  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: Hi everyone -- sorry to disappoint, but Shailagh had something come up, so I'll be filling in today. What's going on?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Southern Maryland: Well, I guess I now have a name for myself -- I'm a &quot;Powell Republican.&quot; The reasons he cited for endorsing Sen. Obama match mine. I simply no longer can associate myself with this party (although Mr. Powell did not go that far -- I'll be changing my status to independent). The party is marginalizing itself. Don't Republican leaders recognize they are alienating many like me -- not an extreme conservative in terms of religion, but conservative in terms of government? After the Bush years with their incredible spending, I have had enough. I can't take talking heads calling some states &quot;pro American&quot; and calling citizens' patriotism into question. Enough. Goodbye.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: Thank you for bringing up this topic -- I think it's one on a lot of people's minds after Powell's very provocative appearance over the weekend. What I found so interesting wasn't as much his endorsement of Obama (which many saw coming) but the criticisms of the party that you point out. That's not something I've heard the conservatives who are attacking him for endorsing Obama because of race address.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Seattle, Wash.: Great to have you, Anne.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sorry to hear Obama needing to leave the campaign to visit his Grandmother in Hawaii. It's the right thing to do, but is he sacrificing one of the Toss-up States to make this trip?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: My understanding is that he was supposed to be visiting Iowa and another midwestern state over the course of Friday and Saturday -- I'm not sure which, and I'm not entirely positive that's right, so don't hold me to it -- but that he will be able to send surrogates instead. He is, however, staying on the road to visit Virginia and Indiana before he goes -- much &quot;redder&quot; states. It looks to me like they're trying to give him a window to visit his grandmother that does not cut too far into their campaigning time, which they consider their most precious asset.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Virginia polling: I've lived in northern Virginia almost my whole life, so it's absolutely stunning to see the polls now putting Virginia in the solidly blue column. Really?! How is this possible? Don't get me wrong, I'm really excited, but I worry that it's misleading and there's some systemic bias or the polls are just missing something. Is it really possible that Obama is that far ahead in my home state?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Virginia: The New Battleground (washingtonpost.com)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: Aha, so you don't live in the real Virginia? (A joke -- a reference to a McCain campaign spokeswoman's assertion last weekend that northern Va. isn't the real part of the state). Look, states can shift over time, and Virginia has been trending more Democratic -- not just this year but in earlier, state elections. I'm not a big fan of labeling states &quot;red&quot; or &quot;blue&quot; because it leaves the impression that they are immutable. That aside, it does look as if Obama has made tremendous inroads there, and his campaign describes it as one of their greatest efforts and goals, one where they've devoted a lot of resources. So my tendency is to say that, yes, it is leaning much more &quot;blue&quot; -- with the caveat that we won't know anything for sure until 14 days from now.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rockville, Md.: While the press has been digging into Palin's records of College, Wasilla, and etc., why haven't they gone after Obama's record in college? Has it been proven he was actually born in Hawaii? I still think he was born in Kenya.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: It has been proven, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Obama was born in Hawaii. He was not born in Kenya. I am going to try to post here a link to fact check.org, which sent a reporter to the Obama campaign headquarters to examine the birth certificate and certify that it is real; he was, I repeat, born in Hawaii.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: Here is a link to the fact.check.org site --- http://www.factcheck.org/election-2008/born_in_the_usa.html. If I am doing this incorrectly, you can also go straight to their site.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: Pennsylvania: Anne: If reports are correct that the McCain camp is giving up on Colorado, Iowa and New Mexico, he now has to win Pennsylvania to have any chance. Why do they think they have a chance there? Most polls show them way behind.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: The McCain campaign disputes that they are giving up in those states, and it appears that McCain will be campaigning in Colorado later in the week. But you are correct -- it would be quite hard for them to bank on Pennsylvania as their salvation, judging from the state polls, which have McCain behind.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anonymous: The polls seem to be all over the place. The Post has Obama up by a comfy 9 points, while others have it only 2, which is a statistical tie. What's the real sense on the part of the campaigns as to where the election now stands?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: I have a better handle on the Obama campaign, but let me give this a shot. On the Obama end, their focus, pretty much relentlessly, is on the state-by-state polls and where that leaves them in the electoral college (the goal being to get to 270 electoral college votes). The McCain campaign is, naturally, focused on the same; we've heard McCain also say that he thinks he is about 6 points behind nationally, even though, as you point out, there are other polls that are more generous to him. If you factor in margin of error, a &quot;comfy&quot; lead can appear less so -- it seems to me both campaigns believe it is at about 5 points nationally. But again, they care much less about than how they are doing in getting to 270.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama WAS born in Hawaii...:... but looks like McCain was born in Panama!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's Canal Zone Birth Prompts Queries About Whether That Rules Him Out ( The New York Times, Feb. 28)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: He was, indeed -- but I think it is pretty well resolved that because that was a US territory, there is no question whether he can legitimately run for/be president. Still, pretty neat that the two nominees are from off the mainland, right?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: FactCheck.org</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Silver Spring, Md.: I was sorry to hear of Sen. Obama's grandmother's illness. But I was confused by the statement about her from his campaign: &quot;Along with his mother and his grandfather, she raised him in Hawaii from the time he was born until the moment he left for college.&quot; I thought his grandparents lived in Kansas, didn't they? And didn't he live there also, as well as in Indonesia for a brief time as a child?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: Actually, Obama's grandparents were from Kansas, but eventually moved to Hawaii, and that's where he was born and raised -- although you are right that for a period of time in the middle there he also lived in Indonesia with his mom, before moving back to be raised by his grandparents in Hawaii.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: Anne, Hillary Clinton has been energetically campaigning for Obama, so she'll probably have a prominent role in an Obama administration. So what do you think has been discussed? I know Obama says she'll have a big role in health care policy, but in what way? Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: The Clinton folks are being exceptionally mum on this point. My sense is that nothing has been decided -- that she is doing her part to get him elected now, and will obviously have a powerful political base of her own going forward, but that we'll have to wait and see what she does with it. In terms of health care, should Sen. Kennedy recover enough to go back to the Senate, he would be the natural leader on it; Clinton would almost certainly play a role, too. But we don't know yet what his health status will be come January.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bethesda, Md.: What effect will early voting have on this election? I voted a week ago. Will there be alot more early voting this year then in past years?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: It sure appears that way. A number of states have early voting in place, which helps on a number of fronts -- more people can get it out of the way earlier, reducing lines on Nov. 4; and activists can be freed to go do their work getting other people to the polls that day. But the count will not actually happen until Nov. 4.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mystified in Minnesota: Please explain how some states can have &quot;early&quot; voting? Is this another way to say &quot;absentee&quot; or is there really a window during which people can vote? Why does this happen?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: It's up to the states -- and yes, it is separate from absentee voting (which in some places requires you to prove that you can't be there on election day and happens by mail). In some places, right now, you can go vote as if it were election day. The idea, largely, is to reduce confusion on Nov. 4, and to give people with odd work schedules a chance to participate in the process, rather than restricting it to people who can make it on that day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Boston, Mass.: Thanks for taking my question. Is it just me, or does Sarah Palin seem to have gone off on her own? I get the feeling that the McCain campaign is not coordinating at all with her and that her goal is to help build her own political future, with no consideration of how she is impacting his campaign.(imho, by next year at this time we will all be saying Sarah who?)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: My colleague John Dickerson over at Slate wrote a nice column last night about the number of ways that Gov. Palin has differed from McCain on various things -- such as dropping out of Michigan -- and what that might mean. To their credit, she did say from the outset that she would disagree with him occaionally (she said in that first Charlie Gibson interview that she was still working on him when it came to drilling in ANWR). But it would not be surprising to discover that Palin -- who is, after all, only 44 -- is also keeping an eye on her own political future. If they were to lose, she would have a strong claim as the leader of the Republican party, having been on the ticket this year, and it wouldn't be shocking to see her run on her own in 2012.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Richmond, Va.: Do you think that this is a hard election to poll because of all the new voters? There seems to be a big number difference in polls betwee registered and likely voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: With the caveat here that I'm no polling expert, I am told that the question of new voters remains a thorny one. At this stage of the game, &quot;likely voters&quot; are the ones that we tend to pay attention to -- and you're right, those polls show a tighter race, generally. But it is not always clear how much they take into account new voters, who tend to be less reliable about actually getting up and voting on election day. It will be interesting to see if what happened in the Iowa caucuses (where Obama motivated a lot of young people to actually caucus, despite predictions they'd flake out as they had for Howard Dean four years earlier) can translate in some way on Nov. 4.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: Based on the signs in my neighborhood, the McCain supporters live on the corners and the Obama supporters live in the middle. Is it the same in your neighborhood?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: How interesting. But do we know which plumbing service each of them uses?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Biden Warns World Will 'Test' Obama, Prompting McCain Response ( The Trail, Oct. 20)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: As you know (or maybe not?) reporters don't get to decide what stories run where. But we did have the story about the &quot;international crisis&quot; comment in the paper, and we'll post the link here.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: Anne, I've been baffled as to McCain's strategy for attacting swing voters, who are usually moderates. It seems for months he's been appealing to the base, especially with the Palin pick. But these folks probably would have voted for him anyway, if not enthusiastically. So my question is, why all the focus on the base?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: This is a great question, and I suspect when all the after-action reports on the campaigns are conducted, this will be one of them. Don't forget -- President Bush had a two-fold strategy in 2004, of appealing to Hispanics and some moderates, but also very heavily turning out his own base. The idea is to drive up your numbers in certain parts of reliable states (think of the map Bush won in 2004) and not worry about the middle. And McCain could win if he just holds onto the Bush states. But the challenge for him is that some of those states (think Iowa) are less conservative than they were four years ago, and may remain, despite the Palin pick, lukewarm about him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: Hi Anne Thanks for doing these chats! With early voting and increased absentee voting, do you think that there will eventually be a national holiday on election day to provide more people with the opportunity to more conveniently vote?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: That's an idea that's been tossed around -- along with having it on a Saturday, so people with demanding jobs and travel issues can make sure to vote.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Albany, N.Y.: If McCain loses, why do you feel that Palin will be the leader of the Republician Party? Being on a ticket that is not successful does not mean you are the leader by default</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: Sorry, I should have been clearer --you are absolutely right, there's nothing that says she would be the leader by default. But she certainly would have a claim to trying to be that -- her huge crowds, her ratings on SNL suggest she has a following -- and if anything, it would be surprising to have her fade away as an afterthought after all the excitement she has generated. But that is different from saying she would assume leadership of the party.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Claverack, N.Y.: A growing complaint among Republicans I'm hearing is that &quot;McCain can't compete because he took public financing.&quot; But my guess is, McCain couldn't possibly have been competitive with Obama if he had forsaken the system, and the money discrepancy would have been even more apparent, generating even more morose headlines for the GOP. Agree?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: Entirely possible -- and entirely impossible to ever know the answer to. One great storyline coming out of this campaign, regardless of who wins, is what the state of the campaign finance system is and should be, because of how lopsided this race has been.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Reston, Va.: Hi, Anne. The opportunity to chat with you will absolutely make my day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Question: Have we ever had a woman secretary of defense? Is that a possible position for Hillary Clinton?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thanks!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: Answer: No, we have not. And what an intriguing idea -- Clinton does sit on the Armed Services Committee, and has made military issues a strong focus of her time in the Senate. I haven't heard her name floated by the Obama folks, but it's early yet. Stay tuned.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Early Voting: If the networks call states based primarily on exit polls and returns, how will early voting affect their ability to call states in a timely matter on November 4th?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: What a great question. I have no idea, and now I'm curious. Let me find out.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.: What Ms. Pfotenhauer is doing is playing on the Northern virginia/Rest of Virginia attitudes that already have been exploited to little effect here. As you can see, I'm from the communist part of the state (according to McCain's brother) and therefore am not part of the Real Virginia, or even the Real America. My family has been here since the 1600s and my great grandfather fought in the Army of Northern Virginia during the Civil War. Is that Real enough for the McCain people? This tactic is divisive and infuriating.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: I have to say, as a native of Virginia myself, I was a little surprised to hear her go that route -- if only because such a large voting population is now in that part of the state, thus making it a politically dicey thing to say. But I hope the folks in her Oakton neighborhood are being kind to her at the grocery store anyway. It's been a long, exhausting campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If McCain loses, why do you feel that Palin will be the leader of the Republician Party?: It didn't work for Jack Kemp or even Dan Quayle, let alone William Miller (who parlayed his obscurity into the first &quot;do you recognize me&quot; TV commercial), so why should it work for Palin?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: And it hasn't worked on the Democratic side, either -- not for Lieberman, or for Edwards. So I have thoroughly debunked my own theory, with your help. Still, I maintain that we will see Gov. Palin as a national political figure again, regardless of the outcome of this election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bethesda, Md.: Reading an article in the Post today I came across a clip from the Constitution describing the requirements to be president. As we all know, you have to older than 35 and born in the U.S. They put in a clause that you have to have lived in the U.S. for 14 years. 14 is a strange number. Do you have any idea how they arrived at that exact number? Were they trying to exclude or include anyone in particular?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: No clue, but I'm going to post it here and see if anyone else does.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucson, Ariz.: Thanks for taking my question. As an Obama supporter, I'm concerned about his security during a rally that attracts 100,000 people. Can secret service really screen that many people?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: I've gotten this question a lot -- and the answer is, I'm no security agent, but I do know how hard they work and how sophisticated their thinking is, and it inspires a lot of confidence. (I am knocking on wood as I type this). The agents are often in a position to both screen the press and protect us, when we're traveling with the candidates, and their professionalism is impressive. There have been some troubling reports lately about agents blocking reporters from talking to crowds -- but that's a different matter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: My sister-in-law and I (both non-obvious minorities)have noticed in our dealings with people from Northern Virginia that when they don't think a minority is present, they'll say racist or intolerant things. Often they use a hushed voice. This observation leads me to believe that whatever Obama is polling in Northern Virgina, the Bradley effect will likely come into play.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I know that by definition predicting the Bradley effect is like trying to hear a tree fall in a forest when no one's not around. However, are there any indications that Northern Virginia will actually be as Democratic as polls say.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: This is a perpetually unanswerable question (at least not until Nov. 4). And it's a good one. I suspect that people's casual intolerance in private company is not operating in the same part of their brains as choosing a president -- that a lot more seriousness goes into the latter, in a time like this -- I certainly heard borderline-sexist things said about Hillary Clinton as a woman when I was covering her from people who intended to vote for her. And the Obama campaign has been adamant in its insistence that they are not worried about the race factor. But we just don't know.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Potomac, Md.: Fantastic move by McCain-Palin to double-down on Pennsylvania. There's no early voting in Pennsylvania, so you only have to gear up for Election Day. Run heavy challenges in Democrat precincts to create long lines and make people go home, as keep-out-the-vote works far more efficiently than get-out-the-vote. Combine with Ayers/Wright ads and leaflet droppings, and you steal a big Kerry state and create breathing room. Smart, smart move.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: And another view...thank you, great observations.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Her ratings on SNL&quot;: Funniest thing you've ever written. You think Palin's base were the ones watching her on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;? I'm guessing it was more likely people like me who hoped to watch her get made a fool of!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: I'm not saying those people will vote for her!! I'm just saying, if it were me, and I drew that large an audience, I would think that I had a legitimate claim to run for higher office again. And I think everyone should not discount her so quickly. I may be proven wrong. But that's my take.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fourteen Years: They were trying to keep anyone who wasn't in the colonies before the start of the Revolution from becoming president. In terms of particular people, maybe Alexander Hamilton?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: Thank you, a really good point.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hoboken, N.J.: Would Palin really stay on as governor of Alaska after this election? I would think doing a Fox News Channel show would propel her into the 2012 primaries far more effectively. It also would give her more time with the babies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: And be warmer. But what of Todd's Iron Dog race?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Monmouth, Ore.: Hello, Ms. Murray. I have read that the McCain camp essentially is conceding the popular vote and going for the electoral vote. If by chance they succeed, what would be the ramifications? Would it finally drive the stake through the Electoral College's heart? Is there any serious move now to get rid of this archaic method of electing a president? Many of us still are fuming about 2000, so if this happened again I fear there would just be wholesale chaos/disgust/maybe worse. Your thoughts? Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: I'll not speak for Ms. Murray (she'll be back doing a chat soon, don't worry!) but instead say that I think both campaigns are -- rightly -- focused on winning the electoral college, because that is, simply, the only way to become president. As we saw in 2000, the popular vote is meaningless. A nice number, and one that might give a president a glowing feeling of, well, popularity, but not the way the rules are constructed. There have been attempts to get rid of the rules (did I read somewhere this week that more bills have been introduced in Congress to get rid of the electoral college than any other topic, over time?) but for now, they stand. So I expect to see both campaigns working hard to get to 270, period.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Austin, Tex.: Early voting started here yesterday. Numbers are apparently huge.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Is is safe to assume that a higher turnout nationwide favors Obama?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: You know what they say about the word &quot;assume.&quot; I'm willing to assume that Obama is doing well in Austin, however. As for the rest of Texas: if Obama is ahead there, McCain has serious problems. But again, we just won't know until they start counting ballots.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Williamsburg, Va.: Since the last two presidential elections have been close, I've forgotten what &quot;non-close&quot; elections are like in the final days. In 1996, did Dole's campaign really claim that they had a path to 270, and was it realistic? If McCain is relying on winning a state where he's now behind by ten or more, that wouldn't be considered realistic. Do you recall 96 (or 88) in the final days?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: If my memory serves, it was pretty bleak for Dole at this point in '96. But it hadn't always been so - it had been much closer earlier on.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: For those of us who like to analyze even the most minor development in this campaign to decide whether we should be excited or nervous about our candidate: What is the impact of Obama heading to Hawaii for 36 hours? It takes him off the trail at a crucial time, but also gains him sympathy. Might the Republicans tone down their rhetoric for that time? If so, will that benefit them with voters who think they've been to negative? On the flip side, what does McCain going on Letterman and Palin going on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; do for them? It makes that seem a bit more human, but will that help them in the polls?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: I think the Hawaii trip is an unknown -- great question. It will be harder for the McCain folks to attack him in a personal way on the campaign trail, I would suspect, but not in robocalls and the like. Also, we don't know what kind of coverage the trip itself will generate. As for the TV appearances, of course, you're completely right, the goal is to humanize them. I'm just not sure that either of them was so aloof or remote that they needed to be humanized at this point. You could argue that Letterman was an attempt just to get Dave to stop bashing McCain so constantly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.: I recall from high school history that the natural-born clause in the requirements for the president was aimed at Alexander Hamilton, who was born in Jamaica. Don't know about the 14 years, however, except that it is longer than similar requirements for senators and congressmen.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: More history! Thank you.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bloomington, Ind.: Hello Anne. I heard that you were pulled from covering Sarah Palin's campaign for some reason. Is that true? If so, why?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: Nope. I cover Obama. I was with Palin for a week, helping out the reporter who does cover her, and had a lovely trip to Alaska. But it is very amusing that there might be rumors of that sort out in Indiana!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: McCain's Strange Moves: I'm certain that the McCain campaign has done polling on how Rev. Wright plays in various parts of the country, and I suspect that reactions out West (Colorado, New Mexico) differ significantly from reactions in the Appalachian region (Ohio, Virginia, and Pennsylvania) and the South (North Carolina and Florida). If that's true, the calculation may be that a racially loaded closing strategy may have a better chance of putting Pennsylvania in play than Colorado, despite what current poll numbers are saying.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: That's another thought; thank you for sharing it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Testing a new President: Not just JFK, but the first World Trade Center bombing occurred less than six weeks after Clinton took office -- reportedly they had another bombing planned if Dole had won and taken office in '97, but scrapped it because he didn't. Then the second World Trade Center bombing occurred less than eight months after Bush 43 took office. Do you think the Republicans want to try to claim this is a good reason to vote for McCain? To me it sounds like capitulating to the terrorists.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: Thank you for a reminder of the history; that's a really good point, and I think it's basically what Biden thought he was saying.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fletcher, N.C.: I spent three hours working at my church yesterday, across from a voting precinct in western North Carolina. From 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., our parking lot averaged about 50 vehicles from the overflow, and the voting line extended out the doors. After standing in line in Alabama on Nov. 2, 2004, for five hours and watching hundreds of people give up, I have to wonder why anyone ever fought early voting. Yes, we appear to have a lot of reasons for an energized electorate this year, but how much do professionals think these extended voting periods increase voter participation? Watching all these people getting out to vote makes me feel a lot better about our future, regardless of which candidate they're choosing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: I am sure someone will crunch the numbers when this is all over and figure out how much of an effect it seemed to have (though I don't know how you could differentiate between increased turnout based on the early voting versus enthusiasm for one candidate or another). But it does seem like a good idea to give people a chance to vote even if they don't have flexible work schedules or easy transportation on the given day of the election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bluffton, S.C.: In previous chats you've complained about Sarah Palin's inaccessability to the press. I understand that -- unlike Joe Biden -- she is now speaking with reporters. Are you still glum?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: I'm not out covering her, but you can see from the footage that she is talking on the plane now, which is really good -- not just for us whiny reporters, though it is, but also for her. She seems a lot more comfortable now that she's been doing it more often, only begging the question of why they kept her under wraps for so long.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">St. Paul, Minn.: There keep being questions about Senator Clinton, or other high-ranking Senators taking places in an Obama administration. History seems to suggest that almost no sitting senators will be appointed to the cabinet, and very few would want those jobs because they then hitch their wagon to someone else who could lose power. I do expect Daschle and maybe Tim Roemer to be in such a cabinet (knock on wood), but I really think the Hillary talk seems silly, don't you?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: Who knows? It's a good point -- and you're definitely right about Daschle's being in the mix -- but we'll just have to wait and see. And the same is true should McCain win...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Toronto, Ontario: It's frightening to see the increasing polarization that some in the GOP seem to want to foster -- you agree with us, or else you are anti-American, you agree with our position or else you are evil and a terrorist. Why is not possible to have a genuine policy disagreement and intelligent debate? Why not rise to the demands of this trying time and attempt to inform, explore and discuss the problems facing the U.S., and come to terms with what damage has been done domestically and globally by the last eight years. Instead, it's all about fear-mongering, lies, and as much as possible, keeping people (who in the U.S. already are deprived of an appreciation of history, global geography etc), even more ignorant?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: And the view from further north...thank you for this.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clifton, Va.: As a still-undecided voter, I am made to feel like an idiot. I may have a preference, but I have not made a decision. Although this delay means I can't vote early, I really don't see the harm in not having decided yet. I plan to see what other news/speeches comes out, as well as reading the platforms on both candidates' Web sites. Am I doing this wrong by being deliberate? Should I be voting more instinctively?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: Who says it's wrong? I know people think that the choice is so stark there's no way to be &quot;undecided&quot; -- but that is probably true for political junkies, not for people who have other things going on in their lives. Good for you for taking it seriously, and good luck figuring it out.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne E. Kornblut: So many good questions today -- thank you all so, so much for taking the time to participate in the chat, as always. You make it worthwhile going out and reporting! I really appreciate it. See you soon.</span></p>
