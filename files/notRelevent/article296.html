  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain are spending nearly $300,000 a day on local television advertising in Virginia, according to an independent analyst, with Obama far outspending McCain as they gear up for the final month of the presidential campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With Democrats and Republicans agreeing that the contest is essentially tied in Virginia, the campaign for the commonwealth's 13 electoral votes is accelerating. The rivals also are blanketing the state with direct mail and other ads. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama, a senator from Illinois, has targeted Virginia relentlessly, believing it will be almost impossible for McCain, a senator from Arizona, to win the White House on Nov. 4 if he loses the historically conservative state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's strategy appears to be paying off, officials in both parties say. On Wednesday, McCain campaign officials announced that they are diverting more resources to Virginia, which last voted for a Democratic presidential nominee in 1964.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We feel good, and we are doubling the size of the field staff and offices in Virginia . . . and that is a reflection of the energy and support we have seen in Virginia,&quot; said Mike DuHaime, McCain's political director.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the closeness of the race in a state President Bush won by 262,000 votes four years ago alarms some Virginia Republicans, who concede that Obama is running a strong campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Several recent polls show varying leads, ranging from a 9-percentage-point Obama advantage to a 3-point McCain edge.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think the seesaw is going to continue, and I just hope we are on top of the seesaw when the election rolls around,&quot; said Del. Jeffrey M. Frederick (Prince William), chairman of the Virginia Republican Party.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama, Democrats say, has built one of the most aggressive campaigns in modern Virginia history and plans to use his organization on Election Day to try to spark a record turnout.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yesterday, with a Navy ship as a backdrop, Obama drew thousands to a rally in Newport News on the banks of the James River, his second large event in Virginia in a week. His running mate, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), was scheduled to make appearances today in Roanoke and Henrico County in suburban Richmond but canceled because of a serious illness in his family.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There are now about 60 Democratic offices open across the state, including Senate candidate Mark R. Warner's. They are staffed by thousands of volunteers and about 200 paid workers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This is absolutely the largest, most comprehensive, most aggressive presidential campaign I have ever seen in Virginia,&quot; Democratic strategist Mo Elleithee said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's efforts in Virginia are apparent on the airwaves.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">From mid-June until last week, Obama spent about $9 million on TV ads in Virginia, compared with McCain's $5 million.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama is now spending about $250,000 a day on local network TV in Virginia, compared with McCain's $30,000, according to Evan Tracey, president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks ad buys.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The TV advertising imbalance is being partially offset by the Republican National Committee, which began a $33,000-a-day media buy in areas of Virginia outside the Washington market, Tracey said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain spent heavily on local network TV in Northern Virginia earlier in the year, but he has pulled advertising from those stations and is bolstering his presence in Hampton Roads.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Obviously, I think they had to make a resource decision,&quot; Tracey said. &quot;He has to make sure he has resources to match Obama at the end of the campaign. . . . But it's a gamble, because Northern Virginia is where races are won and lost.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Trey Walker, McCain's mid-Atlantic regional director, said the decision was strategic and not about resources. The campaign has shifted its Northern Virginia ads to local cable stations to help target specific voter blocs. McCain and Obama also are on the air on national network TV.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We are at parity, saturation-wise in Northern Virginia, with the Obama campaign,&quot; Walker said. &quot;We are using a tactic we need to turn out voters on Election Day. Clearly, when you are doing cable television buys, you can target certain demographics you are unable to do on local&quot; television.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's campaign also is opening a dozen new offices and will be increasing its paid staff in the state to 50, DuHaime said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Although Obama and Biden have appeared jointly or separately in the state almost a dozen times since mid-summer, McCain and his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, have appeared only once, at a rally last month in Fairfax City.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain is instead relying on surrogates and local party committees to drum up enthusiasm for his campaign. Joe McCain, the candidate's brother, headlined a &quot;Veterans for McCain&quot; rally yesterday in Loudoun County.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama surrogates also are blanketing the state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democrats are emboldened by several recent polls. Obama has opened up a 20-point lead in Northern Virginia, according to polls by Washington Post-ABC News, CNN/TIME and Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Research Inc.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the 2005 race for governor and the 2006 Senate campaign, Democrats Timothy M. Kaine and James Webb, respectively, were propelled to victory after they racked up 20-point margins in Northern Virginia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some party officials say Obama is starting to make inroads in rural parts of the state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;For years, it has been socially and culturally unacceptable for white working-class males to vote for a Democrat, and I am hearing a lot of them say, 'I'm voting for Obama,' and that shows me there is some movement,&quot; said Democratic strategist Dave &quot;Mudcat&quot; Saunders, who specializes in targeting rural voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But Dick Leggitt, a GOP strategist and senior adviser to Republican Senate candidate James S. Gilmore III, said the McCain campaign is working hard to turn out the party base through phone calls, mailings and targeted radio spots. The historical surge for GOP candidates from rural areas and military communities in Hampton Roads will be enough to pull out a victory, he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Still, some Virginia Republicans say McCain and Palin need to start campaigning in the state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I know McCain sleeps here a lot,&quot; said Frederick, referring to McCain's condominium in Arlington County. &quot;We need him to come back and campaign here, because the Republican grass roots are hungry to have him.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Other Virginia Republicans say McCain, who is trailing in national polls, doesn't have the luxury to spend time in a state the GOP has carried for decades.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;McCain advisers feel if he isn't going to win Virginia, he probably isn't going to win the election anyway,&quot; said James E. Hyland, chairman of the Fairfax County Republican Party.</span></p>
