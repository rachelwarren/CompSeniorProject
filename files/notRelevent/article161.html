  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Down to the wire: Who wins your plaudits and damnation among the mainstream media's vast array of talking heads during this political season? Station Break's Paul Farhi was online Tuesday, Oct. 21, at 1 p.m. ET to offer some high- and low-lights.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A transcript follows.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Farhi is a reporter in The Post's Style section, writing about media and popular culture. He's been watching TV and listening to the radio since &quot;The Monkees&quot; were in first run and Adam West was a star. Born in Brooklyn and raised in Los Angeles, Farhi had brief stints in the movie business (as an usher at the Picwood Theater), and in the auto industry (rental car lot guy) before devoting himself full-time to word processing. His car has 15 radio pre-sets and his cable system has 500 channels. He vows to use all of them for good instead of evil. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Greetings, all, and step right up. Since we're coming down to the wire in &quot;the most important election of our lives&quot; (I've heard that said for several elections and not sure what it means, exactly), I thought it might be apropos (or not) to offer a completely subjective list of the winners and losers from the media-entertainment industrial complex during this campaign. So here goes (and feel free to hector the typist):</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Winner: The mainstream media. Yes, I'm a card-carrying member of the dreaded MSM, but I still think my colleagues here and out there have done a very good job of covering this wretchedly long campaign. For all the noise kicked up by bloggers, I can't think of many big stories that we owned and they didn't (shout out, however, to the awesomely named blogger Mayhill Fowler for breaking Obama's &quot;bitter-guns-religion&quot; comments during the primaries).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Loser: Keith Olbermann. KO has successfully turned himself into the anti-O'Reilly and a scathing Bush critic, but what now? If Obama wins--I said &quot;if&quot;--doesn't he lose half his act?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Winner: Rush Limbaugh, Fox News' pundits, conservative talkers. Flip side of the Olbermann Conundrum. These folk always have something to rant about, but a liberal administration and Congress looks to be a big fat pinata. Conservatives seem to do their best work while casting themselves in the role of aggrieved underdog. This time, it might even be true.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Loser: Frank Caliendo. Caliendo, an outstanding impersonator/impressionist, does a great John Madden, but his McCain is still a work in progress and his Barack Obama is still largely unseen.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Winner: Fred Armisen. He's &quot;Saturday Night Live's&quot; go-to Obama guy. Again, assuming the polls are right, he could have a four- to eight-year job guarantee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Loser: Every liberal filmmaker/documentarian (which is just about every filmmaker, period). The Bush Administration was an unending gift to Michael Moore and his ilk. Would Obama be as kind?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Winner: John King's &quot;Magic Wall.&quot; CNN's King has that whole &quot;let-me-show-you-how-women-are-voting-in-Cuyahoga-County&quot; touchscreen thing down. It's a gimmick, sure, but a really gee-whiz gimmick.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Well, enough. Let's go to the phones...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Purcellville, Va.: Hi Paul,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Those of us who aren't old enough to remember the Kennedy/Nixon debate in 1960 have been told that the candidates' physical appearance on TV changed a lot of minds (Kennedy good-looking, Nixon unshaven, etc.). Watching the last debate between Obama and McCain on my big-screen, high-def TV (thankfully, it's paid for), I was struck by McCain's appearance. His eyes were red-rimmed and watery, for example, and in the split-screen format, we could see his satisfied smile after answering a serious question and while Obama was talking. Maybe part of it was the lighting for this particular debate (for his part, Obama looked sallow and angular), but that doesn't explain McCain's seeming lack of self-control when he thought he was off camera. My question is, have you heard anyone else talking about this? Despite the pundits calling the debate a draw immediately afterward or praising McCain's stronger performance, the public polling in the following days gave Obama a clear win. It seems that appearance does still matter, at least with televised debates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Hi, P-Ville (which sounds very much like it could be in &quot;the real Virginia,&quot; as determined by McCain aide Nancy Pfotenhauer on MSNBC the other day, not that commie Northern Virginia)...There's been a fair amount of comment about the split screen differences between the two. On balance, I thought it didn't help McCain (for all the reasons you cite). But Obama didn't come off all that great, either. He kept smiling whenever McCain attacked him (which was often). What's up with that?...But I'm not sure how much that really matters. Reason: Palin looked better than Biden in their debate, yet poll after poll found Biden the winner.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: I thought SNL dropped the ball with the McCain-Obama debate. They should have used the split screen and accentuated McCain's creepy and incessant blinking. Also, it would not have been original, because they did it with Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush, but I would have loved to have seen them show each candidate's &quot;inner thoughts&quot; as the other was speaking. I always remember when they had Poppy imagining Clinton in full hippie regalia shrouded by a cloud of &quot;smoke.&quot; Perhaps Obama thinking about decorating the White House while McCain is speaking and McCain fuming about whether Obama had a pulse.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I thought that entire show was a bit of a disappointment. Maybe my expectations were too high, but they had some great elements to work with: the election, the real Palin, the fake Palin (Fey), two fake George Bush's (Josh Brolin and Jason Sudeikis), plus Alec Baldwin, Oliver Stone and Marky Mark. And outside of the Palin &quot;rap&quot; -- which Palin didn't even do -- there weren't all that many laughs or much satire.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.: How can I find out who plays Rachel, the girl who is in the Sprint Instinct commercial who wants to &quot;have it all&quot; with a phone? Why don't they make this type of information easy to find, like a TV commercial IMDb?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Sprint Instinct Commercial</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Maybe because they're worried about creepy stalker people? (I'm not calling you a CSP, Arlington, I'm just sayin'...). My advice, however: Track down Sprint's ad agency; they might tell you.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Falls Church, Va.: Lou Dobbs calls himself &quot;Mr. Independent,&quot; but a more a propos title would be &quot;Mr. Windbag.&quot; I'm amazed he can get guests on his show, since he rarely lets any guest actually answer the questions asked, but interrupts them to pontificate his own opinion. He is far from independent. He leans very far to the right of independence.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: You know who I feel sorry for? The reporters and journalists who have to deliver the Dobbsian slant on their stories. Poor Kitty Pilgrim (what a great name!): She has to play the straight woman to Grumpy Lou...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Detroit, Mich.: Paul: what's up with all these ads on the radio? There are too many of them. Please tell all of your radio friends that there are too many ads, and they need to play some more songs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Agree. As I've said before, I can't imagine that those 5, 6 7-minute &quot;pods&quot; or clusters of ads work. Does anyone sit through one of those relentless assaults? I know I'm hitting the buttons as soon as I hear the &quot;we have to take a break, stick with us&quot; message.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">One thing that I think works on WTOP, by the way, is how they drop in the ads around the news, weather, traffic. A minute here, a minute there. It works much better. And as I understand it, WTOP is the top revenue station, by far, in the Washington area.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lake Ridge, Va.: Further proof that the broadcast radio business is in the dumps, both Don Geronimo and the Greaseman have listed their $1.5 million McMansions for sale.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: A shame to lose the likes of 'em both. I suspect we won't see their kind again.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fairfax City, Va.: Paul: we just got back from being out of the country for a few months, and we missed the end of &quot;For Better or For Worse.&quot; Is it true that the entire extended family died in a horrific plane crash in the Northwest, and that the only character who survived is the old dog?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I dunno, because I've always put &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot; in the same lame category as &quot;Family Circle&quot; and &quot;Cathy.&quot; To me, FBOFW makes &quot;Beetle Baily&quot; seem hip n' happenin'...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cleveland, Ohio: Paul: what if Queen Latifah had married Steven King and taken his last name? She would have been Queen King. Names are funny sometimes, aren't they?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Some red-carpet TV interviewer once actually asked Queen Latifah if her date was her husband, King Latifah....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Greater Green Bay: Actually, Limbaugh should get a Loser tag; he bought the New York Post story that Michelle Obama was living it up at the Waldorf when, in actuality, she never stayed there (today's N.Y. Post Page 6 makes the correction). Limbaugh and other nut job talkers made much of this and it's fun to see it go bad on them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Yeah, but he can always blame the stinkin' MSM for steering him wrong. So he's covered. Kind of.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pittsburgh, Pa.: Hi Paul, I think the talking heads of comedy will shine through no matter who wins. They have upped their games in the last two years, regardless of the target. They aren't dependent on a left or right-leaning viewpoint -- just a point of view on the day's events and absurdities, which are sure to continue no matter who's in charge. And it looks like a couple of conservative pundits may now have new work on the left!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Staying neutral is almost always the best career move. I thought Dennis Miller's post-9/11 transformation into a &quot;conservative&quot; comic was a disaster. Message to entertainers: No one really cares about your politics. They care about your entertaining-ness.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rockville, Md.: There's this dumb new &quot;show&quot; on NBC that isn't funny and isn't clever called &quot;Kath and Kim,&quot; and Molly Shannon, who in real life is 44 years old, plays the mother of a character played by Selma Blair --- who in real life is 36 years old. Although the two women are attractive, Molly Shannon looks like a woman in her early 40s, and Selma Blair looks like a woman in her mid 30s. That's just reality. In no way do they look like a mother and daughter -- in fact, they look like suburban next-door neighbors. Just how stupid have the producers and executives at NBC become? They all need to be fired -- and so does this show.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I'll caveat this next comment by saying I haven't seen &quot;Kath and Kim&quot; yet. But: 1) the promos for it were consistently hilarious; and 2) the age difference makes no difference if the characters/situations are funny and convincing...My favorite in this regard is &quot;The Graduate.&quot; Dustin Hoffman was, I think, 28 at the time, playing a 22-year-old. Anne Bancroft was, I think, 36 at the time, playing, well, an older woman who seduces the 22-year-old Hoffman. And tell me that that situation didn't work?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ballston, Va.: It's time for Nicole Richie, Paris Hilton, Jessica Simpson, Pam Anderson, all of the Kadashians, Tara Reid, Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Miley Cyrus to retire. Just retire. So we don't have to hear about them ever again for the next 50 generations.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I'm still trying to figure out what social need coverage of these ladies fulfills. Because there's obviously a very large market for it. Could it be that we just like to see pretty/wealthy/famous-for-being-famous people in some kind of turmoil (rehab, car wrecks, divorce, arrests, etc.) because it makes us feel better about the turmoil in our own lives? Or do we just like pictures and stories about pretty young women, period?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Winner: The mainstream media: I thought you guys were the &quot;liberal elite media.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I liked Tina-as-Sarah's phrasing the other night: &quot;The liberal elite media and the regular liberal media.&quot; Because poorly paid reporters from, I don't know, Idaho or Wyoming probably don't consider themselves very elite...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Potomac Village: Is it true that Citadel is going to buy all of the radio stations from ClearChannel, Bonneville, Liberty, Westwood, Radio One, ABC, CBS, Bloomberg, Hearst, RKO, Dumont and Acme Radio?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Citadel? Isn't its stock worth even less than an Iceland bank?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fairfax Apartments #12-J: Age in movies -- one of the more famous examples is that Angela Lansbury was just three years older than Lawrence Harvey when she played his mother in &quot;The Manchurian Candidate.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Wow. Even better than &quot;The Graduate&quot;! And I gotta say, Angela really did seem like Larry's mom in that movie (I guess Angela, who has been a very talented performer for a very long time, has always played &quot;old,&quot; even when she wasn't')....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Falls Church, Va.: Greaseman's gone again!? I only just rediscovered him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Gone to Jacksonville, Fla., from whence he came back when.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Don Geroni, MO: Before he retired from the air -- didn't Don Geronimo make it pretty clear that he was packing up and moving to the Eastern Shore (Ocean City, Md.) area? So, it doesn't surprise me that his north Virginia home would be for sale.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Right. And between his non-compete contract with CBS, he wasn't coming back to this area for a while, anyway...Don, by the way, seriously considered retiring to the beach in Florida several years (he walked away from buying a place there at the last minute). This was not long before his wife died and everything changed for him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Airless Cubicle: Hey, Paul -- I like hulu.com very much. Why can't CBS and ABC build their video-on-demand sites to have similar functionality? My daughter reclaimed her TV when she moved out and wife and I are using the 'pute until December sales of digital TVs make them affordable in a recession.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Am a fan of the Hulu, too. But CBS just made an announcement about building out their video offerings (and with a chat-function as well, in case you want to type while you watch )...And funny, isn't it? As TVs get bigger and TV pictures get better, we're still watching shows on crappy small screens; only now the screens are computers instead of TV sets.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Falls Church, Va.: On the Dick Van Dyke Show, he was actually about 35 and Mary Tyler Moore was about 20.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Well, close but not quite. Says here DVD is 82 and MTM is 71.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Say hey to your mother for me...: I thought the Marky Mark bit was funny.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I thought it was a movie promo wrapped in a tortured one-note joke that went on far too long.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Blinking equals Lying: Detectives and psychologists use excessive blinking as a way to determine whether or not a person is lying. McCain was blinking so hard in the last debate I thought his eyeballs were going to roll out onto the floor! LOL!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Maybe he just had something in his eyes. Or maybe it has something to do with age. Or maybe you're right. Or not.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Keystone Stater: Sarah Palin dichotomizes our country into pro-American and anti-American parts. Minnesota's Michele Bachmann blames Chris Matthews for putting words in her mouth after she replied to him that Obama &quot;absolutely&quot; has anti-American views (when all she needed to have said was &quot;No he doesn't, but I think...&quot;).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Do you think these statements are more effective in rallying the Republicans' extreme-right base to turn out the vote in their favor, or in mobilizing Democrats and undecideds to vote against them? Are there data on how effective polarizing statements have been in past elections?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I'll leave the political analysis to others....Well, okay, I won't: Between Nancy Pfotenhauer's &quot;real Virginia&quot; comment and John-bro Joe McCain's public joke that he was once stationed in the &quot;commie&quot; part of Virginia (i.e., Arlington and Alexandria), this can't be great for the Republicans in NoVa. And NoVA is the most important (vote-wise) part of the state. Whoever wins there is going to win Virginia, real or imagined.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">CBS online: Just found the 90210 'classic' episodes on CBS.com. So, so, so much better than the new show. I watched Brenda and Dylan's first break-up on Sunday and it was just as moving as it was in 1992. Thank you CBS!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: The internet provides...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Purcellville, Va., again: Paul, you may be right about my town being inside Pffuffin- whatever's &quot;real Virginia,&quot; but I'm very excited about seeing Obama tomorrow in nearby Leesburg!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here's another question for you: What hot new TV shows are you recording but not watching? For me, it's &quot;Fringe,&quot; which is filling up my DVR and I am debating deleting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I've watched &quot;Fringe.&quot; I would delete it. I liked &quot;Chocolate News&quot; on ComCentral, but I will caveat that by saying I've only seen one episode. It was very good, but comedy (particularly sketch comedy) is far more uneven and inconsistent than regular old series TV.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And outside of the Palin &quot;rap&quot; -- which Palin didn't even do: Stupid question warning:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Was she supposed to do it? I thought the joke and the script had her say that she decided not to do it so Pohler (&quot;unexpectedly&quot;) jumped in. Was Palin really supposed to do the rap and didn't do it at the last moment? Was her bowing out ad libbed? I didn't think so but your comment above and several on TV made me think I was wrong.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I have no insight on this, but my reading was this: She couldn't do it, partly as a political matter and partly as a performance matter. If you've never rapped before (and I'm assuming there aren't all that many open-mic nights in Wasilla), it's pretty easy to mess up. I'm thinking she avoided looking silly, on several levels.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mom-daughter age difference: On the 1950s TV series &quot;Meet Millie,&quot; the mom of the title character (Elena Verdugo) was played by Flo Halop (decades later a bailiff on &quot;Night Court&quot;). Flo was only two years older than Elena.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Okay, how about Vivian Vance and William Frawley on &quot;I Love Lucy.&quot; Vance was barely two years older than Lucille Ball, and came to resent being &quot;married&quot; to Frawley, who was 21 years older than her. She thought it made her seem older than she was.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rachel Maddow: Can I just say as a conservative leaning Republican (I say leaning because I'm voting for Obama, the days of voting for neocons are over for me) that I love her show? It's absolutely excellent, and yeah she's a liberal, but she isn't so in an obnoxious way like Olbermann is, and on the right O'Reilly is. You can tell she's very smart (even before finding out about her Ph.D. from Oxford) and she actually lets people with other opinions on her show. I love seeing her and Pat Buchanan have it out, though in a surprisingly respectful and light-hearted way.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I am attracted to her intelligence/smarts, too. But the whole thing about letting people give their opinions? Yeah, that's PBS or NPR. She'll never last on regular cable.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For Better or for Worse: I stopped reading it a long time ago so I don't know what happened. But that comic strip had a huge following. People got crazy over it. When one of the characters came out of the closet, there was an uproar; some people canceled their newspaper subscriptions. I mean, just stop reading the stupid strip if it upsets you.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Understood. People are very, very devoted to their favorite strip(s). As you probably already know, we delete strips at our peril. Readers go nuts, nuts, nuts when we yank their fave. Always have.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Was she supposed to do it? : I don't think so. I think that was how they got her to agree to do the show. She was able to come on without doing anything too embarrassing. And her comments with Lorne were like &quot;I don't think one of my press conferences would have gone like that.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">All scripted.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Right. There was a heavy flavor of lawyering and pre-show vetting to her appearance. I can totally understand it. This is an absolutely critical time for both campaigns. No one is going on a show like that without knowing exactly what's in store...On the other hand, Letterman's interview with John McCain last week was one of the tougher I've seen.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the whole thing about letting people give their opinions? Yeah, that's PBS or NPR. She'll never last on regular cable. : You may be wrong, the Post's evil competitor in New York had a story today saying that Maddow is kicking Larry &quot;Middle of the Road&quot; King's butt on some nights.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Point noted. And, of course, King has lasted forever on CNN without much opinion mongering (although I hear he really, really likes Sinatra)...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Vance was barely two years older than Lucille Ball, and came to resent being &quot;married&quot; to Frawley, who was 21 years older than her. She thought it made her seem older than she was. : Okay, so don't take the part then.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I guess her attitude must have evolved over time, as the show became enormously popular. But you're right -- it made Vivian Vance's career. Can you name anything else she was in?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mother-son age difference:&quot;Alexander&quot; -- Angelina Jolie was Colin Farrell's mother. 1 year age difference.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Wow. Unless we go into negative-differential territory, that's surely gonna be our winner. Stay on the line and we'll get you a big, big prize....</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Did we say it was going? Lynn Johnston announced recently that she was gonna re-write her originals....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">People are very, very devoted to their favorite strip(s). : We sure are. I have avoided you snobbish, effete, latte-sipping elitists ever since you dropped &quot;Andy Capp.&quot; Why couldn't you people appreciate Andy for the bourgeois satire that it was? No, all you guys heard was the 'limey accent...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I grew up reading Andy Capp. I never really got it, but I like the accents.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I live in Farifax: and everyone I know out here is voting for Obama, including my parents who until the last couple of years would never have voted for a Democrat. I always thought of Fairfax County as conservative, but have we crossed over into being anti-American?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Welcome to the, um, un-American part of America, Fairfax. Which, according to the polls, is now about 51-5 percent of the country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Age difference: Estelle Getty was a year younger than Bea Arthur, though she played Bea's mom on The Golden Girls.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: No! Lemme check that...YES! Estelle: Born July 1923. Bea: Born May 1922.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Houston, we have achieved negative differential! (Please withdraw the big, big prize from the Jolie-Farrell contributor and award it by Estelle-Bea, please...)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Blinking: You know what else causes blinking? Being in front of bright lights, say like when you're doing something that's being filmed for TV.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: But didn't Obama have the same lights to stare into as McCain? And Obama didn't blink nearly half as much....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Age difference: Sally Field playing Tom Hanks' girlfriend in &quot;Stand Up&quot; and then his mother in Forrest Gump. Eww.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Now that's a separate category -- the funky dual role. And, yes, that one really does mess with one's head! Maybe Sally didn't age too good (actually, on the face of the evidence, she's aged perfectly well)....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Laurel, Md.: Jeff Greenfield in &quot;The Real Campaign&quot; points out that in 1960 there would have been profound demographic differences between people who watched the presidential debate on TV (and thought Kennedy won) and listened on radio (and thought Nixon won). The TV and radio audience would likely have skewed for Kennedy and Nixon, respectively, anyway.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Right -- that's one of the pieces of conventional wisdom about the 1960 debate. But, um, not a whole lot of relevance here. Do many people listen to the debates on radio anymore? A few, sure, but it hardly gets factored in, like it did in '60.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ethel Mertz: I must admit that blonde and gray don't look much different in black and white.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Interesting point. Frawley sure seemed like a geezer on that show, but perhaps the age difference was muted by the B&amp;W (plus Vance was a little more rotund than Lucy, which possibly accentuated the perceived age difference between 'em).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Age Difference: Glenn Close played Robin William's mom in &quot;The World According to Garp&quot;.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: But have we achieved the vaunted neg-age diff? Let's go to the Google machine:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Close: Born March 1947,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Williams: Born July 1951 (some sources say 1952).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Survey says...No.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Can you name anything else (Vivian Vance) was in? : Although &quot;Lucy&quot; in its various incarnations made Vance's career, according to IMDb she also appeared in, inter alia, Blake Edwards' &quot;The Great Race,&quot; and episodes of &quot;Love, American Style,&quot; &quot;Rhoda,&quot; and guested 5 times on Red Skelton's show.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Yeah. But you had to check IMDb. Try that unassisted. Couldn't be done.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cedar Rapids, Iowa: FBOFW: The strip ended with a capping off telling what happened to the characters in the rest of their lives. Ms. Johnston has gone back to the beginning redoing the strip. The local paper here in Cedar Rapids has stopped running the strip and I have quit following it since it has run its course.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bring back Calvin and Hobbes!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Right, but I bet hard-core fans are eating up the re-do. To each his/her/their own.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Taneytown, Md.: I live in a blue state, but in a red county. Am I un-American, or just a commie sympathizer? It gets so confusing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I can't wait until November 5...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Sure. And what if you were gay in a red county in a red state? Or Muslim in Utah? Or pro-choice anywhere? Or...oh, Lord, my head is spinning....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">State College, Pa.: Paul, I can't believe you name the MSM as a winner. Once again, most of the attention is on the horse race aspect of the election, not an examination of the issues and policies. Even more disappointing is the utter and complete lack of attention given to the Libertarian, Green, Constitutional and other so-called third-party candidates. None of them were even invited to be part of the &quot;debates.&quot; The media should cover these other candidates with similar gusto as the Big Two, and insist that they be part of the process.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I did a profile of Ralph Nader earlier this year, and he certainly made those points. It is true that by keeping everyone but the &quot;major&quot; party candidates out of the debates, you're reinforcing the idea that there are only two major parties. But that's not the media's doing; the private debate commission makes/made those calls. And there's actually a fair amount of media coverage of the other party candidates. Not nearly as much as Obama and McCain, of course (not even close), but that stuff is out there.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.: Crispin Glover (April 20, 1064) played the father of Michael J. Fox (June 9, 1961) in Back to the Future.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Judges?....[Sound of buzzer}. Oh, sorry. Too late. The valuable prizes have already been awarded. But we have some lovely parting gifts....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________ </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Folks, once again, you've validated my faith in the wonders of the crowd. I'm pretty sure there's nowhere else in America today, or the world, dammit, where a group of people got together and discussed the important matters that we considered here today. And we should be happy for that (someone has to actually work). So, we should leave it there for the moment. But we can try again next time. What say a week from now, hmmm? I'll pencil you in...In the meantime, have a great week. And as always, regards to all...Paul.</span></p>
