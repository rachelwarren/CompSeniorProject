  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At a rally here with Michelle Obama the other day, little slips of paper were tucked into the windshields of cars in the parking lot. They announced a free breakfast, paid for by local Democrats, on behalf of Senator Barack Obama on Saturday, the last day of early voting. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The fliers were a small reminder of something big: the Obama organization in this state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> North Carolina has not seen a real presidential race for a generation. But in one of the biggest surprises of this long campaign season, Mr. Obama has pulled even in the polls with Senator John McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama has more than twice as many offices, more than twice as many paid staff members and thousands more unpaid volunteers. He has outspent Mr. McCain more than eight to one on television advertising, although Mr. McCain has increased his spending in recent weeks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Both campaigns have stepped up their face time here, with Mr. McCain's running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, appearing Saturday and Mr. Obama expected to be back on Monday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A record number of people have voted early; twice as many were Democrats as Republicans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''My people didn't always have the right to vote,'' said Joseph Scott, 40, who works in banking, as he stood in line in Greensboro for more than an hour to vote for Mr. Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Blacks like Mr. Scott make up about 21 percent of registered voters, and the degree to which they turn out for Mr. Obama will be a critical piece of the puzzle.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But Mr. McCain's selection of Ms. Palin has inspired cultural conservatives. Her rallies are energetic; she had the country stars Gretchen Wilson in Asheville belting out ''I'm a Redneck Woman'' and Hank Williams Jr. in Elon singing his own ''McCain-Palin Tradition.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Through rallies, commercials and automated calls, the McCain campaign casts Mr. Obama as a radical.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''He's a socialist,'' Bob Hartsock, 78, who works in real estate in Concord, said after a McCain rally there.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Working to Mr. Obama's advantage is an influx of new voters -- potentially more moderate -- and the mounting economic crisis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Ruby Hill-Benjamin, 53, a registered nurse, was one of hundreds of people in an overflow room here shrieking for Mrs. Obama. She said she had voted for President Bush because she liked his faith initiative. But Mr. McCain is ''running on the past,'' she said, and she is inspired by the Obamas: ''They are speaking for all Americans.''</span></p>
