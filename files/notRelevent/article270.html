  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> GRAPPLING WITH FINANCIAL TURMOIL,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> European Union Remains at Odds</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As the financial crisis radiates around the globe, some of the 27 nations that make up the European Union have broken ranks, opting for self-interested policies to protect their own citizens and banks first. Although finance ministers agreed to take a few steps to shore up markets, they did little to dispel growing doubts that the European Union could grapple collectively with a common problem.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> U.N. FAULTS BIOFUEL SUBSIDIES</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The United Nations food agency called for a review of biofuel subsides and policies, noting that they had contributed significantly to rising food prices and hunger in poor countries. With policies and subsidies to encourage biofuel production in place in much of the developed world, farmers often find it more profitable to plant crops for fuel than food. PAGE A13 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> TURTLE FAILS TO PRODUCE OFFSPRING</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A complicated attempt by scientists in southern China to save a species, the Yangtze giant soft-shell turtle, by mating two elderly turtles ended without producing any offspring. Xie Yan, the China program director for the Wildlife Conservation Society, said she remained hopeful, despite the setback this year. PAGE A13 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> U.S. TO KEEP TROOPS IN KOSOVO</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that the United States would maintain its troop presence in Kosovo until at least late next year and would also continue to provide the country with military equipment and training. Mr. Gates's visit to Kosovo was the first by a United States cabinet member since the country declared independence in February in defiance of Serbia and Russia. PAGE A12 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PUTIN STARS IN MARTIAL ARTS VIDEO</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Just weeks after Russia's state-run media reported that Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin had saved a news crew from a wild tiger, he is flexing his muscles in an instructional martial arts video. The video is part of a growing media library highlighting Mr. Putin's masculinity that includes episodes of the former K.G.B. agent bare-chested on a fishing expedition and in flight in a fighter jet.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CASE IN ALBANIA SPURS SPECULATION</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The investigation into the suspicious death of a whistle-blower in Albania appears to be nearing its conclusion, but with little hope of quelling the doubts surrounding the case. The man, Kosta Trebicka, uncovered evidence of public corruption in the export of ammunition from the Communist era, which led to arrests and charges. He was found dead last month and the inquiry into his death has been anything but routine. PAGE A11 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In California Before Vote</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Since the California Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in May, there has been a rush of gay couples marrying. In the three months ended Sept. 17, California had more same-sex marriages than Massachusetts had in four years. Some say the surge in marriage license applications came in part because of the looming vote on Proposition 8, which would amend the state constitution to outlaw same-sex marriage. PAGE A14</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> QUESTIONING A PROSECUTION WITNESS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In the trial of Senator Ted Stevens, his defense lawyer characterized Bill Allen, the prosecution's chief witness and a longtime friend of the senator, as someone who betrayed a friend to protect his fortune. Under questioning by the defense lawyer, Mr. Allen acknowledged that ''an explicit part of the contract'' to sell Veco, the oil service company he owned, ''was to cooperate with the government'' because the buyers were concerned about whether a corruption investigation he was involved in could damage the company. PAGE A15</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> TWO CASES ON POLICE PROCEDURE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Supreme Court heard two cases involving the Fourth Amendment. In one case, a man's arrest came as a result of false information from the computer files of the police in a neighboring county. In the other, cocaine was found in a man's car after he was arrested and locked in the back of a police squad car. The central question in both cases is the same: does the rule that requires the suppression of some evidence produced by police misconduct still make sense? PAGE A15</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> NEW WARNINGS ON COUGH MEDICINE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Companies that make pediatric cough and cold medicines said they would voluntarily change their products' labels to say that they should not be given to children younger than four and that products with certain antihistamines would have added language warning parents not to use them to sedate a child or make a child feel sleepy. The Food and Drug Administration said it supported the label changes and would continue assessing the safety and effectiveness of the products in children of all ages. PAGE A14</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> COPING WITH A FAMILY'S SLAYING</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> News of a murder-suicide in Los Angeles that ended with six relatives dead spread through the tight-knit Indian-American community in which they lived. The police said that the reported killer, Karthick Rajaram, confessed in two letters, one addressed to the police and one to two friends. ''I can't tell you how I feel,'' a family friend said. ''You have to open my heart and see the feeling.'' PAGE A15</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ICELAND ASKS RUSSIA FOR AID</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As Its Economy Stumbles</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Iceland's banks, once robust, are suddenly wobbly, and the government, facing what it called ''national bankruptcy,'' took extraordinary measures by taking control of the country's second-largest bank -- its second takeover in two weeks. The government also announced that it had asked Russia for a loan of 4 billion euros, about $5.5 billion, to keep its economy afloat. PAGE B1 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A.I.G.'S SPENDING HABITS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> On a second day of Congressional hearings in Washington, lawmakers were informed of the spending habits at the American International Group. Only a week after the insurance giant received an $85 billion federal bailout, one of its subsidiaries held a retreat for its top sales agents at an exclusive beach resort where expenses totaled $442,000 for one week.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> FORMER UBS EXECUTIVE SETTLES</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> David Aufhauser, above, the former general counsel at UBS's investment bank, reached a $6.5 million settlement with the New York attorney general on accusations of insider trading in auction-rate securities. Andrew Cuomo, New York's attorney general, said his office was expanding its investigation into financial derivatives beyond auction-rate securities. PAGE B6 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PFIZER ACCUSED OF SPINNING DATA</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Experts who reviewed thousands of documents from Pfizer said the drug maker manipulated the way scientific studies were published to help sales of Neurontin, its epilepsy drug, to treat other disorders. PAGE B4</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> TREMORS ON WALL STREET</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Leave Harlem Shaken</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Harlem's recent resurgence was driven in part by the banks and Wall Street firms that gave business loans as well as loans for large commercial developments. The collapse of some of those financial institutions means that Harlem's growth will become much more difficult -- and also that the neighborhood will lose millions of dollars in charitable contributions from those companies. PAGE A21 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CRANE COMPANY ACCUSED OF BRIBES</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In indictments unsealed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, prosecutors said that New York City's chief crane inspector conspired for more than a decade with a Long Island-based crane company to ensure that its cranes were certified without receiving valid inspections and that its crane operators had an easy time acquiring licenses. The indictments followed two crane collapses. PAGE A22 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> TINA BROWN, EDITOR OF NOTE, </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Newly Perched on the Web</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A new Web site had its debut this week, thedailybeast.com. But with more than 180 million of the things now online by some estimates, a new one would seem like just another digital drop in an ocean of zeroes and ones. Unless it's Tina Brown doing the dropping. Promising rigorous editing of the culture for complicated times, the Beast is aiming to be a smaller, less chaotic version of the World Wide Web itself, David Carr writes. PAGE C1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> GUNS 'N' POSES: THUGS IN LONDON</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Guy Ritchie reshuffles a worn-out deck in ''RocknRolla,'' a return to the shady stylings that characterized his earlier flicks, ''Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' and ''Snatch.'' There are the usual villains, double-crosses, right hooks, ha-ha scenes of grim torture and the requisite femme fatale. But there isn't much to chew on or mull over. The violence has no passion, no oomph, no sense of real or even feigned purpose, Manohla Dargis writes. PAGE C1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> NEW TAKES ON OLD THEMES</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''The Wrestler,'' which closes the New York Film Festival, was directed by Darren Aronofsky and stars Michael O'Rourke whose simple and cartoonish character might be described as the Rocky Balboa of professional wrestling. But unlike the ''Rocky'' films, ''The Wrestler'' is largely free of pandering sentimentality and phony optimism, and acknowledges that bodies get old and break down despite the most rigorous training, Stephen Holden writes.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> To Save an Ailing Town</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The tiny town of Hardwick, Vt., (pop. 3,000) used to be such a den of vice that it went by the name Little Chicago, and its Main Street was dotted with vacant stores. Internet pioneers, artisans and agricultural entrepreneurs are trying to find investors and betting that farming can save their hardscrabble hamlet. PAGE D1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A LOOPHOLE IN LABELING LAWS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A law has gone into effect that requires retailers to label the country of origin of certain food products. The aim is to allow consumers to avoid products from countries like China, where food safety has been a problem. But critics point to a loophole and a lack of resources for enforcement that they say may make the mandate ineffective. PAGE D3</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But Still Coaching</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Joe Paterno, 81, the longtime football coach at Penn State, has long faced questions about when he may retire. They have gotten louder as he has been hampered by a leg injury and has spent more time coaching games from the press box. But Paterno plays down the significance of being on the sidelines. ''Actually, as far as making a significant contribution on the strategy side and on the tactical side, you're better off upstairs,'' he said. PAGE B20</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PLAYERS TACKLE CHILDHOOD OBESITY</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The N.F.L., with all its beefy linemen on the far side of 300 pounds, would seem an unlikely standard-bearer in the fight against childhood obesity. But experts say athletes present powerful body image role models, particularly for boys. And so players have rebuilt parks and conducted football clinics in support of Play 60, an effort to encourage children to be active for at least an hour a day. Page B22 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> AFTER STORM, TULANE BOUNCES BACK</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Tulane University's athletic department almost did not survive after the campus and its sports facilities were ravaged by Hurricane Katrina. But the disaster galvanized the student body, and its community was unified around the teams. ''I think in a lot of ways, Katrina might have helped because it told people New Orleans is worth caring about,'' said the president of the university's booster club. PAGE B20 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> WINNING WITH A YOUNG FOUNDATION</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> If the Red Sox beat the Tampa Bay Rays to advance to the World Series and win their second championship in two years, it will be in large measure because of some shrewd moves by the team's front office as well and the performance of some of its young, home-grown players. ''They prepared us for what the Red Sox are and what the Red Sox want to be,'' said Dustin Pedroia, the team's young second baseman. ''It's winning.'' PAGE B19 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CHARLES WRIGHT, 76</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> His three books describe a loner's life on the fringes of New York society, and his protagonists are stand-ins for himself, working at low-level jobs, living in low-rent apartments, hanging out with low-life personalities. ''The Messenger'' was the best received of the three, possibly because it was less specifically about being black than about being an outsider. PAGE B16</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Wall Street's crisis is walloping state finances across the country. State government debt is about the safest debt on the market. Still, over the last few weeks, states have been shut out of the credit markets like everybody else. PAGE A30 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In 1982, Congress asked the Army Corps of Engineers to study the feasibility of pumping water from the Great Lakes to arid parts of the Midwest. That terrible idea went nowhere, but ever since, the states that border the lakes have lived in fear that somebody would steal or buy their water. Those worries are over. PAGE A30 </span></p>
