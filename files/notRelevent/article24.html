  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WALLINGFORD, Pa. --The men and women who stood for hours in the Strath Haven High School gym here Sunday said they view John McCain's election as critical, though they remain unsure he will emerge victorious Tuesday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We're cautiously optimistic, but we're also realistic. We know we have a big hill to climb,&quot; said Marie Furey, 67, a retired Philadelphia schoolteacher. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Furey said she is backing McCain because &quot;I'm a Republican, have been for many years,&quot; while her two children, who are in their mid-30s, are backing Barack Obama in part, she said, because they're worried about McCain running mate Sarah Palin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think there are some issues, beyond her energy,&quot; she said, choosing her words carefully. &quot;Others perceive her to be -- not experienced. It's a small concern for me. It's a large concern for my children.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But Jeff Bater, 55, who works on real estate development for a Middle Eastern private equity group, said he sees Palin as &quot;a breath of fresh air&quot; and is encouraged by the recent tightening in the polls in states such as Pennsylvania.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I hope he pulls it out because the election is going to affect us for the next 10 to 15 years, easily,&quot; Bater said, adding that he thinks McCain has the experience to handle the international and domestic crises now faced by the United States. &quot;It even affects my guys in Kuwait. Even though they're sitting on piles of oil, what happens here affects everybody.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's wife, Cindy, spoke to those concerns when she introduced her husband, unveiling a new pitch for the GOP standard-bearer. &quot;He's not a man for all times, but he's definitely a man for these times,&quot; she said, sparking a massive round of cheers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">One member of the audience even had a new moniker for McCain's rival, rather than the &quot;Marxist&quot; and &quot;socialist&quot; labels that have cropped up in rallies. When the senator from Arizona started criticizing Obama for not having faced international challenges in the past, the man shouted, &quot;Obama's a marshmallow!&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> -- Juliet Eilperin <br /><br /></span><span class="c7"> EXPLOITING GOP FISSURES </span><br /><br /><span class="c7">Obama&nbsp;Ad Stars Cheney and Palin </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A day after Vice President Cheney spoke in support of the Republican presidential ticket, Barack Obama's campaign sought Sunday to capitalize on divisions within the GOP, producing a television ad that ties the McCain-Palin ticket to the deeply unpopular vice president while associating the Democrat with Colin Powell, the respected former secretary of state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad also seeks to capitalize on growing doubts about the Republican vice presidential candidate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Delighted,&quot; which the Obama campaign says will air starting Monday on national cable TV, once again emphasized Obama's long-standing position that a John McCain administration would represent a continuation of Bush administration economic and national security policies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Barack Obama. Endorsed by Warren Buffett and Colin Powell. And John McCain's latest endorsement?&quot; the announcer in the spot says, as the ad cuts to video of the vice president at a GOP event in Wyoming.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cheney is seen saying: &quot;I'm delighted to support John McCain and . . . I'm pleased that he's chosen a running mate with executive talent, toughness and common sense, our next vice president, Sarah Palin.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The announcer's conclusion: &quot;And that's not the change we need.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This is the second time in a week that she has starred in an Obama-Biden ad -- a sign the campaign is not only no longer afraid of a backlash for attacking her but now sees her as a wedge to use against McCain.</span></p>
