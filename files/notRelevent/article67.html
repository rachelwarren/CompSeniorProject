  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Florida, Florida, Florida. If the state's 25 electoral votes were the bane of Democrats' existence in 2000, they have emerged as a target of opportunity for Senator Barack Obama in 2008. He ended his day at a rally in Kissimmee with President Bill Clinton -- their first joint event. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Senator John McCain campaigned in Florida, too, and unleashed a new attack on Mr. Obama -- and The Los Angeles Times. Mr. McCain denounced the newspaper's decision not to release a video of Mr. Obama at an event with a former leader of the P.L.O. The Times said it had promised the source of the video that it would not be released.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama spoke to television viewers in a 30-minute commercial and taped ''The Daily Show.'' Mr. McCain hoped to get a word in by appearing on ''Larry King Live.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Takeaway: It was a pedal-to-the-metal day for both tickets. The McCain-Palin team tried to beat up Mr. Obama with multiple lines of attack. But Mr. Obama revealed deep resources: Millions of dollars for television time, and a popular former president on his arm. (Mr. McCain would prefer that George W. Bush stay in bed for the next five days.)</span></p>
