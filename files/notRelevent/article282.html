  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: Hey everyone. I'm filling in for the great Mike Abramowitz, who is on the trail with Sen McCain today. I am heading to Nashville later today for the debate, which I assume you all want to talk about. So let's get started.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">La Vale, Md.: Good morning, and thanks for chatting. The McCain campaign has shifted its theme to &quot;Obama is risky&quot; or &quot;who is this Obama and his associates&quot;? (After trying &quot;Obama is inexperienced&quot; &quot;Obama is a liberal&quot; and &quot;Obama will raise your taxes.&quot;) Isn't it a bit late to be trying a new theme, especially in the face of the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression? Or does the McCain campaign think this is their only, slim chance to win at this point?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: It is late, and some Republicans I talk to worry about the very thing that you mention -- McCain's lack of consistency in his message. I would add that he also tried at times to focus on himself, rather than Obama. In the early days, the campaign talked all about McCain's biography. They don't do that so much anymore.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I do agree that the strategy they are now on carries risks, especially of a backlash from people who desperately want a discussion of how to improve their economic fortunes. But don't underestimate the importance of character in a presidential campaign. Unlike any other (senate, congress, legislator) a presidential campaign is about whether people like their candidate. If McCain can make Obama unlikeable to the swing voter, he could win.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: We're hosting some friends for the debate tonight. What kind of drinks should we have on hand?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: Hmmm. If you were at a college dorm, I could suggest some games that involve taking a drink every time you hear Obama say &quot;change&quot; or McCain say &quot;reform.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Northville, N.Y. : Please, please, please, can we permanently retire the phrase &quot;presidential debate&quot; until we start having real debates? These are joint press conferences, with only minor differences, and -- to the extent that there is any real debating -- debating skills are as irrelevant as they are in a beauty contest. It's more like a joint job interview, except that there is no requirement that the questions of the interviewer be answered. A whole generation of children is being mindlessly misinformed as to what a debate is.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: I largely agree. There's not much -- if any -- true debating going on at these things. Tonight may be a bit more interesting because of the town hall format, but in fact the candidates are barred from talking to each other. Hard to call that a debate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On the other hand, who are we to fight against the momentum of semantics. I suspect they will be still called debates long after you and I are gone.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Mr. Shear, can you please tell us a bit about the format of tonight's debate? How are the audience members (i.e., the questioners) selected? How can we at home know that the audience isn't secretly stacked with supporters of one or other candidate? Also, does anyone pre-screen the questions, or can a questioner ask any old thing he/she wants? Thank you.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: My understanding is that the questions from the audience are submitted in advance to Tom Brokaw, who selects the ones he wants asked. He then calls on the people in the audience, who are not allowed to switch questions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The audience is made up of &quot;uncommitted&quot; voters and is gathered together by the Gallup polling organization in much the same way they put together focus groups -- to reflect the nation as much as possible.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gaithersburg, Md.: Mr. Shear, is there any solid information available at this point on whether the increasingly negative tone of the campaigns (Dana Milbank's article in this morning's Post is a pointed example) has resonance with undecided and/or independent voters? Do these attacks serve to shore up the support and enthusiasm of the base, or can they also persuade voters? What has been your experience covering and studying other campaigns? Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: I have covered campaigns where negativity worked and ones where it didn't. Here's a couple of examples, though I caution that I'm not sure how it's playing out this time.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In 2005, I covered the governor's race in Virginia, where the Republican candidate ran ads accusing the Democratic candidate of not even being willing to support the death penalty for Adolph Hitler. It is widely believed that those ads backfired. After the Democrat (Tim Kaine) won, voter attitudes suggested that many felt the Republican (Jerry Kilgore) had been far more negative.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On the other hand, the Senate race between George Allen and Jim Webb was probably the nastiest, least issue-based I've ever covered. In that case, the negativity was mostly aimed at Allen, though not directly from Webb. Allen suffered from the constant negative stories, and ultimately lost.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sad Irony: Doesn't it seem ironic that prior to the Vice-Presidential debate Sen. Biden was cautioned not to bully Gov. Palin or address her too aggressively, and now we read (via Milbank) that she is at least overtly encouraging crowds to react in an ugly, even threatening manner, toward Barack Obama?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Unleashed, Palin Makes a Pit Bull Look Tame (Post, Oct. 7)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: Gov. Palin has definitely taken on the traditional role of the pit-bull, attacking with relish. The caution for Biden before their debate had more to do with the concern that attacks on her could be perceived as sexist and arrogant and bullying. I think that would be less of a concern today, given her aggressive posture. But there's still a different dynamic for a male-female debate in this country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Good morning. I have read virtually nothing about the Georgia Senate race, and yet many of the polls I've seen have been razor-thin -- one out yesterday shows Sen. Chambliss (R) ahead by only one point. Is this race a serious pick-up possibility for Democrats, especially given Obama's registration efforts there and the likely increase in African American turnout that have just managed to fly under the radar? Or is it bad polling? Thanks!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: I'm anything but an expert on Senate races. But here's what my colleague Chris Cillizza, aka. the Fix, said about this in his blog the other day:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If you extend the playing field slightly further (and some Democrats do) then you add Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss, Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts and Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe to that longshot yet possible list. (We're not there yet although the DSCC released a poll this week that showed Chambliss in a dog fight and state Sen. Andrew Rice in Oklahoma is running a credible race with some nice looking ads.)&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: I just heard about a new national poll that showed a majority of Americans favor the Democratic candidate to address concerns about the economny. Knowing the policy implications of having a Democrat in the White House (e.g. higher taxes, support for unions that put inflationary pressure on wages, increased government spending that could impact the federal budget deficit, etc.), I'm wondering why many concluded that a Democrat would be better for the economy. Did this recent poll, or another poll, delve into the reasons in more detail?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: This is a very interesting question. I just talked to our polling department. The polls suggest that Americans believe that Obama has more empathy for their financial situation tham McCain does. And by a large margin, voters blame President Bush and the Republicans in Congress for the current economic situation. And so it's not surprising that, given that, the edge on the economy would go to Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obviously, though, for people who are already predisposed to disagree with Obama on taxes, unions, spending, they would be less likely to be among the majorities who say they believe Obama would be better for the economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Boulder, Colo.: Why does the media continue to give Sarah Palin an outlet for broadcasting her views when she refuses to engage with reporters? If she's not going to hold press conferences why not just ignore her?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: Are you a reporter in training, Boulder?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While I believe more access to Ms. Palin (and all of the candidates) would be a good thing for Democracy and our country, it is up to the campaigns to decide how much they want their candidates to submit to questions from myself and my colleagues.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Regardless, one can't ignore her. She's holding rallies with thousands of people. It's part of the campaign. All we can do is point out to people in our stories that what they are getting from Palin is the canned, pre-packaged speeches and not the more spontaneous answers that would come from a true question-and-answer session.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roseland, N.J.: Regardless of who wins the presidency, isn't this post-election transition going to be vastly different than any we've seen before?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: I don't think vastly different. It's a process that we've seen in Washington before.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It will, however, be a large-scale transformation of Washington either way. If Obama wins, there will be a massive shift of people as the Bush conservatives move out and a new kind of Democratic administration moves in.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If McCain wins, I would expect a similarly large change. Some of the broader Bush appointees would no doubt stay in a McCain administration, but he is clearly a different kind of Republican and so I would expect lots of people to go, and quickly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Brooklyn, N.Y.: Is Bob Dole doing any campaigning for his wife Liddy? Is the Senate race there going to run in tandem with the presidential race -- i.e., either Sen. Dole and Sen. McCain win North Carolina, or it's a Democratic sweep?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: From what I gather from my colleagues, Elizabeth Dole appears to have a tough slog ahead of her either way.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Claverack, N.Y.: I understand, on its face, that the McCain camp feels they must go negative in tonight's town hall. But are they thinking this through? I mean, if they get really personal, they've already handed Obama the perfect retort: &quot;Hard to believe that just a week ago, the senator thought we needed to do more town halls together because they would elevate the level of debate. I guess the format doesn't matter when you're so out of touch you can only win by throwing mud.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: That's true! One of the main things that Sen. McCain used to say about his proposal for 10 town halls was that it would have elevated the debate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thanks for reminding me. I'm gonna go dig up those quotes to be able to use them tonight.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rolla, Mo.: What exactly can Brokaw, the networks or the commission do to someone who switches questions on them? They're not signing a contract, are they? I guess they can cut off their mike, but boy, that wouldn't go over well.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: That's true. I'm not sure what they are going to do. I suppose they could tell someone that if they switch questions they will be asked to leave. But you're right, that wouldnt go over well either.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I'll endeavor to find out how they intend to enforce this.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Austin, Texas: Does McCain have enough time left to define Obama? And is Obama enough of a blank slate at this point for him to do so? Seems to me that if McCain intended to go hard negative, he should have done so much earlier, just as people were starting to tune in -- say, around the convention.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: This is hard to know. If you go negative too early, when nobody is listening or watching, you are wasting your money. On the other hand, as you suggest, it takes some time for this stuff to sink in.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As an example, the original &quot;Swift Boat&quot; ads came out in August, giving the accusations in the ad time to seep into the public consciousness. Because John Kerry didn't react aggressively, they really took hold.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: I've been reading the Post's political coverage everyday -- thanks to everyone for interesting and good work. After the election and post-election coverage, will some reporters be reassigned to other areas? If so, are reporters looking forward to that?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear:28 days, 9 hours, 19 minutes, 48 seconds left.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Not that I'm counting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Hey, Michael! Thanks for chatting today. The standard story on Palin is that she won't meet with the press, but how many times have any of the people on the tickets (McCain, Obama, Biden) had open question-and-answer sessions with the press? I can't remember the last time Obama met with reporters to answer questions. Am I off-base here, or is he about as accessible as the current president? Thanks!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: If I recall correctly, Sen. Obama did answer questions a week or so ago, during the financial crisis. He held a press conference to announce his &quot;principles&quot; and then took questions. He has not been overly accessible, but has done similar press conferences about once a week or more. He also has done interviews with national TV anchors.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain, of course, used to be the most accessible candidate, holding hours and hours of question-and-answer sessions on the back of his bus. That's how he got the &quot;straight talk express&quot; label. But that is all over. No national reporters traveling with him have had an oppotunity to ask him questions on the road in months.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain has given select interviews to national network anchors. And he regularly submits to interviews with local television personalities.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Biden, I believe, has done dozens of interviews. I'm not sure how many press conferences he's had.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: The democrats are going to remain in control of Congress. Do you have any sense of whether the McCain camp has a strategy in place to deal with Congress if they happen to win with a barage of negative ads? How could he possibly govern in that kind of atmosphere?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: I haven't talked to them about this. Most campaign people don't like to talk much about what happens after they win, figuring that's bad luck.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But I would guess that the relations between the parties are going to be tense no matter what happpened. If McCain wins, the Democrats are going to be seething and it won't matter how he wins, nasty or not.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If that happens, Americans will truly have chosen divided government.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Michael, I feel like you kind of gave the submitter from Washington asking about Obama's support and the economy a free pass. The person was making assumptions that don't really fly with this election -- especially given that under Bush, the federal government's role has expanded to a huge degree. Our federal deficit is at its highest point in years. Just because a president is a Republican doesn't mean that he or she won't increase the deficit.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: That's certainly true, Washington. President Bush has certainly presided over one of the largest -- if not the largest -- increase in the federal deficit in history. That was probably true even before the bailout.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I was not intending to give anyone a pass.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Springfield. Va/: How come there's no picture of you with this discussion? Rumor has it you look like that PC guy in the Mac commercials.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: This is cruel.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This person clearly knows that I am a Mac person, whose commitment to reporting the news using Apple products is unquestioned.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">To accuse me of looking like the PC guys is an affront on so many levels.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fairfax, Va.: Word has it that you're the No. 1 gadget guy on the campaign trail. How has that affected your reporting this year?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: The following is sent from my iPhone:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This seems like a good place to stop. I've enjoyed chatting. Everyone tune in for the debate tonight, and then head over to our website, where I will be helping with the Instant Fact Checking throughout the evening.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tomorrow, I'll head out with McCain to Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Talk to you from the road (with all my gadgets!)</span></p>
