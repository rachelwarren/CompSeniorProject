  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> IF NORTH KOREA'S LEADER IS ILL,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Question Is Succession</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Intelligence reports that Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, suffered a stroke raise questions about succession that the North's neighbors have long feared asking. Mr. Kim took over after his father, Kim Il-sung, the founder of North Korea, died of heart failure in 1994. Long before that, he had been groomed as a successor. But none of his three known sons nor his daughter has emerged as an obvious candidate to take the dynasty into a third generation. PAGE A6</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PAKISTANI LEADER CRITICIZES U.S.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The chief of the Pakistani army said his forces would not tolerate United States missions into Pakistan to fight Taliban and Qaeda militants and would defend the country's sovereignty ''at all costs.'' The statement by the chief amounted to a direct rebuff to the United States by the Pakistanis, who are regarded by the Bush administration as an ally in the campaign on terrorism.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A LOOK INSIDE BIN LADEN'S JIHAD</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A large cache of audiocassette tapes left behind at Osama bin Laden's headquarters in Kandahar, Afghanistan, provide a more spontaneous look at al Qaeda than is usually available through the carefully choreographed messages it releases to the world, said Flagg Miller, a University of California, Davis, professor who spent five years translating the cassettes. Among the revelations: being on jihad can be boring. PAGE A14</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> EFFORT TO HELP CHAD ENDS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When the World Bank agreed in 2000 to help finance a $4.2 billion pipeline to tap the undeveloped oil wealth of Chad, the government of Chad agreed to channel most of its royalties into fighting poverty. That experiment expired quietly this week. Chad repaid the $65.7 million it owed the World Bank out of national coffers swollen by oil revenues, but it had not honored part of its bargain, the bank said. PAGE A12</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> IRAQ SEEKS FIGHTER JETS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Iraq's defense minister said that his country was seeking to buy F-16 fighter jets from the United States, which he said would be a crucial step if Iraqi forces were to assume more responsibilities from American soldiers. His American counterpart, Robert M. Gates, said he believed the Iraq war had entered the ''endgame.'' PAGE A6</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A COLD WAR MYSTERY</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It was a cold war legend: a Bulgarian dissident writer who had defected to the West and become a journalist and critic of Communist rule died in a London hospital of a mysterious fever after being injected with a poison pellet from a specially adapted umbrella. Now, 30 years later, new mystery swirls around the death. PAGE A10</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Delay Fence Along Border</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Cost overruns, legal obstacles and other problems were imperiling the completion of the 670 miles of fencing and technological improvements on the Southwest border that President Bush has promoted as vital to securing it, the Department of Homeland Security said.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PREPARING FOR HURRICANE IKE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Thousands of people fled coastal areas of Texas after Hurricane Ike spun off Cuba, roared into the Gulf of Mexico and headed toward the state with growing strength. The storm pummeled Haiti, Cuba and other parts of the Caribbean, then refueled in the Gulf of Mexico. It headed toward a landfall Saturday as a Category 4 hurricane betweenCorpus Christiand Galveston. PAGE A21</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CALLS TO EASE CUBA EMBARGO</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> With Cuba in trouble, ravaged by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, Miami is again debating its relationship with the island. Even as supporters of the 47-year-old trade embargo maintain that there are already enough programs providing aid, groups have begun to demand that the policy's restrictions on family travel and remittances be lifted for 60 to 90 days so Cuban-Americans can do more for their relatives.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CLEANING UP A NUCLEAR MESS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Last month B Reactor, the world's first major nuclear reactor and the source of plutonium for the bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki in World War II, was designated a national historic landmark. Although the federal government no longer produces plutonium at the B Reactor -- at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Richland, Wash., -- it expects to spend the foreseeable future cleaning up after it, very carefully.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> MCCAIN UNVEILS NEW OBAMA ADS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Escalating its efforts to portray Senator Barack Obama as a candidate whose values fall outside the mainstream, the campaign of Senator John McCain unveiled a new television advertisement asserting that Mr. Obama, the Democratic nominee, favors ''comprehensive sex education'' for kindergarten students. The accusation, however, seriously distorts the record. PAGE A22</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> DEBATE REVIVED ON KNEE SURGERY</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A study has found that surgery is no better than more conservative treatment to relieve knee pain caused by arthritis. The results of the study are in line with those from a study published in 2002. But experts are divided about what effects the two studies will have. PAGE A19</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Still Lingers After 9/11</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Marissa Gonzalez had designed her whole fourth-floor apartment in Brooklyn around the outline of the Lower Manhattan skyline. A few months after Sept. 11, 2001, she moved out. And though it may seem trivial compared with the pain of those who lost loved ones, friends or colleagues in the terrorist attacks, the way New Yorkers have reached accommodation -- or not -- with the transformed view provides yet another window into the city's long recovery process.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> LEARNING BY DOING</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Some 500 engineering students at Columbia University will earn academic credit this year participating in projects around Harlem: designing swings for people in wheelchairs, creating a trash can that can be used by the severely disabled and others. Such service learning has been a graduation requirement for all of Columbia's engineering majors for six years, and other academic departments are considering integrating it into the curriculum.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As Armstrong Plans Return</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As Lance Armstrong prepares to announce his return to professional cycling, a somewhat arcane scientific debate has rekindled questions about his past and whether his cycling success came in part through doping. The matter involves an error in an expert's long-term study of Armstrong's muscle efficiency -- and whether that error is significant, or incidental. PAGE D2 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> AFTER 18 YEARS, RIVALRY RENEWED</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Penn State and Syracuse began their football rivalry with a 0-0 tie in 1922 at the Polo Grounds. More than a few of their 68 games ended with some sort of controversy. And then they ended altogether; the teams have not played each other since 1990 -- and they even dispute the reason for that. But No. 17 Penn State (2-0) and Syracuse (0-2) will revive their history Saturday in the Carrier Dome, then return to State College, Pa., next fall. PAGE D6 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A TOP PROSPECT KEPT OFF THE FIELD</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Pedro Alvarez, the son of a New York City livery cab driver, was picked second over all by the Pittsburgh Pirates in Major League Baseball's draft in June after three standout seasons playing third base for Vanderbilt. But his professional career is tied up in a dispute about precisely when he made his deal with the Pirates and whether baseball rules were broken. PAGE D5 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> OBITUARIES</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> RICHARD MONETTE, 64</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A Canadian actor and director, he became the artistic director of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival and led it into the most robust artistic and financial period in its history. Mr. Monette was known for unabashedly audience-pleasing productions that were sometimes dismissed by critics who derided him as a populist. PAGE C12 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> REPORT ACCUSES BANKS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Of Tax Evasion Schemes</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A number of Wall Street investment banks are selling complex schemes intended to allow foreign investors to illegally avoid paying billions of dollars in dividend taxes, according to a Senate subcommittee report that singles out Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch, UBS and Citigroup. Complex equity swaps, fake loans and sham stock sales help to disguise dividend payments to clients, the report said. PAGE C5</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CHINA JOINS REAL ESTATE DECLINE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> China has joined at least one capitalist list it would not want to: nations suffering a real estate decline. Real estate brokers say prices are down drastically and volumes are up, a downturn that comes as Chinese exports have slowed and stock markets have plummeted. The confluence of events has triggered what economists describe as a deceleration in China's economic growth, although at nearly 10 percent it remains the envy of many countries. PAGE C1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> UNEASY LIES THE LEHMAN HEAD</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Richard S. Fuld started at Lehman Brothers in 1969 as an intern, rose through the ranks, stayed when the firm was sold in distress in the 1980s and oversaw its spinoff in the 1990s. He is the longest-serving Wall Street chief but also the one investors are most closely tying to the problems in the mortgage markets. ''I think it's possible he could be pushed out any day now,'' one analyst said. PAGE C1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> TANKER DECISION DELAYED</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Saying that the competition had become too ''highly charged,'' the defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, said the Pentagon was postponing a decision on a $35 billion contract to replace the Air Force's aging tanker fleet until the next administration. Mr. Gates said that the seven-year acquisition process had become ''enormously complex and emotional,'' blaming ''mistakes and missteps along the way'' by the Pentagon. PAGE C3</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> INVESTORS TURN ON THRIFT</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Investors drove down shares in Washington Mutual, the nation's largest thrift, by 30 percent on fears that, like Lehman Brothers, it is running out of time and options to find a buyer or raise capital to repair it from a hard hit by the downturn in the housing market. PAGE C1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CARDS REPLACE LINES OF CREDIT</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Banks have become more reluctant to extend traditional lines of credit to small businesses, but they have been offering ''small business'' credit cards. One fundamental difference is that lines of credit have low, fixed interest rates or slow-moving, variable ones, while interest rates on credit cards can jump unpredictably. Too unpredictably, some small-business owners say. PAGE C6</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Internet Persona I Never Did</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Of all the things expected of precocious children, typing is not usually one. Or at least not while in infancy. So parents help them start, managing their pages on sites like totspot.com, billed as Facebook for children. It makes whipping out pictures in an old wallet look even more low-tech than ever.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> GOLD, SILVER OR BRONZE? NO, IRON</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Ironman competition, the premiere triathlon in the country, has seen a 40 percent rise in entry costs. But unlike gas or rent, this has not done anything to dampen participation. While anybody can stage a race, it takes a licensing fee to host an Ironman event, complete with the logo's trademark M-dot, proving again that exclusivity is a popular commodity all its own.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A moment in time, between muscle twitches and synaptic response, a photograph of a dancer can often not help being picturesque. In ''Capri's Camera on Dance,'' Frank Capri captures 29 of these moments but shows the flashy, fancy moves of dance and often neglects their more subtle, distinctive counterparts, Alastair Macauley writes. The focus seems to be, unfortunately, on the sensational. Page B5 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Through Unnatural Effort</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Once it matures, a perennial meadow in bloom -- as opposed to, say, a large expanse of lawn -- presents nature at its most alluring. But don't think that producing one is as simple as sprinkling a bunch of wildflower seeds. There are rules to be aware of, and maybe the most important is just to be patient. PAGE D1 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> LIFE IN THE ROUND</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The architects Branimir Medic and Pero Puljiz believe that the modern house must bring the family more intensely together -- because modern life makes those times less frequent than before. They see features of traditional homes -- multiple floors, separate rooms -- as no longer conducive to family life. They favor round -- think of living inside a doughnut surrounding a courtyard.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mississippi's governor and secretary of state have come up with an appalling dirty trick for the November election. They have decided to hide a hard-fought race for the United States Senate at the bottom of the ballot, where they clearly are hoping some voters will overlook it. PAGE A26</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> IN SEARCH OF GOVERNOR PALIN</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It is past time for Sarah Palin, Republican running mate, Alaska governor and self-proclaimed reformer, to fill in for the voting public the gaping blanks about her record and qualifications to be vice president. The best way would be by doing exactly what the McCain campaign is avoiding -- holding an honest news conference. PAGE A26</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Daniel Mudd and Richard Syron, the ousted chiefs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, could collect as much as $24 million in exit pay unless a federal regulator says no. Neither should be rewarded any more than they already have been for their failures. PAGE A26</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> QUESTIONS OF SECURITY</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Op-Ed articles to commemorate 9/11, Philip Bobbitt, a law professor and former member of the National Security Council, and John C. Danforth, a former Republican senator from Missouri, lay out essential foreign policy questions for the candidates; Clark Kent Ervin, the former inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security, asks whether the United States is prepared for another attack; and Edward Ruscha, an artist, shares his thoughts about an old photograph of Lower Manhattan.
