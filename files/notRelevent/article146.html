  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My fellow Americans:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let me make clear at the outset that I have no wardrobe allowance.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I have never shopped at Neiman-Marcus. I once bought an expensive shirt at Nordstrom's, but that was an emergency because I was out of town and on the plane my daughter had attacked, with a crayon, the only dress shirt I had.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But I believe people who shop at Neiman-Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and Barney's are as patriotic as those who get their duds at Wal-Mart.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I question the political wisdom of those who think it's a good idea to spend $150,000 on clothing, wardrobe and makeup for a vice-presidential nominee of any gender. But I question even more the judgment of those who divide the country into &quot;pro-American&quot; and &quot;anti-American&quot; camps. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's really depressing. Having covered campaigns for decades, I have a high tolerance for candidates ripping each other apart. I have a lower tolerance for the attacks on patriotism. And some of them are starting to backfire.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sarah Palin expressed regret on Tuesday for having praised &quot;these wonderful little pockets of what I call the real America, being here with all of you hard-working, very patriotic, very pro-America areas of this great nation.&quot; The governor told CNN: &quot;I certainly don't want that interpreted as one area being more patriotic or more American than another. If that is the way it has come across, I apologize.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann said of Obama, &quot;I'm very concerned that he may have anti-American views,&quot; and also told Chris Matthews that the media should investigate which members of Congress harbor anti-American views. North Carolina Rep. Robin Hayes said, &quot;Liberals hate real Americans that work and achieve and believe in God.&quot; Hate them? Bachmann later said she had been misinterpreted and Hayes denied making the comment.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liberal bloggers are up in arms, starting with Joe Klein:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Anyone who talks about the 'pro-American' parts of the country is making an anti-American statement.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Anyone who talks about the 'real' parts of Virginia doesn't understand that all of Virginia is real--just not the reality as fantasized by the sort of people who see some parts of the country as more 'pro-American' than others.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Anyone who describes one part of the country as 'most patriotic' has lost all sense of what patriotism means. (And any congressman who describes his own constituents as 'rednecks' and 'racists' probably doesn't have much of a future in politics, no matter how much pork he hauls home. I'm talking about you, John Murtha.)&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Salon's Glenn Greenwald deconstructs the charges and subsequent apologies and evasions:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;There's clearly something interesting -- and different -- happening here. It's not that right-wing politicians are accusing liberals and Democrats of being unpatriotic, anti-American subversives. There's nothing new about that. To the contrary, that McCarthyite accusation has virtually been a central plank -- one could say the defining plank -- in the GOP platform for the last three decades, at least.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;What's different -- markedly so -- is that once they do it, they feel compelled to backtrack, deny they said it or meant it, rescind it, and -- in the case of Palin -- actually 'apologize' for it . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Apologies in general are viewed as marks of weakness on the Right and are extremely rare; but in particular, the idea that any of them would apologize for insulting liberals or impugning their patriotism is simply unfathomable. Yet in a period of one week, that's what all three of these right-wing candidates have done -- quite abjectly. . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Why are those tactics suddenly not working? If anything, one could have expected that equating Democrats with anti-American, vaguely foreign, radical subversion would have been more potent this year than any other -- given that the Democratic presidential nominee is a previously unknown, black politician from Chicago with a mixed African and Arab name, a portion of his childhood in Indonesia, and substantial parts of even his immediate family still in Kenya to this day. But that line of attack has gotten Republicans nowhere -- other than sinking further into the mud of defeat.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kos says the press has enabled this sort of thing, until now:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Remember, Republicans have been able to score cheap points for a long time by playing to the media's sense of 'fairness'. Hence, the 'he said, she said' tradition arose. As a reporter, you couldn't write 'the sky is blue' without getting 'the other side' of the story to tell you 'the sky is purple'. Truth and fact are irrelevant.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;And in the old world, blatant lies like this could be easily covered up. A reporter catches you saying something stupid? Who cares! Just lie and deny it. At that point it becomes a 'he said, she said' question, and people will shrug their shoulders unable to independently determine who is right.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Enter YouTube. Both Hayes and Bachmann can blatantly lie and it doesn't matter because we have the video and we can see for ourselves what was actually said.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now Bachmann is saying that Matthews trapped her and that she'd never seen &quot;Hardball.&quot; Huh?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Okay, here's the trick question:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">MATTHEWS: Do you believe that...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(CROSSTALK)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">MATTHEWS: ... that Barack Obama may have anti-American views?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">BACHMANN: Absolutely. I'm very concerned that he may have anti- American views.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I mean, how underhanded is that?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Earlier, Bachmann wouldn't comment to the St. Paul Pioneer Press, but the paper ran an op-ed by her anyway. And Minnesota reporter Eric Black writes about his past difficulties in getting the congresswoman to return calls on remarks she later claimed had been misconstrued.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">All right, let us turn our attention to Palin's own version of &quot;spread the wealth&quot;--spending the dollars of Republican donors on her high-end clothing. Clearly, this is not an issue on which the fate of the republic rests. But it hardly fits her image, does it?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Politico scoop does give the MSM the chance to run cheeky headlines, such as the NYT's &quot;May Alter Tailor-Made Image&quot;:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin's wardrobe joined the ranks of symbolic political excess on Wednesday, alongside John McCain's multiple houses and John Edwards's $400 haircut, as Republicans expressed fear that weeks of tailoring Ms. Palin as an average 'hockey mom' would fray amid revelations that the Republican Party outfitted her with expensive clothing from high-end stores.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Or the LAT with &quot;Sarah Palin's $150,000 Wardrobe Malfunction&quot;:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin, small-town hockey mom and everywoman? More like Sarah Palin, pampered princess.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Or Slate's &quot;Sarah Shops Saks&quot;: &quot;It explodes the idea that she's a middle-class woman of the people . . . The first is that the price tag is just too high, too many teacher and nurse and firefighter salaries. The second is that all this money spent on clothes, etc., points out exactly how much Palin is trading on her sexuality, her winks, her look,&quot; writes Emily Bazelon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It can't help that, as the WP reports, &quot;American Idol&quot; make-up artist Tifanie White got $8,672 last month for beautifying McCain, while Amy Strozzi, head make-up artist on &quot;So You Think You Can Dance,&quot; was paid $13,200 for her work on Palin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">GOP types who went bonkers over Bill Clinton's Christophe haircut and John Edwards's $400 haircut can hardly cry foul.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Well, maybe they can, according to Marc Ambinder:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;There is already an attempt to blame the media -- as in, the liberal media would have looked askance at Palin if she wasn't clad in Neiman Marcus, but this won't wash. Republicans, RNC donors and at least one RNC staff member have e-mailed me tonight to share their utter (and not-for-attribution) disgust at the expenditures. This sort of spending is without precedent -- the closest approximation for any campaign I've ever covered is make-up expenses for television interviews and commercial shoots -- , and Schmitt's weakly defensive response tonight indicates that the campaign is deeply embarrassed by it and has nothing to say in their defense.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liberal blogger Taylor Marsh sounds doggone sympathetic--almost:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We beauty pageant veterans know all about the importance of style, don't we, Sarah? A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;As a woman who loves nice clothes, I don't begrudge anyone a fancy outfit, especially if you're running for vice president. I'd just prefer the woman wearing the Neiman Marcus markup or the Saks Fifth Avenue suit bother to strap a few g's on to her words and leave the betcha by golly malarkey in the dressing room along with her war paint.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Yglesias:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Now that I think about it, there was a story about John Edwards getting an expensive haircut that's like a rounding error compared to Palin's September hair and makeup expenses. The total bill is well over double the median household income in the United States.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ann Althouse:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;There is an uneven burden on men and women. A male candidate can wear whatever business suits and shirts and ties he's had in his wardrobe for years. It's hard to go wrong. But the woman will be scrutinized, and there are so many pitfalls. Especially when she is suddenly elevated to the national stage -- like Sarah Palin -- a woman need major fashion assistance.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And we're talking major.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Red State's Josh Painter changes the subject to . . . Barack:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Now the Obamunist media is upset over the shopping spree the RNC sent the Palin family on soon after John McCain named Alaska's governor as his running mate. The talking heads among them won't dare mention that their own fancy threads are freebies, btw.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Not me, btw!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;My search engine was unable to find a price tag for Sen. Obama's Hartmarx suits and Michelle's Maria Pinto dresses for their DNC convention appearances. Suits similar to the ones made for BHO go for $1,500 off the rack, but these were custom-made threads, not off the rack fare. Custom-tailored suits can easily ring up at $5,000 each or more. The Burberry suits that make up the bulk of Obama's wardrobe start at about $900 per . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If the RNC had not invested heavily in clothing for the Palin clan to stand in front of the TV cameras and crowds, the elitist media would have decried the Palins for looking like the Clampetts. They would have sniffed, 'Somebody buy them some nice clothes!' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The polls have been looking pretty good for Obama, prompting these observations from Roger Simon:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The Democrats are poised on the brink of victory. And they cannot stand it. The news is too good. Something has to go wrong. On Saturday, Charlie Cook, an independent analyst and author of the Cook Report, wrote: 'This election isn't over, but it is looking very bad for Republicans -- and seems to be getting worse.' This plunged the Democrats into a deep gloom. Good news is always bad news for them . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;In October, he has outspent McCain 4-to-1 in advertising.' Awful news. Obama has a money problem. And you know what it is? He might run out of time to spend all the money he has! Election Day might come and go before Obama can spend the $5 million a day he is now raising. (If this does happen, I suggest he borrow a page from Oprah and buy everyone in America a Pontiac. Just as a gesture.) Obama himself has reacted to the dismal drumbeat of good news. At a fundraising concert in Manhattan last Thursday featuring Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel, Obama got up and said: 'Don't underestimate the capacity of Democrats to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Don't underestimate our ability to screw it up.'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Which is the prevailing mood in the top echelons of the Democratic Party right now. The McCain campaign cannot possibly be as hapless as it looks, party leaders feel. It is lulling the Democrats into complacency. The Republicans have to have an October surprise, because the Republicans always have an October surprise . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;For the robocalls to be effective, the Republicans would need Bill Ayers to plant bombs today and not when Barack Obama was 8 years old. They need Ayers to plant bombs in key states right now with stickers on them that say: 'I am Barack Obama, and I endorse this bomb.' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Are Joe Biden's gaffes getting the coverage they deserve? That was a doozy the other day, when Biden said his young running mate, a la JFK, would be tested by an international crisis within six months of taking office. As Palin told CNN: &quot;Why does Joe Biden get a pass on such a thing? Can you imagine if I would have said such a thing? . . . If I would have said that, you guys would have clobbered me.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The newspapers didn't exactly play up the Biden blunder, and that set off Michelle Malkin:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Hysterical Sarah Palin-bashers on the unhinged Left and Elitist right have dominated campaign press coverage and pop culture. They've ridiculed her family, her appearance, and her speech patterns. They've derided her character, her parenting skills, her readiness, and her intellect. Meanwhile, the increasingly erratic, super-gaffetastic Joe Biden gets a pass. What does the guy have to do to earn the relentless scrutiny and merciless mockery he deserves? Answer: wear high heels, shoot caribou and change the 'D' next to his name to an 'R.' . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This week, Biden warned America that an Obama victory would invite a dangerous global showdown between tyrants and the naif Obama. 'Mark my words,' Biden said Sunday at a Democratic fundraiser. 'It will not be six months [after the inauguration] before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy.' In a follow-up appearance, he told supporters to brace for the worst and 'gird your loins.' Out of Biden's mouth, this is called candor. Out of anyone else's mouth, it would be 'fear-mongering,' 'negative campaigning' and a 'distraction.' . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Nightly news shows still haven't tired of replaying Palin's infamous interview with Katie Couric. But how many times have they replayed Biden's botched interview with Couric last month -- in which he cluelessly claimed: 'When the stock market crashed, Franklin D. Roosevelt got on the television and didn't just talk about the, you know, the princes of greed.' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Former Newsweek reporter Michael Hastings, writing in GQ, spills the beans on what really goes down between campaign journalists and operatives:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I quickly realized Rudy was a maniac. I had a recurring fantasy in which I took him out during a press conference (it was nonlethal, just something that put him out of commission for a year or so), saving America from the horror of a President Giuliani. If that sounds like I had some trouble being &quot;objective,&quot; I did. Objectivity is a fallacy . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The dance with staffers is a perilous one. You're probably not going to get much, if any, one-on-one time with the candidate, which means your sources of information are the people who work for him. So you pretend to be friendly and nonthreatening, and over time you &quot;build trust,&quot; which everybody involved knows is an illusion. If the time comes, if your editor calls for it, you're supposed to [betray them] . . . and they'll throw you under a bus without much thought, too. (I should say that personal friendships can actually develop, despite the odds.) For the top campaign officials and operatives, seduction and punishment of reporters is an art. Write this fluff piece now; we'll give you something good later. No, don't write it this way, write it that way. We'll give you something good later.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Next up was Mike Huckabee, and Hastings describes &quot;how the press felt about the man. We thought he was a joke, from his views on evolution to gun control to homeschooling. But we cut him some slack because he was entertaining, and he played up being a yokel because he knew it worked with us . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;There was no small amount of hypocrisy when it came to journalists discussing the sex lives of the people they cover, since fidelity wasn't exactly a prized virtue among reporters on the campaign trail. For my part, I watched a lot of porn.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He was with Hillary when her campaign began to sink:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I wanted out. I wanted Obama to win enough delegates to end this thing. But Hillary didn't lose, and even though the math was clear for everyone to understand, she kept on going. So I kept e-mailing and phoning and cornering her staff, trying to find out what was happening, what she was thinking. But I didn't care anymore if I got an interview. I didn't want to pretend that I thought she should win. I didn't want to pretend that I was enjoying being 'a part of history.' &quot;</span></p>
