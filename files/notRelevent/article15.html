  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Feel as if you've been in stuck in the middle of a political science lecture for the past six months? Paul Farhi can't promise he won't chat about the election, the media that covers the election and the critics of the media that cover the election, but he'll try. Oh, heck, maybe he won't.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Farhi was online Tuesday, Nov. 4, at 1 p.m. ET for his weekly Station Break pop culture chat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A transcript follows. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Farhi is a reporter in The Post's Style section, writing about media and popular culture. He's been watching TV and listening to the radio since &quot;The Monkees&quot; were in first run and Adam West was a star. Born in Brooklyn and raised in Los Angeles, Farhi had brief stints in the movie business (as an usher at the Picwood Theater), and in the auto industry (rental car lot guy) before devoting himself full-time to word processing. His car has 15 radio pre-sets and his cable system has 500 channels. He vows to use all of them for good instead of evil.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Greetings, all, and welcome to our Very Special Election Edition. I just want to say that I hope all of you get out to vote today and exercises your inalienable rights to stand in very long lines. I want to say &quot;Vote!&quot; because it is the obligatory thing to say, and as a proud advocate of democracy I certainly don't disagree. But when you think about it, as an individual matter, we should be advocating the exact opposite: Don't vote. Because if you don't vote, MY vote counts incrementally more, in the scheme of things. But, yeah, do that voting thing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Moving on (as Colbert would say): My Esteemed Producer points out (and his very entertaining blog, www.roccifisch.com), a great Barbara Harrison moment. And I quote:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;News4 Washington's Barbara Harrison read this &quot;teaser&quot; going into a commercial break on one of their morning broadcasts last week: &quot;How a cup'a joe [coffee] could change your bra size.&quot; (I noticed that co-anchor Joe Krebs did not read this news item.) This &quot;fact&quot; was based on a report from the British Journal of Cancer which said a study of 300 women revealed that drinking just three cups of coffee a day can affect the hormones and therefore, breast size (make them smaller).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">. . . When Harrison read the entire story after the break, there was a little good-natured banter on the set between her and Joe and a few (nervous?) laughs (they laugh a lot on that show). It was obvious that that story was thrown in there as a light touch and not for serious journalistic purposes.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">All the Babs haters on this channel will be gratified to learn this, I'm sure.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let's go to the phones....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rockville, Md.: Paul, one of the oldest cliches when satirizing the early days of TV is to call something &quot;the show that asks the question...&quot; Do you know what was the original show that asked a question? It was not The Odd Couple; that came later, after the catch-phrase was already well known.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Well, I've never heard this catchphrase. Could it be an early game show thing? If so, I'll go with &quot;21&quot; or &quot;Joker's Wild.&quot; But I will not, under any circumstances, say &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Do I win a big, big prize, Alex?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Laurel, Md.: Paul, if you watched the SNL special last night, did you notice they never parodied Barack Obama in any sketch? In all the scenes that involved him, the jokes were about the other characters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Actually, I don't recall that SNL has made fun of Obama at all. Ever. I can't think of one really cutting thing they've done about him. All of SNL's jokes have been aimed at McCain and Palin, and before that, Hillary. But Obama? Pfft!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Silver Spring, Md.:3 1/2 hours to vote at the NOAA building today in downtown Silver Spring. Madness.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Wow! That's awful. I voted at my usual place. Been going there about 18 years, I figure. And I've never seen it so crowded. Line out the door and down the block--at 10:15 a.m., when the rush hour's supposed to be over. Lots of pro-Obama chatter in line.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Based on this highly scientific observation, I am predicting that Obama will carry Maryland. Bold prediction, sure, but that's how I roll.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nosy Parker: I haven't in recent times been so disgusted as I was last night by repeated venomous comments from a few hateful individuals who posted messages online in the wake of the death of Barack Obama's grandmother (who had played a major role in his upbringing and for whom he took a recent break from campaigning in order to visit one last time).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">First of all, what is wrong with these people? And, based on your professional experience, what percentage of the American population comprises this group of wingnuts? Do you think they've always existed in such numbers, or that widespread access to the Internet has changed American popular culture for the worse (as well as, at other times, the better)?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: No disrespect, but you just discovered this? Have you ever read, say, the posted comments under any politics story? If the internet has revealed anything, it is that the world is filled with idiots. Not just idiots you disagree with, but idiot idiots who hide behind the anonymity of screen names to post bilge for others to see.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And you know what? Bring 'em on. Let's see what the jerks and dopes and morons have to say. They deserve their free speech just as much as the thoughtful people do. And they're easily ignored. Good speech will always triumph over lousy speech in the ol' marketplace of ideas.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Atlanta, Ga.: Can you tell Chuck Todd to shave his goatee? I mean, he's an adult, right?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Hey, what's wrong with goatees? (Signed, actual adult with goatee).</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">SNL parodying Obama: I suspect Obama is tough to make fun of, just because he's so bland (I was going to say &quot;vanilla&quot; or &quot;white bread,&quot; but thought better of it).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">However, SNL did parody Campbell Brown and other CNN reporters for being &quot;in the tank&quot; for Obama, which is the next best thing to parodying the man himself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: That's one of the striking and often overlooked things about Obama, isn't it? I mean, other than his patented, scripted Soaring Rhetoric speeches, he's really kind of a dull, cautious speaker. Nothing particularly wrong with that, of course, but he wasn't terribly inspiring during, say, the debates.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Scopes, Tex.: Is Alex Trebek really Art Fleming in disguise?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I grew up watching Art Fleming, sir. And Alex Trebek is no Art Fleming. Art was jovial and fun. He didn't act like he knew all the questions/answers like Trebek. He didn't have that slightly sneering tone that Trebek adopts when a contestant blows an easy one. Oh, no, Trebek is no Fleming.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Columbus, Ohio: ESPN interviewed Obama and John McCain last night, asking them the same question -- &quot;if you're elected, what would be the one change they'd like to bring to the sports?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's choice is a playoffs system to college football, while McCain mentioned a better sytem to battle doping.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Do you think if there is any underlying political motivation behind their answers?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Well, I figure everything has an underlying political motivation. But I tried parsing those answers and couldn't come up with what each guy was trying to sell (your thoughts appreciated). And by the way, I'm not sure the question was phrased quite like that...</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Good speech will always triumph over lousy speech in the ol' marketplace of ideas. &quot;: Well said, sir. And may I add that the success of this very chat further reinforces the validity of your statement.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Well, I'm not sure this is exactly what the Framers had in mind with that whole First Amendment business, but the Station Break Nation thanks you.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Beverly Hills, Calif.: Why is Cloris Leachman dancing on a television show?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: You got a problem with that? I think that's the coolest thing ever on &quot;Dancing with Your Stars&quot; (admittedly, not a whole to choose from in that category).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Baltimore, Md.: Big radio news up here in Baltimore, as WHFS was changed to WJZ, and its format was changed from talk to all-sports, and in the process, Kirk McEwen and Mark Ondayko lost their shift as the morning show hosts, just two years after they left their perch at 98 Rock. Now, no station has the call letters WHFS for the first time in about 40 years -- THANKS CBS! -- and two talented broadcasters with homes and families and young children are suddenly out of a job -- THANKS CBS!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: A little beyond our purview, but this is just one teeny little indication of the turmoil in the radio business. Yes, every business is in turmoil, but the thing about the media business is, everyone notices its turmoil. But: Kirk and Mark are very talented guys; they'll land somewhere. I'm not feeling too sad about 'em.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">M Factor: How come when I read the title to your chat that song from M Factor runs through my head with the title of your chat in place of the word &quot;music.&quot; Talk about...pop culture, talk about...pop culture. London, New York, Paris, Munich everybody talk about...pop culture. Now that the pop culture Solid Gold dancers are gone, maybe you should consider this your theme song?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Great idea! And the Solid Gold dancers may be gone (where have you gone, Denny Terio?), but....yes!...the Station Break Dancers are back! Won't you put your hands together and welcome them!!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">[Station Break Dancers appear onstage wearing skimpy red, white and blue outfits, with thumping bass line blasting, and confetti guns blowing. Balloon drop in 3...2...1...]</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: If I may, could I modify the joke?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Set-up: What's wrong with goatees?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Punchline: You should ask the goatER.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bring back the paper ballot: At my voting arena, an elderly lady was stymied by the voting wheel. She didn't have the motor control to make it stop at her candidate. The workers wouldn't help her because they weren't allowed to cast her vote, they could only tell her how the infernal machine worked. So the wheel spun back and forth and back and forth ...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: As a Middle-Aged American, I am increasingly sensitive to the little bitty declines in my motor functions, so I guess I'm sympathetic to the elderly lady. But it shows you the enormous difficulty of designing election systems that respect the vast differentials in physical capabilities and/or technological familiarity. The problem, I think, can be defined in two words: Butterfly ballots.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Didn't those rather simple things screw up an election pretty well?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">College Park, Md.: I'm 20 years old, a college student, a guy, and I'm physically attracted to this Cloris Leachman woman! She's hot! Is this okay?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Cloris Leachman on Dancing With the Stars ( ABC, via Google)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I will reluctantly allow it, but I'd feel better if your attraction was based on the Cloris of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; era or of &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; era.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Questions: Where will Joaquin Phoenix be in five years, and how much money does he have in the bank?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: In five years, after the failure of his musical career, he will be back making movies. In fact, make that two years.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Campaign Junkie: Paul, please tell me...when does C-Span crank up &quot;Road to the White House 2012&quot;? I want to see Bobby Jindal scarfing a pork chop on a stick at the Iowa State Fair. I want to check out John Deere tractors at a dealership with John Thune. I want to see Mitt Romney slapping people on the back at a diner in New Hampshire. I'm already going through withdrawal! Help me, man! HAHAHAHA...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: You don't have to wait long. The next campaign officially starts in about 12 hours.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And curious: If you're assuming an Obama victory, you don't think you'll see Sarah Palin in 2012, too?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Baltimore, Md.: Re venomous online comments: I once asked Eugene Robinson in an online what sort of e-mail he receives and he said much of it was unbelievable and unprintable. Part of me thinks that people should somehow be forced to sign their own, real names to their comments online. (For what it's worth, my Post comments ID is my first and middle initials and my last name.) Another part of me reckons that at least the nutjobs and haters have a place to vent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Yes, I think signing real names would utterly transform the discourse. People say things anonymously that they'd never say if their names were attached. As is, the internet enables a kind of giant prank phone call....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bakersfield, Calif.: Hi from the Charles Schulz Estate! We've decided, like the crazy Lynn Johnston, to go back and &quot;re-tell&quot; all of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; strips, starting at the very beginning in the 1950s! We'll be &quot;updating&quot; and &quot;re-doing&quot; all of the dialogues in all of the &quot;Classic Peanuts&quot; comic strips that generations have loved and hated for all of these years! Isn't that exciting? We might integrate &quot;Peanuts&quot; with &quot;For Better or For Worse,&quot; and maybe have Linus date Elizabeth for a while, and have Schroeder date April for a while! And Snoopy and Farley will strike up a &quot;special dog friendship&quot; for a while! This will be fun, and it will totally revolutionize the comics! And maybe we'll get R. Crumb to draw some of the &quot;re-done&quot; strips! All the fun starts in December!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Wow, comic mash-ups! That would be kinda cool, actually. Let's see: How about B.C meets Beatle Bailey? B.C. pulls out his club; Beetle faces him down in a tank.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Okay, maybe not...</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gaithersburg, Md.: Hi! This year for Christmas, I'm getting everyone in my family, including my parents, &quot;Influence,&quot; the new book by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen! And I'm buying a copy for myself! It will greatly add to my growing Olsen Twins collection that has taken over the garage! We have all of their movies, too!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Taken over your garage? What are you going to do with all the American Girl dolls you have stored there?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">'Actually, I don't recall that SNL has made fun of Obama at all. Ever.': That's because, perceived liberal bias aside, there's really nothing to ridicule about Obama -- as opposed to Bush, who's legacy will be that he was the most ridicule-ready president in the history of the republic.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Not really true, of course. And even if true, that would be a sad day for comedy, and for America. ALL people in power (or who pretend to it) should be made fun of. It's the American Way, not, say, the Uzbeki Way (although maybe in Uzbekhastan they have a great tradition of political satire, I dunno).</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Malibu, Calif.: Why do Sarah Silverman and Frank Caliendo have television sketch/sitcomish shows? Sarah's beautiful, but her show is terrible. Frank's funny with standup, but his show is terrible. Sarah should be doing movies -- she can act pretty well and she lights up the screen -- and Frank should do standup and a traditional sitcom. But their current shows? Sorry.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Well, hold on there, pardner (that was my George W. Bush imitation; did you like it?). I concede that Caliendo's show is not hilarious; but he is a great impersonater and, in theory, should have been able to carry a sketch-comedy show built around him. As for Sarah, her show is really rather astonishing. It is Seinfeldian in the sense that it is very much a &quot;quirky&quot; and unusual take on the traditional sitcom. I'm not sure it's &quot;good,&quot; but it's amazing to watch. She goes off in a dozen unexpected directions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">SNL and Obama: I don't know whether you would count this as making fun of him, but in one of the last two debate skits, Fred Armisen as Obama confessed that William Ayers was his best friend and closest advisor, and made a couple of other similarly devastating admissions (the joke being that he could say anything at that point and it wouldn't matter).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Okay. I didn't remember those, but, yep, that counts. Obama has officially been made fun of. More please.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">'Actually, I don't recall that SNL has made fun of Obama at all. Ever.': There are jokes about Obama in SNL, but they tend to be pretty subtle. Did you listen to Fred Armisen's lines in the primary recap which showed Obama as half a face, Hilary's as the other half, and the two voices united only sometimes? It captured very well the fact that we think of Obama as sweetness, but he's driven to win like any other candidate. The Daily Show has been much stronger in its Obama humor with the mythic hero and messiah jokes. Anyway, agreed we need to mock our leadership and people will just have to listen harder for the jokes in Obama '08</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Well, if he wins, you can guaran-damn-tee that the jokes are coming. Tons upon tons. Nobody becomes prez without becoming Joke Target No. 1.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: Did anybody see SNL Saturday night during Ben Affleck's spoof of Keith Olbermann. There was a great deal of nervous laughter at it in the audience for whatever reason, maybe many have no idea who Olbermann is, but it was absolutely hilarious and really brought out Olbermann's tendency to oh, I don't know, make every issue overblown with his self importance. Anyway, if you haven't seen it, do check it out.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Well, see, I thought that fell short. Went on too long. And Affleck didn't really capture Olbermann's blowhardery, I thought. Imagine if that thing was a little better writeen and had been done by Darrell Hammond. Would have killed.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: Why oh why do networks put the score for sporting events in type that is too small to read? Not eveyone has a 40-inch TV screen.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Maybe you need to stand closer to the set?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Well, I think I'll wrap 'er up here, folks, to give you even more time to go out and stand in line. But let's do this again next week, when we can be the first to discuss the failed Obama or McCain Administration. Until then...regards to all. --Paul.</span></p>
