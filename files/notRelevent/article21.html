  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sponsor plugs are especially prominent in TV sports, where stats and replays and just about everything else can be &quot;brought to you&quot; by somebody. But Fox managed to take product placement to a new level Sunday -- having its announcers sell you a truck in the middle of its top-rated NFL studio show. Really.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fox brought in Jeff Hammond, who dissects cars on Fox's NASCAR coverage, to describe a Ford truck with a &quot;luxury look to it&quot; that had been brought in the studio. Analyst Michael Strahan got in the back seat to show all the leg room while Terry Bradshaw jumped up and down in the truck's bed. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;One thing we try to do at Fox is work with advertisers,&quot; said Fox studio producer Scott Ackerson Sunday. &quot;Ford came to us and said, 'This is important to us, could you make something happen?'&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Savvy viewers could have guessed why Fox's Howie Long, on set, didn't help out with the tire-kicking: He does Chevy truck ads.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pantsgate: That new San Francisco 49ers coach Mike Singletary last week pulled his pants down (in the locker room) to motivate his players was an irresistible topic for Sunday's NFL shows. Fox's Jimmy Johnson called the move &quot;kind of stupid&quot; while CBS' Bill Cowher went clearly on-the-record: &quot;I think pulling your pants down is inappropriate.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But Fox's Strahan suggested pants-dropping would affect concentration: &quot;As a player when a coach does something like that, you're more concerned in the second half about what just happened. You're thinking, 'My coach just pulled his pants down.' Mulling over that could make you miss the snap count.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Singletary, on the NFL Network on Sunday, says he'll &quot;tone it down a little bit. ... We are not in the era of 'What is said in this room stays in the room.' I've seen some things in the locker room that would blow your mind.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Serious stuff: On Sept.16, HBO's Real Sports debuted a Bernard Goldberg report from India showing that children are forced to miss school and work long hours stitching soccer balls. But British ball-maker Mitre, as reported by the New York Post on Sunday, filed a federal lawsuit claiming HBO paid children to go on-camera and misrepresent their lives. Said HBO's Ray Stallone on Sunday: &quot;We are not going to comment on pending litigation.&quot; ... ESPN's Outside the Lines Sunday looked at the death of Ereck Plancher, the Central Florida football player who collapsed and died during a March 18 team workout. James Jamison, who was at the workout as Plancher's teammate, said when Plancher collapsed, the coaches said he was all right, and then asked the players to stand Plancher up. &quot;So we stood him up, and he fell again,&quot; Jamison said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Politics in sports: TNT's Ernie Johnson, after colleague Charles Barkley said the resume of the Phoenix Suns' bench was &quot;thinner than Sarah Palin's,&quot; offered this: &quot;I can see Alaska from the set.&quot; (The set is in Atlanta.) ... After the Republican nominee in a U.S. Senate race in Illinois in 2004 dropped out, ESPN's Mike Ditka was recruited to take on then-state senator Barack Obama. Sunday, Ditka reminisced about what might have been: &quot;Sometimes, the scrutiny that these politicians get is ridiculous. I think there are a lot of good people who stay out of it. Not that I'm a good person.&quot; ... Candidates likely to get nicknames: John McCain and Barack Obama each appear in taped one-on-ones with Chris Berman at halftime of tonight's Monday Night Football.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Spice rack: Fox's Curt Menefee on Sunday suggested some NFL teams listen to anybody: &quot;It absolutely amazes me the impact sports talk radio and the Internet has had on the mind-set of people in the NFL. ... Why let Larry from Longmont on Line 3 influence your decisions? Too many team decision-makers don't know any better because they don't have a football background.&quot; So they turn to radio shows? ... New York Giant Plaxico Burress, who signed a $30million contract before the season opener, has been fined more than $200,000 this season. Fox's Strahan, an ex-teammate, says Burress has the team &quot;reaching their boiling point.&quot; But Burress, to Fox's Pam Oliver Sunday, said, &quot;I've never been ashamed of anything I've done.&quot; <br /></span></p>
