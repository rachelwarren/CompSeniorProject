  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Matthew 25 Network, a relatively new political action group aimed at Christian voters, began broadcasting two radio commercials on Monday on behalf of Senator Barack Obama. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The spots are running on Christian music stations in several contested states, including Colorado, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> One, called ''Source of Hope,'' replays Mr. Obama's words as he describes his faith as a source of hope. He refers to ''kneeling beneath a cross'' and embracing Christ, an implicit declaration of his Christianity as false rumors persist in suggesting that he is Muslim.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The other, called ''Pro-Life, Pro-Obama,'' features Douglas W. Kmiec, a Catholic legal scholar who was a legal counsel under President Ronald Reagan. Mr. Kmiec makes his appeal to those who oppose abortion rights and says that Mr. Obama, who supports abortion rights, also supports prenatal care, maternity leave and adoption. Mr. Kmiec says these policies would reduce the number of abortions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The commercials are intended to appeal to Christian voters who have not been inspired by Mr. Obama's rival, Senator John McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In the most recent New York Times/CBS poll, conducted Oct. 19-22, white voters who describe themselves as evangelical Christians supported Mr. McCain over Mr. Obama by 65 percent to 22 percent. (Voters over all supported Mr. Obama over Mr. McCain by 51 percent to 38 percent.) In 2004, they were more supportive of President Bush; he won 78 percent of the white evangelical Christian vote, exit polls showed.KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and MEGAN THEE </span></p>
