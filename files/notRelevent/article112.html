  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let's be honest. As much as we are looking forward to Nov. 4, when a historic and riveting presidential campaign will finally reach a verdict, it's going to take more than a few aspirin and a nap to get rid of the hangover we will feel the next day. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> No more nights of watching Anderson Cooper make the eager hand-off to the wise David Gergen. Keith Olbermann and Bill O'Reilly will have to make do with political autopsy, while Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert will have to find humor speculating about those first 100 days. And if the current polls hold (and don't hold your breath), Tina Fey might have to make do without Gov. Sarah Palin, along with the rest of us. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But however bereft you and I, along with our broadcast political familiars, might be feeling once the balloons drop, it will be nothing compared to those who live and die on local television advertising. For the last several months, local stations, and to some degree networks, have been frolicking in all the money spilled by the Democratic campaign and the efforts of the Republicans to play catch-up. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Given all of the bailing that the government has been doing in the private sector, perhaps it is only fitting that politics has been a lifesaver for a media industry. It is one of the certainties of democracy that America will never run out of hot air. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Last week, the Obama campaign surpassed the record in advertising spending set by the Bush campaign in 2004, and the end of the campaign has yet to be counted. These final days are when campaigns spend the most to influence the least -- those last few undecided voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> By some estimates, Senator Obama will have spent $250 million on local, cable and network television in just five months, a rate of advertising that outstrips Burger King, Apple and Gap on an annualized basis. And it dwarfs the $188 million that President Bush spent in 2004. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Right now, he is one of the leading brands out there,'' said Evan Tracey, president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group of TNS Media Intelligence, which monitors political advertising. ''We have never had a candidate for president who did not take public financing, so he is sort of rewriting the rule book. We are on new ground here.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But even political spending, along with a popular Olympics, may not salvage the year. Marci L. Ryvicker, vice president for equity research at Wachovia Capital Markets, is estimating that total ad sales will be down 1 percent: the decline in top categories like automotive, retail and financial services wiped out a record year in political ads.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The every-other-year cycle of Congressional races has long been a lifeline. ''This is the first year in history that advertising could decline in an even year,'' Ms. Ryvicker said. ''The finance guys, the auto guys, the retail sector are used to getting pushed off the air by the political ads and then returning, but this year, they won't be coming back.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Brand Obama began as a social network phenomenon online, with a database of not only willing volunteers but also folks who opened up their checkbooks. And this being a hybrid media age, money gathered on the Web is now being spilled on the traditional box in the den. The next time around, the Web may be the vehicle where money is both harvested and spent, but in 2008, it is those spot ads on the local television news that still constitute the sweet spot of political persuasion. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Campaign advertising comes and goes in two-year cycles, with presidential years being a particular bonanza, and then it reliably goes away. But the bubble was bigger this year: In the last presidential election cycle, all political advertising spending was about $1.7 billion. This year it will be $2.5 billion, according to current estimates. The bullish year in broadcast political bull has served as something of a Band-Aid on a hemorrhaging ad market. Pulling that bandage off on Nov. 5 is going to hurt.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''We always plan for feast and famine, not famine and more famine,'' said Gary Belis, a spokesman for Television Bureau of Advertising, a trade association for local television broadcasters. Several crucial categories for local television advertising are down hugely: according to research done by the bureau, as of August, auto advertising was off 13.9 percent, movie ads were down 20.9 percent and television buys for department stores were off 18.5 percent. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Even the networks, not historically huge players in a landscape of focused buys in battleground states, have had some of the money slosh their way. By the time the last hanging chad is accounted for, the Obama campaign will have spent $20 million on network advertising and Senator McCain will have spent more than $10 million. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But while big media companies like Viacom and the News Corporation own dozens of local television stations, it is a relatively minor part of their business. It is smaller, less diversified players -- Hearst-Argyle, Gray Television, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Young Broadcasting and Belo -- that could be hurt the most. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''There is not going to a be a lot of demand for inventory in the fourth quarter,'' said Brad Adgate of Horizon Media. ''There has been so much consolidation in retail and now financial services that there are not enough brands to go around.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But for now, there is a fire hose of spending under way. Seventy percent of election spending happens in the final 60 days, and Mr. Obama has so much money, he is looking for places to stuff it, including a 30-minute buy on most networks and some cable outlets this Wednesday. (Who would have ever thought that the Democrats would use overwhelming financial force to wrest the megaphone from the Republicans? Maybe they'll use it to make some nice speeches about campaign finance reform.) </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In addition to a year of record fund-raising in the presidential campaign and countless hard-fought battles for seats in the Senate and the House, the so-called 527 groups are being allowed to spend in the final days of the campaign after a change in the law, which only adds to all of the late money coursing through television right now.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Given the stakes and the current climate, broadcasters could hardly be blamed for hearing the sound of the cash register when it's time for voters to pull a lever. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''On the bright side, 2010 is going to be starting earlier than ever,'' said Mr. Tracey of TNS. ''They won't have long to wait.''</span></p>
