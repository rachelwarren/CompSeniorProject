  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Federal Reserve and Congress are pushing out close to $1 trillion to repair the nation's financial system and to encourage lending. But that is not enough to revive the economy. Spending has to resume.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Consumers, however, have cut back sharply on their spending, in what will be the first quarterly decline in 17 years when the government tally is in for the third quarter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Business, in response, is shrinking its outlays for equipment, supplies and personnel. And now dozens of state and city governments, their tax revenue falling short of expectations, are engaged in yet another round of cost-cutting. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">To offset this shrinkage, and head off a severe recession, the Democratic leadership in Congress is ''seriously considering'' a large fiscal stimulus proposal, which would send a significant amount of money to states and cities.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">''We have to prop up consumption,'' Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in an interview in which he revealed some of the details the party leadership is discussing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The new proposal would be far greater than the $60 billion stimulus package that the House passed in late September, Mr. Frank said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Senate has not acted on the earlier bill, which was dwarfed in attention and scope by the sums being pledged to Wall Street companies and commercial banks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Congress, now in recess, would be asked to return after the November election to act on the proposal in a lame-duck session.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This new effort would be more diverse than the stimulus that Congress, with bipartisan support, approved early this year and President Bush signed. That package, at a cost of $107 billion, mostly went to low- and moderate-income families, in the form of checks in the spring and early summer. Those checks lifted spending for a while, many economists concluded, and helped compensate consumers as gasoline prices surged. But an unknown amount was used to pay down debt or buy imports. Neither lifts output in this country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republicans embraced the last stimulus plan, and they might very well embrace another. But their long-held position has been that the best way to give the economy a boost is through tax cuts at the corporate and individual level. They also express concerns that some money funneled to the states would be spent inefficiently, for example on programs that would generate few jobs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Democratic proposal would provide tax relief in some form for families, the goal being to step up their spending, as the rebates were intended to do earlier this year. In addition, unemployment insurance benefits would be extended beyond 39 weeks and the food stamp program would expand. Both would channel money to people who would probably spend every penny to meet their needs. But the biggest chunk, perhaps as much as $150 billion, would go to states and cities to sustain their everyday spending.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The rationale for another stimulus package, particularly one that helps the states and cities, is compelling for many economists. The nearly $1 trillion that Congress and the Federal Reserve are making available to the financial system is intended to make credit more available. That props up the supply side.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But to make the economy grow, or stop contracting, demand is required. Consumers, businesses and governments need confidence to spend their own incomes or tap credit from a repaired financial system. In the case of states and cities whose revenue is shrinking, bigger federal subsidies would ease the need to cut so many jobs and services to balance their budgets.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">''That is the whole rationale for giving money to the states and cities,'' said Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton University economist who served in the Clinton administration and also as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. ''Deciding not to cut spending is the functional equivalent of spending more. Either one leads to more spending than you otherwise would have.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">State and local spending accounts for 12 percent of nation's economic activity. There is a widespread contraction in their spending now because of lower revenue and laws that require them to balance their budgets.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">''We know there are at least 15 states that have fallen out of balance since early summer,'' said Iris J. Lav, deputy director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ''We don't have estimates of the gaps for all of them. Only 11 estimated the amount, but their shortfall alone totaled $5.9 billion. That is on top of the $48 billion in gaps that all 50 states were forced to close to balance their budgets for the fiscal year that began in most cases on July 1.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Indianapolis, to take just one of hundreds of examples, reduced to 12 from 24 the number of deputy chiefs and assistant chiefs in its police command staff. ''It was kind of bloated anyway,'' said Marcus Barlow, a spokesman for Mayor Greg Ballard.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Phoenix, every department of the city government has been asked to propose a 30 percent spending reduction, on top of the 12.5 percent cut that was effective on July 1. If tax revenue does not revive and there is no lifeline from Washington, those reductions or some portion of them will go into effect by early next year, said Robert Wingenroth, the Phoenix finance director.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">''Our city government is mostly people, so we would have to reduce people,'' he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Under the stimulus package that the Congressional Democratic leadership is considering, the mechanism for funneling money to the states and cities would be an increase in federal funding of state Medicaid programs. Those states hardest hit economically would receive more proportionally than those relatively better off.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Whatever the amounts, the federal subsidies would free up money the states currently must put into Medicaid. States might divert that money to cities, for example, to pay teachers and vendors, or it might be used to quickly resume public works projects shut down for lack of funding.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential candidate, now supports a stimulus plan similar to the one the Congressional Democratic leadership is seriously considering. ''Mr. Obama has been calling for six months for a demand-side fiscal stimulus,'' said Jason Furman, the candidate's economic policy director.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Senator John McCain, the Republican candidate, is less enthusiastic. His campaign prefers, as a stimulus, making President Bush's tax cuts permanent and lowering corporate tax rates. But the McCain camp does not reject out of hand the Democratic proposal now taking shape.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">''Nothing is off the table,'' said Mark Zandi, a McCain economic adviser and the chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''That includes all the various stimulus tools that might be used, given the severity of the crisis.''</span></p>
