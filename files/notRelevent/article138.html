  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The total bill might make Joe Six-Pack spew his brew, but to image experts, the $150,000 that the Republican National Committee has spent on wardrobing Sarah Palin since she was tapped as the GOP's vice presidential candidate isn't shocking -- in fact, it's arguably necessary. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;When you think about costumes for literally every day of the week, for a couple-month period, it's not outrageous,&quot; says Susan Scafidi, who teaches fashion law at Fordham Law School. As long as the outfits are worn for campaigning only and not for personal use, it's a &quot;perfectly legal&quot; item on the RNC budget, Scafidi says. (The clothing is destined for charity post-election, according to the McCain campaign.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What is shocking, Scafidi says, is the context. &quot;When you see that number in the middle of a credit crunch&quot; and consider the irony of &quot;spending enormous amounts to reach ordinary people&quot; for whom $150,000 is probably more than a year's salary, the spree is &quot;a political disaster.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The expense &quot;doesn't seem frivolous to me,&quot; says Simon Doonan, creative director at Barneys, a stop on Palin's shopping trip. (The tally at the company's New York store: $789.72, according to Politico, which broke the story.) In her role, &quot;you don't have to be high fashion, but you have to be elegantly dressed. &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dressing to impress costs an arm and a well-tailored pantleg, says Amy Tara Koch, who analyzes the art of power dressing on her Inc. blog. Barack Obama, for instance, has a hankering for Hart Schaffner Marx suits, which go for $1,500 in department stores. &quot;If you're in the position of handling the economy&quot; -- a top task for next term -- &quot;you should always overdress,&quot; she says. &quot;You really need to reflect seriousness of task at hand.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And until recently, Palin wasn't impressing, Koch says. &quot;She was a badly coiffed deer in the headlights. She looked like she was straight out of a LensCrafters ad. She did not look like a power player. She looked very peripheral.&quot; Now &quot;she looks more acceptable.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But looking polished, professional and even vice presidential doesn't require a college tuition budget, counters Scafidi. &quot;There's a JC Penney in almost every mall in every small town in the 'real America' as (Palin) puts it. So why did she have to leave it? At least it would have been image-consistent. &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What $150,000 buys</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At Target you could buy every piece in designer Isaac Mizrahi's 20-look fall collection (that includes more than 70 items of apparel from shoes to clothes) for yourself and about 60 of your friends.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At Nordstrom you could buy 51 BOSS Black Suits for $1,445 each and 83 Lafayette 148 New York suits at $896 each.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At Neiman Marcus you could buy eight $5,990 Oscar de la Renta dresses, 29 pairs of Manolo Blahnik boots (at $1,695 each) and 15 Gucci bags (at $3,295 each). <br /></span></p>
