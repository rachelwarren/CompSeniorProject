  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Down to the wire: Who wins your plaudits and damnation among the mainstream media's vast array of talking heads during this political season? Station Break's Paul Farhi was online Tuesday, Oct. 21, at 1 p.m. ET to offer some high- and low-lights.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A transcript follows.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Farhi is a reporter in The Post's Style section, writing about media and popular culture. He's been watching TV and listening to the radio since &quot;The Monkees&quot; were in first run and Adam West was a star. Born in Brooklyn and raised in Los Angeles, Farhi had brief stints in the movie business (as an usher at the Picwood Theater), and in the auto industry (rental car lot guy) before devoting himself full-time to word processing. His car has 15 radio pre-sets and his cable system has 500 channels. He vows to use all of them for good instead of evil. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Greetings, all, and thanks for stopping by...I am, as you know, officially neutral in all things political (Me? Have opinions? Impossible!...), but the election is over as far as the popular culture is concerned. By popular culture, I mean everything from late-night comics to YouTube video makers to musicians to email smart alecks. And in this regard the clear winner is Barack Obama. Has John McCain scored even one popular (i.e., pro-McCain) video? Obama has dozens, dating way back to Obama Girl and and will.i.am song and continuing on all the way to the more recent Ron Howard and Charles Stone/&quot;Wazzup '08&quot; vids (see links below).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Late-night-wise, it's not even close. Leno, Letterman et al love to bash McCain. Here's the actual joke count from the Center for Media and Public Affairs, which runs a monthly tally of political cracks made by Leno, Letterman, Conan, Daily Show and Colbert:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sept. (latest month available):</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Jokes about:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">--McCain: 138</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">--Bush: 58</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">--Obama: 29.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">--Palin: 168.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Me, I'm a little surprised by this. Yeah, young people make the videos and Obama has a huge appeal among young people, but where are the McCain people to spread the word? Is his crowd just too old, too non-tech savvy to get into YouTube? Or is his image just too tired and grumpy, making him the more natural butt of the jokes?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Better yet, what do you think?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let's go to the phones...</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anonymous: Tuesday, October 28, 2008 11:46 a.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul, Through the years of reading your columns and listening to your responses, I've always admired your sense of humor. What popular culture figures have inspired your ready wit? Or does it come from someone in the past? A Fan from Bluffton, S.C.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Aw, shucks. You're much too kind. But now that you mention it, I will have to credit my dear mother! Taught me everything I know. Well, not everything....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Commie Land, Va. (aka Arlington): I was all set to vote for Sen. Obama but then I saw an RNC ad showing an EMPTY CHAIR with OMINOUS MUSIC and a deep voiceover saying HE ISN'T PREPARED. Now I have made an informed decision to vote for the other guy (not named).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Seriously, I know that history shows us that negative ads work, and this one isn't even from the McCain campaign, but how in the world does someone make a decision based on this piece of superficial dreck? When voting for president, this is the level of decision making?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I cannot wait for next Wednesday and NO MORE POLITICAL ADS.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Well, this is a slight digression, but, yes, this campaign has produced few memorable ads, negative or otherwise. I think the thing that will be most remembered, though, is McCain's really negative set of ads since the convention (Obama's gone negative, too, just not quite as...um...hard as McCain). But it'll be the tone of the lot of 'em, not any one in particular.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Jokes?: None about Biden? What's that old saying, I don't care what they say about me, as long as they spell my name correctly?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: CMPA counts 11 jokes about Biden in September (I bet there were many more in October), but that's a surprisingly low total. Consider: CMPA counts 12 jokes during the same period about Bristol Palin. And I'm not sure what she's running for.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chattanooga, Tenn.: Is the Andy Taylor in the Opie Cunningham video CGI or a muppet? I can't tell.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: He may have had a little work done, but National Treasure Andy Griffith is still National Treasure Andy Griffith.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anonymous: Any chance that the Obama Variety Half Hour might actually be aired during the infomercial time slot? Bill Clinton and those dancing ladies were a good bit.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I suspect that would be far more entertaining than the Obama infomercial that will roadblocking primetime TV tonight. Any suggestions for drinking-game phrases? My money's on &quot;main street&quot; and &quot;Wall Street.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Old Blue in Exile: Cal 41, UCLA 20. Go, Bears!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When I first moved to the D.C. area in the '70s, and in reply to the inevitable question about where I'd gone to school I said &quot;Cal,&quot; everyone automatically assumed I meant UCLA, owing to the Bruins' basketball reign-of-terror under John Wooden. Finally, a little r-e-s-p-e-c-t.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Well, that's some teeny tiny respect you got there, Old Blue. You can have your semi-meaningless regular season football victory. Bruins will stick with their 11 NCAA basketball titles.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michelle Obama's wardrobe: Even before I found out how much Sarah Palin's new clothes cost, I didn't think they were all that. Then some supporter of hers made a crack that Palin couldn't be expected to wear a turtleneck from LL Bean, or clothes from the J. Crew catalog.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My first question is, why not? Heck, since my best(!) turtlenecks are from LL Bean, I took personal umbrage at her remark. Or does that make me a hick or rube?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Also, last night on Jay Leno, Michelle Obama proudly replied to one of his questions that she was wearing a J. Crew ensemble, and that owing to time restrictions she does a lot of her shopping from catalogs online.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: The funny thing about Palin's outfits was, they were nice, all right, but not $150k nice. I mean, was anyone really impressed by those fancy duds? She looked perfectly presentable, of course. But why did they need 150 large, when they could have made her equally attractive for far less (and defused the criticism of her clothes in the process). But maybe I don't know anything about women's clothes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Michelle Obama on Leno ( YouTube)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The only political ad I like: is the one where McCain is shown talking about how he's voted in line with George W. Bush even more than his Republican colleagues.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I'm sort of surprised that the Obama campaign didn't make more use of that now-famous photo of McCain hugging Bush. It's iconic, and illustrates the voted-with-the-president-more-than-90-percent-of-the-time charge very vividly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: The thing that galls me about that &quot;empty chair&quot; ad is that there is nobody that is more unprepared to sit in it than Sarah Palin, should a certain 72-year-old fall into poor health. If &quot;unprepared-ness&quot; is your biggest fear (which is what that ad seems targeted at), then why would you take a chance of that happening?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Ain't gonna touch this one. Remember, I'm Mr. Neutral.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: Paul, the media has truly skewed the images of the presidential nominees. They are supossed to be unbiased but do not come close. This is not fair to the American public...most folks do not know what goes on inside the Beltway. Do you think some of the lack of Obama jokes have to do with this and some have to do with the fact that peole would be called racist if there were jokes?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: To be honest, the fear-of-racism thing MAY play some part in this, but I couldn't begin to calculate WHAT part. On the other hand: 1) There are plenty of non-racist ways to joke about Obama or anyone else for that matter; and 2) the news media doesn't make up these jokes or grassroots videos; they're the opinion of voters based on voters' own perceptions, prejudices and points of view.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Any suggestions for drinking-game phrases?: Yes we can!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: How about that oldie but goodie, &quot;Change&quot;?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Radioland: Who does the news for Jack Diamond? Her voice is almost as canned as Diamond's.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: She also sounds like she's being piped in from a studio on the other side of the galaxy. Very strange.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain Backer: Holy socks! Sheriff Taylor is for Obama?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That's it. Fold up the tents and snuff out the campfire, this weenie roast is over..</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Yeah, I had the same reaction: I wonder who takes political instruction from Opie, Andy and the Fonz. And please don't make me watch Ron Howard take his shirt off again...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama Show: It's on Wednesday night, not tonight.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Oh, jeez. Of course. Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Infomercial: will be on at 8 Eastern tomorrow, not tonight (although tomorrow will now be the end of Game 5 of the World Series, not Game 6, as they've just postponed the end of Game 5 from tonight until tomorrow).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Yep. Right. We stand corrected. Twice.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Political Ad: One TV ad that sticks in my mind was produced by Keith Fimian, running for Tom Davis's seat. It's a very negative ad against his competition, Gerry Connolly. It's the ending tag line that got me: Gerry Connolly -- too corrupt, even for Congress. That certainly sets the bar pretty low!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: That one caught me by surprise. I'd never heard of either of those guys. And I thought, &quot;Am I supposed to vote for one of them?&quot; Then I discovered they're running in a different state--Wyoming, I think--than the one I live in. Phew.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Commonwealth of Pennsylvania: There are so many commercials here in the Keystone State, especially for Obama but also plenty for McCain, that I wonder whether our local TV station stations are making more money selling that time to them than if they were simply running ads for, say, local businesses. Do local advertisers get partially frozen out of the TV ad market during the presidential campaign, or are those political ads in slots that might otherwise have been used for non-revenue-producing Public Service Announcements or house ads for their own programming? I assume the same thing is occurring in the battleground Commonwealth of Virginia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Yes, local advertisers DO get frozen out when the candidate downpour is heavy. TV stations tend to appreciate the additional revenue from political ads, but with a couple of caveats. Caveat No. 1: Candidates, by law, get the cheapest rates that stations charge. Caveat No. 2: Candidates get dibs on news programming, which is some of the most valuable real estate stations sell.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On the other hand, all those political ads tends to soak up so much time that it drives up what the station can charge for the rest of the fourth quarter, during the holiday &quot;selling&quot; season. Supply and demand, you see...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Then I discovered they're running in a different state--Wyoming, I think -- than the one I live in. Phew. : Actually Paul, that race is in Virginia, definitely the D.C. Metro area.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Ah. That explains why it was on my local news...(And, for the record, I DO know where Fairfax County is).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clothes and Politics: Do you remember when Nancy Reagan got flak for buying a pair of jeans at Sears? Seems like those in the public eye can't win. Buy expensive, people complain. Buy cheap, people complain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: But wait. These are special circumstances. Nancy Reagan was KNOWN as a clothes horse; she wore all kinds of expensive designer clothes. So the Sears thing kinda looked like she was self-consciously trying to change her image. And the Palin thing just strikes some people as excessive, particularly for a candidate whose appeal is that she's so down to Earth. Most of the time--heck, almost all the time--clothes aren't an issue.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.: Okay -- watching Opie take his shirt off, get his nose hair trimmed and apply various toupees was a highlight -- not saying it was a good highlight since I'm eating lunch -- but a highlight. I bet Aunt Bee would vote McCain/Palin...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Yeah? And where would Barney Fife and Floyd the Barber fall on the political spectrum?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va: I had a 'conversation' with someone over the weekend who buys into that whole thing about Obama's middle name.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I asked if he would not have voted for Obama if he ran 8 years ago before negative connotations of that name. He had no answer. I also asked if he would not have voted for someone with a Russian last name during the cold war, he had no answer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: The whole &quot;Hussein&quot; business certainly has gotten bent out of shape. I realize that McCain's supporters are trying to suggest an unsavory association by repeating it endlessly, but it got really crazy when people were shouting &quot;terrorist!&quot; when Obama's name was mentioned. Really? He's a terrorist? Not just a guy with an Arabic middle name? Crazy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tysons, Va.: The pop culture divide is representative to the cultural divide between Obama and McCain supporters. It is about people who embrace change and technology vs. people who are stuck in old ways of doing and old ways of thinking.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">P.S. The empty chair commercial by the RNC seems so desperate...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: See, I doubt this. McCain has plenty of tech-savvy, youthful supporters. Surely, one or two or 200 of them know how to make a clever video. I still can't figure out why they haven't.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Charlotte, N.C.: Floyd the Barber totally a Ron Paul guy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Ah. Naturally.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rockville, Md.: The N..Y Times is reporting the Christian Science Monitor will stop its print edition and move to online only in April. The beginning of a tectonic shift in the j-biz? Should I short ink and paper stocks?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Christian Science Monitor to Publish Online Only Online ( The New York Times, Oct. 28)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Oh, wow. Big news, yes. We're all going to be there someday, I think. Problem is, no one in newspapers has figured out how to make online work. Print still pays the bills, though print is in steep decline.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If anyone has the answer to this problem, I have my publisher's number.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Worse than political ads: are the new Bud commercials about how Bud has &quot;drinkability.&quot; Is saying it's &quot;drinkable&quot; the best they can do?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Very underwhelming indeed. &quot;Drinkability&quot; actually does have some kind of meaning to beer aficionados, but darned if I know what it is. It just seems to mean &quot;you can drink it.&quot; Sort of like saying of a car &quot;it travels from Point A to Point B.&quot; Not exactly a very persuasive pitch.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Making Online Papers Work: I think the Wall Street Journal charges for their online edition -- but they started in that business mode from the beginning, never &quot;giving it away.&quot; The trick is how The Post, Times et al can move from free to &quot;paid&quot; online content. Being old school, I don't know how the Sunday insert (comics, magazines, ads) could translate from print to electronic.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Yes, which is why print remains our bread and butter. Plus, online ads are sold for much lower prices than the print kind. The assumption is that people are actually spending time with their newspapers, not darting in and out as they are on the web. Plus, there are thousands and thousands of sites to advertise on on the internet. There are only a few newspapers (and often one) in most towns.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anonymous: Why the Candy Corn hate?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Always thought they were kind of chalky tasting. Plus, they tend to jam in your teeth, adding to the usual tooth rot of Halloween. Besides, do we really want a candy with the word &quot;corn&quot; in it?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Garrison, N.Y.: Surely there are a variety of reasons that popular culture has favored Obama. I've wondered if, under the influence of Fox and talk radio and more recently the blogosphere, bias is just more accepted in the media these days. Also, it seems to me that Obama just isn't a very good object of ridicule -- he doesn't move funny (like Ford), sound funny (like both Bushes), carry himself oddly (like Gore and Dukakis), look cranky (like Dole and McCain), hasn't committed many obvious gaffes (like Kerry), and hasn't flip-flopped very often or spectacularly (like Kerry and McCain).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Wait. Stop. Can we please stop conflating the opinions of voters and political operatives with &quot;the media.&quot; The media's opinions don't really matter. But to the rest of your point(s): I think while some of that is true, it's incumbent on satirists, parodists and all-around wits to FIND the points of ridicule. &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; by the way, has done a very poor job of satirizing Obama. They've been much, much tougher on Hillary and McCain.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Yes, the Journal is a specialized case. It's a national paper and targeted to business readers. But I think the general point is a good one here: The Journal charges for its exclusive content and has for a long time. I wonder how the newspaper industry would look today if every local newspaper had made the decision long ago not to give away its staff-written content and instead charged readers for this. Although it's not a perfect comparison, newspapers in Japan put very little of their content on their web sites. And newspaper circulation in Japan has held steady for some time.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Brooke Shields VW Ads: Since the mini-van is targeted for families with young kids, the premise is that people are getting pregnant for the sole purpose of buying the van. Or something.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She does look great....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Right. Big stretch there. They may as well have said that VWs have &quot;drinkability.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Candy Corn: But you can put them inside your mouth upside down and pretend to have fangs. So fun!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Fair point. But I still hate Candy Corn!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">RE: Least Favorite Halloween Candy: So, I guess the big problem with candy corn is its &quot;eatability&quot;...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Hahahaha....</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin couldn't be expected to wear a turtleneck from LL Bean, or clothes from the J. Crew catalog. : Remember that year Sharon Stone was praised for her sleek outfit and she revealed it was a Gap turtleneck? The woman makes the clothes and Valentino or not, Palin's an outback sorta gal.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I dunno. She looks perfectly nice to me. But I'm sure she would have looked just as nice in a cheaper outfit.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe the Plumber: This is another example of the media and/or political party shooting the messenger if his/her message is not liked. In Joe's case, he engaged Obama on taxes, with Obama saying he wants to spread the wealth. Joe did not force Obama to pronounce a socialist stance. With that exchange, we know a little more about Obama, and that can factor into everyone's evaluation (regardless if you are politically left or right). But instead, we're focusing on the evils of Joe, which is not pertinent to the election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Good point. Although I'm confused about the &quot;spread the wealth&quot; thing. Isn't Obama saying that taxes should be LOW, so that you can keep more of the income you earn (i.e., so that wealth will spread)? Or have I just missed the socialist for the trees?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Since the mini-van is targeted for families with young kids, the premise is that people are getting pregnant for the sole purpose of buying the van. Or something. : Aah, because it wouldn't be cool to get the van if you didn't have kids. Okay.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: We're all learning something here...</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Worst Radio Ad: I was listening to the radio yesterday and couldn't believe I heard an ad for a hangover prevention product. Was this for real? It was during Rush Limbaugh's show. Are they expecting a lot of people to need it on Tuesday night?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Or Wednesday morning maybe...My question: Does stuff like that (and the ubiquitous Head On) really work? If not, why are they allowed on the air?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">RE: Brooke: Why is a celebrity who has struggled with highly publicized postpartum depression issues in the past, now the spokesperson for people who make irrational decisions regarding kids, in order to help sell automobiles?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I hate to say it, but this occured to me, too (the post-partum thing, not the allegedly irrational decision). But, then, I just chalked it up to thinking too much. I've stopped now.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">VW: I think the purpose of those ads is not necessarily to make sense, but to present the product and generate discussion about the ad, so that the product sticks...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">...and here we are.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I feel so used!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If anyone has the answer to this problem, I have my publisher's number.: Have every newspaper agree to move to online and charge money to access it. It doesn&quot;t work if one or two or 10 papers do it. It will only work if every major newspaper does it. If that doesn't work then I'm afraid there will be a song in 10- 20 years that reaches number one on the charts called &quot;Internet killed the organized news collecting source.&quot; It will be all the rage in the clubs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Hahahaha...You are entirely right. EVERY newspaper has to make the same move at once (antitrust! antitrust!) for everyone to benefit equally. Not gonna happen.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.: Well, the whole point of the progressive tax code (which we've always had by the way) is that the people who make more money pay higher taxes. That spreading the wealth seems like a pretty good idea to me, and I suspect to most people. While it fires up McCain's base I think the moderates are scratching their heads.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I'm gonna get killed for saying this, but I don't know why politicians regularly tear down the very notion of paying taxes. It's a dirty word. It's also (duh!) a necessity. I'm not advocating anyone's tax plans here, but you'd think from some of the campaign rhetoric that paying ANY taxes is a terrible idea.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Atlanta: That VW minivan is a repurposed Dodge and looks it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Anyone remember the Vanagon? One of VW's lesser hits, I think.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mayberry, N.C.: We call Andy Griffith the nuclear bomb of N.C. politics. He doesn't endorse often, but when he does KA-BOOM, it's all over.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I guess this means Obama's going to take N.C. next week. The Andy Index says it is so.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But instead, we're focusing on the evils of Joe, which is not pertinent to the election.: It's pertinent to him being praised as a role model! By the law and order party, no less. If you want lower taxes, you legislate them, not refuse to pay (thereby spreading the obligatino to other people to pay for your roads.) Talk about spreading the wealth.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: True. If he's your role model, you have to take some responsibility for the company you keep.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Foggy Bottom, Washington, D.C.: Paul, why isn't there a Wiki entry on you? I feel like the whole pop culture experience is incomplete!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I'm planning to bypass Wikipedia altogether and go straight to the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame. I'm hoping that my tragic lack of musical talent doesn't affect my entry.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Orlando TV Anchor and Joe Biden ( YouTube)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: That was nuts, wasn't it? She had four minutes of satellite time with Biden, and I guess she was going to make the most of it. Now she's got her 15 minutes of fame.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Folks, time to go back to the real world (darn it). Next week, the chat is scheduled for Election Day and I'm not sure if we'll be interrupted for some very special programming (Election Day seems to be a big deal around here). So stay tuned for further announcements, if any. In the meantime, a big shout out to everyone. Regards to all!...Paul.</span></p>
