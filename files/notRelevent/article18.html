  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">FIGHTING IN CONGO STIRS FEAR</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That Instability Could Spread</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The relatively small-scale bush fighting in Congo over the last week has attracted intense diplomatic activity. The reason is that violence in Congo, a vast country that borders nine nations in the heart of Africa, usually ends up involving its neighbors. And many foreign officials believe that if Congo collapses, it will drag other countries down with it. PAGE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">CHINA CRACKS DOWN ON TAINTED FEED</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Facing growing concern that China's animal feed industry could be contaminated by an industrial chemical, regulators there said that they had confiscated and destroyed more than 3,600 tons of the animal feed tainted with the substance, called melamine. The government also said it closed 238 feed makers in a series of sweeps that involved more than 369,000 government inspectors. PAGE A8 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">LIBYAN LEADER VISITS RUSSIA</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In his first visit to the region since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the leader of Libya, visited Moscow over the weekend for talks on oil and natural gas deals. The trip to Russia came just months after he met with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and it suggested that Colonel Qaddafi is maneuvering to play Russia and the United States against each other for commercial and political favors.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">THE TALIBAN'S WIDENING SHADOW</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fear of the Taliban and other militant groups has trickled down to Lahore, Pakistan, long considered the country's cultural and intellectual capital. Lahore's liberal and tolerant outlook has been under attack from Taliban-style moral policing, and anonymous threats have led many shopkeepers to stop selling their wares. ''We didn't want to take any chances,'' one trader said. PAGE A8</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ISRAEL TO HALT SETTLEMENT FINANCING</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ehud Olmert, the departing prime minister of Israel, announced several measures in response to a rise in violence by extremist Jewish settlers in the West Bank. One of those measures included halting all direct or indirect government financing of illegal outposts -- an acknowledgment that public money was still being spent on the outposts.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">DELEGATES DEFECT FROM A.N.C.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The events of this weekend may go down in South African history as a watershed: a time when 6,400 political delegates from around the nation defected and charted a new course that loosened the African National Congress's grip on government power. Then again, the movement might turn out to be a flop, a lot of batting of wings without sustained takeoff. PAGE A11</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On the Floor of Battle</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It is still the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, still the center of the amorphous, temperamental, life-altering thing called ''Wall Street.'' But it is quieter now, the humor is not quite as black, and the brokers are a dwindling bunch. Not all leave of their own volition. This Land, by Dan Barry. PAGE A12</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">GOVERNOR SAID TO BE CLEARED</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gov. Jim Gibbons of Nevada has been cleared by the Justice Department of any wrongdoing in connection with an inquiry into whether he helped a friend win defense contracts in exchange for gifts, his lawyer said. The lawyer, Abbe D. Lowell, said the investigation spanned 18 months and began when a former staff member of a technology company run by a friend of the governor made accusations of influence peddling.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">FOR PALIN, A TENDER CONNECTION</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Among the many drawn to see Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, are those who come because they see in her an advocate for children with special needs. Ms. Palin, 44, is herself the mother of a child with Down syndrome. The families look to her not only because of her promise of improved policies, but because she offers a connection to their struggles and needs. PAGE A19</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WELCOME TO A GAWKERS' PARADISE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As he does every year to celebrate the day Nevada became a state, Dr. Lonnie Hammargren opened his house to the public on Sunday. Once a one-story house, it now has three floors and is attached to houses on each side that Dr. Hammargren has bought and similarly overloaded with a lifetime of acquisitions fit for a proud, eccentric pack rat. ''Eclectic'' does not begin to describe it. PAGE A13</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">MILTON KATSELAS, 75</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">An iconoclastic acting teacher whose 30 years in Hollywood raised him to guru status in the eyes of hundreds of actors, many of them famous. He was a pragmatist who declared himself open to any and all acting theories if they got results. PAGE A29</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">RABBI MOSHE COTEL, 65</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">An acclaimed pianist and composer whose works were often infused with themes emanating from his deep Jewish roots, a weave of influences that only later in life led him to the pulpit. Rabbi Cotel was ordained five years ago and since then had been spiritual leader of Temple Beth El in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn. PAGE A29</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wall Street's Political Tea Leaves</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Market forecasters like to find a link between presidential election results and the stock market. Some have pointed out that declines in the market immediately before voting generally favor the challenging party. Some research shows that stocks tend to do better the day after a Republican presidential victory. Other data shows that, over time, stocks perform better under Democratic administrations. Or maybe there is no connection at all. PAGE B1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A NEW MEDIA LANDSCAPE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Consider that when Senator John Kerry ran against President Bush in 2004, YouTube did not exist to host candid videos of politicians (like the clip of Barack Obama and a voter, above), The Huffington Post had not yet debuted, and Facebook barely reached beyond the Ivy League. But when election returns start coming in on Tuesday night, the expanded number of new-media options available for getting the newswill even include some old-media entries. PAGE B1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">TELEVISION AS COMFORT FOOD</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">CBS, which supposedly does not fixate on the 18- to 49-year-old demographic, has twice as many shows in the Top 20 among young adult viewers as any of its network competitors. Its lineup -- of police procedurals where the criminals always get caught and sitcoms that are reliably funny in unchallenging ways -- seems to be becoming a safe haven for viewers worried about their jobs and mortgages. PAGE B1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A GROWING INTERNET AD PIE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Local advertisers are expected to spend $12.9 billion online this year, almost five times what they spent in 2004, according to Borrell Associates, a local media research firm. Small businesses are helping drive the growth, and some newspapers are changing their approach in hope of capturing a bigger portion of the sales. PAGE B6</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">THE END OF THE RIDE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Among those who are not looking forward to the end of the election season are the staff members, variously called ''campaign embeds'' or ''off-air reporters,'' that news media outlets hire to shadow candidates during the campaign. They may end up with great tales to tell, a great resume filler -- and no job. PAGE B10</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shows Signs of a Comeback</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After decades of decline, commercial shipping has returned to the Erie Canal, though it is a far cry from the canal's heyday. The number of shipments rose to 42 so far this year during the season the canal is open, from 15 during last year's season. Once nearly forgotten, the relic of history has shown signs of life as higher fuel prices have made barges an attractive alternative to trucks. PAGE A23</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">TURNING TO CONGRESS FOR HELP</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some 600 other survivors of Nazi Germany and Vichy France, so far unsuccessful in a federal lawsuit that accuses the national French railroad of carrying more than 72,000 Jews and thousands of others to Nazi camps, have pinned their hopes on a bill in Congress that would permit their class-action suit to go forward.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ylon Schwartz beat out more than 6,800 competitors to get to the finals in the World Series of Poker Main Event, which is considered the unofficial world championship. Even the last-place finisher will take home $900,000. It is a far cry from the day he won $340 by managing to throw a lemon across Church Street from Liberty Plaza and onto the roof of a Burger King near the World Trade Center. PAGE A26</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And Winning Football Games</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mike Leach is a law school graduate who never played football in college and is given to conversations that have nothing to do with the game. He is also coach of the Texas Tech football team, which scored the biggest victory in its history, beating the nation's No. 1 team, Texas, on Saturday night. And with just two years remaining on his contract, he could become one of the most sought-after candidates for coaching jobs at places like Clemson and Washington. PAGE D1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">LIFE WITHOUT BASEBALL</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eight years into his retirement from baseball, Jim Leyritz has been shunned by the Yankees. The nearly $11 million he earned as a player is gone, as is his lucrative speaking career. He is awaiting trial in Florida on charges of manslaughter and driving under the influence of alcohol after a fatal crash in December. But not every detail of his life fits the fable of the self-destructive athlete. PAGE D1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">GUARD PASSES IN WOMEN'S TENNIS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A year ago Justine Henin and Maria Sharapova played one of the best finals in the 36-year history of the women's season-ending championships. But when the Sony Ericsson Championships begin on Tuesday in Doha, Qatar, neither Henin nor Sharapova will be in the eight-woman field. PAGE D8</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">PROFESSORS' LIBERALISM CONTAGIOUS? NEW STUDIES SAY PROBABLY NOT</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">An article of faith among conservative critics of American universities has been that liberal professors politically indoctrinate their students. A few weeks ago Michael Barone, a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, warned in The Washington Times that ''the liberal thugocracy'' seems to be taking ''marching orders'' from ''college and university campuses.'' But three new studies have found such worries to be overwrought. The three sets of researchers concluded that professors have virtually no impact on the political views of their students.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">GIVING VOICE TO MANY, AND HIMSELF</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Studs Terkel's radio voice was unforgettable, as if each phrase scraped the ear with a scoop of gravel. What remains in memory, too, is the earnestness that could turn both fervent and sentimental, Edward Rothstein writes of Mr. Terkel, who died last week. And there was the music -- jazz and blues that often provided a respite from the trademark persona. But what Mr. Rothstein remembers of Mr. Terkel's radio shows in Chicago is that even though Mr. Terkel had some terrific guests, he rarely stood aside. PAGE C1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">CELLO FAILS TO FIND HIGH SUITOR</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It was a remarkable cello, with an equally remarkable pedigree, and by all accounts it was primed to draw a record price as serious bidding began on the Web site of Tarisio, auctioneers of fine stringed instruments and bows. There was the first bid, $1.35 million. And then there was silence. When the auction ended, there was only that first bid, which was lower than the cello's confidential reserve price. The 1717 cello, one of only 60 or so made by Antonio Stradivari, went unsold. PAGE C3</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">SEX, DEATH AND CABARET</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Karen Kohler's new two-act show, ''Little Death: Songs of Coming and Going,'' at the Zipper Factory on 37th Street in New York, is as cosmopolitan a work of musical theater as the critic Stephen Holden can remember. ''Little Death'' fearlessly blurs the lines separating cabaret, theater and rock 'n' roll, he writes, and Ms. Kohler is a performer who stretches her resources to their limits and sometimes beyond. Between the first act, ''Sex Act,'' and the second, ''Death Act,'' she transforms from a prowling seductress with her hair loose to a more demure mourner. PAGE C2</span></p>

The focal point, whether conveying tragedy or comedy, is Ms. Govind's searing, kohl-lined eyes.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">President Bush will be the lamest of ducks by Nov. 15, when leaders of 20 nations meet in Washington to discuss the global financial crisis. But the meeting cannot wait. The global economic powers need to air their concerns, and global markets need to see that political leaders are ready to work together to restore stability.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The next president, according to the prevailing wisdom, will have to make hard choices: between increasing public spending and reducing the deficit, between improving regulation and protecting free markets. In an Op-Ed article, Robert E. Rubin and Jared Bernstein write that these decisions, in many important ways, should not be viewed as tradeoffs. PAGE A27</span></p>
