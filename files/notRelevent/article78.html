  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This is the Obama infomercial!&quot; Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama conceded to Jon Stewart on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; last night of his 30-minute time buy on CBS, NBC, Fox, MSNBC, Univision, BET and TV One.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a satellite interview that aired three hours after Obama's half-hour message to the American public, the senator told the late-night cable-show host that he hoped people would come away with the feeling that &quot;this election is really important&quot; and that the four struggling families profiled in the infomercial would remind them of someone they know.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;At this stage, everything that needs to be said probably has been heard by a lot of voters,&quot; Obama acknowledged.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">All day long, Barack Obamavision had been on the minds of the made-for-TV navel-gazers in the small-screen firmament. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Most of them had some fun with that clip of Obama's GOP rival, John McCain, mocking the time buy:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He's measuring the drapes, and he's planning his first address to the nation, an infomercial. By the way, I will never delay the start of the World Series for an infomercial.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fox News Channel reported that &quot;tonight it's almost all Obama all the time -- on Fox, CBS, Univision, NBC and three other TV stations. Starting at 8 p.m., Barack Obama will star in the largest campaign buy in history -- a last-minute, 30-minute plea to undecided voters and a living testament to his campaign's deep pockets.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama camp's purchase of time on the major broadcast networks -- ABC excepted -- and several cable networks, reportedly cost $3 million to $5 million.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On CNN, Jessica Yellin reported breathlessly that Obama would be &quot;interrupting prime time for millions of Americans.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On ABC News's &quot;Good Morning America,&quot; they trotted out clips of Elisabeth Hasselbeck discussing the time buy with sometime-ABC News-journalist Barbara Walters on Babs's Sirius satellite radio show, &quot;Barbara Live&quot;:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Babs: He's got the money and he wants to win.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Hasselbeck: That to me is, in terms of the economy -- that is repulsive.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Just to make sure we're clear here:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">1. ABC News</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">2. Covering the campaign strategy of a presidential candidate -- the country's historic first African American major-party presidential candidate</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">3. Using quotes from former &quot;Survivor&quot; contestant turned daytime-TV hostess</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">4. And, again, not to put too fine a point on it -- ABC News.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Back in the comfort of her own show, ABC's syndicated &quot;The View,&quot; Hasselbeck toned it down a bit. &quot;I just think at this point to spend $1 million per network on this ad seems a little excessive,&quot; she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It bothers me a bit we can't ask him -- it's a 30-minute ad. . . . People I think have a lot of questions, especially now, given his spread-the-wealth conversation,&quot; Hasselbeck told the other Ladies of &quot;The View.&quot; (Babs was noticeably missing, though it's also her show.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Moderator Whoopi Goldberg explained, slowly, to Hasselbeck that when people contribute to Obama's campaign, &quot;that money is not meant to be given to the person to go and give to charity. . . . That is to get out [the candidate's] word. And he's doing it. And I think you can't fault the guy. I'm pretty sure if John McCain had the opportunity and the dough, he would probably do the same thing, as most candidates would.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;But Barack broke his promise -- he said he'd take public financing,&quot; Hasselbeck whined.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;That's the point you want to make. The point that I am making is that the people gave him this money to do exactly what he's doing with it,&quot; Whoopi shot back.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;GMA&quot; also trotted out footage of the last presidential candidate to make campaign time buys: billionaire Ross Perot in 1992, making his case by using flow charts, to which he pointed with a &quot;voodoo stick&quot; Perot said had been sent to him by some lady.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's unclear that Senator Obama will use flow charts or not,&quot; ABC News's senior national correspondent Jake Tapper told viewers at home.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nice.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tapper also noted that Obama was running a grave &quot;oversaturation&quot; risk, because his 30-minute message to voters will appear on three whole broadcast networks and a handful of cable nets, not to mention a same-day sit-down on ABC's own evening newscast and an appearance on Comedy Central's &quot;The Daily Show.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Over at NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show, Chris Matthews likened the time buy to the election-eve speech John F. Kennedy delivered from Faneuil Hall in Boston 48 years ago, and said what Obama needs to do in his 30 minutes is make white men feel better.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The toughest thing that neither candidate has really done yet, and Barack included, they haven't really gone to the American male -- white male, if you want to put it that way, brutally -- and said to them, 'Look, you've got a tough row to hoe. . . . You take pride in providing for your family and putting food on the table and maybe getting the kids into college. . . . I'm going to help you do it. I'm not going to get in the way with high taxes. . . . I'm going to be one of your helpers. I'm not going to get in your way,' &quot; Matthews said Obama needs to say.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">CBS's &quot;The Early Show&quot; went out and found two former White House gofers -- Dee Dee Myers and Dan Bartlett -- to debate the merits of the time buy. Myers, who was an aide to Bill Clinton, noted this is the first time a real contender for president has had the resources to make a time buy across three broadcast networks and multiple cable nets. Bartlett, a former George W. Bush aide, said Obama ran the risk of looking like he thinks he already has the job, &quot;taking over network time like this.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">During his one-on-one with Obama for the ABC evening newscast, Charlie Gibson was not joined by Hasselbeck, and he did not talk to Obama over his Skinny Glasses of Intimidation and did not ask him to explain the Bush Doctrine. Instead, Gibson asked Obama such penetrating questions as: &quot;Finish this sentence: 'On November 5, I'm so happy I won't have to . . .' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(Obama went with &quot;pack.&quot;)</span></p>
