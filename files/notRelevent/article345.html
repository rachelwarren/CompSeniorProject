  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I've been covering John McCain steadily for a decade. A few years ago, I worked on a book, which I foolishly never completed, on the U.S. Senate with McCain as the central character. So when I step back and think of McCain, even in the heat of this campaign, I still think of him first in the real world of governing, not in the show-business world of the election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I think first of the personal qualities. He was an unfailingly candid man. When other politicians described a meeting, they always ended up the heroes of the story. But McCain would always describe the meeting straight, emphasizing his own failings with more vigor than his accomplishments. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He is, for a politician, a humble man. The most important legacy of his prisoner-of-war days is that he witnessed others behaving more heroically than he did. This experience has given him a basic honesty when appraising himself. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> His mood darkened as the Iraq war deteriorated, but his accomplishments mounted. I don't think any senator had as impressive a few years as McCain did during this span of time.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He lobbied relentlessly for a change of strategy in Iraq, holding off the tide that would have had us accept defeat and leave Iraq to its genocide. He negotiated a complicated immigration bill with Ted Kennedy. He helped organize the Gang of 14 and helped save the Senate from polarized Armageddon over judicial nominations.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He voted against opportunist bills like the pork-laden energy package and the prescription drug plan. He led a crusade against Jack Abramoff and the sleaze-meisters in his own party and exposed corrupt Pentagon contracts.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I could fill this column with his accomplishments during this period, and not even mention the insights. At a defense conference in Munich, I saw him diagnose and confront Russian hegemony. Week after week, I saw him dissent from G.O.P. colleagues as their party lost its way.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Some people who cover the campaign seem to have no knowledge of anything but the campaign, but I can't get these events -- which were real and required the constant application of judgment, honor and courage -- out of my head. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Do I wish he was running a different campaign? Yes. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It's not that he has changed his political personality that bothers me. I've come to accept that in this media-circus environment, you simply cannot run for president as a candid, normal person.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Nor is it, primarily, the dishonest ads he is running. My friends in the Obama cheering section get huffy about them, while filtering from their consciousness all the dishonest ads Obama has run -- the demagogic DHL ad, the insulting computer ad, the cynical Rush Limbaugh ad, the misleading Social Security ad and so on. If one candidate has sunk lower than the other at this point, I've lost track.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> No, what disappoints me about the McCain campaign is it has no central argument. I had hoped that he would create a grand narrative explaining how the United States is fundamentally unprepared for the 21st century and how McCain's worldview is different. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> McCain has not made that sort of all-encompassing argument, so his proposals don't add up to more than the sum of their parts. Without a groundbreaking argument about why he is different, he's had to rely on tactical gimmicks to stay afloat. He has no frame to organize his response when financial and other crises pop up. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He has no overarching argument in part because of his Senate training and the tendency to take issues on one at a time -- in part, because of the foolish decision to run a traditional right-left campaign against Obama and, in part, because McCain has never really resolved the contradiction between the Barry Goldwater and Teddy Roosevelt sides of his worldview. One day he's a small-government Western conservative; the next he's a Bull Moose progressive. The two don't add up -- as we've seen in his uneven reaction to the financial crisis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Nonetheless, when people try to tell me that the McCain on the campaign trail is the real McCain and the one who came before was fake, I just say, baloney. I saw him. A half-century of evidence is there.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> If McCain is elected, he will retain his instinct for the hard challenge. With that Greatest Generation style of his, he will run the least partisan administration in recent times. He is not a sophisticated conceptual thinker, but he is a good judge of character. He is not an organized administrator, but he has become a practiced legislative craftsman. He is, above all -- and this is completely impossible to convey in the midst of a campaign -- a serious man prone to serious things.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Amid the stupidity of this season, it seemed worth stepping back to recall the fundamentals -- about McCain today and Obama on some other day in the near future. </span></p>
