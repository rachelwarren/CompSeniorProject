  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A confused-looking Richard Nixon asked, ''Sock it to me?'' (emphasis on the ''me,'' not the ''sock'') on ''Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In'' during the 1968 presidential campaign, flinging open the door for candidates to troll for votes in nontraditional ways. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> So, two years after Senator Barack Obama played a Halloween guest (wearing an Obama mask) at the Clintons' costume party on ''Saturday Night Live'' -- and a few days after Senator John McCain hosted a faux QVC sale of campaign gewgaws, also on ''SNL'' -- it is a natural evolution of the electoral process that the two presidential candidates would star on election eve at halftime of ESPN's ''Monday Night Football.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> No late-night rallies could place them in front of as many supporters as the 12 million or so who were expected to watch the Steelers-Redskins game.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The surprise wasn't that Obama and McCain accepted ESPN's request (they also taped interviews with Jim Gray for CBS Radio/Westwood One's ''Monday Night'' pregame and postgame shows). </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The surprise was that it took this long to so explicitly mix football and the presidential race on ''Monday Night,'' which has been alive through 10 elections.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Maybe in the past, there was a desire to keep the election separate and not turn 'Monday Night' political,'' said Norby Williamson, an executive vice president of ESPN, which is in its first presidential election cycle with ''Monday Night.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Two members of ABC Sports' former ''Monday Night'' team said that in their time it would have been the place of ABC News to do presidential interviews. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''ABC News obviously would have had first dibs on presidential politics,'' said Fred Gaudelli, the former producer, who now produces NBC's ''Sunday Night Football'' games. Al Michaels, who called ABC's games from 1986 to 2005 before heading to NBC, said, ''ABC News had election eve specials, and I'm sure they would have wanted to ride herd on something like this.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Williamson said that ABC News was supportive of ESPN's monthslong pursuit of the Obama and McCain interviews and offered to promote them on ''World News Tonight.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> McCain and Obama will not be in the ESPN booth, unlike the celebrities the network paraded in front of viewers in 2006 and 2007 before realizing that the game was more important than Christian Slater. Instead, Chris Berman, working from ESPN's studios in Bristol, Conn., interviewed Obama first Monday afternoon, from Jacksonville, Fla.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Berman spoke next with McCain, who was in Indianapolis. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The order that they ran, at about 10:10 p.m. Eastern, was determined during a coin flip by Kordell Stewart, the former Steeler who is an ESPN analyst. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''He said, 'Heads, Obama; tails, McCain,' '' Williamson said. It came up heads. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The interviews were cut into three-minute segments separated by a 30-second commercial. Berman did not give either man a Bermanian nickname, so there was no need to worry about its presidential respectability. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ESPN, of course, promoted the interviews thusly: ''Obama! McCain! Boomer!'' Imagine a 1960 equivalent, CBS-style: ''Kennedy! Nixon! Uncle Walter!''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> McCain played ESPN's game, using a Berman phrase to answer the question about what he wanted people to think about him as they voted.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''He. Could. Go. All. The. Way to the White House,'' McCain said, moving Berman to abandon the sober demeanor he had adopted.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Both candidates talked about high school coaches, one who taught Obama that ''this isn't about you, it's about the team,'' and one who guided McCain to appreciate literature and to ''do the honorable thing even when nobody's looking.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Obama said he advocated a college football playoff (he told Gray, jokingly, that it would be ''one of my legislative priorities''); McCain wants to take ''significant action'' against performance-enhancing drugs. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> This was not Obama's first appearance on ''Monday Night.'' He was the star of its opening segment two years ago before a Chicago Bears-St. Louis Rams game, when he was still teasing the public about a run for the White House. He spoke somberly to the camera about critical questions facing America, as if ready to announce his candidacy. ''I am ready,'' he said, putting a Bears cap on his head, ''for the Bears to go all the way, baby.'' Then he loudly hummed the first four notes of the ''Monday Night'' theme.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Only one man who has become president, Ronald Reagan, visited the ''Monday Night'' booth. Reagan was the governor of California in 1973 when he was spotted in the back of ABC's booth talking football fundamentals to John Lennon, an incongruous sight to any sensate human aware of the men's politics. Grasping the moment, Howard Cosell told Frank Gifford to talk to Reagan, and, ''I'll take the Beatle.''</span></p>
