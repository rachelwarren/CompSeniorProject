  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: Good morning, everyone. Glad to have you all here today.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">St. Paul, Minn.: Hi Lois. It seems like the hoopla surrounding Sarah Palin has died down somewhat, along with the Monday morning quarterbacking that Obama should have gone with Hillary ... but where is Joe Biden? Is there a sense that he's proving to be an effective surrogate for Obama, or is he merely fulfilling the &quot;do no harm&quot; requirement, despite his occasional odd comments (i.e. criticizing ads from his own party)?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: See the ad at The Post's new Political Browser, a rundown of the biggest and best stories of the day from across the Web.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: Biden actually is campaigning very hard across the country, focusing his energy on working-class communities that Obama has trouble connecting with. You may not read about him, but he is getting ample coverage from the local press where he travels. There certainly was some panic among Democrats when Palin was named, but there was never any serious consideration to Obama replacing Biden.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">San Diego: What is the schedule for the vice presidential and presidential debates (i.e. dates, times, TV channels)?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: All debates start at 9 p.m. ET. Presidential: Sept. 26, moderated by Jim Lehrer of PBS; Oct. 7, moderated by Tom Brokaw of NBC; Oct. 15, moderated by Bob Schieffer of CBS. Vice presidential: Oct. 2, moderated by Gwen Ifill of PBS.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: Commission on Presidential Debates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: Dire Consequences: The Post has a headline above the fold which says the administration warns of &quot;dire consequences&quot; if its $700 billion financial solution is not adopted. Didn't it use many of the same words to roll us over to accepting the invasion of Iraq? Do these words and scare tactic fall into the &quot;fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me&quot; department?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Policymakers: Congress Must Move Quickly to Avert Damage (Post, Sept. 24)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: It's because of Iraq that you see lawmakers take a closer look at this package in the light of day. Everyone seems to agree on some level that it's needed, but to what extent the public must pick up the tab for Wall Street and corporations -- while their executives get great golden parachutes -- is being hotly debated.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dunn Loring, Va.: With Obama criticizing Biden's position on the AIG bailout and with Biden criticizing the Obama&nbsp;ad making fun of McCain's inability to use a computer, is there even more talk now of Biden being removed from the vice presidential slot? Is this harping on your running mate indicative of what an Obama administration will look like?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: I don't think we can read too much into it at this point. They were in different locations and it was a fast-moving event, so there wasn't much time to formulate an official campaign policy. I doubt you will see too much more of that moving forward.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Waterville, Maine: Good morning. Joe Biden's comment to Katie Couric that an Obama-Biden campaign ad ridiculing McCain's computer skills, among other things, was &quot;terrible&quot; appears like the kind of gaffe that McCain's team will seize on to say Obama is not a new kind of politician -- even his vice presidential pick is disgusted (or something along those lines). I can imagine that ads are being created as we speak. Two questions: How is the Obama camp -- which has been very disciplined -- going to deal with Biden's off-message remarks? And do you think this has legs, or will the financial industry bailout drown out this impolitic statement as noise?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: The ad seems to have backfired on the Democrats. In addition to it being perceived as simply silly, some blogs are writing that McCain can't use a computer because of the injuries he sustained in Vietnam. Dan Pfeiffer an Obama spokesman explained the ad, saying cyber-security is &quot;one of our most serious national security threats.&quot; It didn't come off in a way that showed &quot;security&quot; to be the issue.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This being said, the McCain campaign has been throwing some very tough stuff at Obama in ads. It's a pretty tough race.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Orono, Maine: The talk of my office the other day was George Will's comments Sunday about John McCain's temperament. Now he's put those thoughts into print and the column will be in our local paper tomorrow. Do you think having a conservative criticize McCain will have an impact on moderate and conservative voters?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: Not particularly. Conservative voters long have been wary of McCain and his temper long has been an issue.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Good morning. I was asked an interesting question yesterday and was hoping you might know the answer: What happens if a candidate has to drop out after they've been nominated? I'm not saying either candidate will/should, but it was a hypothetical, and I couldn't answer. Does the vice presidential pick automatically take up the mantle? Does the party hold an emergency meeting and pick a new candidate based on who got the second-most delegates? Are the rules the same for both parties? Just wondering.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: The only time this has happened is recent political history was when George McGovern dropped Thomas Eagleton from the ticket in 1972, and gave the vice presidential slot to Sargent Shriver after the convention. I believe what happened is that the Democrats then staged what amounted to a mini-nominating convention in Washington for Sargent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anyone out there know more about this?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Salinas, Calif.: Hi Lois. It appears to me that Barak Obama has surrendered his high ground campaign of hope and leadership for the trench warfare that John McCain's advisors have calculated will get them the win (perhaps the only way). Barring a huge Election Day turnout of first-time Democratic and independent voters (the vaunted &quot;ground game&quot;) and a dominating Obama presence in the debate crapshoot, doesn't daily &quot;news&quot; of battleground states leave Democrats with a queasy feeling, a bad deja vu?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: It's a very tough race. One demographic you didn't mention was young voters. Obama did a good job mobilizing them for the primaries; he needs them to vote this time in droves.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Albany, N.Y.: In the world of the pundits, Obama and Biden not walking in lockstep is a major faux pas, but in the rest of the country, it is more likely a sign of two men speaking candidly -- rarely a bad thing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: I agree. They come across as straight-talking in my view.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Massillon, Ohio: In answer to the apparent disappearance of Joe Biden, he was in our area last week, and had big crowds in Wooster and Canton. The local newspapers all had extensive coverage and the television stations in Cleveland covered it. People in this area are much more likely to trust the coverage of our local media than you MSM-ers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: That you for sharing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dunn Loring, Va.: How smart is Biden really? I know he likes to brag about his intelligence, but then he tells Katie Couric that &quot;when the stock market crashed, Franklin Roosevelt got on the television and didn't just talk about the princes of greed.&quot; Does Biden not realize that TV wasn't commercially available in 1929, and that FDR didn't take office until 1933?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: Biden is plenty smart, but like many politicians his mouth gets ahead of him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Raleigh, N.C.: Good morning. The McCain campaign, in its public face, comes across as angry a lot of the time. Are they that way on a personal level?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: No, not really. There are many decent people working there who believe in McCain. I think what you're seeing now is their attack on the media, which the media then covers -- so it seems as if they are angry all the time.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Richmond, Va.: Former President Clinton's appearance on &quot;The View&quot; the other day has been well reviewed across the board, with his admission that his administration made mistakes and that both parties were to blame. While some folks have said this is him being upfront and bipartisan, am I wrong to think that it's another attempt to screw over Obama and take another potentially harmful issue for the GOP off the table?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: To the contrary, he looks open and conciliatory. And that is a welcomed change from the primaries.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Brookline, Mass.: If the McCain campaign says it doesn't care about the media &quot;filter,&quot; why go on such an unhinged tirade against the Times?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: The Fix: Schmidt Hammers the New York Times (washingtonpost.com, Sept. )</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: They care. A critical part of their strategy is to attack the media -- it fires up their base, which hates the media.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: Thank you all for joining me today. I have to sign out a few minutes early to attend a press conference. These are very exciting times -- check in with us early and often.</span></p>
