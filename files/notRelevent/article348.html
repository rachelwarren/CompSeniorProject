  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I knew McCain's let's-skip-the-debate maneuver wasn't drawing applause in some precincts on the right when I heard Laura Ingraham tell her radio audience that this was a &quot;huge mistake,&quot; &quot;gimmicky,&quot; and &quot;the worst thing he could have done.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It was what passes for high drama in Washington -- lawmakers shuttling in and out of meetings, &quot;Breaking News&quot; banners on cable, speculation about whether the deal would get done. Journalists were primarily interested in a) could McCain, Obama, Bush and Paulson rescue the economy from implosion and b) will there be a debate tonight. And not necessarily in that order. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Later in this column: some surprising numbers about the media coverage of Sarah Palin. But first: If McCain's gambit was designed to show him putting politics aside and riding to the rescue to save the economy, it fell flat. Especially since he found time to give a speech at the Clinton Global Initiative and do a round of network-anchor interviews while at least some of his attack ads continued to air. And hopeful noises about a bipartisan deal on the Hill were replaced by squabbling after the White House meeting, when House Repubs unveiled an alternative plan with no public money, ticking off the Dems. So much for McCain's shuttle diplomacy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At this writing, Mississippi remains up in the air.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;With no done deal on the $700 billion Wall Street bailout, John McCain and Barack Obama last night intensified their extraordinary staredown over whether to hold their first presidential debate tonight,&quot; the Boston Globe reports.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Senator John McCain had intended to ride back into Washington on Thursday as a leader who had put aside presidential politics to help broker a solution to the financial crisis. Instead he found himself in the midst of a remarkable partisan showdown, lacking a clear public message for how to bring it to an end,&quot; the NYT says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Not all conservatives razzed McCain for threatening to pull out of Mississippi. Bill Kristol loves the idea:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The rescue package that was so poorly crafted and defended by the Bush administration seemed to be sliding toward defeat. The presidential candidates were on the sidelines, carping and opining and commenting. But one of them, John McCain, intervened suddenly and boldly, taking a risk in order to change the situation, and to rearrange the landscape.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Of course his motives were partly election-related. But 'the interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place.' If candidate McCain, for whatever mixed motives, ends up acting in a way that results in a deal that is viewed as better than the original proposal, and that seems to stabilize the markets and avert a meltdown -- he'll benefit politically, and he deserves to. For McCain will have acted presidentially in the campaign -- which some voters, quite reasonably, will think speaks to his qualifications to be president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;As for the question of Friday night's debate, which some in the media seem to think more important than saving the financial system -- if the negotiations are still going on in D.C., McCain should offer to send Palin to debate Obama! Or he can take a break from the meetings, fly down at the last minute himself, and turn a boring foreign policy debate, in which he and Obama would repeat well-rehearsed arguments, into a discussion about leadership and decisiveness. And if the negotiations are clearly on a path to success, then McCain can say he can now afford to leave D.C., fly down, and the debate would become a victory lap for McCain.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Oh, come on. The debates are just some fetish for media blabbermouths? I was under the impression that 50 million or more Americans wanted to see these two candidates side by side, talking about this issue and others, so they could make an informed decision. Bailouts are important. So is democracy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On the liberal side, Josh Marshall views it as a firing offense:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Look, if you were living in the real world, if you were some hotshot young executive at a Fortune 500 company trying to rise in the ranks, and you pulled some whacked crap like this, it would probably get you blackballed permanently. People would think you were either deeply unreliable or maybe just had a screw loose. And yet here he is -- is he kidding? He can't debate Barack Obama because he's got to go to Washington and save the economy? It's like the biggest 'dog ate my homework' in history.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington Monthly's Steve Benen likens McCain to a Las Vegas high-roller:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;McCain seeks the presidency and gambles in largely the same way -- taking ridiculous risks without regard for consequence. Wednesday's bizarre announcement about 'suspending' the campaign obviously didn't make any sense -- McCain isn't on the Banking Committee, doesn't have any constructive role to play, and has no reason to leave the campaign trail -- but irresponsible risk-takers don't much care about good judgment. They just want to go all in and let it ride.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We saw this dangerous impulse problem last month when McCain made the ridiculous decision to add Sarah Palin to the Republican ticket, and we clearly saw it again Wednesday.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dick Polman reads the Arizona senator's mind:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I want to cut and run from the presidential debate. I wonder if I can get away with this. Or, failing that, I wonder if they'll let me bring Gov. Palin on stage to stand beside me at the lectern. The crowds seem to like her . . . No wait, I have a better idea. There's no way Palin can be adequately prepped for her scheduled debate next Thursday; her learning curve is way too steep. So I'm simply gonna suggest that we reschedule the first presidential debate for next Thursday -- and that way I can keep her under wraps until whenever. If the press whines about all this, I'll just remind everyone that I always put country first.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now for a new study, unveiled here for the first time, that counters the impression the media have been kicking the stuffing out of Sarah Palin. The Center for Media and Public Affairs says Palin got better coverage than Obama and McCain from Aug. 23 to Sept. 12 -- at least on the three network newscasts and Fox's &quot;Special Report.&quot; On the ABC, CBS and NBC programs, 74 percent of the evaluations of Palin were positive, as were 60 percent on the first half of Brit Hume's show (the study evaluated only the first, news-oriented half of Humes's show).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">CBS's Chip Reid, for instance, reported that Palin &quot;has earned a reputation in Alaska as a tough and fearless reformer.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By contrast, McCain's coverage was 40 percent positive on the nets and 55 percent positive on the Fox show. Obama stories were 56 percent positive on the networks and just 29 percent positive on Fox. That means, according to the center, that McCain's coverage was nearly twice as positive as Obama's on &quot;Special Report.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">During that period, Palin was the subject of 77 network stories, McCain 71 and Obama 39. Joe Biden: five.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here's my report on part two of the Katie interview. Americablog's John Aravosis is popping a few veins over Palin:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;John McCain is willing to risk the stewardship of our country, should he die in office, to a person who is unqualified and untested, and who has already shown outward signs of being something of an idiot. Nothing is less honorable, less heroic, than that. And McCain's staff made clear to Howie Kurtz that it wasn't going to change.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot; ' I know the media is throwing a temper tantrum about this,' [McCain spokesman Michael] Goldfarb said. But, he said, 'she was so beat up the first week when she came on and this campaign has had fraught relations with the media ever since. There's just not a tremendous amount of concern. The campaign is resolved not to allow the media to dictate her schedule. . . . This is mainly an inside-the-Beltway issue.'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;So vetting our possible future president, testing whether she even has a brain, let alone is qualified to lead America during war time and economic crisis, is 'an inside-the-Beltway issue.' Thus is the arrogance of the self-defined hero.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After watching the first part of the Couric interview, Salon's Glenn Greenwald can hardly believe it:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I'll be honest: watching this, I actually felt sorry for Sarah Palin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I still think Palin is probably perfectly smart. And in this age of dynastic and nepotistic political power centers in both parties, I admire the fact that she created her political career out of nothing . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;But Sarah Palin's performance in the tiny vignettes of unscripted dialogue in which we've been allowed to see her has been nothing short of frightening -- really, as I said, pity-inducing. And I say that as someone who has thought from the start that the criticisms of her abilities -- as opposed to her ideology -- were much too extreme. One of two things is absolutely clear at this point: she is either (a) completely ignorant about the most basic political issues -- a vacant, ill-informed, incurious know-nothing, or (b) aggressively concealing her actual beliefs about these matters because she's petrified of deviating from the simple-minded campaign talking points she's been fed and/or because her actual beliefs are so politically unpalatable, even when taking into account the right-wing extremism that is permitted, even rewarded, in our mainstream. I'm not really sure which is worse, but it doesn't really matter, because with 40 days left before the election, both options are heinous.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Conservative Dallas Morning News columnist Rod Dreher, who declared after her convention speech that &quot;this Iron Lady is not about to quail before the judgment of her would-be betters,&quot; is now aghast:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Palin is mediocre, again, regurgitating talking points mechanically, not thinking. Palin's just babbling. She makes George W. Bush sound like Cicero . . . I am well and truly embarrassed for her. I think she's a good woman who might well be a great governor of Alaska. But good grief, just watch this train wreck.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In what may be the sleaziest ad of the season, Democracy for America is showing closeups of McCain's scarred face while two doctors say, &quot;Melanoma is the deadliest of skin cancers and the chances of survival if you have melanoma spread through a five-year period are very, very slim.&quot; Will Obama and his allies denounce it?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And in other Palin news, the WP reports: &quot;Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who has made a crackdown on gift-giving to state officials a centerpiece of her ethics reform agenda, has accepted gifts valued at $25,367 from industry executives, municipalities and a cultural center whose board includes officials from some of the largest mining interests in the state, a review of state records shows.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Remember when some of us thought this campaign would be different? Politico's John Harris and Jim VandeHei offer reasons &quot;why American politics is stuck in a rut&quot;:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot; Media madness. Reporters complain about the lack of spontaneity in politics. Then we punish spontaneity by ensuring that any impolitic comment gets played and replayed, often simplified and distorted in each replaying--usually accompanied with disapproving analysis about a candidate's lack of discipline and inability to stay on message. The lack of press access to both candidates this fall is frustrating. But the truth is McCain would be foolish to indulge in the kind of free-flowing, free-associating conversations that won such notice in 2000.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Obama's natural instincts are to tightly control his image and words, which works nicely in this media environment. An unscripted campaign would be more interesting and more useful to voters, but it would require two unlikely ingredients: Candidates self-confident enough to throw out the script, and a news media that would devote as much attention to ideas as to gaffes . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot; Conventional politics works. This is the ugly truth of politics: the predictable tactics of modern campaigns are often brutally effective. Both candidates promised to run cleaner campaigns.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The chatter has died down since Obama blipped up in the polls, but Jonah Goldberg objects to a race-based analysis that's been making the rounds:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The news media have been shamefully stoking the idea that the only way Barack Obama could possibly lose the presidential election is if American racists have their way. Indeed, the fact that Obama isn't leading in polls by a wide margin 'doesn't make sense . . . unless it's race,' says CNN's Jack Cafferty. Slate's Jacob Weisberg says Obama is losing among older white voters because of the 'color of his skin.'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Many journalists are so committed to the racism-explains-everything line they are labeling any effective anti-Obama ad as an attempt by John McCain to 'viciously exacerbate' America's 'race-fueled angst,' in the words of one New York magazine writer. For example, a McCain&nbsp;ad noted that Franklin Raines, the Clinton-appointed former head of Fannie Mae who helped bring about the current Wall Street meltdown, advised the Obama campaign. Time's Karen Tumulty gasped that because Raines is black, McCain is playing the race card . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;According to critics, McCain's 'celebrity' ads featuring Paris Hilton and Britney Spears were nothing but tawdry race-baiting because they subliminally played on white America's fear of black men violating the delicate flowers of white American womanhood. You'd think a cognitive warning bell would have gone off the moment anyone started suggesting that Paris Hilton and Britney Spears are icons of chastity.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This spectacle is grotesque. It reveals how little the supposedly objective press corps thinks of the American people -- and how highly they think of themselves . . . and Obama. Obama's lack of experience, his doctrinaire liberalism, his record, his known associations with Weatherman radical William Ayers and the hate-mongering Rev. Jeremiah Wright: These cannot possibly be legitimate motivations to vote against Obama, in this view.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yet another issue I never imagined becoming part of the presidential campaign: witchcraft.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;A grainy YouTube video surfaced Wednesday showing Sarah Palin being blessed in her hometown church three years ago by a Kenyan pastor who prayed for her protection from 'witchcraft' as she prepared to seek higher office.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The video shows Palin standing before Bishop Thomas Muthee in the pulpit of the Wasilla Assembly of God church, holding her hands open as he asked Jesus Christ to keep her safe from 'every form of witchcraft.'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot; 'Come on, talk to God about this woman. We declare, save her from Satan,' Muthee said as two attendants placed their hands on Palin's shoulders. 'Make her way my God. Bring finances her way even for the campaign in the name of Jesus . . . Use her to turn this nation the other way around.' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I'm anxiously waiting for reporters to find out Joe Biden's position on witchcraft.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">An update on a woman I wrote about whose romantic e-mails to a school official she was covering, Alberto Carvalho, hit the Miami press:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;A former Miami Herald education reporter implicated in a romantic relationship with a top Miami-Dade schools official has resigned from her post at The Boston Globe, according to a Globe spokesman. 'Tania deLuzuriaga has resigned to pursue other opportunities,' said Bob Powers.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Still no comment from deLuzuriaga; she's been less available than Sarah Palin.</span></p>
