  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Voting for the black man does not come easy to Nick Piroli. He is the first to admit that. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> To the sound of bowling balls smacking pins, as the bartender in the Fallout Shelter queues up more Buds, this retired steelworker wrestles with this election and his choice. A couple of friends, he says, will not vote for Senator Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I'm no racist, but I'm not crazy about him either,'' said Mr. Piroli, 77. ''I don't know, maybe 'cause he's black.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He winces at himself. ''We was raised and worked with the black, the Serb,'' he said. ''It was a regular league of nations. And the economy now, it's terrible.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I've got to vote for him,'' he said finally.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Him? ''The Democrat, Obama,'' Mr. Piroli replied. ''I can't be stupid.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama's Republican rival in the presidential campaign, Senator John McCain, has placed a sizable electoral bet that he can sweep predominantly white, working-class Beaver County and a dozen more Pennsylvania counties like it. Last week, Mr. McCain spoke before thousands in Moon Township, and two days later his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, drew more than 2,000 fans to a rally in Beaver.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But to walk the back streets of the Beaver River mill cities -- the biggest mills were long ago shuttered -- and to visit rural hamlets like Economy and Hookstown is to hear more than a few Democrats saying they intend, however reluctantly, to support their party's standard-bearer, particularly as the world economy cracks and heaves. Many Democrats, and a few independents, wonder if Mr. McCain is too old and Ms. Palin too unsophisticated to take his place. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Such sentiments could bode ill for Mr. McCain, who hopes for a surprise victory in Pennsylvania to rescue his presidential bid. And they dovetail with poll findings that show a gravitation of white voters, female and male, toward Mr. Obama's camp. To try to stanch that flow and tap into doubts about Mr. Obama, Mr. McCain will return to the state on Monday for the second time in a week and then appear on Tuesday with Ms. Palin as they try to sway voters like Mr. Piroli.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain may have an opening: 35 interviews over three days offer up a conversation about race and presidential choices, and that is where the greatest uncertainty lies for Mr. Obama. Sometimes race talk runs like a subterranean river. Sometimes it floats right on the surface.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Ambridge, a Beaver River factory town named after the company that gave it fame -- American Bridge -- Olga Permon, a 71-year-old steelworker's widow and a lifelong Democrat, climbs the stoop of her yellow-brick home. She considers the field: Mr. McCain? A grouchy old man. Ms. Palin? Please. No way. What about Mr. Obama?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Her pause goes on and on. ''He scares me,'' Mrs. Permon said. ''The coloreds are excited, but my friends and I plan to write in Hillary's name.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> These are not gentle lands for Mr. Obama. A visit here in August found even deeper suspicions of him in Beaver County, where Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton beat him by 40 percentage points in the Democratic primary. Democrats outnumber Republicans, but voters here tilt either way in presidential elections. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Still, a worsening economy has worked to the Democrats' advantage. Mr. Obama and his running mate, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., drew 8,000 to a rally in Beaver a month ago; John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, stumped on Saturday in Beaver; and many dozens of union members go door to door each weekend, rounding up votes. They remind their fellow workers that Mr. McCain had supported privatization of Social Security, a move they say could have left worker retirement accounts trapped in a plummeting stock market.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''This is McCain's Hail Mary; they looked at the huge margin here for Hillary Clinton in the primary and figured, 'Hmm, we have a shot,' '' said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin &amp; Marshall College, in Lancaster. ''But it's going to be very difficult here for him to get the margins needed to offset the cities and the eastern suburbs.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Ambridge, Vince Pisano, 47, a union plumber, reflects that challenge. As he sits on his porch, he considers collapses -- of the economy and his retirement account. He is firm for Mr. Obama, but he is in a small club. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Close friends, real close, tell me they can't get past his race,'' said Mr. Pisano, flashing his give-me-a-break look. ''If Obama were white, this would be a landslide around here.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Beaver was known as the cake-eater's town. Steel management lived here, and its elegant Edwardian and Victorian homes, with oak and mahogany beams, lend a grace to the streets.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Ms. Palin has taken a lead role in wooing culturally conservative counties like Beaver. She held a rally here and obtained the endorsement of the Beaver High School football coach, who paraded his players and cheerleaders onto the field for her, and the crowds cheered when she spoke of her opposition to abortion. This is a theologically conservative province -- Catholic churches vie with conservative Protestant and evangelical churches.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''She's what we need, a live one,'' said Steve Matoic, a 6-foot-6 truck driver in a camouflage jacket and with a flag bandana on his head. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''The head of our ticket is good, but sometimes his energy ----'' he said, his voice trailing off.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Palin fires, however, show signs of banking. Over at Sheffield Lanes, mention of her name summons no glint from older bowlers, or from Jeremy and Joe Long, in their 20s, tipping Buds. They liked Mrs. Clinton but pass on Ms. Palin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''She's always talking about the 'Average Joe,' '' Jeremy Long said. ''Average me! I don't want myself in the Oval Office. I want someone smarter.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The next day, just up the street on Linden Avenue, Grace Ruscitti, a retired schoolteacher, stood on her porch on a block of modest steel-worker bungalows. She was still upset about Mr. McCain's choice of Ms. Palin. ''That was an insult to our intelligence,'' Ms. Ruscitti said. ''This barracuda nonsense. Tell me, where'd they find her?''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> None of which is to suggest that Mr. McCain does not have deep reservoirs of support. The Rev. Chris Noyes, a Presbyterian minister in Beaver Falls, a city with broad avenues and storefronts that are more vacant than not, estimates that two-thirds of his congregation supports the Republican ticket. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Talk to Derek Wood, 28, as his Dalmatian tugs at a leash, and he says he is voting for Mr. McCain. He likes the tax cuts.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> People here have voted for Democrats since the 1930s, Mr. Wood said, and what is left? Ghosts hang from oaks and pumpkins sit on porches, but there are no children to demand trick or treat. If you are 28, you rent a U-Haul truck and leave.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''It's a great place to live from 45 and up,'' Mr. Wood said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Republicans have also poured money into advertising. Until early October, the McCain campaign had outspent the Obama campaign in Pennsylvania. And commercials and e-mail messages from unaffiliated groups have sown doubt: about Mr. Obama's ties to William Ayers, the former member of the 1960s-era Weather Underground radical group; about his connection to Acorn, an organizing group being accused of voter-registration fraud; about his religion. The rumors and charges form a subliminal closed loop.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The white-haired Judy Miller, ''Miss Judy'' to customers, slaps together a turkey hoagie in Hookstown, near the West Virginia border. Mention of Mr. Obama brings a frown. ''Who is he? Who's behind him?'' she said. ''This radical at the university thing, the Muslim stuff.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A union distributes a leaflet here titled ''The Truth About Barack Obama,'' which says: ''Is he a Christian? Yes. Was he sworn in on a Bible? Yes. Was he born in America? Yes.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Still, doubts about Mr. Obama persist. Mrs. Permon, the steelworker's widow, plans to write in Mrs. Clinton's name. Rita Ratjer, another steel widow, plans to sit it out altogether. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But in between sits the housebound Peggy Doffin. Her knees are gone and she takes groceries, mail deliveries and interviews through her first-floor window. At 79, with her fat tabby cat in her arms, she has lived through the Great Depression and fears another coming. Once she was a confirmed ''Hillary woman'' and not a fan of Mr. Obama. Then she listened to his convention speech and, she said, ''chills ran down my back.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Race just don't matter to me any more,'' she said. ''But a lot of Democrats out there'' -- she shrugged -- ''we'll find out on Election Day, won't we?''</span></p>
