  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> General David Petraeus and the Search for a Way Out of Iraq</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> By Linda Robinson</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Illustrated. 411 pp. PublicAffairs. $27.95</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gen. David Petraeus says that he has no desire to meddle in politics, but he may have more to do with the outcome of the presidential election than any other nonpolitician. As commanding officer in Iraq throughout 2007 and much of this year, Petraeus has served as the chief architect and champion of the ''surge'' policy there. (He has now moved on to become commander of the American military's Central Command.) As the number of both American and Iraqi deaths has plunged, and as the prospects for real political change have improved, it has become increasingly difficult for Barack Obama to argue that the surge, which he opposed and John McCain passionately supported, has been a failure. Obama may have to hope that after five years of mayhem and empty promises, the American people are past caring. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Linda Robinson's ''Tell Me How This Ends'' is the first book about this new Iraq. It's a first-rate piece of work, probing and conscientious, though reading a good-news book about one of America's all-time bad-news stories can take some getting used to. The Iraq calamity has been a colossal boon to journalists, and the scenes that Robinson's predecessors have etched into readers' minds combine equal elements of tragedy and farce. The hopelessly unprepared Jay Garner, the first head of civilian reconstruction, cheerfully informing a group of anxious sheiks that they're on their own -- that's the Iraq we know. Robinson forces us to look again. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Tell Me How This Ends'' is scarcely a bouquet to the administration. Robinson, author in residence at the Philip Merrill Center for Strategic Studies at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, describes President Bush as blindly, and ruinously, attached to Nuri al-Maliki, Iraq's slow-moving leader. She does give Bush credit for supporting the few military thinkers who in late 2006, in the face of opposition from the State Department and the civilian Pentagon, argued that 30,000 additional troops could make a decisive difference. But this is a book about military strategy and tactics; and the president and his entourage do not linger long. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Indeed, you cannot help being struck by the radical difference between Bush and his world, and Petraeus and his. The 55-year-old general is a superachiever who took on all the toughest training assignments and came away with the medals, a perfectionist who demands as much from others as from himself and a deeply reflective figure -- he has a Ph.D. in international relations from Princeton -- who continually adapts to the lessons of experience. Petraeus puts no special store by his gut intuitions; in Iraq, he surrounded himself with junior officers as analytical, and as driven, as he is. Robinson singles out as his greatest gift not leadership but ''intellectual rigor,'' which compelled him ''to mount a sustained effort to understand the problem.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The problem, which had thoroughly eluded Bush and his chief aides, as well as prior commanding officers up to and including Gen. George Casey, Petraeus's immediate predecessor, was that no number of American troops would make a lasting difference unless they could affect the Iraqis' own political calculations. While serving as a commanding officer at Fort Leavenworth in 2006, Petraeus had brought together leading civilian and military thinkers to produce a new version of the Army's counterinsurgency manual. The document's central theme was political rather than military: A counterinsurgency can succeed only if it makes the government legitimate in the eyes of its citizens. This requires economic aid, governance reform, improvement in basic services and the like. And it requires an act of understanding, even empathy: ''Knowing why an insurgent movement has gained support,'' the manual states, ''is essential in designing a counterinsurgency campaign.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Petraeus proceeded to implement his strategy with relentless focus (and those 30,000 extra troops). A correct strategy forcefully executed will take you a long way -- but not all the way. As we know now, Petraeus's arrival in Iraq coincided with the fateful decision of Sunni tribal sheiks to stand up to the extremists of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, who had worn out their welcome by, for example, throwing acid in the faces of women deemed insufficiently veiled. Thanks to the ''Anbar Awakening,'' as it was called, 100,000 Sunni men joined the fight against extremism. The fallback position among Democrats, which Joe Biden articulated last month on ''Meet The Press,'' is that it wasn't the surge that worked, but the Awakening. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Robinson makes it clear that this simply isn't so. She describes in exacting detail the tactics used by field officers in some of the most terrifying battlegrounds of Iraq. When the First Battalion, Fifth Cavalry Regiment of the First Cavalry Division was assigned in late 2006 to Ameriya, in western Baghdad, the commander, Lt. Col. Dale Kuehl, moved his headquarters out of the base camp and into a local police station. He and his staff officers had read up on ''battalion-led counterinsurgency,'' and were eager to put its precepts into effect. Kuehl began building contacts with local sheiks, and spreading money around by paying for trash pickup and road repair. Then he began ''clearing'' operations against insurgents. The cost was high: 14 deaths in May alone. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Robinson lingers on the heroic self-discipline of officers who denied their men the catharsis of revenge, knowing that they were fighting for the sympathies of civilians. And finally, that discipline paid off. In late May, a local sheik called Kuehl to say that his tribesmen would be going after an Al Qaeda cell. When the sheik called back in a panic to ask for help, Kuehl joined the fight. His men weren't sure which Iraqis to shoot at, but the battle went well, and later Kuehl reached an understanding with the commander of the tribal force: he promised to pay the Sunnis, many of them former insurgents, if they submitted to fingerprinting and agreed to work with the Iraqi Army. When Petraeus learned of the deal, his only advice was, ''Do not let our Army stop you,'' and ''Do not let the Iraqi government stop you.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Counterinsurgency theory holds that military action can only be a precondition for political success. And Robinson readily concedes that President Maliki and other Iraqi national leaders have so far refused to pursue compromise. Indeed, journalists and policy analysts have been reporting that Maliki has reneged on promises to induct Awakening members into the Iraqi Army and police, threatening a return to the Hobbesian violence of 2006. Robinson holds out hope that coming elections will produce a more legitimate government. She supports Petraeus's preference for a gradual draw-down of forces as the Iraqi Army assumes control of ground-level operations. And she argues that a swifter withdrawal would jeopardize the fragile gains of the last year. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Petraeus has come in for a great deal of abuse from opponents of the war, most notoriously when he testified in September 2007 that the surge was working, and Moveon.org took out a full-page ad in The New York Times whose headline read, ''General Petraeus or General Betray Us?''At the time, the military top brass, worried about stretching the Army to the breaking point, continued to oppose the surge; Democratic congressmen, progressive organizations and many pundits mocked Petraeus as a Bush administration shill. But Petraeus was right; and Moveon's question sounds almost repellent in retrospect. Indeed, Robinson leaves the reader feeling that, however the war turns out, our country owes David Petraeus a debt of gratitude.</span></p>
