  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten's humor column, Below the Beltway, appears every Sunday in The Washington Post magazine. It is syndicated nationally by the Washington Post Writers Group.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At one time or another, Below the Beltway has managed to offend persons of both sexes as well as individuals belonging to every religious, ethnic, regional, political and socioeconomic group. If you know of a group we have missed, please write in and the situation will be promptly rectified. &quot;Rectified&quot; is a funny word.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Tuesdays at noon, Gene is online to take your questions and abuse. He will chat about anything. Although this chat is updated regularly throughout the week, it is not and never will be a &quot;blog,&quot; even though many persons keep making that mistake. One reason for the confusion is the Underpants Paradox: Blogs, like underpants, contain &quot;threads,&quot; whereas this chat contains no &quot;threads&quot; but, like underpants, does sometimes get funky and inexcusable.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This Week's Poll. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Not chat day? Visit the Gene Pool.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Important, secret note to readers: The management of The Washington Post apparently does not know this chat exists, or it would have been shut down long ago. Please do not tell them. Thank you.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Weingarten is also the author of &quot;The Hypochondriac's Guide to Life. And Death&quot; and co-author of &quot;I'm with Stupid,&quot; with feminist scholar Gina Barreca.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Good afternoon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I attended an Obama rally last week in Leesburg and then wrote a column about it. This column was for publication after the election. It was a resourceful and courageous bit of journalistic derring-do, making ironic use of the fact that the writer, but not the reader, would be ignorant of the results of the election. This sort of high-wire act would not be attempted by a lesser columnist. Alas, you will never read this column because my editor, Tom the Butcher, informed me that it was &quot;stupid, unfunny, incomprehensible, juvenile and tasteless.&quot; The juvenile and tasteless part was because much of the column was about how I had been hiding out in the press section without proper credentials, meaning I could not risk visiting the secret-service-guarded media-only Port-a-Potty, something I biologically needed to do.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Also, not knowing who I was, the Obama campaign people had randomly chosen me to sit behind Obama in the grandstands, waving a placard and cheering on cue, something I would have loved to accept just for the silliness of it, had I been willing to be immediately fired afterwards.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">However bad the column was, it did make some observations in this column that were entertaining, and I will share them now:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">1. Tens of thousands of people showed up two hours before this event, clogging downtown Leesburg streets. These including a six-year-old child dressed head-to-toe in a bear costume, holding the hand of his ma, who looked just a little sheepish. I suspect this was the kid's drop-dead condition for attendance, and ma really wanted to go see Obama, so</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">2. While it is obviously an unfair cliche that all Obama supporters are Birkenstockian, peasent-frocked, back-to-the-earth, bunny-hugging greenie socialist hippies, and that an Obama cabinet will resemble a meeting of the Sierra Club circa 1977, I could not help but notice that when I arrived at the metal detectors, security personnel were seizing any objects that might be used as projectiles. Hundreds of these confiscated potential missiles were gathered in piles, and, bizarrely, they were all the same. Apples.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">3. Vendors were doing a brisk, impromptu business selling from the tailgates of their cars campaign souvenirs, many of which I strongly suspected were unofficial and unauthorized, such as the ladies' underpants that read, &quot;No More Bush.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">4. &quot;In America,&quot; Obama told the crowd, &quot;our destiny is not written for us, it's written by us.&quot; As always, this line got a thunderous ovation even though -- I must point this out in the spirit of today's poll-- it is an illiteracy. &quot;Destiny,&quot; if you believe in such a thing, is predetermined. We can no more write our own destiny as we can predetermine, 10 days before an election, who is going to win. (Oooh, see what I was doing there? Isn't it unspeakably clever? No, Tom the Butcher didn't think so, either. )</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">----</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I had a dream last night in which I was taking the written driver's exam. It had a whole bunch of unusual questions, including &quot;Does Barack Obama own The Onion?&quot; (The answer, apparently, was yes.) Also, it asked me to grade the various shapes of human poop (This was clearly occasioned by an upcoming chat posting that I read yesterday), and also to identify 15 or 20 ladies hairstyles. This last question so terrified me, I woke up.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">----</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some weeks ago, I was IMing with my friend Caitlin Gibson when the following occurred, verbatim.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cast of characters: Cait is a writer, and the administrator in The Post's legal office. Marcus Brauchli is the brand-new Executive Editor of The Post, and a Very Important Potentially Scary Person.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Caitlin: S--- !</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Caitlin: marcus brauchli just asked me for a notepad and i didn't have a new one so i just ripped the top sheet off one on my desk and gave it to him</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Me: that is fine.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Caitlin: and i think</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Me: that is resourceful.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Caitlin: i doodled cartoon ducks</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Caitlin: on the back page of it</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Me: hahahahahahaha.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Caitlin: S--- s--- s---.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">me: hahahahahaha.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Caitlin: i am trying to find another pad that has the ducks</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Caitlin: so i can know it wasn't the one i gave him</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Caitlin: but i can't find the ducks</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Caitlin: i think i gave him the ducks</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Caitlin: one was wearing a party hat</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Caitlin: this is what it looked like.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Caitlin: S---. I haven't said ten words to him yet and I give him a cartoon duck in a party hat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Me: Wow. Can I use this in a chat?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Caitlin: I suppose so. If he has my ducks, and he sees this in the chat, maybe he will forgive me.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">-----</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Please take today's poll. So far, and I need to say this kindly, you guys are mostly sucking. The answers are very hard, though. I will explain 'em fairly early in the chat, but will reveal this now: The first question in the poll is what prompted me to ask Pat to write the rest of the poll. It is the verbatim first line of my column on Sunday. That is how it appeared in The Washington Post. Elsewhere in the country, in newspapers that are my clients for syndication, it read &quot;Bob Woodward and I,&quot; not &quot;Bob Woodward and me.&quot; Yes, there is an interesting story behind this.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">---</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Today we have a tandem CLOD, and they must be viewed in succession. Here they are: First this, then this.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The CPOW is Sunday's Doonesbury. The First Runner up is Thursday's Get Fuzzy. Honorables: Thursday's Prick City, Friday's Rhymes with Orange, Friday's Brewster Rockit, Friday's Speed Bump, and today's ... Baldo!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Oh, Redskin Chris Cooley has a blog, the same one in which he recently accidentally posted a photograph of his penis. This week, he decided to publish some of his own limericks. They were dreadful, but looked Shakespearean next to those that his readers submitted.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So I submitted two to the blog. Here they are:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Not one of you writes decent verse:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You can't rhyme, and your meter is worse.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Better stay football fans,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And just sit on your cans,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Swill beer, pick your wedgies, and curse.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">--</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Britain, Chris, we're just agog</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">'Cause your fan base seems dumb as a log.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">All in all, we would rather</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Been been spared all that blather.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(Not the first time you've cocked up your blog.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Reston, Va.: Gene -- a friend was at the Obama rally in Leesburg last week and caught a picture of you! Can I send it in?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Sure, but send to weingarten (at) washpost.com. I tend not to post pics of myself here, but will consider for an update.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rally for Oba, MA: Why would you have been fired? Does The Post really think you're an impartial political observer? Wouldn't you essentially be the equivalent of an Op-Ed contributor?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Because I cannot literally let myself be used as a political backdrop. It would be the equivalent of contributing money to a campaign. Not allowed, for good reason.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ellicott City, Md.: Is &quot;Rocking Chair&quot; the best song by the Band?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: No, but you've got the right album. The Band's brown album is probably the best folk-rock album of all time, and it contains the five best songs ever by The Band, which are, in order: Across the Great Divide, Rag Mama Rag, Jemima Surrender, The Night They Drive Old Dixie Down, and Rocking Chair.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten:&quot;Unfaithful Servant&quot; might be in the mix, too. An amazing album.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dude: Caitlin draws really good ducks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Her mommy is a really talented artist.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Today's Poll: One great joy of graduating high school is I don't have to take grammar tests anymore. You described the answers as &quot;very hard.&quot; Way to sell it, Gene. I'm guessing this poll will rank pretty low in participation. Do you keep records?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: It's doing fine.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: My mother attended an Obama rally last weekend in Reno, Nev. She called me later with only one complaint about the event -- that they had confiscated her apple at the gate!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I think you are on to something here, Gene.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: It was completely bizarre. Huge piles of apples.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fairfax, Va.: Dear Gene,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My partner and I decided that you are the only person qualified to arbitrate on this question. Which is worse:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Opening your mouth in an enclosed space (read shower) just in time to inhale (actually, eat) the other person's fart (of the deadly variety)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">or</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">being on the receiving end of a burp (also the deadly kind) during open-mouthed kissing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both of these happened recently (luckily, for balance's sake, to different receivers) and we've been back and forth trying to decide who was worse off. Thoughts?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I am sitting here laughing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rib: Why are you laughing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Me: The concept of &quot;eating a fart.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rib:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Me: Never mind.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So, that's worse. Simply by the way it is explained.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anonymous: I hate this poll more than any poll</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I have a dozen posts saying, essentially, &quot;I love this poll more than any other poll.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dunn Loring, Va.: I've noticed an interesting phenomenon. As I drive around different neighborhoods, it's rare (I'd venture maybe 2 percent) that I see a house with both an Obama yard sign and an American flag. By comparison, around 10 percent of McCain supporters fly an American flag. Is there some unspoken rule that I missed?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Clearly, people who support Obama hate America.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Writing our Desti, NY: You may be the only professional author here, but don't get too jealous of the prerogatives that go with it. Obama's comment that we write our own destiny isn't an illiteracy any more than William Ernest Henley's line in Invictus, &quot;I am the master of my fate.&quot; As long as these guys don't venture into humor, you should ease up and give them some license to be literary. They're not so bad at it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: It's lazy, though. I don't like it. Sports people are particularly guilty of this, when they talk about controlling their own destiny.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Reston Peas: So, a few weeks ago my mortgage sharing girlfriend and I decided to split up, and I found out I was getting laid off in the same day. Not one of my favorite days. I'm driving home, impatient, being an arse of sorts. This lady cuts me off, I get annoyed, practically do everything those radio commericals and metro bus ads say not to. Somewhere in there she gets the finger. (I would swear this up and down if I wasn't an atheist) I of course got the finger back. Except it wasn't the usual suspect, but the pointer accompanied by the thumb, calling into question the size of my manhood. Honestly, it made me laugh, thinking about the chat et. al, and realize what a Richard I was being. I took a deep breath and happily obliged (most) traffic laws the rest of my commute.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: OOOhh. Possibly it was a reader of these chats! I have advocated just such a move.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.: Speaking of The Band, which do you think works best? &quot;I got me a date with a purty little girl from Greece&quot; as Levon Helm sang it or &quot;I got me a date with Boticelli's niece&quot; as Dylan wrote it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Uh, Botticelli. Botticelli's niece is fabulous.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ThePo, Ll: I loved today's poll, but my answers aren't in line with the majority. I'll assume it's because I'm right and everyone else is wrong. Agreed?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Probably. He are the correct answers:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Okay, the poll.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Except for the first answer, which is in dispute, there is something wrong with ALL OF THEM.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">1. On the first line, from my column: The confusion seems to have come from my use of &quot;such as&quot; for pompous-sounding effect, instead of &quot;like,&quot; which would have been straightforward and carried a &quot;me,&quot; not &quot;I&quot;. With &quot;such</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">as,&quot; an ambiguity arises and knowledgeable people could come down on either side of this issue. Pat would have gone with &quot;I,&quot; because it sounds better, but invites other grammarians to dissent. I wrote &quot;I&quot; and a Post copy editor changed it. The Syndicate copy editor did not. We are not prepared to allege that either was &quot;wrong.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">2. The expressioIt is free rein, not free reign. A word usage problem. This is about loosening the reins on someone, not weakening their control of government.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">3. In the Pulitzer prize sentence, there is a problem of parallelism. It is presented as a list, but in fact is not a list, because the third item is not parallel. It could be most simply fixed by adding an &quot;and&quot; before the second item in the list.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">4. Word usage problem. The musical term &quot;crescendo&quot; is a gradual building, not an apex. You don't really &quot;reach&quot; a crescendo at all. Very common misuse.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">5. This is clearly grammatical. The sirens and horns are not surrounded by glass. This is a dangling participle.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">6. Who is the better person for the job, not whom.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">7. Ooh, so many of you got this wrong. The prize will go to whoever can explain, the point being that 'whoever&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">is the subject of &quot;can explain,&quot; not the object of &quot;go to.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">8. Something can't be five times bigger than something else. It can be five times as big. &quot;Bigger&quot; allows only addition, nut multiplication as the modifying factor. &quot;Five times bigger&quot; is meaningless.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Regarding Size and Shape of Poop: You published an email in your WED or THURS update regarding the size (width) of a person's poop. Bet you didn't know that there is actually a scale that doctors use to help determine your GI health by the shape of your stool. It is called the Bristol Scale. If you type &quot;Bristol Stool Scale&quot; into wikipedia, you will be greeted with a chart showing the Bristol Scale (with graphical representations).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Liz, can we link to this?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I wonder if Sarah Palin knew about this? Probably not.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">BYW - is the picture of his penis still on the blog? And why does anyone take a picture of his penis - unless he plans to send it to a doctor because of some really ugly rash?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I mentioned this in the Gene Pool a couple of weeks ago. He blogs naked, and was taking a picture of the Redskins playbook on his lap, and, uh, forgot. He. Was. Naked.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, DC: Gene, have you ever posted something during a chat that you really shouldn't said? Would you go to the extreme as editing from the chat or do you go by the standard that if it has been posted, it stays there.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Splitting Hai, RS: Let's get this straight, Gene:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">1. Giving money to a campaign (and having your name posted as a contributor): bad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">2. Sitting on a stage for a compaign: bad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">3. Writing articles in the bloody newspaper itself that call Obama the Man of Destiny or McCane/Palin the Little Ducks with Party Hats: fine.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That's the sort of ethical hair-splitting up with which I will not put.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: These are not parallel. I think most people see why. As a columnist I am allowed to/supposed to have and express opinions. I am not allowed to materially help a campaign as a partisan, other than what I do openly and publically, in the course of my job.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York, NY: Metro to Randomly Search Riders' Bags: Your thoughts? I'm a die hard civil liberties fan, and find security theater of this sort offensive. I'm not sure you've ever given a position on privacy rights in this field.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I don't like it, though.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Truth is, he'd smile.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And if he's reading this chat, he'll REALLY smile.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hickeyville: Here's one for you , Gene --</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am a 34-year-old married female. I am in the process of looking for a new job. I'm a good interview, but I have one issue- I have a strawberry birthmark on my neck that looks like a hickey. It's definitely noticeable, and I have yet to find a cover up that completely conceals it. I am trying to figure out if it's a good idea to bring it up in the interview -- something like, &quot;Oh, just an fyi, this is a birthmark on my neck, I know it looks rather like something else, just wanted to be upfront about it&quot;. Or something like that. Or should I not say anything at all and hope they don't notice? They totally will, though. On the first day of my current job, my manager told me that she didn't care what I did extracurricularly, but I had to look professional at work and then nodded at neck. This has happened a few times. Of course, when I tell them it's a birthmark, they're extremely apologetic. So I'm conflicted. What would you do in this situation?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I would do nothing.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The random searches that the NYPD undertakes before allowing you to enter the PUBLIC mass transit system is something completely different and bothers the hell out of me. When it was new, I was shocked at how few people shared my view on this.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">No Nookie-ville: Hi Gene. My boyfriend of five years has little to no sex-drive. I was always more interested in sex than he was, but over the past year or two, we have become all but celibate. Counseling is probably down the road, but first the plan is to rule out physical causes. There is a plan for a visit to an actual doctor, but as you are my window into the male brain and body... what could cause a 29-year-old male to lose interest in sex? FWIW his &quot;equipment&quot; still works; it's just that sex has just become as urgent as folding the laundry: it should be done, but it can be put off until later, like next month. I love this man. I want to marry him. But sometimes I am so depressed about our sex life I want to cry. Please, please, please lend me what insight you can.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I have no explanation, but he should definitely seek counseling and medical advice. AT 29, this should not be the case. I'm not sure why you would want to marry someone and look at a lifetime of no sex.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: My friends and I have been discussing: Is there any one book, movie, or TV show, that having as a favorite is an automatic deal breaker? What interests would prove to you that someone is totally unfunny, has a different worldview, and that this relationship would never work?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some say &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot; as a favorite book is a deal breaker. The best example I've come up with is ruling out someone whose favorite television show is &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Dan Quayle's favorite movie was, famously, &quot;Ferris Beuller's Day Off.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I judge people by their taste in comic strips, where there are obvious and cliched deal breakers. But there are also subtle red flags. I'm worrying about someone who claims to like &quot;Prickly City&quot; or &quot;Mallard Fillmore.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anonymous: As a male, I have a question that I never had the courage to ask, especially since I believe my source is something I heard Howard Stern say years ago. Is it true that in many breast enlargement surgeries that some women lose nipple feeling? In other words, the woman has decreased abilities for sensual pleasure, all in exchange for supposedly making herself more attractive to men? (Only to learn that, for a lot of men, that is not an issue?) If this is so, shouldn't there be greater warnings to women, or do they know this and proceed with the surgeries anyway?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: A quick Google search confirms this. Permanent loss of sensation is not uncommon. As you point out, the irony here is disturbing.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pat the Perfect, ME: Re: Crescendo. I'm not surprised that the meaning of &quot;peak&quot; has made it into Merriam-Webster, since it's often used that way and MW is a descriptive dictionary; i.e., it's describing what's said out there, not what OUGHT to be said. So is the dictionary that The Post uses, Webster's New World; our edition, however, still doesn't give that meaning, surprisingly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What surprises me is that as a musical term meaning to grow louder, &quot;crescendo&quot; is learned by every child who ever studies a musical instrument, which must be a huge proportion of the population. So you'd think that a meaning that's so different from the original wouldn't catch on. I guess people either forgot or didn't like the alternatives, such as &quot;climax.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I think using &quot;crescendo&quot; to mean peak is especially unfortunate if you're talking about music. But still, i think it's sloppy and that it prevents its use as a great word for its original meaning, a big swell of volume.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I'm not sure that the percentage of kids learning music remains high, Pat.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Strawberry mark: I would cover it up with a scarf or turtle neck for the interview. I had an informational interview with my friend's cousin the other day. He is highly qualified, has an impressive resume, and was recently laid off. He deserves a new job -- he is highly competent and experienced, pleasant, resourceful and is networking like mad. However, he has some sort of skin condition and has many, many (I'm talking hundreds, possibly) small cysts or warts on his face. There are so many that it is distracting -- for the first 20 minutes, I could barely concentrate on anything he was saying because I was so curious about his condition. You don't want your interviewers to be distracted or speculating about anything but your qualifications for the job and fit with the organization. Please cover it up.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I have a question which I believe you are uniquely qualified to answer. I recently joined a new gym in town - the membership an anniversary gift from my wonderful SO - and have been working out there every morning. I love to run, and because I'm a freak of nature, I will sometimes run on a treadmill for an hour and a half at a time while watching the news. I don't know, it's my therapy. Oh, I should also mention that I'm a 26-year-old woman, but look considerably younger. People assume my 21-year-old sister is older than me. So anyway, I'm running along yesterday, and a man in his late 60s, probably, approaches me. He says he admires that I've been running since he got there and he's showered and leaving now, and that I'm a very beautiful girl. That last bit makes me uncomfortable, but I decided being pleasant wouldn't kill me, and he walked away anyway. Then, this morning, same thing. He walks up to me while I'm running, carries on a semi-flirty conversation, harasses me because he thinks I forgot his name (I didn't), and leaves. I don't know why, but he makes me nervous. Is he, do you think -- harmless? Should I not worry about anything yet? Am I paranoid? If he makes a habit of commenting on my appearance, what do I do? I hate conflict but I also hate feeling leered at. You're my dad's age, but far less likely to drive 1,000 miles here to shoot someone, so I'm asking you. Thanks! Virtual panties, etc.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I'm not sure what you're asking. Yes, he is hitting on you, but you already know that. Yes, it is starting to make you uncomfortable, so you have to stop it. And yes, you are going to have to do something uncharacteristic that makes you seem unfriendly and cold, which shouldn't have to be, but in many ways the world is unfair.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Next time stop, and tell him flatly, without a smile, that you're sorry, but you don't like to talk while exercising. He will go away and not come back unless he is a REAL jerk, which he probably isn't.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He spoke to the U.S. Marine standing guard and said, &quot;I would like to go in and meet with President Bush.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Marine looked at the man and said, &quot;Sir, Mr. Bush is no longer president and no longer resides here.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The old man said, &quot;Okay&quot; and walked away.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The following day, the same man approached the White House and said to the same Marine, &quot;I would like to go in and meet with President Bush.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Marine again told the man, &quot;Sir, as I said yesterday, Mr. Bush is no longer president and no longer resides here.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Marine, understandably agitated at this point, looked at the man and said, &quot;Sir, this is the third day in a row you have been here asking to speak to Mr. Bush. I've told you already that Mr. Bush is no longer the president and no longer resides here. Don't you understand?&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sample sentence: &quot;I presume that you are qualified to become Vice President of the United States.&quot; Is this correct?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I had to look this up. I thought I wouldn't, but I did.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the sense you are using the words -- meaning, to suppose, or take for granted that -- these words are essentially interchangeable. However some 80 years ago a very learned wordsmith noted a very minor difference between them: &quot;Assume&quot; tends to connote something taken on faith, or through belief, whereas &quot;presume&quot; suggests you suppose it based on more empirical fact and evidence. These are trifling differences, of interest mostly to persons like me and Ms. Perfect.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Your example, though, is appalling. When one is dealing with the potential vice president, one must not presume competence. One must demand proof.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Name Ga, ME: Gene, as the wise arbiter of all things name-related, I need your help.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My husband and I are completely stuck on names for our soon-to-be-born son. He wants something really unique and based in old legends/mythology. I'm afraid that the child will be teased endlessly and be labeled with &quot;weird.&quot; (The name my husband currently likes is Tyr - pronounced like tear as in teardrop).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What do we do? The middle name has already been chosen (passing on a family name) so unfortunately that's not an option for balancing out. I'm getting a bit stressed, although we still have a couple months to decide. I think this is one of the biggest decisions I've ever had to make and I'm afraid of screwing it up.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: The answer to this is simple. In choosing a name, each parent has total veto power and must not be bashful about using it. A veto need no be defended. It just is, and we move on.... This tends to militate toward safety (if not boredom), which is fine. Names should not be an exercise in ego for the parents.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tyr is unconscionable, as you well know, so put your foot down. No. Next?</span></p>

I did not believe my friends when they told me this until I checked the dictionary and realized, with much horror, they were right. The same rule actually applies to any word that starts with &quot;wh.&quot; I've tried to be good and say it right, but I just can't stand it!

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What was your reaction to Sunday's &quot;Doonesbury?&quot; I have trouble with this whole &quot;attack Joe the Plumber&quot; thing. For all you, I or Trudeau knows, Joe's a great plumber -- or maybe a terrible one -- but why should we care? The cartoon comes across as just a vicious personal attack on the guy for having the temerity to disagree with Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So I figured there must be a deeper point being made -- some metaphor about the candidates -- but if Trudeau is trying to suggest that one of them will prove to be an inept bumbler who doesn't know what he's doing -- well, Obama's the one without the track record of accomplishment, but somehow I don't think that's where Trudeau was going.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Doonesbury, ( Oct. 26)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Yes, it was funny and you just missed it. First off, you need to understand that because of Sunday comic deadlines, Trudeau must have punched this out in minutes, the day after the last debate, when it became manifest that Joe the Plumber was not a licensed plumber.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Is this fair satire? Yep. Why? Because Trudeau knows exactly as much about Joe the Plumber as McCain apparently did before he hauled him out to be the CENTERPIECE of his failing, desperate campaign. McCain had already created this ridiculous stalking horse, and Trudeau is doing exactly what his job is: Exposing the hypocrisy behind it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It doesn't matter whether Joe is a competent, unlicensed plumber. He's a caricature, and McCain made him one.</span></p>

I was amused to read that his views on VPL are bang on with yours:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;For me, it's the mystery. What's behind her clothes? What excites me is panty lines - and yet the women, they don't want no panty lines. To me, it's the sexiest thing.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We know your love for VPL, but have you ever discussed your views on the paparazzi? Do you think this guy's pictures are art? Some of them look just as invasive as today's pap shots, but some of them are kind of striking.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I think Ron Gallela is an artist specifically BECAUSE he was first. He created an art form which has been imitated by many people far less skilled than he is.</span></p>

Do people have to worry about carrying perfectly legal, but potentially dangerous objects? Do I need to edit my bag to TSA standards? What happens if they find something they deem inappropriate? What is considered &quot;explosive&quot;? Firecrackers? Flammable liquids, such as lighter fluid for your bbq? What about something with which they are unfamiliar?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I'm not saying it's wrong, but clarification would be very helpful. The whole food police debacle a few years ago doesn't inspire confidence in the method in which they will implement this new program.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Not a one. I have never reviewed my own book, though without my knowledge my kids once ananymously, hilariously reviewed my Hypochondria book. They were 17 and 14 at the time. They recommended the book, then noted that they had never before recommended a book to anyone, then noted that this fact is particularly odd because they are a librarian. This happened to be the first review of the book, and it is forever archived at Amazon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I do think anonymous self-review is sadly legion in Amazon: If you look skeptically at many books with only a few reviews, you can often get a whiff of a suspicion of it. I think Amazon reviews should have to be signed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They can also be annoying to a writer. The only less-than-good review of Old Dogs so far -- the reason it is four and a half stars, and not five stars -- is from some person who never bought the book, never read the book, never even LOOKED AT the book. She asked that a free page of it be sent to her Kindle reading machine, and was apparently disappointed that this page did not contain a photo of a dog.</span></p>

I'm an Obama fan, but shouldn't someone have vetted that before they put it out there? You know the he knows that &quot;their&quot; isn't correct as it's used in the ad. Is he pandering to people who don't know good English? Or to those who think using proper English is elitist?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten:&quot;Their&quot; in that circumstance has become acceptable. I used to hate it, but have become resigned to it because it is not an ignorance so much as it is an agreed-upon convenience. &quot;His or her&quot; is clumsy, and there is no less clumsy alternative.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anonymous: Yesterday I was waiting for my order at a cafe. There was a mother with a young (perhaps 5-year-old) daughter, also waiting. With them was a man who appeared to be the mother's boy friend. At first he &quot;play-punched&quot; at the little girl, who screamed. Mother told him to cut it out. Then he did it again, and again, and again, each time coming closer to her. Eventually, she stopped crying. Then he took out a cigarette lighter, flicked it on, and pushed it toward her face (really fast). Again mom told him to cut it out (while the little girl cried and tried to hide). Again, he kept doing it and doing it and doing it, bringing the flame closer and closer to her face. I was absolutely horrified, but couldn't think of anything to do other than glaring at him across the room, (and yes, he saw me, and smirked) since the mother quit protesting pretty quickly. What would you have done?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I hate question like this because they're so disturbing, and there's no good answer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I don't think you do anything, except feel bad afterward. You're looking at bad parenting, but I don't think you're looking at anything tangible enough to intercede. I'd like to hear if someone has any better ideas.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I was talking to a friend last night who recommended something interesting: Go up to the child and say something neutral, but friendly: &quot;Hi, how you doing? I like your shoes!&quot; Whatever. This does not directly confront the parents, but tells the child there is an adult there who considers her a human being and likes her and is concerned for her wellbeing. Might shame the adults into acting more in her interest.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McLean, Va.: I wish that elementary and high school English courses would bring back the old and arcane practice of diagramming sentences.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I believe Ms. Perfect, who is perfect, says she could never competently diagram sentences. I might be misremembering, and will be so informed forthwith.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: It is, apparently, but it must be seen in context to have its humor understood.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: There is a distinction between what costume is worn at a party -- where guests have to abandon their self-righteousness at the door -- and what is placed out in public view for passersby to see.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I was initially on the fence on this; I do see it as public art, and certainly as free speech. But I asked myself how I would regard it if it were an Obama effigy, and the answer is it would feel really, really wrong.

I can't answer it, but I can tell you something that a man in a Verizon store once told me: Cell phones getting dropped in the toilet is so common it is basically an epidemic.
