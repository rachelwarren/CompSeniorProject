  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lew Oliver's McCain-Palin T-shirt advertised his intentions, and the woman in the S.U.V. gave him an opening. ''I'm undecided,'' said Nicole Ellington, 31, a paralegal with two young children. ''You have two minutes. Go.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Oliver knew that her family leaned Republican because she was on his get-out-the-vote list, and he rapidly delivered a pitch honed over 22 years of volunteering for local campaigns. ''Wow, you're good,'' she said. And as she drove away, Mr. Oliver smiled with satisfaction.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But did he really win her over? Ms. Ellington had pointed to the ''Palin'' on his T-shirt and said, ''I'm worried about this one.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I don't know,'' Mr. Oliver said after giving it some thought. ''She may have been being polite.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Oliver, 47, a real estate lawyer who walks and talks in bursts, is the kind of party regular who is not usually one to doubt. He has been the Orange County Republican Party chairman since 1999, and with his encyclopedic knowledge of the neighborhoods and demographics of Orlando, he built the grass-roots effort that pushed George W. Bush to victory here and statewide in 2000 and 2004. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But this year, Mr. Oliver said, the challenge is tougher. Part of it is the ''collapse of the economy of the Western world,'' he said. Part is the competition, a campaign by Senator Barack Obama that has poured more money and people into the state than Senator John McCain. Even the most seasoned Republicans now acknowledge that they face an uphill fight.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''This is as difficult an environment for Republicans as there's been since Watergate,'' said George LeMieux, the former campaign manager for Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Oliver agrees. And like many Republicans trying in the final days to push their party to victory, he says he has found inspiration in Mr. McCain, the perseverant prisoner of war who came from behind to seize the Republican nomination. The current call to arms is simple: ''If anyone can pull it off, it's John McCain.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The same could be said for Mr. Oliver. Even his counterparts in the local Democratic Party describe him as one of the best organizers in Florida, a tireless terrier of campaigns who has missed only four of the county party's meetings in 22 years. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Oliver claims to dislike politics, seeing it as a way to fulfill the civic duty that led his father and two brothers to the military. But he is single and admits that the Republican Party consumes much of his free time. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> On Thursday, his day began at 9 a.m., calling his Orlando neighbors from a phone bank list he carries everywhere so he can reach voters during down times. By 10 a.m., he was inside a local TV news studio, where he debated the race with the local Democratic Party chairman. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> On camera, Mr. Oliver emphasized that ''no one is giving up.'' He said that the polls were close in Florida and that slight movement could bring victory. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> During a commercial break, though, he quoted Bill Clinton (''It's the economy, stupid'') and said, ''If I had a videotape of Barack Obama shooting someone, he'd still be up in the polls.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> What really frustrated him, he said, was that voters did not seem to be recognizing what he admired about John McCain: his pragmatism, his toughness, his proven willingness to buck his party and reach across the aisle on tough issues like immigration. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But lately, Mr. Oliver's task has become complicated as he finds himself competing with a burning fear voiced by some McCain supporters. It can be seen in the anti-Obama book at the McCain office in Altamonte Springs; or in Maitland, where someone posted a letter on the wall that said: ''This is the scariest election we as Christians have ever faced, and from the looks of the polls, the Christians aren't voting Christian values.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Just a few feet away, a larger poster near an American flag stated: ''Obama -- too dangerous for our America.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Oliver, when told about the messages, said they did not reflect the party's official position and would be taken down. At the Orlando headquarters, where he usually spends his time, no such language was visible.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But in an unscientific show of hands among 30 volunteers, more people said they were motivated by a fear of Mr. Obama than by a love of Mr. McCain or Gov. Sarah Palin. Such passions are double-edged: some party officials worry that the negative tone alienates independent voters; on the other hand, it has pushed volunteers to great lengths. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> About half of the volunteers at the headquarters had come from outside Florida, representing at least eight states, including Alaska, Georgia and Texas. Many said they were volunteering for the first time, spending as much as $2,000 of their own money to try to keep the Democrats from winning. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Krista Parrett, 37, said she came from Syracuse to volunteer because she feared that an Obama victory would make the United States like Uzbekistan, a former Soviet state ruled with an iron fist, where she once lived. Marlene Heineman, 58, a flight attendant who had come to the office during a long layover, said she worried about who might be behind Mr. Obama's rapid rise to prominence. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''He has a lot of shady connections,'' Ms. Heineman said. ''He hasn't been forthcoming.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Other interviews brought similar sentiments, though one volunteer, Michael Walzak, 46, a member of the county's Republican Executive Committee, said he was ''disappointed that so many people are that fearful.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Oliver, for his part, has stayed focused on what he knows: how to win. At 3:30 p.m., he returned from his law office, speeding into the campaign headquarters in Nike running sneakers and jeans, with not just a McCain-Palin shirt but also a hat. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The operation had just shifted from asking voters whether they had received and sent in their absentee ballots to the get-out-the-vote effort. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> This two-pronged emphasis, on absentee ballots and getting voters to the polls, has been the party's focus in Florida for decades. Mr. Oliver says that it works in part because Republicans tend to be less transient than Democrats, making them easier to reach, and because they have historically been more loyal to their party. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As an example, he said that 81 percent of registered Republicans in Orange County voted in 2004 compared with about 75 percent of Democrats.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> To try to continue that tradition, Mr. Oliver grabbed a list of 181 addresses in Baldwin Park, an area of working professionals. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The first house he visited took him to James Sims, 50, who said he was happy to see fellow McCain supporters in the neighborhood. The second voter he encountered also promised to vote Republican. ''No matter how sick you are?'' Mr. Oliver said. ''Even if you have to drag yourself there on a wagon?''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Yes,'' the woman said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It was a well-honed pitch. In his 22 years, he said he had learned a few things about voter contact. First, knock and ring the doorbell. Second, step a few feet back to avoid looking threatening. And third, use humor. Introductions like ''Hi'' -- big smile -- ''we're not selling anything'' are usually effective. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Or at least they get the conversation going. What happens next, this year at least, seems more unpredictable. Just after Mr. Oliver said he had not yet found a house with Republicans who said they would vote for Barack Obama, he encountered two of them in a row. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Beth Moriarty said that her 62-year-old husband, for the first time in his life, was going to vote for a Democrat. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Patricia Millar, 50, a registered independent, also said that sheand her husband, Jeffery Bergenthal, a Republican, were not voting for Mr. McCain. A blue Obama sign fluttered in her lawn. She seemed unsure of how to break the news. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''We think he's a great guy,'' she said of Mr. McCain. ''We're just a little disappointed with the ticket this year.'' </span></p>
