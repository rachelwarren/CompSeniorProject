  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Forget Iraq and health care. Forget the polls and focus groups. There's a new explanation why Sarah Palin is the surprise hit of the season.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;She's sexy. Men want a sexy woman,&quot; says CNBC's Donny Deutsch. &quot;Woman want to idealize about a sexy woman. . . . She's a lioness. . . . Women want to be her. Men want to mate with her.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What men are really saying, Deutsch adds, is, &quot;I want her laying next to me in bed.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">How could I have missed that? It's all about her looks! No wonder we can't stop talking about her. (Hat tip: TV Newser.) </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There is something to the notion that Palin has always run with motherhood at the center of her political persona. It's also true that she has spooked many feminists who want more women in high office (as long as they're liberal) and coaxed from many conservatives a new concern about sexist media coverage. It is a measure of how Palin has taken over this campaign that the latest satirical image of her online, courtesy of Salon.com, is that of a dominatrix, complete with riding crop and (for a touch of humor) a moose. Photoshopped pix floating around the Net also show her posing in a bikini, toting an assault rifle.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She has certainly mounted an assault on the narrative of this election, dumbfounding all the pundits who said McCain's pick was &quot;desperate&quot; (VandeHei and Harris, Politico, Aug. 30). Now it's the media who are scrambling to explain how Hurricane Sarah has transformed the political landscape.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Want proof? The Project for Excellence in Journalism says that 60 percent of last week's stories were about her: &quot;Palin enjoyed more coverage as a VP candidate during the GOP convention than Obama did a week earlier when he became the first person of color to accept the nomination for president of a major party.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now to the panic part. With a new WP poll showing a 20-point swing among white women toward McCain-Palin, worried Democrats seem not to know what to do. An NBC/WSJ poll has Obama up 47-46: &quot;McCain's pick of Sarah Palin as his running mate appears to have not only attracted female voters, but boosted McCain's association with changing the country's direction, and energized members of the Republican Party.&quot; A CBS poll: &quot;Gov. Sarah Palin has been well received: 52 percent have a favorable feeling towards her, while just 18 percent view her unfavorably. Obama running mate Sen. Joe Biden is less well known: 54 percent say they don't know enough about him to have an opinion.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama campaign has already made an ad against Palin, but what presidential candidate runs against a number two? And yet, at his news conference yesterday, it was, hey, Senator, tell us what you think of Sarah Palin. And Obama was tepid, mostly observing how much press coverage she's gotten.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some, like columnist Richard Cohen, are frustrated by Obama's demeanor, saying that the Illinois senator &quot;for all his splendid virtues, seems to lack fight. Maybe he's worried about how America would receive an angry black man or maybe he's just too cool to ever get hot, but the result is that we have little insight into his passions: What, above all, does he care about?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here's my question. Will the public fascination with Palin trump a growing familiarity with her positions (against abortion even in cases of rape, for instance)? Will it trump revelations about her Alaska record or qualms about her relative lack of experience? Will it trump news stories saying she keeps claiming credit for killing the Bridge to Nowhere when she once supported it?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Which leads me to this what if: What if Obama had picked Hillary? Then McCain wouldn't have chosen Palin, or if he had, it wouldn't have mattered as much. Of course, Hillary would have brought plenty of other baggage: battle scars, Bill, undermining a change message. But she might have shored up Barack among women.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By the way, there are now Sarah Palin dolls.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The sex appeal question keeps popping up, as it does in the aforementioned Salon piece by Gary Kamiya (illustrated by the dominatrix):</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The tough-talking, gun-toting 'hockey mom' who believes that America's wars are God's will has fired up social conservatives, restarted the culture wars so beloved of Republicans, and shifted the election from being about issues into a personality contest.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Post-convention polls are highly unreliable. But the same Democrats who were crowing with glee a week ago about McCain's off-the-wall choice are suddenly panicking. And you can't blame them. . . . It's all too plausible that just when victory is in sight, the most crucial election of our time could be tipped by the 11th-hour appearance of a slick, unqualified, right-wing extremist and religious zealot in designer glasses.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Call it Moose ex Machina. Republican strategists have made it clear that the GOP's only chance to win is by reframing the election as a battle of images. And right now, Palin is the pinup queen in that war. She's feisty, she's a mom, she's from a frontier state, she guns down wolves from the air, she's a devout Evangelical, she poses as a reformer, and she insults the Washington elites.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;And large numbers of Americans think she's hot.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This latter point cannot be underestimated. Iraq may be a quagmire, a new cold war may be looming, the economy may be tanking and the world may be heading toward environmental doom, but the presidential race may be decided by the perceived doability of the governor of Alaska.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For the record, I take no position on that burning national question.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Barack Obama and his Democratic allies are intensifying their attacks on Sarah Palin,&quot; says Politico, &quot;as her sustained and surprising central role in this race is upending Obama's strategy and often overshadowing McCain . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The Obama campaign is calculating that it must reckon with Palin and the big public boost she has provided McCain in the past week. When Palin was first named, the Obama staff attacked, then he pulled back. Now, reflecting the threat posed by Palin, Obama is taking the unusual route of attacking the opposition's No. 2, a job that would more typically be left to Biden, who focused more on McCain and President Bush.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The new tone is not without risk for the Democratic ticket. It's hard to take down an opponent without appearing overly or overtly partisan. It's also unusual to appear so focused on your opponent's running mate -- and not the nominee himself.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Some Democrats are now worried about the perils of Obama's strategy,&quot; reports the L.A. Times, &quot;saying that his campaign, instead of engaging the Alaska governor, should avoid any move that draws more attention to her and could enhance her appeal among the white, blue-collar voters who remain cool to Obama's candidacy.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liberals, such as Josh Marshall, are increasingly training their fire on the running mate:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We seem to be witnessing the first stirrings of a backlash and a dawning realization that the 'Sarah Palin' we've heard so much about over the last few days is a fraud of truly comical dimensions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The McCain camp has made her signature issue shutting down the Bridge to Nowhere. But as The New Republic put it, that's just 'a naked lie.' &quot; Hmm. Subliminal reference, maybe?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;And pretty much the same thing has been written today in Newsweek, the Washington Post, the AP, the Wall Street Journal. Yesterday even Fox's Chris Wallace called out Rick Davis on it . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;On earmarks she's an even bigger crock. On the trail with McCain they're telling everyone that she's some kind of earmark slayer when actually, when she was mayor and governor, in both offices, she requested and got more earmarks than virtually any city or state in the country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Think about that. On the stump , not a single word that comes out of her mouth -- or not a single word that the McCain folks put in her mouth-- is anything but a lie. I know that sounds like hyperbole. But just go down the list. None of them bear out.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At the New Republic, Leon Wieseltier is rather exercised over Palin:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;These are not the times for right-wing screwball. The world is aflame and we have been pondering the knocked-up daughter of a pert and uncannily confident Alaskan mediocrity who was elevated to a national ticket for the purpose of changing the conversation. The Republicans wanted a new conversation, and they got one. Juno in Juneau! The anthropological harvest has been rich: what a carnival of double standards Palin provoked. I was unaware of the tender feelings of conservatives for sex outside of marriage. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin was chosen not for what she has done but for what she is -- for her value as an ideological illustration. Her distinction lies in her typicality, whereas the Democratic candidate is a monster of atypicality. She is, quite plainly, a stranger to skepticism. No McCain-like temperament here; only a vivacious dogmatism. As mayor of Wasilla she considered the banning of books from the town's library. Three of her five children exemplify articles of conservative faith. And she sees God in her own activities.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">How's this for a HUGE scandal? Obama uses the phrase &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; and has to deny that he was referring to the woman who described herself as a pit bull with lipstick. This led to a Drudge banner headline, and Hannity made it the lead story: Breaking News! When he asked Mike Huckabee about it, though, the former Arkansas governor said it was a common phrase and he'd cut Obama some slack.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And, not surprisingly, that other Rupert Murdoch property, the New York Post (which just endorsed McCain in a front-page editorial), hypes up the story with a screaming &quot;HOLY SOW!&quot; headline.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The reality-based reporting continues, as with this Wall Street Journal story:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin and John Bitney go way back. They were in the same junior-high band class. Mr. Bitney was a key aide in Gov. Palin's 2006 gubernatorial campaign. When she took office, she gave Mr. Bitney a job as her legislative director, and a few months later stood beside him at a news conference and praised his work.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot; 'Whatever you did, you did it right,' she told Mr. Bitney and his team. Seven weeks later she fired Mr. Bitney for what her spokeswoman now describes as 'poor job performance.'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;What happened in between? According to Mr. Bitney, Gov. Palin got a call from another old friend, Scott Richter, informing her that his wife, Debbie Richter, and Mr. Bitney were having an affair. Mr. Bitney had kept that secret from the governor, even as he told her of his divorce, he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Allies of Republican presidential nominee John McCain like to point out that his running mate is the governor of the largest state in the union. But at times, Alaska seems more like a small town, run by folks with overlapping professional, political and personal ties that can be difficult to untangle.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At Slate, Dahlia Lithwick offers Joe Biden (remember him?) some advice for taking on Palin and her body of work:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Everyone expects you to win the debate, and to trounce her on the substance. But the rules for debating Gov. Palin are different. If you lecture her, you'll be seen as a sexist bully. If you act too smart, you'll be seen as a sexist bully. If you condescend to her, you'll be seen as a sexist bully. So this longtime parliamentary debater (and longer-time female) is going to humbly offer you a few tips on how to debate a girl . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Your real problem with Palin is not actually going to be her gender. Assuming you don't gaze fixedly at her breasts or ask her to fetch you a coffee, you probably won't do anything truly career wrecking on the sexism front. Your real problem is that Palin is not a serious candidate. I don't mean to suggest that she is not a serious person or even a seriously impressive first-term governor with real potential to shake up national politics. Nor do I want to imply for an instant that Palin is not a serious competitor. I just want to state here what you will be unable to say out loud at the debate: That by every obvious metric -- experience, knowledge base, decades of public service, policy experience, understanding of the world -- Palin is an unserious candidate for the vice presidency of the United States. And as any college debater will tell you, it's far harder to beat a clumsy opponent than a good one . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;But if you even hint that Sarah Palin may be opining on the Israel-Palestinian peace process with something Piper pulled off Wikipedia that morning, you will look like a snotty professor lecturing an undergrad. And if you look like a snotty professor, you will come across as a sexist bully.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I bet some Dems are wishing that Tim Pawlenty had gotten the nod.</span></p>
