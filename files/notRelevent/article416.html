  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sunday's Pittsburgh Steelers-vs.-Cleveland Browns square-off, and three servings of &quot;America's Got Talent,&quot; pushed NBC to the top of the ratings heap -- the beleaguered network's sixth consecutive weekly ratings win.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here's a look at the week's touchdowns and fumbles:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WINNERS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Football, football and football. On Monday, ESPN's &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; coverage of the Dallas Cowboys' 41-37 home victory over the Philadelphia Eagles clocked 18.6 million viewers -- the biggest audience in the history of ad-supported cable TV. One night earlier, NBC's Pittsburgh-at-Cleveland football game copped 17.8 million viewers to become last week's No. 1-ranked broadcast and put NBC on top for the sixth week straight. And one night before that, ABC's Saturday college football game snagged that franchise's biggest Saturday college football audience in nearly two years: 12 million fans. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Plus, last week on Monday, ESPN's first game of the prime-time night, featuring Aaron Rodgers's first regular-season game as the Green Bay Packers' starting quarterback, copped 12.5 million viewers -- which, for one week, was cable's biggest audience of '08 to date and beat everything on broadcast TV that night, including the season debut of Fox's &quot;The Sarah Connor Chronicles.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;/Sarah Palin. Tina Fey's dead-on portrayal of Palin, along with an appearance by Olympic record-setter Michael Phelps, combined to deliver the biggest audience to NBC's late-night show since its first original episode after the 9/11 attacks. Early stats indicate the season debut was up 64 percent (in the country's top TV markets) vs. last year's season starter, which would put its audience around 10 million viewers. Final stats are due later this week.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ABC evening news/Sarah Palin. Charlie Gibson struck ratings gold with Palin's first sit-down since becoming the GOP veep hopeful, averaging nearly 10 million viewers to beat front-runner &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; by more than 2 mil.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Late Show&quot;/Barack Obama. CBS's David Letterman pulled off a rare win over NBC's &quot;Tonight Show&quot; Wednesday in the country's top TV markets with guest Dem presidential hopeful Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bill O'Reilly/Barack Obama. It all started two weeks ago, when O'Reilly's Fox News Channel show ran Part 1 of his four-part Obama interview and copped 6.6 million viewers -- the second-biggest audience in &quot;The O'Reilly Factor&quot; history. That ran on FNC the same night GOP presidential nominee John McCain gave his acceptance speech at his party's convention in St. Paul, Minn., setting a viewing record. Last week, on Monday, Part 2 of O'Reilly's Obama Saga averaged 4.6 million viewers -- at the exact same time Keith Olbermann's MSNBC show &quot;Countdown&quot; was running its Obama interview, which averaged 1.9 million. Olbermann's Obama and O'Reilly's Obama went mano a mano again the next night, Tuesday, and once again O'Reilly's Obama made mincemeat of Olbermann's Obama, 4.3 million viewers to 1.6 million, respectively. And finally, O'Reilly wrung the last drop out of his Obama on Wednesday night -- he had the Obama field to himself -- and 4.2 million tuned in.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Coco Chanel.&quot; Shirley MacLaine's phoned-in performance nonetheless attracted 5.2 million viewers Saturday at 8, making this Lifetime biopic basic cable's No. 2-ranked original flick of the year, behind only Lifetime's &quot;The Memory Keeper's Daughter&quot; (5.8 mil).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Saving Grace&quot;/&quot;Raising the Bar.&quot; TNT renewed both dramas for another season. Cop show &quot;SG&quot; averaged 4.4 million viewers this summer and winds up its second season in early '09; a 15-episode third season will kick in later next year. Meanwhile, lawyerly &quot;RtB&quot; is averaging 5.5 million viewers, making it ad-supported cable's top new series for '08 to date; the second season starts next year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">LOSERS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alma Awards. The trophy show logged just 3.52 million viewers Friday at 8 after getting preempted in Los Angeles, the country's No. 2 television market: The L.A. ABC station instead covered news of the fatal Metrolink/freight train crash. In Los Angeles, the Alma Awards broadcast finally aired -- at 1:35 a.m. Sunday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Fringe.&quot; Maybe the most highly anticipated new-series launch of the TV season, Tuesday's unveiling of J.J. Abrams's latest series attracted only 9.1 million viewers -- about 10 million fewer than his most recent series premiere, ABC's &quot;Lost&quot; in '04. In fact, it's the smallest opening for a J.J. series since &quot;Felicity,&quot; way back in September '98. On the bright side, Sunday's repeat did 75 percent of what the premiere had done among the network's target 18-to-49-year-old audience, after a repeat &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode, suggesting maybe there's a hit in there somewhere and the problem was the premiere's early start and lack of a lead-in show.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The Sarah Connor Chronicles.&quot; The season debut clocked 6.3 million -- a series low for an original of that show. (This past Monday it beat that record, logging just 5.6 million viewers.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;CMA Music Festival.&quot; ABC's Monday telecast attracted just 4.9 million viewers -- a 24 percent plunge compared with last year when it was broadcast six weeks earlier.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The week's 10 most watched programs, in order: NBC's Sunday football, CBS's &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; ESPN's &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; Vikings/Packers game, ABC's Saturday football, NBC's Wednesday &quot;America's Got Talent,&quot; NBC's Tuesday &quot;America's Got Talent,&quot; NBC's Thursday &quot;America's Got Talent,&quot; ESPN's &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; Broncos/Raiders game, NBC's Monday &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; and CBS's &quot;Two and a Half Men.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* * *</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Men's Vogue posts a blurb on &quot;Saturday Night Live's&quot; Amy Poehler, in which it is mentioned she's leaving the show around the time of the presidential election to have her baby, after which she will star in a midseason comedy series for NBC. Never mind that all of this was already laid out by NBC execs this summer: The item got picked up yesterday by The Reporters Who Cover Television With Their Heads in the Sand, leading to such breathless reports as &quot;Amy Poehler Moves Up SNL Exit,&quot; &quot;Amy Poehler's . . . decided to kick 'Saturday Night Live' to the curb sooner than expected,&quot; &quot;Hillary Clinton, oops Amy Poehler's leaving 'SNL' -- Say it isn't so&quot; and, our fave, &quot;No joke: Amy Poehler's leaving 'Saturday Night Live.' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sigh.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Back in July, NBC's programming chief, Ben Silverman, announced at the Thank God We're Working Summer TV Press Tour 2008 that his network had signed the &quot;SNL&quot; star to headline a new Thursday night sitcom, to be created by the guys behind the Americanization of the Britcom &quot;The Office.&quot; The as-yet-unnamed comedy would debut in March, Silverman said. Both Silverman and &quot;SNL&quot; exec producer Lorne Michaels explained, in separate press-tour Q&amp;A sessions, that they hoped Poehler would be on &quot;SNL&quot; through early November. &quot;Amy will be [on the show] until her baby is born, which hopefully will be just after the election,&quot; Michaels joked during his session with TV critics and reporters, adding, &quot;I think she'll be with us through the election.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After that, Michaels said, they expected the very pregnant Poehler to take time off to spend with her baby. And, after that, Silverman explained, NBC plans to debut her prime-time series in March.</span></p>
