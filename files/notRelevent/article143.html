  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Each week, the country's top reporters join moderator Gwen Ifill for an in-depth discussion of the week's top news from Washington and around the world. The longest-running news and public affairs program on PBS, &quot;Washington Week and National Journal&quot; features journalists -- not pundits -- lending insight and perspective to the week's important news stories. Now, Ifill brings &quot;Washington Week&quot; online.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ifill was online Thursday, Oct. 23 at noon ET to take questions and comments.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The transcript follows. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ifill is moderator and managing editor of &quot;Washington Week&quot; and senior correspondent for &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.&quot; Ifill spent several years as a &quot;Washington Week&quot; panelist before taking over the moderator's chair in October 1999. Before coming to PBS, she spent five years at NBC News as chief congressional and political correspondent. Her reports appeared on &quot;NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw,&quot; &quot;Today,&quot; &quot;Meet the Press&quot; and MSNBC. Ifill joined NBC News from The New York Times where she covered the White House and politics. She also covered national and local affairs for The Washington Post, Baltimore Evening Sun, and Boston Herald American.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot; Washington Week with Gwen Ifill and National Journal,&quot; airs on WETA/Channel 26, Fridays at 8 p.m. and Saturdays at 6:30 p.m. ( check local listings).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: Hello everyone. Happy to be back chatting. Fire away.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bronx, N.Y.: Hello Gwen -- speedy recovery to you! Why are some Republicans saying that Gen. Colin Powell (ret.) is backing Sen. Obama because he's black? After more than 40 years of service to the United States, that's incredibly insulting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: Hi and thanks for your good wishes. The ankle is healing nicely.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">All I can say about the Colin Powell blowback is that I can guarantee the same people criticizing him now would have been happy to praise him to the skies if he had endorsed their candidates. It remains an open question why such criticism is only race-based when the target is a person of color. (Anyone suggesting race loyalty when the endorsed and the endorser are white?)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Atlanta: How would you rate the debate performance of the vice-presidential candidates, as well as your own?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: It would have been nice if both candidates had come prepared to debate each other. My questions were designed to elicit discussion, not interrogation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Still, the feedback I have received indicates that most viewers saw through all that, listened closely to some of the pretty illuminating answers and non-answers, and reached their own conclusions -- which is what I was hoping for.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Silver Spring, Md.: Congrats on being immortalized on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; by Queen Latifah. What'd you think of her impression?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: All hail the Queen.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: As you have watched this election process from the beginning, what is your guess on who will win the White House?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: Nice try, but I don't do guesses. Besides, we'll know in just a few days, so what's the point?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: We continue to be avid viewers who thoroughly enjoy Washington Week. You do an outstanding job. Is the current Democratic congressional leadership -- Reid and Pelosi -- likely to continue in the next session, or have their positions on certain legislative issues (e.g. offshore drilling) placed either of them in jeopardy?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: The Democrats at this moment seem supremely unconcerned about their own political peril.But anyone who inherits this economy and these wars should certainly realize that immediate political advantage can fade quickly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anonymous: How are your negotiations for a $150,000 clothing allowance from PBS coming?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: Ha!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Not a &quot;real&quot; American, evidently: Gwen, isn't all this &quot;real&quot; American palaver by certain candidates just code-language, the verbal equivalent of a wink to voters who pine for the &quot;good old days&quot; of racial segregation -- just like Jesse Helms's notorious TV commercial in North Carolina a few years depicting the white hands of the applicant whose failure to get hired was supposedly unfair because of affirmative action? And the expression &quot;real Virginia&quot; evokes a geographical part of the state where a senatorial candidate (mistakenly, as it turned out) felt he could utter &quot;macaca&quot; with crowd approval.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: I am not willing to concede that everyone who uses this &quot;real America&quot; shorthand is engaged in winking code. But if they are, it sure doesn't seem to be working.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Congrats on being immortalized on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; by Queen Latifah: I was just so relieved that it wasn't Kenan Thompson in drag.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: You know, that had occurred to me too. Love Kenan Thompson, but don't want to be him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re:&quot;(Anyone suggesting race loyalty when the endorsed and the endorser are white?)&quot; Although I agree with the crux of your point, I think that would be an irrelevancy in most campaigns, as both of the people running are generally white. Now, if a white person endorses a white person of the opposite political affiliation and they happen to be running against a black person, then I do think that it would raise some eyebrows.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: You mean like Joe Lieberman?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: Vice-Presidential Debate: I want to congratulate you on your performance during the vice-presidential debate. I initially was disappointed with the lack of follow-ups and attempts for clarification, but after some time and thought, I realized that you didn't give either candidate something to push-back against or any question to protest as &quot;unfair. Was that your take or plan?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: I did not change a single question I had prepared because of that silly brouhaha over my supposed fairness. Anyone who has wached the way I do my job (when there are NOT 70 million people watching) could have predicted how I would run this debate. After all, it wasn't my first time at the rodeo.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.: Do you get an feel for the direction each candidate will take up in terms of alternative energy (solar, wind, etc.)?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: They both have said they favor the expansion of solar, wind, etc. They are less clear about nuclear energy, clean coal, etc. And neither can commit to spending what it will take to develop emerging technologies at a time when the nation will be cash strapped.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">St. Paul, Minn.: Hi Gwen -- glad to hear that you're on the mend. I've been following this election more closely than any other I've ever voted in, including the polls. How do you account for the conflicting messages we seem to be receiving? Obama is pulling away, McCain is closing the gap, Pennsylvania is out of reach for McCain, Pennsylvania is tightening ... all at the same time. It's driving me a little batty.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: Yes, we have all reached that point in the campaign where it's best to take a deep breath. If you read enough polls, you can find a lot of apparently conflicting information. Just keep in mind that It Will All Be Over in just a few days.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Toronto: Lately we have been hearing Republicans describe certain Democratic policies as &quot;socialist.&quot; I was wondering if you think this word is used to suggest fiscal irresponsibility (such as &quot;liberal&quot;) or dangerous ideology (such as &quot;communist&quot;)?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: Ummm. Sure.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kansas City, Mo.: Hi Gwen. I love Washington Week! I've been missing you as moderator the past few weeks -- your fill-ins can't compare. As an undecided voter from the swing state of Missouri, I was lucky enough to attend rallies for both Sen. McCain and Sen. Obama in the past week. It was an interesting comparison. I was disappointed by the tone at the McCain rally -- it was full of negativity and booing. Is that supposed to appeal to someone like me, who leans toward McCain on issues but is tired of the politics of division?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: Hi. Never fear. I will be back Friday night, with the crutches just out of sight.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thanks for the observations from tipping-point land. We'll be watching you out in Missouri on the 4th.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: &quot;You mean like Joe Lieberman?&quot;: Relevancy is a qualifier. Joe Lieberman's contrarian habits are predictable and simply match a pattern of behavior. Colin Powell's endorsement was much more of a surprise and departure, so people are going to wonder what the underlying causes really are.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: I would agree with you if I hadn't watched Powell speak for a half an hour on Meet the Press on his &quot;underlying causes&quot; and reasoning. Funny that no matter how much he explained, there would always be more questions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Plus, last time I checked, Lieberman was still a Democrat on any number of policy points. I don't think that makes his support of McCain that predictable.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Just keep in mind that It Will All Be Over in just a few days.: That's what we thought in 2000 also!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: Now, now.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Seattle: With Sen. McConnell in a tight race and Rep. Boehner likely to lose more than 15 seats from his side of the aisle, have you seen indications of leadership changes among Republicans?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: It's possible to be premature on all this. I think it's fine to leave speculation about leadership changes until after the election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Austin, Texas: How much on average do you pay for the clothes you wear on-air? (Seriously. I'm a guy, and I want to have an idea how much it costs for a woman to dress well and professionally, as you do.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: If you find a woman who would answer that question online, I'd like to meet her.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But I think you can assume that, of the two women on the stage at the VP debate,I was not the more expensively dressed one (although I have not seen the medical bill yet for the crutches).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lake Canada, N.Y.: To me, the startling part of the Powell endorsement was what went along with it: a condemnation of GOP tactics and a devastating attack on Palin's qualifications. This was out of character for a man not known for extravagent statements. Sounds like he truly has been appalled with what has happened to his party since the Reagan years, and this was his chance to explode (in his quiet fashion).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: I found it most interesting that he is the only big name I have seem attack the premise of the Obama-is-a-Muslim rumor, not just its substance.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cleveland: Gwen, I'm curious -- you've seen Sarah Palin up close and have asked her questions. Is there an objective view you have on her qualifications to be president? Say, compared to Biden? You must have a personal view, which you probably feel you can't reveal, but objectively this seems to be a large issue in what is dragging down McCain right now. Any thoughts?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: As am sure you know, it's not my job to tell you what to think about candidates -- or even what i think. Matter of fact, I'd bet I trust your thoughts as much as my own.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anonymous: As a long-time fan of yours, I was disappointed by your debate performance. Your questions weren't being answered and you did nothing to prod the candidates to answer your questions. I think the hype your upcoming book received influenced your performance in a negative way.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: Read my earlier response on my approach to debates. It is my job to spur engagement from both candidates, not to grill one or the other. I am completely certain others would have done it differently, but I am equally as sure little else would have been gained.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There is a line I observe between covering the story and being the story. Interviews are different from debates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lesson Learned: Overall, I'd say all four debate moderators did just fine, because they stayed out of the way, didn't try to make themselves the stars, didn't call attention to themselves and didn't ask foolish &quot;gotcha&quot; questions that do nothing to help the electorate make its decision. I would say that the Democratic blacklisting of ABC, which conducted a miserably stupid debate during the primaries, had its intended effect.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: Gosh I agreed with you -- right up until that last line.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Los Angeles: Why do you folks call yourselves &quot;journalists&quot; when even you on Oct. 17 tried to smear Joe the Plumber rather than even mention Sen. Obama's statement that it is a good thing to spread the wealth around.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: Since I was sitting on my couch with my foot elevated on Oct. 17, I can only assume someone has encouraged you to suggest a smear where none existed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Contrarian habits&quot;: Powell is well known as not agreeing with neoconservative foreign policy (which McCain has completely embraced) and as generally socially liberal. Maybe the people who think his endorsement is racially based never bothered learning his political views. There is a reason that both parties have tried to recruit him as a presidential candidate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: Interesting point.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Although I have not seen the medical bill yet for the crutches: Those aren't clothes, those are accessories!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: Everything is definition, isn't it?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Seattle: On your show tomorrow I assume you will address the primary issues at this point in the Presidential campaign. Can you give us a preview of what these issues are?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: We will have a great show tomorrow night, examining the candidates' closing arguments and their closing challenges.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">David Shribman of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, Jeanne Cummings of Politico, John Dickerson of Slate, Shailagh Murray of the Washington Post and Michael Viqueira of NBC News will provide the roundup.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thanks for chatting!</span></p>
