  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. -- The final presidential debate was held Wednesday night in a converted basketball arena at Hofstra University, but John McCain and Barack Obama might just as well have been battling on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, a 31-mile commute to the west.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Dow Jones industrial average scored its most precipitous fall ever last week, followed by its biggest one-day surge on Monday; it closed Wednesday after a breathtaking 733-point drop. The stock-market roller coaster set the stage for a debate that was dominated at the beginning by the nation's precarious financial situation and what the next president might do about it. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the opening question, the two scrapped over the affections of an Ohio plumber who spoke to Obama last week at a campaign stop. McCain said the man -- Joe Wurzelbacher, referred to by both as &quot;Joe the plumber&quot; -- had expressed concerns that Obama's economic plan might mean he couldn't afford to buy a small business because of the tax burden.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;He's been watching some ads of Sen. McCain,&quot; Obama replied. He said his tax cuts would help the middle class while McCain's were directed at the affluent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The 90-minute forum was McCain's last chance to curb the momentum that has helped Obama open a small but consistent lead in nationwide polls, and an edge in a series of battleground states. The debate wasn't the only event that could change the campaign's course -- a national security surprise or personal scandal still could shake things up -- but it presumably was the final one under McCain's control.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Arizona senator, a master of comeback politics, started out with a friendlier tone than he did in the first two debates, saying it was &quot;good to be here&quot; with him again.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama was cool, careful and low-key, wearing a red tie and sporting an American flag pin in his lapel. The two sat on swivel chairs at a horseshoe-shaped table with moderator Bob Schieffer of CBS.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain, wearing a blue striped tie, was crisply aggressive about the economy and challenged Obama to name a single time he had challenged the leadership of his party.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When Obama sought to link McCain to President Bush -- a theme throughout the campaign -- McCain shot back: &quot;Sen. Obama, I am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama replied, &quot;Essentially, you're proposing eight more years of the same thing.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Each candidate touted the proposals they unveiled this week aimed at easing the pain Americans are likely to feel from the credit crunch, stock market slump and economic slowdown.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And both blasted the other for the negative ads and attacks directed at them, and McCain accused Obama of breaking his word to accept public financing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I don't mind being attacked for the next three weeks,&quot; Obama replied. &quot;What the American people can't afford is four more years of failed economic policies.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Tuesday, McCain proposed help for the jobless -- for two years, they wouldn't have to pay income taxes on unemployment benefits -- and for seniors, who could delay withdrawing funds from their retirement accounts while the markets are so low. He also called for cutting the 15% capital gains tax rate in half.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama on Monday backed a tax credit for businesses that hire new full-time workers, a 90-day moratorium on some home foreclosures and extended unemployment benefits.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A cascade of economic catastrophe has driven all three of the fall debates and the presidential campaign itself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Of course, there are limits to the impact of even the most caustic remarks or dramatic exchanges. &quot;A debate will change the atmospherics vs. changing the fundamentals,&quot; Republican strategist Kevin Madden said, &quot;and this campaign is being driven much more by the fundamentals.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Those fundamentals have favored Obama. In a USA TODAY/Gallup Poll taken Friday through Sunday, 85% of those surveyed rated the economy as poor and predicted it was getting worse. Obama was preferred over McCain on handling the economy by 14 percentage points, and he far outdistanced McCain as someone who &quot;understands the problems Americans face in their daily lives&quot; and as someone who &quot;has a clear plan for solving the nation's problems.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Still, partisans on both sides agreed the race wasn't over yet.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The public is still taking the two candidates' measure,&quot; Illinois Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a Chicago Democrat who is close to Obama, said as he arrived at the debate site.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;No. 1, no one should ever count out John McCain under any circumstances,&quot; said Todd Harris, an aide to McCain in his 2000 presidential bid, &quot;and No. 2, in a race that has seen as many twists and turns over the last 18 months as this one, it would be silly to assume we don't have at least one more.&quot; <br /></span></p>
