  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Purple States citizen journalists Elizabeth Gotsdiner and Bert Sobanik were online Thursday, Oct. 30 at 2 p.m. ET to discuss the documentary video project, and what they've learned on their travels through swing states ahead of Tuesday's election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The transcript follows.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: Hey everyone! It's Lizz!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dallas: What is the deal with Obama's plan. I first heard that everyone under 250,000 will get a tax break. Yesterday, Obama said now everyone will get it who makes under 200,000. Now we are hearing from Biden it is going to be 150,000. Is anyone going to get anything? Why the change in the last couple of days before election? Should he not change it then right after he wins? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: I've been hearing all this same rhetoric. This is one issue that makes me uncomfortable with Obama. For starters, I think distribution of wealth is not the best idea. I believe in earning what's yours. Initially I found $250 K to be to little a number, but as the number has continued to drop I've been very turned off. Plus, these developments have happened after early voting, and maybe this would have swung some voters the other way. I have chosen to wait until voting day for a reason.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">St. Petersburg, Fla.: Many voters or potential voters feel that the two major parties are both failures in their own rights. It's apparent that the American populace clearly wields no true influence over its government (just look at the opposition to the bailout). As someone who shares concerns about civil liberties and war, but also about the failures of the welfare state and our undeniably socialist moves (especially the nationalization taking place right now), do you see any viable alternative to my motivation to vote third-party, if nothing else as a &quot;protest vote&quot;? Do you expect to see a spike in third-party votes this election season?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: Third party candidates are candidates, and deserve the attention and recognition that comes along with running for the presidency. The mainstream media hasn't given them much time of day, but ya wonder what came first, the chicken or the egg? Is it due to the lack of coverage that they are not heard, or the do not recieve coverage because not enough voters identify with them?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I know a number of voters who are voting third party as &quot;protest vote&quot;. The reasoning is logical enough, but I unfortunately am not familiar enough with these candidates to vote for them. What if I voted on principle alone and later found out that I disagreed with the fundamentals of the candidates? Bert has said this in the past, and I will reitterate. Vote your conscience.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Brooklyn, N.Y.: How do swing-state voters react to the name-calling and negative campaigning? Do you see any credit going to the candidate who avoids doing this, or has negative campaigning in this cycle -- like many others -- worked to move swing voters?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: We in Maine are among the few states that actually divide out our minuscule number of electoral votes. There is talk that one will go to John McCain from the eastern district. That said I blanch when I see men one of whom will lead our country, take cheap shots during a commercial or a debate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When I saw Huckabee getting all worked up at the debate in Myrtle Beach about how Iran would &quot;enter the gates of hell&quot; if they fired on one of our destroyers in the Straits I felt a little ashamed for him since it was so out of character from the way I knew him at the start of his campaign. He changed his demeanor entirely once the GOP handlers &quot;remade&quot; him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">San Francisco: What steps are being undertaken to ensure that we have a &quot;democratic&quot; election, so that people are not disenfranchised again in swing states like Ohio, Florida and New Mexico? In what ways can journalists be diligent in getting real information out as opposed to parroting what they are being told, so that we can guarantee that the election has allowed for the sanctity of the vote?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: Honestly, I was a little put off by Bush taking Florida in the last election. I voted for Kerry. But after I spoke with Kerry a few weeks ago in New Hampshire I now regret that vote. I wonder, though, how disenchanted I would have truly been during the last election had I known more about those guys... because I honestly really didn't know much. It was my first election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Super delegates and electoral votes confuse me, and jeopardize the importance of my vote in my mind. But it still counts, and its still important! I was rooting for Ron Paul for some time, and I took criticism for supporting him. My point was if we vote honestly then we can see our faults. We can see what people care about, and who they truly support. But if people keep voting for the two main parties, how can we dog that? I mean, they are still getting the majority of the votes, right?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: The states themselves are responsible for maintaining the integrity of their voting system.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I would welcome oversight from internationals (from friendly Nations of course) who have no axe to grind here, to provide oversight, much as we have done in countries where election procedures are suspect.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pentagon City, Va.: I thought it was a tax increase if you make over 250K like Joe the Plumber, and a tax cut under 200K. So 200-250K would be status quo, i suppose.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: Sorry, I don't have the published answers in front of me. Yes, I meant tax increase. Now, not to say that I think higher tax brackets should get tax cuts, and if the amount of money was more around one million and up I would be more comfortable with &quot;taxing the rich&quot;. I just don't see $150-$250 K as being enough to tax along side the very rich.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Realameri, CA:&quot;distribution of wealth is not the best idea. I believe in earning what's yours.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">News flash: The U.S. has had income taxes since 1861.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: The Bush tax cuts during a time of war are definitely a redistribution of wealth. The rich get richer, right now, later on when the debt gets distributed, I guarantee that the Lion's share ends up on the backs of the middle class,.....if there even is one at that time.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York, N.Y.: Can you tell us about the things you found most surprising when you got to interact with the candidates directly?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: Well, at first I was terrified and nervous to speak to them. I thought that I was going to make a fool of myself, or they were going to be mean to me or laugh at my level of political knowledge. As time passed, I realized I had control, and the last thing they want to happen is for a camera to catch them being crude to a curious citizen. So I learned to take advantage of that. I think they are more scared of us than we are of them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rolla, Mo.: Look, this isn't that hard. Obama has always said if you make less than $250,k you won't see your taxes go up. Above $250,k you'll see an increase. If you make less than $200,k you'll get a tax cut (between the two, no impact). Those under $150k will get a tax credit in addition to a cut. Can you understand?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: The promises made during campaign season have a way of giving way to reality once the candidate takes office. The deficits of recent time will become unacceptable to our creditors soon, at that time I think there will be another &quot;new deal&quot; where we have to start paying for more of our programs as we go instead of &quot;later on&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shartlesville, Pa.: I don't understand what your point is in this video, Lizz. If Barack Obama is aiming too high with his plan, and John McCain is aiming too low, isn't the best idea to vote with the one who's at least trying?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: I wouldn't necessarily say aiming high or low. I think it's more a matter of practicality and possibility. If McCain was a little more generous in healthcare I would much more comfortable with him, but I disagree with forcing people to pay into a pool for everyone. My main concern with Universal healthcare is the quality and availability of care. I don't see us holding our position of having the best medical practice in the world if we don't have restrictions on it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Brooklyn, N.Y.: Undecided still? Well there must be good reason. What are the issues that are keeping you from deciding? Perhaps the two major candidates seems like a choice between two evils. What are some of the best third-party options and what does voting for them actually accomplish? Also, I try to pick the issues that tie most closely into my concerns and the concerns of my family, and then whatever candidate's views are best, I support.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Video: Still Undecided Just Days Before the Election (washingtonpost.com, Oct. 29)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: Of course all voting is relative to the voter. I'm pretty much decided at this point, but so nervous and skeptical about it. I wish our options were better. That's the truth. But who knows, I might get in that voting both and vote for Bill McKay.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Durham, N.C.: I saw the video today. How can you be undecided? You have one guy happy to be in the quagmire in Iraq and Afghanistan, and one guy who wants to leave. You have one guy who wants universal health coverage, and one guy who wants to throw you a tax credit. You have one guy who wants to &quot;drill baby drill,&quot; and one guy who will drag his feet on drilling. You have one guy who wants more regulation of the banking industry, and one guy who really doesn't. One guy who raises money from corporate bundlers, and one guy who raises money $86 bucks at a time. This is about as black and white as it gets.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: To be entirely honest, everything they say are &quot;promises&quot;. I found myself growing exceedingly skeptical as the year has passed, and now I'm in a rut and a hard place. For starters, They both want out of war, McCain just has a longer time table for that to actually happen. And as for Obama, he has changed his stance on his time table. Starting in the primaries he said &quot;the day I become president I will begin bringing home one to two brigades a month...&quot; now he says he will sit down and discuss it. With no difinate time table. That for one has frusterated me.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">NAFTA was another point for me. Initially I was against globalization and free trade, and I believed Obama would be the guy to bring jobs back. Well, as I have been researching NAFTA for a paper I'm writing in Foreign Policy, I found Obama has no plan or policy in place about NAFTA. I don't like how vague he has become.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Universal healthcare... not my bag baby. I'll end this novel on that note :)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: There is more to a candidate than their campaign promises, remember first bush, &quot;read my lips&quot;, but there were so many more, the promises are only binding until the election is won, then come the excuses, and the need to pay back the &quot;big&quot; contributors. Obama, in Flint said he would increase the size of the military!, and also that he would only remove &quot;Combat&quot; troops from Iraq. Please do not think that the Dem candidate is not getting corporate &quot;bundles&quot; the point is if you watch real close the two front runners are proposing near identical leadership, with only tiny shades of difference to thrill the electorate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Vincennes, Ind.: If people are tempted to vote -- again -- for the lesser of two evils, maybe they should stop worrying about how their vote might affect that horse race and use it to escape the &quot;lesser evil&quot; trap? It's simple. Find someone who hates your lesser evil, and agree to remove your votes from that horse race -- one from each candidate -- and cast them honestly for the third party or independent candidate you'd really like to see in office. Or show up and either cast a &quot;blank&quot; for the race, or write in anyone from Ron Paul to Homer Simpson (knowing your vote won't be counted) in order to increase the number of &quot;none of the above&quot; votes this year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We don't have to keep puking over the results you get if enough of us just get off the merry-go-round!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This idea is explained in more detail at VoteBuddy.org and VotePact.org.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Comments?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: I understand your point of view. I'm been listening to it for months now. And I agree with it. But I don't know the third party candidates, and after the year I've endured and had to learn about the &quot;Repulocrats&quot;, as they are so often called, I do not have to time to brush up on the third party candidates. With the next election I will keep a closer eye on them though :)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I have considered this year my learning curve.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Orlando Fla.: Hi Bert, hi Lizz. In 2000, Ralph Nader split the Democratic vote and perhaps cost the Democrats the White House. His rationale was that this would cause an upswing in left wing activism -- even if it hurt the Democratic party. What results do you hope to achieve from your support of third party candidates?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: I've chosen not to support a third party candidate...so I will just let Bert have this one ;)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: The problem here is not that Nader took to many votes,it is that he did not get enough to win. Heck if your candidate cannot win the election without the votes of another voter's candidate maybe they need to strengthen their platform instead of blaming someone else.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ross Perot did not screw up Geo H Bushes election in favor of Clinton, he simply did not get enough to win himself (he got mine and won several counties here in Maine)!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If any candidate is so weak that they cannot stand out in a larger field than just &quot;us or them&quot; then they do not deserve the office. This election will see more third party voters than ever, increasing the chance that issue sensitive elections may occur sometime soon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Just because their are voters who cannot see beyond two candidates (that are largely shoved down their throats) does not make me feel that I have to vote for Red or Blue.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Q and A: Q: How do you know when you've become an &quot;inside the Beltway&quot; type? A: When you type phrases like &quot; I just don't see $150-$250 K as being... rich.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: I have a few questions lined up similar to this one. Let me try to clarify...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">People that are making this amount of money are well off. I'm not saying there not. They are also people that get up every day, go to work, work hard, work harder, don't get government aid, pay for everything they own (even though they probably credit some) and created that life for themself. They also pay for their children's college. I'm completely novice at this. So don't pick on me too much. I'm still learning. I'm not sure exact numbers, but I do know that lower income will recieve government aid all the want. So why should we tax people in the upper MIDDLE class to pay for everyone else? How does breaking even and working harder make it fair?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: Is the race over? It seems like Obama is running away with it, but is that what the two of you have seen as well?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: No!! The race is not over until November 4th-5th. It's going to be an exciting week! More so, it's going to be an exciting four years! Who ever gets into office sit back and relax, it's going to be one hell of a show!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: Graduated tax structure:&quot;For starters, I think distribution of wealth is not the best idea. &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So you favor a flat tax?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And you can read about the tax plan on Obama's website. $250k for families, $200k for individuals.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: Mike Huckabee's platform of switching to a flat rate consumption tax, got my attention right away. Consumption tax would insure that those who are contributing the most to resource depletion and global warming pay the most taxes for doing so. It would also be much easier to administrate, freeing up hours and hours for people all over the country in early April. Also this would reward people who save to buy a home or send their children to college since saving money would not cause you to pay taxes on interest, or the earnings. Our current economic crisis did not come about because Americans are saving to much.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The IRS is a huge bureaucratic beast, specially managed so that big earners in our society do not pay the Taxes proportionate to the benefits that our society affords them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Reality, Tex.: You both should not vote. You have no grasp of any of the platforms, nor a grasp of reality. Study up a bit, find out what is important to you -- since the choices and postions are stark. So, if you are undecided, wait until 2012...do not vote now, you are of clueless.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: That's just rude, dude.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York, N.Y.: You guys have been around the country. How divided are we? Is the rift repairable?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: I wouldn't even say we are divided. Yes, there are strong republican and strong democrats... but I think it's best to describe them as strong McCain supporters and strong Obama supporters. At the end of the day we are all American, and everywhere I've been I've gotten nothing but a deep sense of pride and honor for my country. If not from the candidates, from the American people. Not one time in this past year, or in my life for that matter, when I have been to a rally and heard our national anthem did I not get goose bumps. Love it. :)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: The country is nowhere near as divided as the candidates and the media portray it to be. The people who are polarized in party dogma are out there, however on the Purple States trail the more we learned (my observation) the more tolerant and understanding we became.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Everywhere I went I was able to talk to people who were different in race, gender, creed, political stripe, and profession without the feeling that they would hate me for holding my own beliefs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dallas, Tex.: I think trying to pin down the candidates on the exact details of their plan is unrealistic. Neither candidate know the full scope of any one of these issues, and the process is sufficiently complicated and fluid that you need to adjust frequently. It's sort of like a job interview, no one really knows every single detail of the job they are interviewing for. That's why I would look at a more generalized view, to get a sense of the candidates philosophy, because the details are important but they can't be set in stone.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: Agreed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sedona, Ariz.: Ha! Liz, you are hilarious. It's a circus and you've been following the circus from town to town. Does it make you lose and gain respect for the state of American Politics?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: Hehe. A complete circus. I particulary like the schedule of the rallies. Watching them come in like red carpet celebrities with &quot;eye of the tiger&quot; playing... that's the part where I slap my knee the whole time!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alrington, Va.: No matter who wins taxes will eventually rise. Someone has to pay for the bailout and the bill will come due sooner rather than later</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: Truer words have not been said, the &quot;bail-out&quot; is actually more of a &quot;keep it going just a little longer&quot;. There have been no fundamental changes in our financial system to modify the basic causes of the problem. Never once did I hear a call to repeal any of the bad legislation that led to this mess.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Just more monkeying around with the once good system that we gave up in the name of &quot;De-Regulation&quot; and &quot;fair mortgage practices&quot; all which were written by the finance industries themselves.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">How does breaking even and working harder make it fair?: Earth to Elizabeth: Life's not fair. Get over it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: I believe in personal responsibility. At the end of the day my actions were my choices. I have no one to blame but myself. Then you would say, that having things unfair are OK. That's perfectly fine. Enjoy your matrix.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Vincennes, Ind.: Any voter in a &quot;safe&quot; red or blue state who hates the Demolican status quo has no reason to vote for either Obama or McCain. After all, if Obama, say, is going to win your state, he doesn't need your vote -- and your vote won't help McCain. So why not take the opportunity to use your vote to indicate exactly what direction you want the country to move in, by picking the minor candidate closest to your views?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: WOW, that is a new spin on don't waste your vote, and as much as I like it I still feel like I want to vote for the Candidate that I would like to see in the presidency regardless of the long shot. The way I look at it is if I can ignore the polls, the media bombardment and the hoards of well or not so well wishers, so could every one else!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I will vote libertarian, and maybe enough disgusted US citizens will do the same that we get some action going!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: This is my third presidential election cycle I will vote in and I am appalled at how the media has tripped over itself in building up Obama. For the first time in my life I am NOT proud of this Country for allowing BIG MEDIA to exert so much control over national policy</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: This I can identify with. The agenda setting can be aggrevating sometimes. I have found the Obama supporters to much louder and have larger masses. When I am having conversations with people in my neck of the woods about Obama and McCain, however, the Obama supporters have lacked the knowledge of his policies opposed to those of McCain's. This isn't speaking for everyone, everywhere though.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;So don't pick on me&quot;: You're in The Washington Post, reporting on Politics! You signed up to get picked on.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That said, I think you're doing well and I hope to read more of you in the future.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Boston, Mass.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: Yo Boston, we are &quot;off the streeters&quot; just getting our fifteen minutes of fame. Pick if you must, but also try to identify the lack of polish as being the genuine reactions of people new to this game, and the media is definitely part of the &quot;game&quot; in politics.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: ya take that!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Princeton, N.J.: I am 70 years old and I can tell you that you can live very well on 100k a year in a very expensive place. If 200k is not rich, it is certainly very well-to-do. Look, the overall US tax rate is 26.1 percent and Sweden's is 50.1 percent. Not only did Sweden have higher per capita GDP growth, but their people get high quality health care, free education including college and they live longer and are happier. Low taxes are always good; high taxes are not always bad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: The US situation is nothing like Sweden's. We are multicultural and they are not. They are starting to be and their system is starting to break down. We should be proud of what we have here and continue to support the constitution and what it says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Universal health care&quot;: Have you actually read what Obama is proposing for health care? We are not talking about universal health care. What he wants is that anyone who wants health insurance can get it for a reasonable price, even if they have pre-existing conditions. He's not forcing anyone to have any particular type of insurance, except if you have kids - then they have to be insured. But this is very different from what Canada and many European countries have, which actually is universal health care.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: The way I see it is the Health Care Insurance industry in this nation is so huge and profitable that it cannot be changed even regulated by an act of congress. The figures I keep getting show that somewhere between 35-50% of the money spent on health care goes for the administration of health care. Claims processing, profits, actuaries, appeals, malpractice insurance, up to half the cash is going to profits and paper work! It would take a true giant among men to be able to push that big money grabbin' operation back into what was once a non-profit &quot;mutual' industry. Another poster child for &quot;de-regulation&quot;.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Go ahead: Liz,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By now we all know who you will vote for, so just go ahead and vote for him. Whether he wins or not you won't feel as bad as you would for voting for the other guy. You don't have to prove anything to anyone. Being undecided at this point is a joke. You are leaning towards one side, and making one million (not under) is rich to you, vote your conscious/wallet. Maybe you just might get that guy in office who will continue giving you the tax credit or cut you are looking for, after all you have worked so hard to earn yours, and you should keep it, forget everyone else.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: No, not forget everyone else at all. Personal responsibility. I would not consider someone at this point foolish for being undecided. I've spent this entire year learning and absorbing. There's a lot out there. Taking everything in has been quite overwhelming. This entire experience has been quite overwhelming. In the greatest sense.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dallas, Tex.: Obama has been consistent on his tax plan -- he says it two ways though. No tax increases under K$250 $250K and tax cuts under K$200. $200.K Really there will be tax cuts under K$200, $200,K K$200 to K$250 $250K will be the same.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both candidates have two different economic plans, bottom-up OR top-down. Neither is particularly new or earth shattering. We had a structure similar to Obama's plan in the Clinton years and a structure similar to Bush's plan in the Bush years. History can tell us a lot in thins respect.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: The Clinton years economy was in large part due to Alan Greenspan's &quot;overheating&quot; the economy with excessively low interest rates (see the results?) and also that was before we had the Clinton double whammy of &quot;NAFTA&quot; and &quot;permanent most favored nation trade status for China&quot; these two pieces of bad trade legislation make it highly unlikely that either candidate can bring back the &quot;good old days&quot; of American Manufacturing glory.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Los Angeles, Calif.: Are you decided on who to vote for? Who? How long have you known? When did you know? How did you come to that decision? How confident are you that you are making the right decision? Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: I am finally a decided voter. Ah! You asked the golden question I am so hesitant to respond to! I've known, and danced on egg shells, for a few days, really. I was doing an international interview with CNN, and I kind of showed my true colors. HA! Confident? No way. Uncomfortable to the max. But I don't see it being any other way.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: I think people look at tax breaks in too much of black and white terms. Many people graduate from college, make far less than even 150K, are saddled with student loans and find that they are paying more in taxes then those who make more money but can afford to pay accountants to do their taxes thus finding them all the loopholes the rest of us know nothing about.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That is maddening.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It is not just &quot;lazy&quot; people who are benefiting, it's new grads, those who would prefer to work in non profits but can't afford to due to health care costs and tax rates, families who can't afford the day care to have more than one parent work, and all those who don't live in the cities where it is very rare to see anyone make 150-250K.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: The lack of health care coverage in this country stifles innovation and small business growth. I worked with people who were dying to open their own business, but &quot;I would lose the family health plan&quot; also I worked with people who had great ideas for new innovation but had to stay with &quot;the old grind&quot; just because they could not afford heath care insurance if they pursued new opportunities. Meanwhile we provide health care to people in prison. This one makes my head hurt. All the other industrialized trading partners subsidize their manufacturing base by providing health care, look at our manufacturing base lately?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I don't see us holding our position of having the best medical practice in the world if we don't have restrictions on it. : WHO ranks the U.S. 37th in health care -- above Slovenia, but below Costa Rica. If you rank the U.S. and the 12 other wealthiest developed countries according to the 16 basic public health statistics (infany mortality, life expectency, etc.), we rank last or next to last in each category. Other wealthy countries get much better health care and they pay less than half of what we pay. The evidence is overwhelming.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: What? do you want to take the profit out of this huge cash cow just for the sake of dying babies and old folks that can not afford Med's? Sounds down right UN-American to me:)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Black Mountain, N.C.: This is a question for Bert. If conservatives are red, and liberals are blue, what color are libertarians? (It's not a riddle -- I really want to know the answer.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: White, from many years in the closet I guess.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Loving the spins: Bert,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If the Clinton years gave us these bad times, what will the 'W'(Bush) years give us?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: The Apocalypse most likely, these guys have subjugated every possible freedom, and source of honest wealth that the generations before us ever held dear. We were to busy watching ESPN to feel how badly we were getting burned.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fairfax, Va.: The Ronald Reagan earned income tax credit was a pure reditribution plan. This country, with the progressive tax HAS ALWAYS redistibuted wealth, that is what taxes do...sorry. Fact, the roads built, trains and infrastructure, public tranist etc., all support the COMMON good and not the selfish slug who wants to sit in a tower and horde what is mine.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: So should everyone recieve equal pay? I don't consider earning hording.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We had a structure similar to Obama's plan in the Clinton years and a structure similar to Bush's plan in the Bush years.: We also had a tax picture similar to Obama's in the period 1946 - 73. Was the prosperity then due to Greenspan?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: Greenspan's low interest rates urged on the risk takers and &quot;venture capitalists&quot; to do take overs, introduce marketing schemes and generally persuade a large potion of the public that being in debt is a &quot;natural&quot; state of being for Americans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The wealth that was drawn against peoples homes, along with credit card debt went almost entirely overseas for imported autos, electronics, clothing, footwear, and expensive doo dads of all nature.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Debt is not the answer, debt is the problem.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Low interst rates, made artificially low by the federal reserve punish savers and reward borrowers, who is going to blame the savers for the current problem?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ellicott City, Md.: A strong argument (to me at least) for a two party system is that when it comes down to it, voters have to choose one or the other. Neither candidate will be perfect, but one will be chosen over the other. How hard is it to govern if you win an election with 30 percent of the vote? Additionally, a candidate who gets 50 plus percentage of the vote would be more open to compromise with the other side than someone who can win by stirring up 30% support from &quot;true believers&quot;.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Runoffs would alleviate this while complicating elections, but I think the final vote needs to come down to two candidates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: I can't say that I agree that the vote SHOULD come down to two candidates, but it does. For that reason, among others, I will be voting for one of them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: Do you think the Republican Party is going to last after this election? I'm predicting a major split.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: Any time a party loses the House and two years later the Executive I would expect that there will be a shake up.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I went to the Maine GOP convention this year and the Ron Paul supporters (who made up the majority of the under 55 crowd) in spite of a large, noisy showing were completely ignored by the party &quot;leaders&quot; at the podium, I was deeply disillusioned when I saw that this was not a bottom up process, but instead a top down arrangement where Ron Paul in spite of his popularity, could not even get his name mentioned from the podium.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Republican party needs a darn good shaking in my opinion, they had six years of total dominance (2000-2006) and they returned nothing to the citizens, patriot act tax cuts for the wealthy and massive debt for everyone else, I hope they implode.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Curious but . . . :&quot;the Obama supporters have lacked the knowledge of his policies opposed to those of McCain's&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">How would you be able to judge that without knowing what Obama's positions are yourself? You've pretty clearly indicated that in this chat. Perhaps McCain's supporters are spouting what they hear in the sound bites, which isn't necessarily the truth.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: I'm not trying to portray myself as onmiscient in any sense. A year ago I couldn't even name the candidates running. I will continue to learn, grow, and become politically saavy as I get older. I know the basics. I live on a college campus, and I can't say that for everyone. That was my point.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ann Arbor, Mich.: The Republicans have been in charge of the Legistlative branch for 12 of the past 14 years. The Republicans have been in charge of the Executive branch for the past 8 years. Wow. Don't you think its obviously time for a change?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: It is time for a change that was what the Dems promise us. That is also what &quot;Dubya&quot; promised at the end of the Clinton mess.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I want change that is not just more of the same old stuff by the other party. They both nurse on the same big money PAC's niether one is able to break free.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's tax breaks:K$200 is the magic number for individuals; K$250 $250K for families, I believe.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: When is successful too successful?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What?: You spoke to Kerry and he so upset you that you now wish you had supported Bush in 2004? Did he leave a crappy tip or something? Have you had a check-up?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: Oh no... I never said I would vote for Bush! I would not vote for Bush. I just think we feel we have an insane election now, but I wasn't as aware then as I am now. I would have been really flustered in the last election if I didn't vote just to vote.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Princeton, N.J.: Your theory that low interest rates in the '90s caused later problems would be good except for the fact interest rates were not low under Clinton. Thirty-year fixed rates ranged between 6 percent and 8 percent from 1992 to 2000, and were much lower later. Look it up.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: How about my theory that &quot;permanent most favored nation trade status for China&quot; blew our most basic wealth generator, Manufacturing, of shore?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By the way I did not state interest rates in absolute numbers but only in direction, Grenspam lowered the rates while the economy did not indicate necessity of it, thus the dependency of Wall st. on &quot;cheap money&quot;.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: What's up with Arizona turning pink? Why is McCain having to run robocalls in his own state?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: If I recall, Gore did not take Tenn. in the primaries. It all probably has to do with the fact that most politicians with any time in have a certain amount of &quot;bagage&quot; that is most apparent to those who know them best, the people of their state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For Dallas: Obama's K$250 $250K is for joint filers; K$200 $200K is for single filers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: That helps clear some things up for me. I will have to go check it out for myself now... that's one big thing I learned. Check your sources.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bert Sobanik: I never made half that much, even when I worked eighty hours a week, I would say that in order to make that much this nation is giving you some sweet deal and you should be paying a good amount of taxes to the good of the state, next thing is, the Government should spend no more than it takes in, last year we paid $430 billion in interest on the debt, this year will be a lot more, more than we spend on the war even. I say if you don't like the taxes cut the spending, don't up the borrowing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elizabeth Gotsdiner: Thanks everyone! Have a great day!</span></p>
