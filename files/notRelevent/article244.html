  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Republican National Committee began running an advertisement called ''Chicago Way'' on Friday in Indiana, a traditionally Republican state where Senator Barack Obama is showing strength, and Wisconsin, which has gone narrowly for Democrats in recent elections but which Senator John McCain is trying to win.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PRODUCER On Message Inc. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SCRIPT A man says: ''The Chicago Way. Shady politics. That's Barack Obama's training. His teachers? Tony Rezko, convicted of corruption, money laundering, aiding and abetting bribery. Rezko got Obama in on a shady land deal. William Daley, heir to the Chicago machine, a top Obama adviser. And William Ayers, leader of a terrorist group that bombed the U.S. Capitol. Obama's first campaign was launched at a gathering at Mr. Ayers's home. There's more you need to know. The Republican National Committee is responsible for the content of this advertising.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ON THE SCREEN A red neon sign saying ''The Chicago Way'' flickers to life above a black and white photograph of the city's skyline. The words ''Barack Obama'' zoom into the shot. The scene cuts to a shot of cobblestone pavement with feet walking, casting long shadows. A picture captioned ''Tony Rezko'' appears, and a citation drops saying, ''Rezko convicted of corruption,'' followed by another that says, ''Obama and his Rezko ties.'' A picture captioned ''political boss William Daley'' appears. A picture captioned ''Fmr. terrorist William Ayers'' appears, joined by a picture of Mr. Obama, and text saying ''Obama's first campaign was launched ... at Mr. Ayers's home.'' The pictures disappear, and the words ''There's more you need to know'' appear.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ACCURACY Although he has been criticized for his ties to Mr. Rezko, who raised money for his past campaigns, Mr. Obama has never been implicated in any wrongdoing connected to him. The ''land deal'' referred to took place in 2005, before Mr. Rezko was indicted, when Mr. Rezko's wife bought an empty lot adjacent to the house the Obamas were buying, and later sold it to them. Mr. Obama later called the transaction ''boneheaded.'' The reference to Mr. Daley is puzzling. When Mr. Daley was commerce secretary in the Clinton administration, he was praised by none other than Mr. McCain, who was then chairman of the Senate commerce committee. And the effort to tie Mr. Obama to Mr. Ayers is overstated. Mr. Ayers, who is now an education professor in Chicago, did host a coffee for Mr. Obama's first run for office, and serve with him on a charitable board, but the two men do not appear to have been close, and Mr. Obama does not appear to have expressed sympathy for Mr. Ayers's past radical actions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SCORECARD With Mr. McCain and Republicans slipping in the polls as the economic crisis spreads, they have begun to attack Mr. Obama's character in the hope of, as one McCain adviser put it, ''turning the page on the financial crisis.'' But such a tactic carries its own risks because Mr. McCain is not without his own questionable associations. As a member of the Keating Five in the 1980s, he was rebuked by the Senate for ''poor judgment'' after he met with regulators investigating one of his major political donors, Charles H. Keating Jr., who later went to prison after his savings and loan collapsed, at great cost to taxpayers. There is also the risk that such attacks will be seen as petty at a time of a national economic crisis. MICHAEL COOPER </span></p>
