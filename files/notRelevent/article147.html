  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> TOP MILITARY OFFICERS TALK</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In U.S.-Russia Conference</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In an effort to improve strained relations, the United States and Russia sent their top military officers to Helsinki, Finland, for a secretly arranged meeting. It was the first meeting between Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and his counterpart, Gen. Nikolai Makarov, since the Russian was appointed to his post this summer. ''I think it's important that we talk when there isn't a crisis,'' Admiral Mullen said after the meeting. Page A14</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> TORTURE INQUIRY FAULTS MOUNTIES</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A Canadian inquiry found that the passing of inflammatory information from Canadian police and intelligence officials to the United States contributed to the jailing and torture of three Canadian citizens by Syria. The head of the inquiry faulted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service for making strong claims about the men that were mainly unsupported.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> INDIA AIMS FOR THE MOON</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> India has launched its first unmanned spacecraft to orbit the moon, part of an effort to assert its power in space and claim some of the business opportunities there. The spacecraft, called Chandrayaan-1, will not land on the moon, though it is supposed to send a small ''impactor'' probe to the surface. The trip has increased talk of a space race with China.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> NEW SENTENCE IN BLASPHEMY CASE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> An appeals court in Afghanistan sentenced a young Afghan journalist to 20 years in prison for blasphemy, overturning a death sentence ordered by a provincial court. The ruling raised further concerns of judicial propriety in the case, in which the defendant, 23-year-old Sayed Parwiz Kambakhsh, was accused of printing and distributing an article from the Internet about Islam and women's rights, on which he had written some comments about the Prophet Muhammad's failings on that issue.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ITALY'S PREMIER RIDING HIGH</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Even as the economic crisis took huge tolls on some of the companies he owns, Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's billionaire prime minister, has been in good spirits. The reason? Mr. Berlusconi, who is already at the center of the nation's economy and politics, now stands to control billions of dollars in public money to bail out private companies should they need it, and they probably will.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Caesar's Restaurant sits in the seediest of spots, along Tijuana's Avenida Revolucion, and specializes in salad. But Caesar's claims a distinguished title: inventor of the Caesar salad. PAGE A10</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Two years ago, Sarah Palin landed near Ekwok, Alaska, and spoke of her love for the vast delta that drains into Bristol Bay. ''I could not support a project that risks one resource that we know is a given and that is the world's richest spawning grounds, over another resource,'' she said, referring to the millions of wild salmon that spawn in those waters. But as governor, Ms. Palin has helped ease the way for a proposed copper and gold mine at the headwaters of Bristol Bay that would rival the world's largest mines. That prospect has ignited a war between Alaska's two historic industries: mining and fishing. PAGE A22 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ARREST IN CHICAGO POLICE SCANDAL</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Scores of criminal suspects, many poor and black, have come forward in the last few decades and said they were routinely brutalized during the 1980s by Jon Burge, above, and the mostly white officers under his command on the South Side of Chicago. Authorities arrested Mr. Burge, now 60, at his Florida home Tuesday, charging him in the police brutality scandal that continues to be one of the most racially charged chapters in the city's history.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ACORN REPORT RAISES QUESTIONS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> An internal report by a lawyer for the community organizing group Acorn raises questions about whether the web of relationships among its 174 affiliates may have led to violations of federal laws. The report, written by Elizabeth Kingsley, a Washington lawyer, spells out her concerns about potentially improper use of charitable dollars for political purposes, money transfers among the affiliates and potential conflicts created by employees working for multiple affiliates, among other things.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THROUGH GAPS IN A FENCE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Families and friends, some of them unable to cross the border because of immigration trouble, meet in Friendship Park to exchange kisses and news through small gaps in the tattered chain-link fence that marks the meeting of Mexico and the United States in Imperial Beach, Calif. But in a sign of changing times, construction of new border fencing will begin next month, limiting any fence-side socializing. PAGE A16 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> OLD BOAT'S LAST VOYAGE (MAYBE)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As the Delta Queen pulled away from her dock in Cincinnati into the Ohio River, tears flowed among passengers, crew members and some of the hundreds of onlookers. The 10-day cruise to Memphis could be the last commercial voyage for America's last original, paddle-wheeled, steam-driven, overnight passenger boat. PAGE A18 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> For a Homeowner Bailout</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The head of the agency that guarantees bank deposits said the government should do more to prevent foreclosures, and both presidential candidates have called for assistance to homeowners. But David Leonhardt writes that each of those plans has an inherent problem: how does a large-scale homeowner bailout work without also helping millions of people who don't need help?

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> WAL-MART TO ALTER ITS SUPPLY CHAIN</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In its latest effort to respond to criticism of its business practices, Wal-Mart said it would require manufacturers supplying goods for its stores to adhere to stricter ethical and environmental standards. Executives for the retail giant plan to reveal a new agreement that would require manufacturers to allow outside audits and to adhere to specific social and environmental criteria.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> REGIONAL BANKS IN DIRE STRAITS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Five regional banks reported another round of painful results, and experts say their business will get worse as the economy deteriorates. Some of those banks sold stock to the government to shore up their finances, but as the losses mount, it is unclear how many small and midsize lenders the government will save. PAGE B9</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> YAHOO TO LAY OFF 1,500 WORKERS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Yahoo released its results after the market closed, and the news was not good. With the turmoil on Wall Street and an economic downturn weighing on the online advertising business, the company continued to falter in the third quarter, and the company said Tuesday that it would cut at least 10 percent of its work force, or about 1,500 workers, in the current quarter to reduce costs.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Can Use Tax-Exempt Bonds</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Federal tax officials ruled that the developer of a billion-dollar basketball arena for the Nets at the Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn can use tax-exempt bonds to pay for the building. They also allowed the Yankees and the Mets to issue a new round of tax-exempt bonds for their new stadiums. But the teams may have difficulty finding investors to buy the bonds in the current economic climate. PAGE A26</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> FLAGS OF THEIR NEIGHBORS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A four-leaf clover? Plausible. A white tiger? It's been known to happen. A bastion of Republican supporters in the deeply blue enclave of Park Slope, Brooklyn? Wait, what? Oh, but it's true: four brownstones on a single block are waving a flag with a word rare enough in this liberal fortress to stop passers-by cold: ''McCain.'' PAGE A25</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> NATION'S RESTAURANTS FEEL PINCH AS DOWNTURN SLIMS DINERS' WALLETS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Across the country, restaurants are feeling the economic bite as patrons curb their spending habits. Restaurant owners are responding, with changed menus and added value options while diners order fewer appetizers and cheaper bottles of wine. Major chains are being affected more than their smaller, more malleable, independent counterparts, but experts say that nobody is going to escape this downturn unscathed. Page D1 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A DIFFERENT SORT OF MICROBREWERY</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Presenting a Japanese transplant, by way of Kentucky: Bluegrass Soy Sauce. Matt Jamie developed the idea while thinking about small-batch bourbon and artisanal olive oil. Why not do the same with soy sauce? The resulting product is turned out in batches of around 1,600 and sticks close to the original Japanese methods of brewing, except for the old bourbon barrels it is aged in. Page D3 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> For Overqualified Fashionistas</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In the new reality show ''Stylista,'' contestants vie for an editorial position at Elle magazine. The show's judge is an imperious magazine editor, one of those exacting types who is particular about, say, the way she likes her breakfast, and the show's commentary on our economic times may be accidental, but it was hard for Ginia Bellafante to miss. ''It is a brutal world indeed when securing a job to procure coffee for women in six-inch heels suddenly means going up against adversaries who speak Mandarin,'' she writes. PAGE C1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> YOUNG MALES IN THEIR FUTON YEARS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Charles Isherwood writes that the beginning of the Second Stage Theater's revival of ''Boys' Life,'' a sensitive 1988 comedy by Howard Korder about three postadolescent men, misplays some of its early moments. ''But the staging matures almost by the minute,'' he writes ''and when the actors begin consistently hitting the right notes, Mr. Korder's mosaic of youthful dissatisfaction achieves a jazzy sense of melancholy.''

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE ENGINES OF CHINA'S GROWTH</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> China's boom has been fueled by what Leslie T. Chang calls the ''the largest migration in human history'' -- the movement of millions of migrant workers into the country's cities. Her new book, ''Factory Girls,'' explores that shift, and offers an extended aside in which she explores her ancestors' roots in China. ''The results are deeply affecting,'' writes Howard French.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Now in the Owner's Box</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As a child, David Montgomery would sit in the upper deck of Connie Mack stadium to watch the Phillies play. When he went to the University of Pennsylvania, he would sit in the bleacher seats with his friend Ed Rendell, the city's future mayor and Pennsylvania's future governor. And Montgomery worked his way up from an entry-level job with his beloved team to become its chief executive. PAGE B12</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SOME NOSH AND A PENNANT</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Tampa Bay Rays are the rare sports team that allows its fans, above, to bring their own food into the stadium. And, George Vecsey writes, the outstanding good karma for that practice has helped propel the Rays to the World Series. PAGE B15 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE MISSING PIECE?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Lebron James is arguably the best player in the N.B.A., and with his contract heading into its final phase, the pressure is on the Cleveland Cavaliers to build a championship team. A big part of their plan relies on the recently signed Mo Williams, who has become a solid scorer after falling to the second round of the 2003 draft. PAGE B12 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> WITH FAVRE, NEVER A DULL MOMENT</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When the Jets traded for Brett Favre they knew they were getting from Green Bay a gunslinger with three Most Valuable Player awards. But allegations that he called the Packers' opponent last week to tell them some of the nuances of the Green Bay offense underscores the other thing that Favre brings: drama -- a whole lot of it.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CALL TIMEOUT, KICKERS DON'T MIND</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It's an age-old football tradition. If the game is on the line, and the kicker is lining up to boot a field goal for the victory, the opposing team's coach calls a timeout to get in his head. But kickers say it does not work; indeed, it gives them more time to prepare and adjust. So what of the new practice of calling a timeout immediately before a kick, in essence nullifying the first attempt? The Fifth Down. PAGE B13</span></p>
