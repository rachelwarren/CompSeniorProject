  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Potomac Confidential fills the midday lull with discussion by Metro columnist Marc Fisher who looks at the latest news with a rigorous slicing and dicing of the issues that define who we are and where we live. This week he examines the Virginia U.S. Senate debate, the struggle over whether the District's homeless should have a place to stay in downtown Washington, and new accusations of overuse of SWAT teams in Prince George's County.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fisher was online Thursday, Sept. 18, at Noon ET.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The transcript follows. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Check out Marc's blog, Raw Fisher.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In his weekly show, Fisher veers wildly from serious probing to silly prattle, and is open to topics local, national, personal and more.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Welcome aboard, folks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The nation's financial markets are in disarray, nobody knows where to put their money safely, and the presidential campaign seems to be off in its own universe, a place where pigs, Alaskan municipal affairs and the merits of being an &quot;outsider&quot; take precedence over basic questions such as: Are we living beyond our means? Is it good to have a society divided by deep economic inequalities? What kind of jobs will sustain our country a generation from now?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And our Congress, how are they coping with this turning point in American history? Why, they're busy meddling in the affairs of the District of Columbia, spending their time writing gun laws for the city, because no right-thinking congressman would want to have to go home without being able to tell his constituents that he has saved Washington from the opportunity to have lots more guns on its streets. How do you feel about your congressman's vote on the D.C. gun bill yesterday?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Virginia U.S. Senate debate between former governors Jim Gilmore and Mark Warner just ended a moment ago -- did you see it? First reactions?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Today's column looks at the battle over whether homeless people should be guaranteed a place to sleep in downtown Washington, or should be sent to apartments of their own out in the neighborhoods. The Sunday column visited with Cheye Calvo, the mayor of Berwyn Heights in Prince George's County whose family was the victim of a SWAT team assault this summer, a traumatic moment occasioned by a drug dealer's scheme to deliver a box of marijuana to an innocent person's house, where the dealer would intercept his stuff, ideally sight unseen. The event has sparked a new debate over how extensively SWAT teams are used and the impact that has on community trust in police.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On to your many comments and questions, but first, let's call the Yay and Nay of the Day:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yay to congressmen Jim Moran of Virginia and Chris Van Hollen, Donna Edwards, Steny Hoyer and Wayne Gilchrest of Maryland for standing up for D.C. home rule by refusing to go along with yesterday's abusive move to stuff the District, even as its government moved (belatedly) to bring its gun laws into accord with this summer's Supreme Court ruling.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nay to the D.C. police and government for refusing to disclose details of two investigations into the police shooting of 14-year-old Deonte Rawlings. The reports cleared police of any wrongdoing, but the city mysteriously says that the reports include details that cannot be released. It's hard enough to swallow the notion that the shooting was entirely justified, but to have to do so on the police department's say-so, without any details from the report, is simply too much to ask.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(We don't normally do financial issues here, but I'm curious -- what stories would you want to read about the current crisis? What impact are you feeling or do you anticipate and what would you want to read to help you through it?)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Your turn starts right now....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gaithersburg, Md.: Marc, I'm sure you won't like this, but your most recent blog has made me decide to vote for the slots referendum! I was on the fence before, but knowing that 87% of the proceeds goes back to the players was the deciding factor. That's a much higher percentage than any other type of gambling with which I'm familiar. I'm impressed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Hey, happy to provide a public service, even if you end up on the other side of an issue from me. My point, though, was that whatever you think of state-sponsored slots casinos, the government owes it to the voters to present the ballot question honestly. Why not lay out right there on the ballot exactly what the breakdown would be, how much of each dollar would go to the casino operators, the horse tracks and the state's budget? Is there any reason not to do that other than to try to trick voters into believing that the money is going somewhere other than where it really would go?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gaithersburg, Md.: If we were sincere about this &quot;education proposal&quot;, why in the world aren't we putting in table games and capitalizing on poker's popularity? Sure it costs the casinos more, but if we're really trying to create jobs and raise revenue, bring in real casinos! Why should I drive to Atlantic City and give money to New Jersey, instead of driving to Frederick or Annapolis?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This is bottom line a prop up for racetracks. Slots are for the mindless, at least poker and blackjack requires I exercise my brain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: I'm all for casinos if that's what the market seeks -- if folks want to gamble and the state believes that this ought to be a legal business, then license the casinos and let them go at it. But I cannot see why any government -- or any people -- would want to base their revenue structure on gambling, both for social and fairness reasons and because any function that government ought to serve ought to be something that the people understand their responsibility to pay for. Shunting that responsibility onto people who can least afford it and whose purpose has nothing to do with those government functions is simply wrong.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bethesda, Md.: Marc, I know I'm not adding anything new here, but I work in downtown D.C. and every day see poorly-dressed people with numbers written on scraps of paper lining up to buy Powerball and lottery tickets. They have far less than a 50% change of getting back much of their money. And my elderly parents, who live in Leisure World, travel every month or so to play the slots, mostly in Dover but occasionally in Atlantic City. Wouldn't it really be better if Maryland got their money and they had a shorter drive?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Sure, if there's a consensus that slots palaces are a good and important business to have in the state, I see no problem with that -- after all, we already have plenty of gambling going on and it's silly to pretend that people aren't pumping their money into online gambling and the lottery and so on. But that doesn't mean that the state ought to depend on gambling money to pay for basic functions such as schools.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">VA Senate Debate: Who 'Won'?: We know you're no fan of Gov. Gilmore and would have a hard time ever declaring him the &quot;winner&quot; of a debate with Mark Warner, so perhaps the best way to restate the question is: Did Gilmore do better than expected?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I expect my vote for Gilmore in November won't keep him from getting trounced, but it would be nice to know he put up a spirited fight in the debates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: The debate is just finishing now with Jim Gilmore slamming Barack Obama as he has throughout the hour, using virtually every question as a way to try to connect Mark Warner with Obama. In his closing statement just now, Gilmore mentioned Obama three times. Warner responded several times during the hour saying that he supports Obama but that whoever becomes president will have to take on tough issues in a much more rigorous and bipartisan fashion than we've been used to.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mostly, the debate consisted of Gilmore slamming Warner as a tax-raising liar who is connected to Obama, and Warner arguing that this is a time for bipartisanship and touting his record as governor over Gilmore's. Not a lot of surprises.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.: When will the D.C. council and mayor demonstrate that they are ready for real home rule and having two senators and a congress person who can vote? They are the most inept bunch of screw-ups and the only thing close in the VA Republican party! Congress needs to amend the bill passed by Congress and allow us Virginians to carry concealed in D.C. without a permit or a VA permit!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Certainly the D.C. Council and Mayor Fenty brought this congressional interference upon themselves with their initial reaction to the Supreme Court ruling throwing out the D.C. gun ban. That first move, a poke in the eye of the court, outraged gun advocates across the country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But under the threat of congressional meddling, the mayor and council backed off and this week passed legislation that is much more in keeping with the spirit of the Supreme Court ruling. For Congress to go ahead now and bash the District has nothing to do with life on the streets of Washington, but is solely a reflection of the continuing battle over gun policy at the national level, and especially in this fall's congressional campaigns around the nation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">NW, D.C.: I was not surprised to see Ms. Walters inherited the tax scheme on the job, and took it to another level. Is D.C. preparing to investigate the history of stealing dating back to the early 80s if not 70s? Secondly, for the life of me, how does Gandhi survive this when his level of accountability goes from Director of the Office to City CFO? He's a shrewd dude, but his oversight was grossly lax while D.C. enjoyed strong revenues!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I worked for the DC-OCFO. Employees fear him because he can and will fire quickly. He's proven himself in that regard. However, management- and oversight-wise, as long as you don't bring him an issue you are fine. If you cannot tell, D.C. government manages by crisis. Long-term plans and standards are not common. I can see the tax office never had a deficit issue, nor a horrible audit, so they stayed under the radar. However, Gandhi never ran a tight ship with sharp oversight in any agency.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Today's story about the decision not to prosecute Diane Gustus, the D.C. worker who was alleged to have prepared the documents supporting the phony checks in the scam, certainly sends the message that the prosecutors are not too eager to turn over every rock and get to everyone responsible. Obviously, every account we've heard of this scam indicates that a great many people in the office were involved. Nothing less than a total house cleaning could send a message that government is serious about doing this right.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McLean, Va.: Why haven't the names of the PG Sheriff's SWAT Team been released? Doesn't the public have a right to know the names of the vigilante police who violated the civil rights of Calvo and his wife?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Mayor Calvo has requested that the county release a whole bunch of data about how and when the SWAT teams are used and what results they achieve, and certainly he wants all the details about his own case to be released.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But not only is the county sheriff refusing to release the report that cleared his officers of any wrongdoing, neither Calvo nor even a member of the county council has been able to get the stats on the SWAT team's use. I don't see that info coming out without a court order.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: So I was at the Newington Costco last night, buying some frozen berries (since fresh ones are getting harder to find in the stores now) and I noticed the package I pulled from the freezer contained raspberries, blueberries, and marionberries! My question is, is this a special blend Costco's making for us here in the D.C. Metro area? Our MFL (Mayor for Life) must be so pleased...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Those are berries from the Pacific Northwest -- quite good, actually. And there's a congressman from Arkansas named Marion Berry, while we're at it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: Dan Morse's story was such a tragic yet sweet story. It sounds like Wolmans and the Rubins had a great zest for life and relationships. I worry a little about the surviving spouses, as losing your partner of 65 years is tough enough, even without compounding the pain by the loss of a good friend's spouse. That said, and without knowing the official cause of the accident, I wish they would have considered their age and driving capabilities before getting behind the wheel. I understand it's a lot of independence to surrender, but as my own grandfather proved to the drivers of the roads in California, they stop realizing that others are making corrections on their behalf to avoid an accident. And at some point, it's safer to just not be on the road at all.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: A Final Dinner for Four Friends (Washington Post, September 18, 2008)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: A lovely story, on today's front page if you haven't seen it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The only solution to that problem is to require road tests for all drivers who hit a certain age, say, 75 and up. Old folks are extremely loathe to give up their driving, even when they know their reflexes or vision are going fast. Lack of mobility leads to a dramatically diminished life. But that's why authorities need to step in to make those decisions for those who are unwilling or unable to make them for themselves.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Blaming the victim: Marc, your paper has had several articles about the woman abducted from Springfield Mall. Most of the blogger comments were what you would expect -- shock, outrage, sympathy for the husband. But a few actually said the woman should have been more alert to her surroundings. She was shopping in broad daylight. I don't think the possibility of being kidnapped was on her list for that day. I thought she was remarkably quick-thinking. She phoned her husband and called him by the WRONG name. A sympathetic person who thought something was wrong was asked by her to check her tag number. I read somewhere not in your paper, I believe, that the mother of one of the scum claimed both men were mentally ill. I can hear the defense right now from the survivor - I was forced by the other guy, I tried to stop it, I tried to protect the woman, I was an unwilling accomplice, etc. But he is alive and an innocent woman is dead.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: The store surveillance video of the kidnappers and the woman is just chilling. You could second guess her and wonder why she didn't make her plight known to the store clerks, but on the other hand, how could she be sure that the clerks would really help her, or that she wouldn't then be killed by the captors?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It does seem that she tried to reach out for help as subtly as she could. I would hope that any jury would have zero tolerance for the nonsensical claims of mental illness that defense lawyers unethically concoct so often in such cases.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Manassas, Va.:&quot;Warner arguing that this is a time for bipartisanship&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A Democrat's definition of bipartisanship: OK, you did what you needed to get elected. Now vote for what we want.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Yes, Gilmore hit back on that bit of rhetoric again and again, repeating the line that &quot;Bipartisanship is no substitute for honesty&quot; and then slamming Warner for having broken his promise not to raise taxes. It's a nice comeback on Gilmore's part, but I wonder if it will have any impact as a centerpiece of his campaign -- after all, Warner has remained Virginia's most popular politician despite -- and perhaps because of -- the way he managed to raise taxes and fix some of the state's deep structural financial problems.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McLean, Va.: Is Jim Gilmore purposely &quot;taking one for the team,&quot; or does he seriously believe that he has a chance to beat Mark Warner? My take is that on November 4, Virginia voters will kick Jim Gilmore's butt so hard that the RNC will have to buy Gilmore a new place to sit.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Well, Gilmore is hardly out to lose this race, and he's fighting as hard as he can given far more limited financial resources and a huge gap in the polls. Gilmore, bizarrely enough, is trying to latch onto John McCain's coattails, if there will be any -- I say bizarre because Gilmore has long been highly critical of McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cleveland Park, Washington, D.C.: You wrote: &quot;How do you feel about your congressman's vote on the D.C. gun bill yesterday?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What congressman?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Exactly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Raw Fisher Radio: I'm curious. Is anyone else having problems with the weekly podcast? The last two weeks nothing from RFR has downloaded into my iTunes. I can hear the current version online (on Swat teams) though. I'm just curious if it's just me.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: I'll pass the concern along to the tech folks here - Michele (today's producer)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Thanks for letting us know -- the feed on washingtonpost.com seems to work just fine, but we should make sure the one on iTunes is zipping along nicely as well.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clifton, Va.: No, Marc. The solution is road tests for everyone every 3 years to renew your license. A real road test to also include your ability to recover from skids and spins on wet skidpad and to apply maximum braking even with ABS.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Sure, that's a lovely idea, but it's about as likely to happen as a minimum driving age of 20, which would also dramatically improve road safety. So, to concentrate on fixes that might actually have a chance of happening, I focused instead on the idea of road tests for the elderly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lost chat: Marc, I have a regular schedule of chats that I read (yes, yours included). What happens when one disappears with no warning? The college football chat with Prisbell and Yanda is MIA!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Did the guys get tired of doing the chat or is it just economics of having too many discussions?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Thanks for asking -- and for participating in Live Discussions! The college football chat will return before and/or after big games this season. We've moved to that model with that particular discussion, rather than having it run as a regular discussion every week. -- Michele (Live Online Editor and Marc's producer for today.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Thanks for having Potomac Confidential on your list -- and thanks to Michele for the explanation. The roster of chats changes fairly regularly, both to reflect changing stories and interests and to try out new ideas. We have several different kinds of chats here on the site -- some focused around individual columnists or writers, such as this here thing, some based on one narrow area of coverage or reader interest, and some that are temporary topics, based on something happening in our world....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: The Franklin School and the Gales School (near Union Station, two blocks from the U.S. Capitol) are both examples of us preferring political symbolism over actually helping the homeless. Both of these properties are historic properties not originally built as homeless shelters. Both sit on some of the most expensive land in the world. Using these as homeless shelters is a stunning waste of money and resources. Instead they should both be sold to the highest bidder, or developed by the city and rented out. The city would get tens of millions of dollars for each of these properties, either in sale or rental. The proceeds from this could fund ten times as many shelters, on less expensive land (much of which D.C. already owns in other parts of the city) complete with every sort of substance abuse rehab and job training program known to man. Why don't we do this? We prefer political symbolism -- the use of grand structures in highly visible high dollar locations -- over actually using those resources to generate revenue to treat the problems of homelessness.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: You're absolutely right and the good news is that the mayor and much of the city government now realize how foolish and expensive it is to relegate the homeless to those vast, 19th century kind of warehouses. The far better solution for all of society is to get people into real housing with all the support they need -- counseling, drug treatment, medical care, job training--and get them into work as fast as possible. Several big cities have been moving in this direction with good results and the District is heading that way.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dunn Loring, Va.: Why is that in reporting about local crime stories, such as the Springfield abduction, the Post refuses to provides descriptions of the criminals, but the paper is willing to have large Style section pieces on crimes committed against a minority (in areas outside this region), such as the recent article on an assault on an immigrant in Pennsylvania?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: I watched the surveillance video of the Springfield abductors right here on the Post web site, which leaves me with a very strong description of those thugs. What more could you possibly want? It is true that in some crime stories, we don't use physical descriptions if those descriptions are so sketchy and broad as to be useless. A good description, with lots of detail, is one that we would and do indeed publish. This complaint, which I hear often from readers, usually focuses on race -- the idea being that editors are overly shy about mentioning the race of a suspect for fear of offending some notion of political correctness. But really it's more a question of fairness and usefulness: No one wants to read a description that is frustratingly broad. If the only function of the description is to tell readers the race of the suspect, then it doesn't belong in the paper. If the purpose is to provide a description that you can actually use to be on the lookout for the bad guy, then the whole thing goes in, race and all.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">D.C.: I hate to be morbid but as for the poor women who was killed in the kidnapping, most defense experts will tell you NEVER EVER get taken to the &quot;second place&quot; -- i.e. never ever get in the car. It's better to be killed in parking garage where at least your family may find out what happened to you than left for dead somewhere and just &quot;missing&quot; for decades. I know its harsh but this is what I hear from all self-defense class teachers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: That may be what they teach, but can you imagine really doing that in the real world? Bad guy with gun tells you to get in the car, and you're prepared to say, &quot;No, my good sir, I would rather die here in the parking lot than accompany you on your journey of illicit activities?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rockville, Md.: I so wish the person who hugged the abducted woman had just taken her away from them. But that is hindsight. It will be a while before I get over this one.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: I wonder -- what would I have done had I seen that woman come into a convenience store where I was shopping? Would I assume that an older white woman accompanied by two young black guys was somehow not there of her own volition? Would I be able to read fear or pleading on her face? Even if I could, what, beyond calling the cops, would have been the right or useful thing to do? The one person I'd point to who had the best opportunity to be useful would be the shop clerk, who might have been able to at least hit a silent alarm and then try to delay the abductors with a very slow transaction at the counter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gaithersburg Poker Proponent Again: Sorry, my point was that we aren't being given that option. Slots, even with 87% payback (Nevada requires higher and most casinos advertise 90% or higher), aren't really going to pay for education... it's a prop for the horse industry.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We do want real casinos. No the state shouldn't base it's budget on that and that alone. But quit losing money to neighboring states while shilling for a failing industry.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I've lived in Tucson (tribal casinos), Vegas, and am from Detroit (which has both corporate and tribal casinos). I enjoy low dollar poker and table games create more jobs than slot parlors. Dealers in Vegas make a pretty decent living. But we're not being given that option. The way the proposal is worded is slots or nothing, and I'll vote nothing until we're given that option.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: I'd say that I can't foresee Maryland accepting full-blown gambling casinos, but now I'm not so certain. If slots prove to be as popular as the polls now indicate, I would not rule out the idea that the next set of politicians will say that the only way to maintain the state's schools is to go to full casinos, and I can certainly see voters choosing almost any alternative to paying for the services they actually use.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria:&quot;...but knowing that 87% of the proceeds goes back to the players was the deciding factor. That's a much higher percentage than any other type of gambling with which I'm familiar&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There are so many things wrong with this statement I don't know where to start, but I'll try. 87% of the &quot;proceeds&quot; do not go back to the players. 87% of the money put in the machine does, but then that money just goes back in the machine the next time you pull the handle (or push the button as in most slots these days). And 87% is NOT a good return (unless you're used to playing the ponies). Most table games have a much smaller house edge.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For what it's worth, I go to casinos all the time and know exactly what I'm getting into. I consider it entertainment expense.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Right -- I don't see anything immoral about gambling. What's immoral is the state teaching the people to expect to get services paid for by those who can least afford it, the people who tend to do a disproportionate amount of the gambling at slots casinos.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gas Station Closures, Va.: What's with the epidemic of gas station closures in Northern Virginia? In my commute from Fairfax to Arlington, no fewer than three of the gas stations I've used in the past are now all dug up and sealed off. I can't tell if they're going out of business, or if this is something that all gas stations go through from time to time. Perhaps they're replacing their tanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Might be just that, but in fact, I've been hearing from an increasing number of gas station owners or franchisees who are getting out of the business because -- though it may seem impossible in an era of $4 gas -- their profits are severely down as the oil companies squeeze them to the max.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dunn Loring, Va.: Last week, several posters noted that the questions you took contained often irrational language in their attacks against Palin but conservative responses were much tamer, which you blithely dismissed during the chat. By any chance did you go back over and look over the transcript or did you just ignore the charges?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: I did take a look and I didn't see any such pattern. There was indeed a pattern in that I had more posts last week that were anti-Palin than pro-Palin, but not by a whole lot. My sense is that as with many such polarizing figures, those on both extremes tend to be very, um, colorful in their defense of their positions, but that most readers, just like most voters, are firmly in the middle and are mainly turned off by the extreme language and anger on both ends.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, DC: My personal Yay goes to Carol Schwartz for launching a write-in campaign. I seem to recall your appreciating her service to DC.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Well, I can't Yay or Nay Schwartz's turnabout this week. She had said in no uncertain terms that she would accept the results of the primary and wouldn't run as a write-in candidate. There was honor and integrity in that position, and I admired that. Now, she's back in the race and while I did indeed write appreciatively of her record and value to the D.C. government and to voters, I am troubled by the idea that she's the only one who can save the District. On the other hand, I don't see much to admire in her opponents in that November Council race....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Coffee for $1: There's a new coffeehouse on Lee Highway in Merrifield, Va.. I think its name is &quot;Coffeehouse,&quot; but the signs that face oncoming traffic simply say &quot;COFFEE NOW $1.&quot; I pulled in yesterday, and sure enough, the place is newly opened and is offering a cup of Caribou Coffee for $1. It's not a Caribou franchisee, but is licensed to carry Caribou coffees.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I asked if they were going to be raising their prices soon, and a woman there said no, small coffee remain $1. It's a 12 oz. cup, I think. Just right for the 30-minute commute that awaits me after I pass the new coffee shop. I haven't seen a $1 cup of good coffee anywhere for years. And no, I don't work at this place; as a grateful consumer, I just wanted to plug them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Hard to imagine it's not just an opening promotion. Hard to see how they can maintain that given commodity prices and the state of the economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And at some point, won't it become evident to all that we're kind of at the moment when this society needs to start paying for what it consumes and not pretending that everything can be cheap or free?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rockville, Md.:&quot;you're prepared to say, &quot;No, my good sir,..&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You bet I am. But not to say &quot;good sir...&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Make them work. Run like heck.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Good for you -- I admire the courage, but I'm not sure I see a good end game.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That may be what they teach, but can you imagine really doing that in the real world?: Actually, yes. I would have started screaming as soon as I went into the convenience store. That at least gives you a chance of survival, given that the thugs may get scared and run off. All of this is second guessing though; it is really horrifying what happened to this poor lady. There better be a special place in hell for defense attorneys who actively think up ways to get thugs off. I hope they rot in jail.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: So do I, but my sense from my own experiences with being held up is that you really can't predict what you would do in the moment. I was once held up at gunpoint with three other friends and we would all have predicted that we'd just give the guy the money he asked for -- yet we walked away from the pointed gun, walked right into the middle of the street and started making loud noises as we hurried away. We had each individually sensed a certain weakness in his voice and his body language and we felt like we could get away. I would never had predicted that reaction on my own part, and I would never recommend it to anyone, but in the moment, you do read the other person, even if he is a thug.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So I am reluctant to second guess the woman in this case; my bet is that she did as much as she thought she could get away with and still survive.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bethesda, Md.: Again, not intending to blame the victim (and I'm not the same chatter as the previous post) -- and I admire her creativity in trying to signal others -- but yeah, I think I can imagine it -- because I'm pretty sure I would also be imagining some of the really awful things that guy might do to me (a woman, by the way) in the car, or elsewhere, whether or not I ended up dead by the end of it. Which is another reason that self-defense experts say not to get in the car.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Most of these guys will not, in fact, shoot you. And those who really would -- those that are violent and not just bluffing -- are also more likely to do other horrendous things to you if you do go along, right?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Right, in most cases, you're probably safe to run away or call out for help. But you really do have to rely on your street smarts and your sense of human behavior. And my worry is that so many kids now grow up without developing that street sense.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fairfax, Va.: I am a DOD civilian employee and reside in the 11th Congressional District in Virginia. I am an independent who voted for Mark Warner and Tim Kaine but I also voted for John Warner, Tom Davis and Bush (twice).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Virginia Republican party is worthless. Tom Davis was an asset to us Feds and would have made a better candidate than Gilmore. I am pro life and a fiscal conservative who believes in less government. I have big problems with Virginia Republican candidates who are chosen strictly on litmus issues. And yeah Cucinelli is my state senator. I will never vote for a candidate who home schools. I would have voted for Davis for Senator. Would have been a tough choice. And I would vote for Mark Warner for prez over either McCain or Obama. The Virginia Republican party needs to realize Virginia has changed. I am as good ole boy as my herding instructor but come on!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: I think you are very much in the mainstream of northern Virginia voters and I talk to people who lay out their politics as you did quite often. And this fall, I am hearing those voters go every which way on the presidential race. If you're still out there, please let us know your presidential pick.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Vienna, Va.: Is Warner's lead over Gilmore in NoVa such that Warner can forgo campaigning out here? I am sick of seeing an incredible Gilmore presence at every local event and nothing or very little from Warner. I will support Warner, but I can tell you it is a feeling akin to those who supported Hillary and feel dissed by Obama. It irrationally makes me almost want to vote the other way. And if Warner were more visible here in NoVa, it would help Obama, who by no means has it locked up here in Fairfax.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: I think you will find that yes, Warner does tend to take northern Virginia for granted both because it's his home base and because he has traditionally done so well here, but given his large financial advantage in this race, you will definitely see a substantial Warner presence on TV this fall. I'm not sure that's the kind of presence you're looking for, but you will also see Warner out and about -- he's doing more and more retail appearances, but I do get the sense that his focus on personal appearances will be in other, more divided parts of the state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Great Falls, Va.: Gilmore was a poor Governor, leaving the state in a fiscal crisis. He also has no transportation plan, something northern Virginians desperately need. Characterizing the &quot;bipartisanship&quot; statements by Warner as rhetoric is fair, but how can Gilmore's harping about Obama, who is not running for Senate in Virginia as far as I know, be anything but rhetoric? My question is whether Gilmore is appealing to unspoken racism when he continually brings up Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: That's a fair question, and the way Gilmore slipped Obama's name into well more than half of his answers -- even when the presidential race had zero to do with the question -- certainly lends credence to that notion. Clearly, the Gilmore camp believes that Warner is so popular and so far ahead that their only chance is to try to link him to Obama. And Warner at the Democratic convention was careful to reach out to what he called &quot;McCain-Warner&quot; voters, of whom there will be many. But I found myself wondering the same thing -- was this a not so subtle racial appeal?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">NW, D.C.: Marc: Can we discuss some of these local budget issues? I live in PG and note my own county on top of Montgomery, and the states of MD and VA. I am not a conservative, but how is it these jurisdictions basically just approved their FY09 budgets a few months ago and are now scurrying around over potential deficits?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The revenue trends have been there for over a year. How did they just realize the potential shortfall 3-4 months after approving the upcoming budgets? It seems they failed to do a thorough job in their initial budget process. The mention of furloughs before department/program cuts just seems like lazy governance. I think if they scrub their budgets and looked at effective programs, and those with low return, not to mention non-essential contracts, they can find the 3% easily and not require an 80-hour furlough. And slots are not the solution!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Most of those budgets have been pretty well scrubbed in other recent financial crunches, but yes, of course there are always services that can be cut and staffs that can be trimmed. But while it's been obvious for some months that revenues would be lower, state and local budgets are drawn up quite a bit in advance and they've been based in recent years on extraordinary incomes from real estate taxes and fees, and no one could have predicted just how deeply those would fall, or how quickly energy prices would jack up the price of just about everything that government buys.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">D.C.: I agree with the earlier poster on the sale of the buildings for more funds for shelters and training, it is a good solution -- IF there is effort to make sure the facilities are spread evenly throughout the city. In other words, don't just stick the homeless in NE or Petworth, but also integrate them into mixed income housing west of the park. The NW NIMBYs may not like it, but it is unfair to expect one or two communities to absorb the entire population of the city's homeless.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Scatter-site housing for the homeless is not a terrible idea, except for two caveats: One, it doesn't make sense to buy very expensive housing for the homeless just to make the political point that all must share in housing them, and two, you do want the homeless to be near or have access to the mental health and other services they will need to get back into the work force and take care of their families.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: Gas station closures: Marc: I have a little knowledge to offer here. My understanding is that the profit margins on gasoline for gas stations and convenience stores is really small and they don't set the prices. They simply react to the price charged to them. They make their money getting us to do an oil change there or going inside and buying sodas and stuff. It's quite possible that if prices are going up and consumption is going down, they're having real problems.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Quite right -- I did a column a couple of years ago in which a Montgomery County station owner opened his books to me and showed how the big oil companies really break the backs of your neighborhood station owner. They literally make all of their profit from the convenience store operations, almost like movie theater owners relying almost entirely on the popcorn sales.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: Marc, you miss the point on the way D.C. deals with the homeless, the two buildings will be sold at a song to friendly developers, those same developers will the severely mark up anything the city buys/rents to replace and service for the homeless will go down at higher costs. In other words the status quo.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Sorry, but the conspiracy theories just don't work on this one. Indeed, the city has no buyer or even plan for a buyer on the Franklin Shelter. But that gorgeous building ought to be sold or leased to someone who will make big money on it, and the city's cut of that money is the only way the District can ever be able to take care of its neediest citizens.</span></p>

You may just be too much trouble for an assailant in the middle of a parking lot in the middle of the day. I wonder if these two thugs in Springfield looked at this woman and thought she is older so maybe she won't be able to fight back?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: I'm sure they picked her in good part because they thought she might be easier to handle than some other victim -- that's why we see so many home invaders picking the homes of the elderly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">No, Good Sir: It is a good strategy, because in most cases that person is not prepared to shoot you while you are standing in a public place. That's why running away or standing your ground IS the best strategy. It is true this is what police or security/self-defense experts will tell you. Another tip I remember from when kids were small -- teach kids if they are in trouble to look for a grandma-type person to go to for help. Chances are they will not SEE a policeman if they are in a public place and are lost, need help, etc. The least chance of a threat is an older woman -- that's who they should ask for help.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Springfield, Va.: Not a question, but just a comment. I am amazed at the courage not only the woman who was kidnapped had, but also the person who went up to her at the store. I am not sure if I could have done that and that poor person must be plagued with guilty feelings as well, like not having done enough. What a horrible situation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Yeah, I'd be cautious about slamming that person for not having done more. Only the folks who were there can know just what the crooks were saying with their body language.</span></p>

No telling how people might react in such situations, but I guess it depends on the situation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: A bit different, those situations are: The woman who has been abducted has more limited freedom of choice. The driver is of course limited by physical forces and his own reflexes, but otherwise has the ability to decide how to handle a frightening and disorienting situation.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc, please don't continue to spread that misinformation about how mental illness is &quot;so often&quot; used in cases. Yes, this is a wikipedia link, but it is cited. The defense is only used 1% of the time, not sure how that qualifies as &quot;so often.&quot; And, the citation further points out that of the successful cases 90% of those people are actually mentally ill.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mental illness is just not the get out jail free card a lot of people (apparently, yourself included) seem to think it is.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Sorry, but first of all, one percent is a lot. Second, I've sat in way too many courtrooms and watched mental illness being used as a defense and as a distraction when it was clearly not justified. Most juries can see through that nonsense, but unfortunately, many judges don't let the juries make that decision but instead take it upon themselves to accept bogus claims.</span></p>

Or will they stick with and up for their own kind in the name of law enforcement brotherhood?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: A lot of hope is riding on that FBI investigation. But Calvo and others are also pursuing change at the county level and there ought to be a state role in this as well -- changing the policies that govern when and how SWAT teams are used need not await the results of an FBI probe.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It says: &quot;The top two suppliers of cameras used to capture motorists who run red lights and speed are now selling local governments on video technology that can be used to identify drivers and their passengers, reports Newspaper.com. Redflex and American Traffic Solutions are selling the enhanced systems as a way to help police track down Amber Alert cases and stolen cars.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This is appalling! Is there any way to find out if DC or MD are buying this junk? The public was assured when the cameras were put in that any red light/speed cameras would NOT be able to identify the people in the cars to protect our privacy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Not exactly fair of me to unload this one at the very end of the show, but I just saw it. My quick view: I'm all for any such program that uses the cameras as the automated eyes of the police. There ought be no expectation of privacy when you are driving on the public thoroughfares, especially if and when you are violating the law and endangering others.</span></p>

Yes, this is all true. I'm currently running a write in campaign for an election as I have been tired of writing in names only to know the votes get thrown away (talk about disenfranchisement).

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elderly Drivers: Marc, I agree elderly drivers should be restested frequently, but disagree that age 75 should be the threshold for status as elderly. Even though I no longer think of 40 as middle-aged, having recently hit that number myself, I believe that for purposes of driving that number needs to be moved south. I would say age 70 to start, with retesting every other year until age 80, when retesting would be annual. Part of the battle is just getting older folks to buy in to questioning their own abilities. And yes, the age for licensure should be increased to age 18. Maybe these changes would force communities to get more involved with providing transportation options.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Sure, start at 60 or even lower. But realistically, to get that kind of regulation through, you'd have to pick on the older crowd -- at least that's the way it went in Florida, where I worked when the state finally imposed such rules.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Making it easier to vote absentee: Since moving, I have voted absentee every election. I claim to be out of town that day. Do I hate having to lie? Yes. It's not that I will be away at work for 12 hours or whatever it is, it's just that it's inconvenient to get to the polling place and probably stand in long lines either before or after work. By the time I count in my travel time with work, it's still less than 12 hours, but what if I'm stuck on metro? Voting is important to me, and I want to let my vote count. Why do I have to lie to get an absentee ballot?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Because part of your civic duty is actually going to the polls. It is a communal act and there is value in having to go out and see your neighbors and have them see you -- that builds the sense that by voting, we are acting on behalf of each other. I would actually make absentee voting much more difficult.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: It wasn't in the Metro section, but the front page article by Post Staff Writer Dan Morse, &quot;A Final Dinner for Four Friends&quot; actually made me cry on the ride to work on the metro this morning. Beautifully written and incredibly sad. My heart goes out to the family members.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: There are more like this one -- well-deserved kudos for a splendid story.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rockville, Md.: Since these SWAT teams do not have to check to see who lives in the house they will attack, I will send them a tip for a house on Pennsylvania Ave. 1600 I think. Perhaps the Secret Service can take care of them. At least it will be more of a fair fight.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: Ouch.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Springfield, Va.: Marc, the financial crisis I worry about is the Post. Your circulation is down by about 200K in the past decade or so, and I'm guessing ad revenues are also dropping. The New York Times is reporting that their ad revenues are off by about 10%. How much longer can the Post continue to lose customers? Millions read you on-line for free, but I doubt internet ads bring in much dough? What will it take to entice a new generation or readers to subscribe to the Post, while many older and loyal subscribers depart for news sources that fit their political desires?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: The irony many newspapers face is that more people read us than ever before, thanks to Webly Webster, but we get little revenue from that to support our news operation. The business model hasn't caught up with the way people live today. It's a challenge that all old media -- and all new media too -- face, and no one has figured out answers that would support the nation's news-gathering infrastructure, which, as a result, is crumbling before our eyes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marc Fisher: On that cheery note, that has to kick things in the head for today. Many thanks for coming along, and apologies to those I couldn't get to. Back here with you again next week, and of course on the blog every day and in the column again on Sunday, when we'll visit with a woman who has made the Hillary Clinton to Sarah Palin switch. She explains why.</span></p>
