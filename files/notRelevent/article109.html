  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Good morning,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A busy day on the campaign trail today with, gulp, one week left. Also, plenty of news in Washington, starting with the Ted Stevens conviction. As many of you will have just read, Sen. John McCain called on Stevens to step aside this morning. What do you think?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eager to hear your thoughts today.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Evanston, Ill.: Let's say Sen. Stevens had fully reported all the gifts. Is it really normal for an oil company to facilitate the adding of a story to a politian's home? Could such a deal really be legal on either side of things?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Stevens Found Guilty on 7 Counts (Post, Oct. 28)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: This is a great question, and I've just been bouncing it around with my colleagues. The short answer is, yes, kindof. Senators can accept gifts if they are out of friendship. But they can't accept gifts that are the result of their official position, or are in exchange for some official action.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Feds in this case decided not to try and prove that these gifts were about more than friendship (although Stevens was in a position to help the oil services firm), instead deciding to simply prove that he received the gifts and failed to report them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here's a link to the Senate rules and a snippit of them:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">http://rules.senate.gov/senaterules/rule35.php</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(B) In determining whether a gift is provided on the basis of personal friendship, the Member, officer, or employee shall consider the circumstances under which the gift was offered, such as:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(i) The history of the relationship between the individual giving the gift and the recipient of the gift, including any previous exchange of gifts between such individuals.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(ii) Whether to the actual knowledge of the Member, officer, or employee the individual who gave the gift personally paid for the gift or sought a tax deduction or business reimbursement for the gift.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(iii) Whether to the actual knowledge of the Member, officer, or employee the individual who gave the gift also at the same time gave the same or similar gifts to other Members, officers, or employees.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Medford, Ore.: What happens if Sen. Ted Stevens wins the election?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Another good question, and not out of the realm of possibility. I spent a couple weeks in Alaska this fall, and was interested to find a tremendous amount of good will for Sen. Stevens and mistrust of the Washington, DC, jury.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A Stevens victory will, at minimum, buy him some time to figure out whether he can survive this conviction. Odds are he can't. So what happens then? Here, courtesy of election law expert Rick Hasen, is the relevant portion of the Alaksa Code:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sec. 15.40.010. Conditions and time of filling vacancy by appointment and special election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When a vacancy occurs in the office of United States senator, the governor, at least five days after the date of the vacancy but within 30 days after the date of the vacancy, shall</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(1) appoint a qualified person who, if the predecessor in office was nominated by a political party, has been, for the six months before the date of the vacancy, and is, on the date of appointment, a member of the same political party as that which nominated the predecessor in office to fill the vacancy temporarily until the vacancy is filled permanently by election; and</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(2) by proclamation and subject to this chapter, call a special primary election and a special election to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the term of the predecessor in office if the predecessor's term would expire more than 30 calendar months after the date of the vacancy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">About the Ted Stevens Deal: So I&quot;m reading that John Mccain has now come out and said Stevens should resign, and all it took was a felony conviction! If the Republican Party were serious, wouldn't they have tried doing this before the primary so that a Democrat would have a harder time getting into office?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: I think what happened is that Stevens tried to speed up the trial on the chance that he would be acquitted, and that courtroom victory would propel him to electoral victory. My guess is that Republicans thought that was their better option, rather than by calling for him to resign and trying to find a new candidate to run against the Anchorage mayor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Silver Spring, Md.: Sarah Palin seemed to throw fellow Alaska Republican Ted Stevens under the bus yesterday, with her commenting on the &quot;corrupting influence of the big oil service company that was allowed to control too much of our state.&quot; How did she describe this influence -- I assume mentioning Stevens by name -- when she campaigned for governor? Interestingly, the Democrats do not seem to have made that much mention of Palin's own condemnation on ethics charges (which she trumpeted as a victory, because the panel criticized her on only some of the charges).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Hello Silver Spring,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You are right to point out that it is very hard to figure out what Gov. Palin's relationship with Sen. Stevens is like. When she ran for governor, she cut an ad with Stevens towards the end of the campaign. And while she ran as a reformer who wanted to rid her own party of corruption, she was less vocal about Stevens. That may be a matter of political calculation -- Stevens has remained very popular in Alaska as the case against him unfolded.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: Matthew, an early question because I'm traveling: When people say that this election marks the end of campaign finance reform, what exactly do they mean? Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Obama's Huge Haul Should End This Fight (Post, Oct. 26)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Seems a good moment for some campaign finance questions. Here's the big picture question.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some folks who have argued against most campaign finance restrictions believe that Obama's fundraising proves that a politician can raise money in an unfettered way without risking the corrupting influences that people have long associated with political donors. That's because instead of focusing primarily on seeking large contributions from the wealthy and special interests, Sen. Obama raised hundreds of millions from small 'kitchen table' donors.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Providence, R.I.: Matthew, if John McCain had forgone public campaign financing, do you think he could have raised enough money to be competitive with Barack Obama's war chest? Thanks for the chat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: This is a great question, Providence, and one reason to consider the possibility that public financing is not as obsolete as people think.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I think a case could be made that without the $84 million infusion of cash, Sen. McCain would have been at a WORSE financial disadvantage going into October. I suspect the general election fundraising we saw from the RNC (with McCain and Palin leading the effort) represented the best McCain had to offer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Glenmont, Md.: I'm sorry, but when friends give gifts, they buy each other books and sweaters, and maybe even a flat-screen TV if you've got money to throw around. A barca-lounger, okay. Even a weekend getaway at some resort -- that I could see. But remodeling the house? Get outta here. There's an issue of scale that defies any notion that a gift is given out of friendship.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: That makes sense to me, Glenmont. But apparently the Feds thought they'd have a challenge trying to make that case in court.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Please answer me this -- now that Stevens is a convicted felon, does he have the right to vote?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: This question just popped up on Politico, this morning, too. Here's the section of law they referenced:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;According to the state of Alaska, A person convicted of a crime that constitutes a felony involving moral turpitude under state or federal law may not vote in a state, federal, or municipal election from the date of the conviction through the date of the unconditional discharge of the person.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I don't know whether this applies to Sen. Stevens, but will endeavor to find out before our hour is up.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Hi Matthew. Assuming Sen. Obama is elected president, care to venture any predictions about whether he'll support changes tightening restrictions on campaign donors? And if John McCain remains in the Senate, do you foresee any changes in his stance?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: I think the big question facing both of them will be about the presidential public financing system. There is legislation pending to update the rules to prevent a candidate from being in the situation that Sen. McCain has found himself -- at a huge financial disadvantage. Ironically, Sen. Obama has signed on as a supporter of this bill, while Sen. McCain has not. Whether their positions could change will be an interesting question to watch.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Campaign Fundraising:&quot;That's because instead of focusing primarily on seeking large contributions from the wealthy and special interests, Sen. Obama raised hundreds of millions from small 'kitchen table' donors.&quot; A minor point of clarification: While he did raise money from &quot;kitchen table&quot; donors, the bulk of the money he raised -- 75 percent -- was from large contributions ... or so said The Washington Post.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Yes indeed. That is true. But even with just a quarter of his overall take coming from donors who gave under $200, the amount of money involved was considerable.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Helena, Mont.: Your article on tricksters donating under false names to the Obama campaign was pretty short on skepticism. Have you ever tried to use your credit card online to make purchases or donations? You can't do it unless the name and address you give is the same as what the card company has on file. Try moving sometime and give your new address before the credit card company has changed your address on their records -- can't do it. So my questions are: Did these tricksters have cards in the names of the donors they told you they had used on Obama's site? Did you see the cards? Did you even raise this question with them? Or did you just take their word at face value?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Campaign Finance Gets New Scrutiny (Post, Oct. 26)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Hi Helena,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You raise good questions. The Obama campaign has acknowledged that people have given money under false names -- these donations even showed up on their campaign reports. Their argument has been that they have gone back and swept their donor lists for evidence of problem donors, and during these sweeps, have found them and returned the money.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Vancouver, Wash.: Hi Mr. Mosk. Does the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's decision to stop running ads in the Alaska senate race imply that Sen. Schumer thinks that Stevens is (excuse the expression) dead meat now that he has been convicted of seven felony counts? And have you heard of any talk regarding a possible presidental pardon? Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Hi Vancouver,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Our White House reporters tell me they have not heard discussion of a presidential pardon for Stevens.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: I've just spoken with Marc Mauer, a lawyer with the Sentencing Project, about whether or not Sen. Stevens has lost his right to vote in the upcoming election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mauer said there is a question of whether he has to be formally sentenced. &quot;It's almost always defined as the conviction. But that may just be shorthand for how it's implimented. Every state has a convoluted way of describing it. I think most people would say that he probably could not vote. The best example of this I can think of is when Eugene V. Debs ran for president from his prison cell. He got a million votes, but he couldn't vote for himself.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fort Myers, Fla.: I've heard from smoe people that late-deciders are prone to vote for Obama because late-deciders tend to lean Democratic and McCain is of the incumbent party, but I've also heard some commentators say that late deciders will lean toward McCain because, well, he's white and more trandtionally presidential looking. Is there an established conventional wisdom on this, or is it a true point of disagreement?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: I'm not sure there's any conventional wisdom on this, other than that the candidate with an effective early-voter turnout program will benefit. Right now, our polling indicates that it is the Obama campaign that is benefitting from early voting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Boston: On the ledge at &quot;The Corner&quot; several bloggers incited several readers to make donations to the Obama campaign under assumed identities. I know both camps regularly send back millions in inappropriate donations, and the FEC is supposed to review donornames. I just wonder if it is a crime to ask others to make fraudulent contributions to a campaign...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: I don't know if it is a crime to &quot;incite&quot; people to make false donations. But making a donation &quot;in the name of another&quot; is a crime. I can understand the urge to try and test these campaigns to see what their screens will catch. But breaking the law seems ill advised.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Beverly Hills, Calif.: What is the status of Hillary Clinton's deficit? Has she been able to raise substantial funds for Obama?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Thanks for this question -- I hadn't checked this in some time. Sen. Clinton's latest filing indicates she is still saddled with about $8 million in debt. A good portion of it, $5,279,535, to be exact, is owed to the firm of strategist Mark Penn. This makes some sense, since a number of the Obama donors enlisted to try and help Clinton wipe away her debt explicitly did not want their money to be used to pay Penn. All that said, Sen. Clinton's effort on behalf of Sen. Obama (she's campaigning for him in Florida this week) should guarantee that if he wins, he'll help Clinton raise money at the start of next year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fairfax, Va.: Is The Post going to have its list of celebrity pundits and their predictions of the races, like they did during the 2004 campaign?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: I am told by OUTLOOK editor John Pomfret that, yes, you can expect to see this feature Sunday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Baltimore: At what point does the Republican National Committee cut its losses and focus on the Senate races? I feel like there are several senate races that could use an infusion of money, while I don't know if continuing to feed money into the presidential race would make too much of a difference.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: This is a subject that has been discussed with some intensity inside the RNC, according to sources I've spoken with. As far as I know, that's not the direction they opted to go.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Princeton, N.J.: It's snowing here in the plains of New Jersey. If the weather is bad on Nov. 4, will that help Obama in some places like North Carolina, because of early voting?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Hi Princeton -- congratulations on getting your first snowfall. I'm not sure we'll have to answer this question. Forecast for the Northeast next Tuesday: Partly Cloudy, 60 degrees.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thanks for all the great questions, and stay tuned for an exciting final week!</span></p>
