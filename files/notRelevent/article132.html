  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Ad: (BARACK OBAMA): I think when you spread the wealth around it's good for everybody.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(1st WOMAN): I'm Joe the plumber. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(2nd WOMAN): I'm Joe the plumber.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(3rd WOMAN): I'm Joe the plumber.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(NARRATOR): Spread the wealth?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(1st MAN): I'm supposed to work harder . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(2nd MAN): . . . just to pay more taxes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(3rd MAN): Obama wants my sweat to pay for his trillion dollars in new spending?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(4th WOMAN): I'm Joe the plumber.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(NARRATOR): Barack Obama. Higher taxes. More spending. Not ready.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Analysis: This John McCain&nbsp;ad is based on a faulty premise.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The &quot;ordinary&quot; folks who say they are like Joe Wurzelbacher, the Ohio plumber constantly invoked by the Republican nominee, are meant to convey that they, too, are working-class Americans. But if they are anywhere near the income status of Joe the plumber, they would receive a tax cut under Barack Obama's plan -- not, as the commercial suggests, a tax increase.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama would raise taxes on those earning more than $250,000 a year, which is why the ad carefully skirts any mention of income. Wurzelbacher, who makes roughly $40,000 a year, has acknowledged that his taxes would be cut by the Obama proposal. His complaint to the Democratic nominee during a campaign stop about having to pay higher taxes was based on his hope that one day he would buy a business and earn more than six times his current pay.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The &quot;spread the wealth&quot; remark, captured on videotape as the senator from Illinois talked to Wurzelbacher, is fair game for political attack. The unidentified people who complain that Obama would take more of their income to pay for government spending undoubtedly reflect a widespread resentment among taxpayers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But redistributing wealth -- that is, taking a bigger slice from the affluent than from those in lower brackets -- has long been a feature of the progressive income tax. The Obama campaign disputes the trillion-dollar figure and says the candidate has made clear how he will pay for new spending -- in part through the higher levy on upper-income taxpayers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe the plumber has become a potent symbol for the McCain campaign, but as this ad demonstrates, his circumstances don't fit the charge that Obama would raise taxes on plumbers, and others, in his financial situation.</span></p>
