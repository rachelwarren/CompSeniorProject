  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: Good Friday morning. I'm sequestered in the official Fix coffee shop -- Buzz on Slaters Lane -- for this chat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lots going on this morning already. I just finished a Fix post on whether Barack Obama's new aggressive tone toward John McCain on the economy will work, and we've got Sarah Palin's three-part interview with ABC' Charlie Gibson coming out in drips and drabs throughout today.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Did I mention there are ads&nbsp;and polls out this week in nearly every competitive Senate race?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Man. What a time to be a political junkie.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let's get to it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">San Diego: Chris, the Republicans won the news cycle this week, hands down. What advice would you have for Obama to win next week?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: Up early in San Diego! I like it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Far be it from me to give advice to the Obama campaign but here it goes:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Find a way to change the narrative. Right now the meta-story is how Sarah Palin has changed the face of American politics. The micro-story is a day-by-day picking-apart of Obama's readiness to lead. Neither of those are good story lines for the Democratic ticket.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The roll out this morning by the Obama campaign of a strategy designed to refocus the race on the economy and their belief that McCain is out of touch on this central issue is a smart move. Obama -- and Democrats generally -- are on their strongest footing when talking about the economy and health care, domestic issues where voters have tired of Republican policies and are ready for a change.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The more time Obama spends responding to McCain attacks (lipstick on a pig) or talking about national security, the less of a chance he has to win.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">St. Louis: Since you're so &quot;in the know,&quot; I was wondering if you've heard from Republicans -- off the record, of course -- that they're surprised by McCain's campaign. His traditionally Republican campaign is smart -- they win -- but it also seems so out of character for the old McCain we knew in 2000. What are Republican insiders thoughts on this change?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: Hmm, was that &quot;in the know&quot; comment a shot at me? If so, well played.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Onto the question...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republicans always -- or at least for as long as the Fix memory lasts -- have adopted a realpolitik approach to political campaigns. That is, they use tactics that work -- whether or not they are &quot;fair.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republicans are, typically, far less concerned about the approval of newspaper editorial boards and the so-called &quot;Eastern media elite&quot; than their Democratic counterparts, a fact that allows them almost total freedom when it comes to how they conduct their campaigns.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democrats, on the other hand, always promise to play as down-and-dirty as Republicans, but when the rubber hits the road they tend to back off somewhat. The one Democratic politician in recent memory who didn't follow that blueprint was Bill Clinton; it's no accident he is the last Democrat to win the White House.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the frame of campaign politics, &quot;fair&quot; doesn't really matter. Effective and persuasive do. I don't condone this but state it merely as fact.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The jury remains out on how the Obama campaign will approach the final seven weeks of the campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama Responses: I hate to say this, but it looks to me like Hillary was right -- Obama didn't appreciate how hard the Republicans would go after him and was not as &quot;steeled&quot; as she was to handle this.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: This line of thinking has percolated up -- see stories in Bloomberg, Los Angeles&nbsp;Times and Politico -- in recent days.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I'm not sure it's right. Obama has shown a pretty strong backbone in this campaign to date. There is still lots of time left in this race.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Falls Church, Va.: Hola Chris. With all the polls coming out on a daily basis how should they be interpreted? Who are the people that are asked to answer these polls? What about the youth vote and first-time registered voters -- are they on the pollsters' call list?. And one more thing: Can The Washington Post have a Q&amp;A with a pollster who can explain objectively what these polls mean?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: We've had a few discussions with The Post's Jon Cohen and Jennifer Agiesta, Falls Church ( one, two, three) but will look at lining up another.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: Great question, and as our moderator has already noted, the Post's polling unit -- Jon &quot;Can Do&quot; Cohen and Jenn &quot;The Analyst&quot; Agiesta -- have done several online chats and I am sure will do a bunch more between now and November.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My general attitude on polling: Don't take any one survey -- even one as good as the Post/ABC poll -- as the Truth.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Instead, average a series of polls and take that number as roughly right.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I've seen a series of polls lately that show McCain up a few on Obama and several others that have Obama ahead. My guess is that on a national level the race is basically a dead heat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As I laid out in my battleground states Line this morning on The Fix, Obama still has a slight edge in the state by state analysis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Aldie, Va.: Okay, Obama's gotta move on to the issues and away from Palin, but that's gonna be tough with the ABC interview in three parts -- neat strategy by McCain's campaign, because regardless of what she says, the focus will be squarely on her...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: Aldie, I agree. The McCain did a few very smart things with this interview:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">1. Split it into three separate sit downs to allow Palin to regroup and refocus if and when she gets flustered or makes a mistake.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">2. Schedule the interview in Alaska so that Palin is as relaxed as possible and fighting on her home turf.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">3. Put the interviews at the end of a week when, even if there is some sort of major screw-up, it will be lessened by the oncoming weekend.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fairfax, Va.: Will Biden back up his recent comments about Hillary being a better choice for vice president than him by withdrawing so Obama could name Hillary?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: No.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Look, Joe Biden is Joe Biden. Barack Obama knew it when he picked him. Biden says literally everything that is on his mind. And, while that can be incredibly endearing at times, it also makes for the occasional gaffe.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His comment that Clinton would have been a better choice is such a moment. If there was any blessing in the &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; comment for the Obama campaign, however, it was that it drained a lot of the oxygen from Biden's remarks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Yesterday, in a Fix post about the Minnesota Senate race, you said Minnesota had the highest anti-war sentiment, second only to New Hampshire. If that's the case, then why is New Hampshire a swing state? Does McCain's &quot;independent&quot; streak prevail over his Iraq policies?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: Ah yes. That was actually a few days ago when I wrote about the new Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ad hitting Norm Coleman for his support of the war in Iraq.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Looking back at the 2006 election, there were two states where voters' opposition to the war played out in obvious electoral terms.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The first was in Minnesota where Amy Klobuchar turned what was expected to be a competitive Senate race against Mark Kennedy into a blow out. The second was New Hampshire, where Democrats not only knocked off vulnerable Rep. Charlie Bass (R), but also beat seemingly safe Rep. Jeb Bradley (R). Bradley fell to Carol Shea-Porter, an antiwar activist not seen as a serious opponent by many within her own party.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Given that, it would seem as though New Hampshire would be in the bag for Obama this year. But that doesn't account for McCain's unique connection to the state. New Hampshire jump-started McCain on the national scene in 2000 and saved his campaign in this race. New Hampshire-ites -- especially independents -- like McCain and respond to his maverick messaging.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Still, polling shows Obama with an edge in the state, and his campaign is confident they will hold it on Nov. 4.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Glen Burnie, Md.: Commenting on Charles Gibson's interview with Gov. Palin, I think both sides of the commenters are wrong -- he asked good questions and actually asked what is on people's minds, and was skeptical yet fair, and the governor gave good answers. But then again, I thought he ran the best of the Democratic Party debates too, for the same reason -- he asked about what people were talking about.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama people complained bitterly at the time, and I guess the McCain/Palin people are complaining a bit now, too, but give Gibson credit: He asks about things that the candidate may not want to respond to but they are on people's minds, and he doesn't ask them rhetorically or in a nasty, leading way, the way others on other networks do. And by the way, I thought the governor's answers last night about NATO defense and the Bush Doctrine were clearer and more specific than anything Sen. Obama ever has said about that.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: An interesting take.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">St. Paul, Minn.: Hi Chris -- a Senate question for you. Is Al Franken making any headway against Norm Coleman here in Minnesota? They both have been running some pretty tough ads, but we also have a relatively strong third-party candidate (Dean Barkley) in the mix. Is Coleman is any danger of losing his seat, or does Franken simply carry too much baggage to knock him out?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: Senate question! Love it. Keep them coming!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This is one of the best -- if not the best -- Senate race on the docket this fall.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Coleman is a savvy pol who, as a former Democrat, is absolutely detested by his former party. Franken is a larger than life personality who has brought tons of national attention to the race. Barkley served in the Senate -- albeit briefly -- and has a real following in the state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Right now, the Coleman people feel good about where they are as they see the race, as a referendum on Franken and his controversial comments and writings during his past life as a satirist/comedian. But, Minnesota seems almost certain to go for Obama in the fall campaign, which should help Franken.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My guess is this will be a very close contest.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Boston: Hey Chris, transplanted Washington political junkie now in Boston. Is the McCain/Palin surge working in terms of the Congressional races? Will a closer race mean less time for presidential candidates to help their party by campaigning with congressional candidates? Thanks for your time.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: Great question that I don't know the answer to.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Congressional Republicans are pushing the idea that the excitement in their base for Palin is helping them down-ballot, and several recent national surveys suggest that the huge Democratic edge on the generic ballot largely has evaporated in recent weeks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Whether that will continue for the remainder of the race remains to be seen.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hampton Cove, Ala.: Chris, is there an agreement among the press corp not to cover Biden? Five draft deferrals, two brain aneurysms, 92-page expense report ... seems so different than the treatment Bush, Cheney and Palin have gotten. Is everyone in Alaska?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: Without accepting the premise of the first part of your question, I will tell you The Post as well as lots of other news organizations have lots and lots of people in Alaska.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I think the focus on Palin is so intense because we knew so little about her when she was picked. Biden is a much more of a known commodity inside Washington, a fact that takes away some of reporters' natural curiosity.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Charlottesville, Va.: I found Gibson's tone condescending, and I was annoyed by his misquotation of Palin, and then his insistence that the misquotation were her &quot;exact words.&quot; Kurtz appeared to be unfamiliar with the fact that she had been misquoted; will this ever get reflected in The Post's coverage?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: Another opinion on the Palin interview.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Richmond, Va.: Why was Biden's comment about Hillary being a better VP a gaffe? I struck me as a bit of humility, something you rarely see in politicians and certainly Palin's &quot;no hesitation about being the vice presidential nominee&quot; didn't strike me as humble. It struck me as coming from someone who had no clue what she was getting into, or the gravity of the position.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: Fair point, and the word &quot;gaffe&quot; may have been too strong.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My only issue with Biden's comment: When you are running to be the vice president of the United States, it's usually not a good idea to say someone is better equipped for the job than you. That would be like me saying &quot;I can do a good job with The Fix, but not as good a job as some other guy.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wouldn't exactly instill a lot of confidence in The Fix Bosses.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Old Town, Maine: I thought Palin's responses were frightening. She seemed like someone who crammed for an exam and then was trying to wing her way through it. There was no real thinking going on. Shouldn't the Obama campaign be talking about that? Yes, I know they want to get back to their message, but the whole set of foreign policy answers were awful, and Palin is not prepared to take over should McCain pass away.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: Maine is in the house!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I think you touch on an important point as it relates to Obama's new counterattack that McCain is out of touch on the economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The issue for Obama is that attacks on McCain's record on the economy are not what gets the Democratic base going these days. The only thing that the party base wants to hear is pushback on Palin, which is not something the Obama campaign seems willing to do.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For more on this, make sure to check out The Fix shortly ... I have a full post on the new attack by Obama and whether it will work.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The only Republican in Ann Arbor, Mich.: Anyone who thought that Palin's answers on NATO and the Bush Doctrine were clearer than Obama's is crazy. I've been a McCain supporter for years, and I cringed. I thought she came across at times as rehearsed and at times as confused. I'm worried, especially here in Michigan where the Obama campaign's voter-registration campaign is phenomenal -- you should see the volunteers in Detroit.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: This comment reminds me of one of our favorite &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes of all time -- Lisa the Vegetarian -- which contains the following lines:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Jimmy: Uhh, Mr. McClure? I have a crazy friend who says its wrong to eat meat. Is he crazy?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Troy McClure: Nooo, just ignorant. You see your crazy friend never heard of &quot;The Food Chain.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So true.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Austin, Texas: I find it amazing that polls in general show this race to be a dead heat. With most of the country agreeing that the past eight years have not been good, how is it that half of the populace believes that the Republican Party deserves to hold the presidency for another term? Is it the &quot;maverick&quot; label that McCain uses? Is he truly seen as an agent of change by independent voters?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: It's an interesting point. From a political environment standpoint, it's hard to argue that the playing field is badly stacked against Republicans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So, why is McCain competitive? My guess is twofold: Voters still see McCain as a maverick, independent operator and that image appeals to them,&nbsp;and voters still have real questions about Obama and whether he is ready to be president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's job, then, in the next&nbsp;eight weeks is to call into question McCain's maverick credentials while simultaneously making sure he assures voters he is ready and able to lead.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tough to do, but far from impossible.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: How do you think Palin did? Honestly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: What I think matters so very little. Less than you can possibly imagine.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Asheville, N.C.: The longer Palin holds off the media, the harder they pursue her, which plays to the whole &quot;media stacked against us&quot; mythology Republicans love. The more it's suggested she's hiding because she might be a lightweight, the lower her expectation bar drops. I think W proved in 2000 how valuable that can be. When and how does this stop being a win-win for her? Is the media's sole relevance in today's politics simply spelling names right and providing free advertising for the day's most spectacular spin, no matter how inaccurate?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: This shows that attacking the media is not the sole purview of conservatives.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The media: Hated by everyone.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Falls Church, Va.:&quot;Denali&quot; and &quot;Driller,&quot; eh? What are the Secret Service codenames of the other candidates and spouses? (I'm sure they've been mentioned, but I've missed them).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: 'Renegade' Joins Race For White House (Post, June 17)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: I just read that Biden's codename is &quot;Celtic&quot; and Michelle Obama is &quot;Renaissance.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Fix codename? We are partial to &quot;Animal&quot; or maybe &quot;Hoya&quot; or &quot;Cardinal&quot; in honor of our basketball and field hockey rooting loyalties.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We could always go simple: &quot;Fix.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Cillizza: That's all, folks. Thanks for joining me this morning and thanks for the continued support of The Fix.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Remember to check The Fix multiple times a day (100 or so would be helpful for my page views) for the latest and greatest news and analysis from the campaign trail.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Have a great weekend and don't forget to root for the Catholic University Cardinals field hockey team tomorrow as they take their show on the road for a game against the Randolph Macon Hornets! Go Cards!</span></p>
