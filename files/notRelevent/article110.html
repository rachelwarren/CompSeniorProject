  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sunday was the 41st anniversary of the day Senator John McCain was shot down over Vietnam, an event that might put into perspective these last nine days before the election in which he is trailing in the polls. He has been through worse. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> On ''Meet the Press'' on NBC, he undermined his attempt to separate from President Bush by saying, ''Do we share a common philosophy of the Republican Party? Of course.'' Senator Barack Obama immediately worked that into his speech, calling it ''a little straight talk,'' at last. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> If there is friction between Mr. McCain's camp and that of his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, he gave no hint of it on ''Meet the Press,'' where he defended her integrity in the wardrobe flap (''She lives a frugal life''). On the trail, he said that a vote for Mr. Obama would give ''total control'' of Washington to Democrats, including Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts liberal. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Takeaway: The attacks may fire up his base, but will they win over independents? Mr. Obama, meanwhile, barely suppresses a new glow (overconfidence?). His new television commercial calls Mr. McCain ''out of ideas, out of touch and out of time.''</span></p>
