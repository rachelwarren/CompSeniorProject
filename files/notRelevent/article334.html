  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">David Axelrod was surrounded by a pack of camera-toting, mike-wielding, pushing-and-shoving media types, one of whom asked whether his man Barack Obama had been &quot;too nice&quot; in the just-completed debate with John McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I don't think he was too nice. . . . There were clear differences. . . . He made a very strong case, absolutely,&quot; the onetime newspaperman said in his meandering style.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Twenty feet away, McCain operative Steve Schmidt was robotically hammering home a single number.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Senator Obama was right tonight when he said John McCain was right 11 times. . . . It was a home run for Senator McCain. . . . The person who is losing the debate, the person who is on defense, is the person who says his opponent is right 11 times,&quot; the shaved-head strategist declared. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama may have won the insta-polls after Friday's debate here at the University of Mississippi, but the McCain team won the spin war, a postgame ritual that quickly seeps into the punditry enveloping such events. What was equally striking, inside the massive media tent, was that some of the journalists who profess to want an elevated debate on the issues -- which is precisely what they got, courtesy of moderator Jim Lehrer -- seemed unusually interested in style points.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody asked Axelrod about the &quot;body language,&quot; saying: &quot;John McCain didn't make eye contact at all.&quot; Another reporter wondered whether McCain had been &quot;patronizing&quot; in dismissing Obama's lack of foreign-policy experience. A third asked whether McCain had hurled &quot;insults&quot; at his opponent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Perhaps the debate's sober tone -- lacking such memorable one-liners as &quot;There you go again&quot; or &quot;You're no Jack Kennedy&quot; -- left the journalistic handicappers searching for a more personal way to score the session. They disdain the predictable partisans who show up afterward, but these advocates -- from Madeleine Albright and Rudy Giuliani -- didn't lack for attention.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The spin is something we should pay less attention to, but it's important because it can change the story line,&quot; says NBC's Andrea Mitchell.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I find most of what these people say about exceeding expectations to be total baloney,&quot; says CNBC's John Harwood.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I guess it'd be news if someone came out and said, 'My guy did just awful,' &quot; says CBS's Bob Schieffer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The spinning began in earnest hours before the debate. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham insisted to a group of reporters that his close friend McCain had done the right thing in parachuting into congressional negotiations over the $700 billion federal bailout bill and threatening to abandon the debate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;What about the criticism that Senator McCain is impetuous, kind of a drama king?&quot; asked National Review's Byron York. Graham said McCain's participation had been &quot;invaluable,&quot; even though the bailout talks had imploded.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;But he suggested he wasn't going to come if there wasn't an agreement,&quot; said BBC's Katty Kay. &quot;There is no agreement.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Do you want him here?&quot; Graham asked. And, of course, the journalists did, or their trip to Ole Miss would have been pointless.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ten feet away, John Kerry -- who would have been mobbed four years ago -- looked around the tent, and when no one seemed interested in his presence, walked out.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Outside, on a summerlike evening, Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs held forth for the likes of NBC's Chuck Todd and New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, who was wearing an Elvis T-shirt. (The company may have been more pleasant than that of McCain aides, who have barred Dowd from the candidate's plane. And the Obama camp seemed to show its media leanings when it texted followers to watch the debate -- on CNN.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gibbs said he was merely trying to gauge the media mood. And what would his role be afterward?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I will be very, very frank,&quot; he said, laughing at the absurdity.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Moments after the debate, the front of the tent resembled a crowded bazaar, festooned with huge yellow signs for McCain surrogates and narrow blue ones for Obama advocates. The biggest names drew the largest crowds until the journalists grew bored and drifted off in search of better goods -- the free market at work.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While Axelrod fielded questions in one corner, McCain spokeswoman Nicolle Wallace was surrounded by a second press pack six feet away. She lauded her boss for suggesting he would consider a partial freeze on federal spending. &quot;That was a leadership moment,&quot; Wallace said again and again.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Minutes later the two stood awkwardly side by side, staring straight ahead at a robot camera, waiting for an interview with CBS's Katie Couric.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Go ahead, David, spin me,&quot; Couric began.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I don't need to spin you, Katie. . . . What you saw was one candidate making a forceful, compelling case for change,&quot; Axelrod said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When her turn came, Wallace -- who was working with Couric last year as a CBS commentator -- said: &quot;What was exposed tonight was a leadership gap, a judgment gap and an experience gap.&quot; Then she was back to McCain's &quot;bold&quot; spending freeze.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As the McCain team rushed out a Web ad featuring Obama repeatedly saying McCain was right about this or that, Fox's Sean Hannity, MSNBC's Chris Matthews and other TV hosts picked up the point -- a twist that left Obama press secretary Linda Douglass shaking her head.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I can't believe that anyone is criticizing someone, in this hyperpartisan environment, for being gracious enough to acknowledge where there are areas of agreement,&quot; the former ABC correspondent said. &quot;I find it surprising that journalists would be raising questions about a candidate who is capable of acknowledging that his opponent has a point.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Then she pivoted to how Obama had won a &quot;commanding victory&quot; on &quot;John McCain's home turf.&quot;<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">Palin Gets Panned </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sarah Palin has been struggling in her own debates -- with network anchors. While the Alaska governor hardly drew rave reviews for her interview with Charlie Gibson, her sit-down with Katie Couric last week opened the floodgates of criticism, even from conservatives.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin was halting, repetitive and occasionally stumped on basic questions. And the worst moments -- boasting again, Tina Fey-like, of Alaska's proximity to Russia -- have been endlessly replayed on other networks and the Web.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It may have been a turning point for Couric, who was persistent without being overbearing, in shedding early doubts about her ability to be a commanding presence in the CBS anchor chair. And the worst may be yet to come for Palin; sources say CBS has two more responses on tape that will likely prove embarrassing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While some journalists say privately they are censoring their comments about Palin to avoid looking like they're piling on, pundits on the right are jumping ship. MSNBC's Joe Scarborough says Palin &quot;just seems out of her league.&quot; National Review Editor Rich Lowry called her performance &quot;dreadful.&quot; Dallas Morning News columnist Rod Dreher described the interview as a &quot;train wreck.&quot; Conservative columnist Kathleen Parker urged Palin to quit the race, saying: &quot;If BS were currency, Palin could bail out Wall Street herself.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The interview is drawing extraordinary attention because of the McCain campaign's calculated decision to shield Palin from reporters. No vice-presidential nominee in modern history has been this inaccessible to the media, reinforcing the perception that she can't hit major-league pitching. When the networks balked at recording Palin's photo ops with foreign leaders at the U.N. last week unless journalists were allowed in -- and a CNN producer was granted access for all of 29 seconds -- the no-press dictum degenerated into farce.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin was buoyed for weeks by negative and sometimes unfair coverage, particularly about her family situation, that turned her into a sympathetic figure. But the Couric and Gibson interviews were the first real test of whether she could do more than read a punchy speech off a prompter. And even many of her supporters are no longer trying to spin her performance.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">Not Too Bright </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The rhetoric gets heated this time of year, but Paul Begala, the CNN commentator, went way over the line in calling President Bush a &quot;high-functioning moron.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The former Bill Clinton aide can be a witty partisan, but there are 50 ways he could have ridiculed Bush's capacity to govern without using such a slur. Begala, though, is undeterred: &quot;I said it. I meant it. I don't regret it. . . . You cannot imagine the positive feedback I've gotten.&quot;</span></p>
