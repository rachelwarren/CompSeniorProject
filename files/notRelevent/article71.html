  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">KISSIMMEE, Fla. -- Barack Obama pulled out all political and technological stops Wednesday, barnstorming across Republican territory, making a late-night appearance at a rally here with former president Bill Clinton, and blanketing the airwaves.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's first joint campaign appearance with Clinton, the last Democrat to serve in the White House and husband of his former rival, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., came on the same evening as his campaign aired a 30-minute TV ad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In what Obama aide Linda Douglass described as &quot;a bit of a high-wire act,&quot; the campaign cut from the pre-taped ad with a live feed from a rally Obama held in Sunrise, Fla., a suburb of Orlando, with his running mate, Joe Biden. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's&nbsp;ad ran simultaneously on several broadcast and cable networks at a cost of more than $4 million. It intertwined stories of families facing financial and personal difficulties with Obama's comments on how he plans to help them. It cut to the live rally just as Obama was reaching the climax of his speech.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If you'll stand with me, and fight by my side, and cast your ballot for me, then I promise you, we will not just win Florida, we will win this election,&quot; he said to the roaring crowd during the last part of the ad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad highlighted the enormous financial advantage enjoyed by Obama, who opted out of the public campaign finance system. McCain, who accepted public funding, is limited to $84 million for the general election campaign. In September, Obama raised $153 million and spent $106 million in the first two weeks of October.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Buying a half-hour block of TV time was a chance for Obama to capture the nation's attention and control the news cycle, said Ken Goldstein, head of the Wisconsin Advertising Project at the University of Wisconsin. &quot;Campaigns usually have very, very few chances to get through unfiltered to voters,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After the ad aired, Tucker Bounds, spokesman for Republican rival John McCain, said: &quot;As anyone who has bought anything from an infomercial knows, the sales-job is always better than the product. Buyer beware.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At his appearance with Bill Clinton, timed for the 11p.m. ET news, Obama took a shot at the current president and the Republican who wants to succeed him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We've dug a deep hole, and George Bush wants to hand the shovel to John McCain,&quot; Obama said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clinton's willingness to share a stage with Obama was also a sign of Obama's success in unifying the party after a bruising primary battle with Clinton's wife.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I am honored to be here to voice my support,&quot; Clinton said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The two Democrats' appearance came at the same hour that an interview Obama had with Jon Stewart aired on the comedian's Daily Show.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the interview, Obama joked that his daughters were appalled at his big TV buy. He quoted 10-year-old Malia as saying &quot;'Are you saying that my programs are going to be interrupted?'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I said, 'No, we didn't buy on Disney,'&quot; Obama said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama spent the day trolling for votes here and in North Carolina, two states where early voting is underway.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The last Democratic presidential candidate to win North Carolina was Jimmy Carter in 1976. The last to win Florida was Clinton in 1996.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Raleigh, Obama poked fun at attacks on his economic policies by McCain: &quot;By the end of the week, he'll be accusing me of being a secret Communist because I shared my toys in kindergarten.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain campaigned in Florida on Wednesday. Obama began in North Carolina. McCain spent the night in Ohio.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Florida: 27 electoral votes. President Bush won in 2004 with 52%.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">North Carolina: 15 electoral votes. Bush won in 2004 with 56%. <br /></span></p>
