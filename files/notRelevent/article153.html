  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Reliable Source columnists Amy Argetsinger and Roxanne Roberts were online Wednesday, Oct. 22, at Noon ET to discuss your favorite gossip, what you think about their recent columns or who you want to see them writing about in future ones.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Wednesday's New Reliable Source Blog: We don't think the McCain-Palin team meant to advertise alongside the fake-Palin porno. D.C. reality series ruins friendships before it even airs. Tina Fey says Palin is &quot;five times better-looking.&quot; Courtroom dramas for Britney, Duchovny, Pepa.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In recent days: Leo a no-show at Italian gala. Sarah Jessica Parker's Washingtonienne drama won't have much Jessica Cutler in it. High-powered D.C. lawyer by day, high-roller by night. Diplomats stay diplomatic about the election. Snowmobile vs. snowmachine?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">E-mail and bookmark Reliable Source Blog. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A transcript follows.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: Good morning everyone. Don't forget, we can also talk about Madonna's divorce. Or did we tackle that last week? Anyway, she's still getting divorced, and A-Rod is either still or Kabbalah soulmate or never was. Looking forward to your questions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandra: That Italian American dinner sounded really entertaining, even without Leonardo DiCaprio there. Did you guys get the chance to talk to Jack Valenti? From the picture in your paper, it looks like he was there.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: Stop teasing us, you meanie! Answer, and link, to follow.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: No Leo but Plenty of Stellas at NIAF Gala ( Post, Oct. 20)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hollywood, Calif.: Okay, guys, we're fans of the column, but a bunch of us has to ask: How on earth did a picture from 2006, featuring Jack Valenti, who died in April, 2007, at the age of 85, appear with the item on the Italian Foundation dinner on Monday, October 20, 2008, saying that Valenti attended and &quot;mingled&quot; at the 2008 dinner?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Corrections</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: Thanks for asking. Obviously, this was a terrible mistake, one that caused me to nearly spit out my toast with Nutella (from the gala gift bag) when I saw it in the paper Monday morning.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What happened is this: A layout editor, working late at night, was looking for more photos of the event to go along with the Gina Lollabrigida photo, and because of the search terms plugged in, the photo database coughed up an image from the same event two years ago. And somehow none of the late-night editors who glanced at the page noticed the mistake before it went to print. Also fair to note that the other two guys in the photo -- Mel Brooks and Alan Alda -- were NOT at this year's event. I mean, don't you think I'd have mentioned them in the story instead of Boom Boom Mancini?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anyway, everyone felt terrible about it Monday morning, and the correction ran yesterday. It also made us very nostalgic for Mr. Valenti whom we all miss. It's not a black-tie gala without him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Palin Makeover: So, the GOP has spent $150,000 on clothes, hair styling, and makeup artistry for Gov. Palin and family! I'm thinking Nancy Pelosi doesn't spend that much in 3 months (maybe because it's her own money, not someone else's), and she usually is flawless. Not sure whether I'm outraged, disgusted, or merely understanding why bloggers refer to the VP candidate as &quot;Bible Spice.&quot; Your thoughts?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roxanne Roberts: My thoughts: That's a LOT of money, even if they bought an entire wardrobe for her. Which----given that most people are cutting back and afraid to spend much right now---doesn't exactly fit with the &quot;average hockey mom&quot; persona. Even if they felt she needed a wardrobe makeover, someone at the campaign made a bad call by shopping at high-end stores.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Separated at Birth?: This occurred to me last week when Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics. Someone else did all the work putting the pictures next to each other in one Web site:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clooney/Klugman ( Google Images)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: That link should say &quot;Krugman&quot; not &quot;Klugman&quot; (though we don't write enough about Jack Klugman, do we?)... Eerie, isn't it?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Potomac, Md.: Where are Sargent and Eunice Shriver, at 92 and 87 years old, going to live if and when they sell their Potomac house for $11 million? Where are they moving to? And why is the Shriver son not having the Best Buddies fundraising ball any more? Why hold a bike race instead of a ball to raise money? Why not just hold the Best Buddies ball at another location? There are several hundred -- more than 500, at least -- alternate possible locations for the ball.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Annual Best Buddies Ball Rolls to a Glitzy Finale ( Post, Oct. 20)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roxanne Roberts: The Shrivers are selling the place because they don't really live there anymore. Eunice, 87, and Sargent, 92, both ave serious health issues and spend most of their time at the homes of their kids or the Kennedy compound in Massachusetts.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As for the ball---after 20 years, it's not a bad idea to change formats. Fundraising is getting increasingly hard,and events can get &quot;been there, done that&quot; after a few years. Maybe a bike fundraiser will attract a new group of donors.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Jealous: If I'd offered to run for vice president, would the Republican National Committee have bought me a $150,000 new wardrobe too?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roxanne Roberts: You betcha!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rockville, Md.: What is Sarah Jessica Parker thinking? Her plans for her new HBO &quot;show&quot; sounds simply like a lame, lazy rip-off of her previously overrated &quot;Sex and the City.&quot; Why spend money and time purchasing the rights to &quot;The Washingtonienne,&quot; which has its own distinct and original character, style, vibe and atmosphere, if you're just going to ignore the book and its atmosphere and produce a lame &quot;Sex and the City&quot; rip-off? And how involved is Jessica Cutler, the original Washingtonienne who wrote the book, in the television show? Did you talk to Cutler? And what is she doing now? What does Cutler think about Parker's plans for her book?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: We finally reached Jessica, too late to get into print, and she's sanguine about the whole thing. I think her line was, &quot;it's a TV series, not a documentary!&quot; She's impressed by SJP and excited to see how it works out. I don't think she has much involvement with the series at this point.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Is it true...: that the GOP spent $75,000 at Neimann Marcus on clothes for the Palins?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: RNC Shells Out $150K for Palin Fashion ( Politico, Oct. 22)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: Here's one story that lays it out.. .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pledge Drive: Roxanne --</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Loved hearing you on WAMU on Saturday morning during the pledge drive: &quot;We don't need your support. My cat gives me support. We need your money!&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roxanne Roberts: The brutal truth of pledge drives. My mission was to make it a tiny bit less horrible.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Washington's Last Corner Of Camelot Is On the Market Reliable Source, Sept. 12)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Falls Church, Va.: Don't know if anyone cares, but cute cop and I have been living together for a couple of months now. He has accepted a job in California (big promotion) so we'll be moving in December. I hope my dog likes the beaches in Coronado.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: Oh, we absolutely care. That's great news. Are you excited about SoCal? You should pick up surfing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(To those of you wondering: Yes, this is a long-running saga we've been following, ever since Falls Church asked us for advice about the cute cop neighbor who was always being nice and helpful. So bring us your love questions -- Hax is really too busy -- and we'll give you terrible advice, and maybe it will all work out for you too!)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sweet Seventeen: Madonna is 17 years older than A-Rod. Does that qualify as a cougar pounce?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: Stipulated that that's an offensive term, blah blah blah -- yeah, I think so.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Maryland: Do you girls and Wonkette ever get together?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger:&quot;Girls&quot;? Um, thanks?... I've had the pleasure of getting to know most of the editors who've run Wonkete over the past three years -- at least those who live here; there are a couple on board right now who work from afar, I think, and who I haven't met.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin's wardrobe: Not necessarily high-end fashion clothes. Could just be expensive because they were bullet-proofed. When you live in a state that has some parts close to Russia, you need to be careful.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: Ha!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Potomac, Md.: Some of the recent stories weren't clear about why Leonard Slatkin left the NSO to go to -- Detroit? Why leave the NSO, the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C.? No offense to Detroit, which is a great town, but the city's cultural scene, its symphony, and its symphony home literally don't quite match the levels of the NSO and the Kennedy Center, and Detroiters admit as much. One Detroiter, when told that Slatkin was coming there, recently said, &quot;Why is he coming here?&quot; So why is he going to Detroit?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roxanne Roberts: My guess? Time for a change. He recently split from his wife, ran a respectable but not steller course at the NSO, and is probably looking for a new challenge and fresh start. Plus, Detroit is not his only gig: He's guest conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and works with the Nashville Symphony Orchestra.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin fashion makeover: Well, at least she can shoot her own fur coat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roxanne Roberts: Best line of the day!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Another Last Corner of Camelot: Did Ethel Kennedy ever sell HIckory Hill?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: Nope, still on the market last we checked. And a bargain, now, at a mere $12.5 million.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Reality TV Hard On Friendships&quot;: Duh...because nobody is 100 percent perfect, 100 percent happy, or 100 percent easy to get along with.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: And how do you think reality-TV cameras and the glare of publicity factor into that?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ratchet the dog: It warmed my heart to read that Ratchet the Iraq puppy befriended by a U.S. soldier is safely in Washington and headed to his new home in Minneapolis this afternoon after 68K people signed a petition to bring him to America. I know, it's just one little dog, but I'm happy for him and the young soldier who will be welcomed by him when she returns.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Happy Ending: Soldier, Puppy to Be Reunited ( Post, Oct. 21)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roxanne Roberts: Awwww---me too. It was stupid that officials were so inflexible about it to begin with. I do, however, hope someone gave Ratchet a warm doggie coat---winters in Minnesota will be a shock to the little guy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New Blog: I'm finding it a bit confusing. Your names and pics are at the top, but Marissa writes all the entries? Are you exchanging some of your columns for blog entries?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: New format, if you haven't noticed. That's our regular old print column, but presented in a way that we hope will more reader-friendly online -- more photos, easier to link to and comment on, easier to find your way back to. Those first four entries when you go to our column link are the same four items you see in print today. Marissa's name showing up there is a technical oddity, based on the fact that she's inserting the photos and is thus the first person to handle the story files. Either that or it's going to turn out that she's the puppet master who really runs this show.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Falls Church, Va.: We're really stoked about the move, and as a native of Florida, it'll be up to me to teach cute cop Paul how to surf.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thanks for all of your advice!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: Good for you. Well, I hope you stay in touch in the chats, even though they'll be at 9 a.m. for you. Good luck with the move. There are supposedly all kinds of amazing real estate bargains in the San Diego area now.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Philadelphia, Pa.: Please congratulate Falls Church! Hooray for happy endings and new beginnings. Best of luck to you both.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roxanne Roberts: The first Reliable Source romance. Maybe we should run Date Lab!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wardrobes: Have either of you ever spent $150K on upscale garments in two months? Boggles the minds of those of us shopping at TJ Maxx and Marshalls.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roxanne Roberts: Oh, pleeeese! Amy and I together haven't spent $150K in our lifetimes on clothing. They never heard of the sale rack?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marriage Advice: The wife comes home from a business trip tonight.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">From a woman's perspective, what should I do to make her feel welcome after a trip-other than cleaning the house to what I think are her expectations?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She will be sad if Beckham does not return from Milan next year. Boo hoo</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: Have dinner ready. And, well, you know.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Reliable Source Blog</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washingtonienne: If you're going to do a series on young career women in Washington, both Dog Days by Ana Marie Cox (erstwhile Wonkette) and the books by Kristin Gore (Sammy's House and Sammy's Hill) are much better written and I suspect more accurate depictions of this sub-genre. Plus, Gore's heroine has a BF who is a sharky Washington Post political reporter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: Actually... Cutler's book got some not bad reviews, including from our own Jonathan Yardley, if I recall. We'll pull up a link.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Well, at least she can shoot her own fur coat: Would that be moose, with polar bear trim?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: That would be HOT.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin vs. Brangelina: Sarah Palin and her brood schlepping around the country is starting to remind me more and more of Brangelina, and not in a good way, I might add. Why aren't the Palin girls in school this time of year? Did the pregnant eldest daughter drop out? And on a similar note, are Obama's daughters in school this fall?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: Good questions, none of which we can answer with certainty and accuracy off the top of our heads but we'll look into it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;My cat gives me support.&quot;: You must have an unusual cat. My cat pretends to give support, but it's all a carefully crafted method of getting some treat for herself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roxanne Roberts: Once in a while, after there's plenty of food in the dish, he'll curl up on my lap and start madly purring. His brother has dibs whenever I'm sitting at the computer. I realize my main role is a reliable food delivery system I still like it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In fairness: Has any journalist investigated whether Michelle Obama or Jill Biden ever gets any of their clothes thanks to the DNC?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: I believe the Politico story said they could not find any comparable expenses in the DNC filings.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: Is it just me, or do your other readers get this empty, depressed, I need-a-shower feeling I have upon following your discussions? This is the third chat of yours I've read, and I can't take it anymore, I tell you ... thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: So... why are you here? No, seriously -- I'm curious.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy -- you are absolutely right: I hate that Cougar term. So insulting and demeaning. If a man is dating someone 17 years younger, there is nothing wrong with that. For a woman, there is something predatory about that. I can deal with making fun of Hillary Clinton's pantsuits or Sarah Palin's answers, but this is really insulting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pelham Park: Ladies, Our little church group got to see Equus this past week. Really heavy drama, and no singing or dancing. Also, I realize Broadway is more minimalist now than ever but that poor Daniel Radcliffe didn't even have a costume for a good deal of the first act!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: It hasn't been getting great reviews. Apparently the story seems pretty hackneyed and dated, from what the critics I've read have said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: A question I must know the answer to so I can figure out how much credibility to give your chat/column: do either of you have pets?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roxanne Roberts: Never NOT had pets. Grew up with dogs, cats, fish, hamsters, birds. Currently own two Siamese cats.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Capitol Hill Siren's Tell-All Fiction</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: Sorry, meant to add to that pet question. I used to have two cats, but one died (natural causes) and I lost a custody fight over the other to my parents.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Best Buddies: I obviously went to the Best Buddies ball at exactly the wrong time, between its early fun phase as a smallish dinner and its glamour phase (about to end.) It was the early 90s, and I went there at the behest of a PR person I knew, who was trying to find friends to go with. I didn't understand why until we got there. The &quot;ball&quot; (I don't recall there being any dancing or even an option to dance) took place at a large auditorium somewhere downtown (who remembers?) where we were subjected to endless appearances on stage by pre-Kathy Griffin D-list celebs, lamely and ignorantly extolling the virtues of this charity they knew nothing about. There were rumors that JFK Jr. was going to show, but he didn't. We got Wilt Chamberlain instead. This was immediately after his book came out, the one in which he bragged about having slept with 20,000 women. It was bizarre and skeevy, and I was sorry I had spent money on it. I would have preferred to make a larger donation to Planned Parenthood or WAMU.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roxanne Roberts: I bet a lot of people went hoping JFK Jr. would show up.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Silver Spring, Md.: You have a blog! Now I'll never get any work done!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: It's really just our print column in a more online-friendly format. Eventually we may start posting more stuff during the day. And if you post a comment, we might respond.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.: Any word on what Piper Palin is going to be for Halloween?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: Something ADORABLE, I'm sure. Seriously, this could be the GOP's October Surprise that changes everything.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Newark, Del.: I saw a promo for a new Patrick Swayze series last night. Is this a recycle or has he recovered? He looked great in the promo. There hasn't been much in the press on his condition. Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: This is a series that he started work on since his pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Supposedly he's doing well, though the prognosis is rarely good with that particular form of cancer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washingtonienne: I went to a Jessica Cutler book signing a few years back to get a copy for a friend of mine in California who was obsessed with the story (Seriously, it was not me). I asked her to sign it to my friend Tony, so which she signed &quot;To Tony, the best sex of my life.&quot; I didn't ask her to do that, but it oddly made me respect her so much more.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: That's strangely impressive. I mean, she knows what the fans want. Good for her.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thanks for answering my blog question: I think it was only confusing to those of us who don't read the print version of The Post and only read your columns online.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But know that I &quot;get it&quot; I do think the blog format will be easier to follow, so that's cool.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: More photos! That's always good.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: The big question -- will the Washingtonienne TV show help get Jessica Cutler out of bankruptcy? Or is she not making money off this show?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: This is what I'd love to know. She probably got a check when they sold the TV rights; does her deal allow for more money if the show airs and prospers? People tend to be cagey with these kind of financial details, though.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin's Wardrobe: I'd like to defend the expenditure, but I'm laughing too hard to pull together something coherent. Too bad no one in the GOP watches &quot;What Not to Wear,&quot; because they would have realized that a respectable wardrobe could be put together for $5k.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">$150k is the budget a Windsor would need when attending many ceremonial functions and changing clothes 4 times a day. And having to look royal while doing so, instead of merely respectable.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roxanne Roberts: That's the thing: Gov. Palin just needs to look neat and well groomed. No fancy dresses or jewelry. No need for a $3,000 suit when a $300 suit would do just fine. It's really tone-deaf to spend that much during the campaign.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: They do wine as well as cheese? My sister-in-law is a die-hard partisan of that place. She always has good cheese on hand.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tom Brady: Reading the posts about Tom and Giselle, he needs to stop hanging around with models and underemployed actresses. Frankly between the two (Tom and Leo DiCaprio), I'd go with Leo. He's not in danger of getting a concussion, among other things. And he might introduce me to his friend George Clooney.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: Well, if he shows up, that is. Ah, just kidding. He's reportedly laid up with pneumonia, which has got to stink.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roxanne Roberts: I did! He's adorable---smallish for a lab, wearing black tie. I was at the embassy, sitting on the floor in my ball gown talking to Skipper, when other guests walked in and thought I'd fallen down in a drunken heap. I had to explain that, no, Skipper and I were just bonding.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: Sort of the opposite. The deal with getting the new format is that they forced us to post a photo, and you know how weird we've always been about that. I hope to update that image of us sooner or later -- maybe one of the two of us with Jack Valenti?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It was stupid that officials were so inflexible : I don't think so. I don't pay taxes so soldiers can adopt dogs, that's not their job, not why we're there. Good feelings, happy thoughts, and whatever, buy it is not the role of the governement to adopt or transport dogs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roxanne Roberts: The government didn't pay to transport the dog---that was paid by private donations and a volunteer organization. Really, a little kindness and humanity in what is otherwise a brutal posting isn't going to keep the soldiers from doing their jobs.</span></p>

However, let's be honest here The Washingtonienne is someone who sold their dignity and sex for money. And the people she slept with, not that it would make it better, were nobodies. Why are we rewarding people like Ms. Cutler for being nothing more than naive loose moron?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Argetsinger: It's a business. SJP and HBO bought the story because they think they can make a series that people will want to watch. Simple as that.</span></p>

The U.S. Government, taxes, me. Who justifies spending U.S. money on dogs when kids run the sidewalks with less food? Dogs are cute, but Irani children are starving.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roxanne Roberts: No taxpayers dollars involved, people. And it would be a great world if the choice between saving one dog and saving starving children were that simple.</span></p>
