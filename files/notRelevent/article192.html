  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Oliver Stone is perhaps best known as the purveyor of compelling cinematic narratives of JFK and Nixon that had a loose association with the historical record. This time around, he is eager for his audience to understand that he is a rigorous fact-checker.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Everything in the movie is annotated,&quot; Stone asserts during an interview Wednesday as he asks an assistant to retrieve a notebook containing the backup for all the scenes in &quot;W.,&quot; his new biopic about George W. Bush, which opens Friday. The material will be posted on the movie's Web site, he says, and the world will see that though the director has taken certain liberties for dramatic effect, his basic findings and themes flow directly from the considerable body of work already published about Bush and his presidency.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We're dramatists. I don't claim to be a historian or a documentarian,&quot; says Stone, looking intense and a tad disheveled the morning after the red-carpet premiere of his movie in Manhattan. &quot;But we did read everything we could, and we tried not to cross the line of truth.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That proposition will surely be questioned for a movie that invents dialogue between Bush and his advisers in the Oval Office, speculates about the dreams that may haunt the president and presents a Freudian explanation for the invasion of Iraq as some kind of payback for a life-long series of resentments Bush has nursed against his dad, former president George H.W. Bush.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The release of &quot;W.&quot; will also test whether there's any remaining commercial interest in a president whose approval ratings have bottomed out in recent months. By Stone's own telling, a number of Hollywood studios passed on the project, convinced there wasn't a market for a movie about Bush, leaving the 62-year-old director to finance the enterprise through foreign investors.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Even so, Stone is convinced that he still has a fantastic story to tell, the details of which he claims are still unknown by many Americans. &quot;He's a character that you couldn't make up, bigger than fiction,&quot; Stone says, a fleck of his preppy upbringing in Connecticut and New York still audible in his voice. &quot;He's bumbled his way into this mess -- into this extraordinary nightmare. Frank Capra could not make this up. He's the reverse of 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's a great story, for Chrissake,&quot; Stone goes on. &quot;Mark Twain would tell it. Dickens would tell it. How could you ignore this guy? They ask me about Obama and McCain every day. . . . God, these are pygmies compared to what he has done. They are going to live in his shadow for a while.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Stone's obvious interest in the psychological roots of his character, a fascination Bush and his father famously detest, has Bushworld ready to trash a project few have actually seen. &quot;From what I have seen from the script and from I have seen of the trailers, this is how the lunatic asylum inmates would write it,&quot; says Karl Rove, Bush's onetime political adviser. &quot;It is so laughable to suggest that the actions of this president are driven by a dysfunctional relationship with his father.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Asked for her reaction, White House press secretary Dana Perino says only that &quot;The Post's readers will understand that we have more important things to do than comment on this ridiculous movie.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Still, Stone's movie is probably more nuanced than the president's defenders might expect from a director they see as a kooky left-winger. Stone has tried to debunk some of the traditional stereotypes about Bush -- in particular the notion that he's been led around by the nose by Dick Cheney or Rove. A number of scenes make clear Stone's view that Bush is the dominant player in these relationships and that Bush is shrewder than his critics will concede.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As portrayed by Josh Brolin, Stone's Bush, while perhaps goofier than the real president, also conveys the powerful charisma that propelled the onetime black sheep of the Bush family to the presidency after his alcohol-dominated younger days. &quot;He's oddly likable,&quot; Stone says. &quot;I am empathetic, not sympathetic.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The empathy may stem from some shared personal experiences. Both Bush and Stone grew up as the children of privilege (Stone was the son of a wealthy stockbroker). Both matriculated at Yale in 1964, though Stone would drop out and later volunteered for combat duty in Vietnam. Bush finished his degree and headed south, where he avoided the war by serving in the Texas and Alabama Air National Guard.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Stone, whose Vietnam experience fueled some of his most successful work (&quot;Platoon,&quot; &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;), says he did not know Bush at Yale but &quot;knew the type&quot; -- &quot;retrograde&quot; frat boy, as he puts it. They met once, in 1999, when Stone was invited to a Bush fundraiser in Los Angeles. After the event, Stone met privately with the then-Texas governor and says he came away charmed and convinced that Bush would be elected president the next year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Stone says the movie relied heavily on journalistic accounts of Bush that he says have broken through a &quot;veil&quot; of secrecy surrounding the administration; he cites in particular Bob Woodward's books, an account of prewar spin by Michael Isikoff and David Corn, Ron Suskind's &quot;The One Percent Doctrine,&quot; and books by New York Times correspondents Michael Gordon and James Risen.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We could not have made this movie without those breakthroughs -- those books,&quot; Stone says. He also says he got little cooperation from anyone in the Bush family or the administration, not surprising given his leftist reputation; he does say he got some technical assistance from unidentified people in the military who helped him structure a key scene in the situation room.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There will be much that purists for accuracy won't like about this movie. Bush does not call his dad &quot;Poppy,&quot; as the imaginary president does, nor does the elder Bush call his son &quot;Junior.&quot; Stone and screenwriter Stanley Weiser take real quotes and place them in different contexts; they have Laura Bush telling her future husband, &quot;I read. I smoke. I admire,&quot; a comment she actually made to Bush's grandmother. Nor did Rove routinely attend national security meetings, as the movie suggests, and he's a more robust figure in real life than as portrayed by Toby Jones, perhaps best known for playing Truman Capote in a previous film.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">More seriously, Stone's account almost certainly overstates the amount of formal debate inside the administration about the decision to go to war in Iraq, and assigns to former secretary of state Colin Powell (played well by Jeffrey Wright) a much more vigorous role as war skeptic than the historical record so far seems to support. Stone concedes as much, saying he elevated Powell's role to sharpen the dramatic tension. But he says he captured the essential truth -- that, as he puts it, Powell was rolled by Bush and signed off on the invasion.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Similarly, Stone believes he's on target about the fundamental nature of the Bush-Rove relationship, what he describes as an intense &quot;heterosexual attraction&quot; between the pol and his closest adviser. Yet while he describes Rove as &quot;Bush's brain,&quot; he says Bush is &quot;in charge&quot; and is not &quot;this manipulated guy.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I am sure he will be pleasantly surprised that he's not as ugly as he's perceived,&quot; Stone says of Rove, somewhat quixotically. &quot;I think he's far uglier, and I think we gave him the benefit of the doubt, like we did with Powell.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Stone says his departures from literal truth were reasonable accommodations to heighten dramatic interest: &quot;I think we got the overall thing right.&quot;</span></p>
