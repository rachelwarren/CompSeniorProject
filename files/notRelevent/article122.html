  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WHILE the presidential candidates are competing with each other over plans to bail out home mortgages across the country, pity the suffering renters of New York who are left out in the cold. The voluminous tax-cutting plans by Senators Barack Obama and John McCain do not address the fundamental disparity in the tax codes that allows homeowners huge deductions on mortgages but does not provide a similar benefit to renters, who make up around two-thirds of the city's households. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Senator Obama, for example, has promised to cut taxes on American families earning less than $250,000 a year. But the Obama-Biden tax calculator on his Web site, barackobama.com, shows that a family earning only $200,000, but without a mortgage, will get no tax cut under his plan, while a family with a $400,000 mortgage will get significant savings. </span></p>

Gramlich, a professor of accounting at the University of Southern Maine, who prepared his own tax calculator to compare the candidates' plans. (His Web site is electiontaxes.com.) Renters would have fewer deductions, he said.</span></p>
