  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The thing that surprised me most, after the $700 billion bailout bill finally passed, was that Barney Frank never cracked a smile.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It was Friday afternoon, minutes after the resounding 263-171 vote -- reversing Monday's stunning rejection of the bill -- and the House Democratic leadership was holding a self-congratulatory news conference. Photographers pushed and shoved and stood on chairs to capture the moment. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Standing at the lectern was the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. Behind her stood a half-dozen members of the Democratic leadership, including Mr. Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, who probably had more to do with the shape of the legislation than anyone other than Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. The executive compensation limits, the aid for struggling homeowners, the toughened oversight provisions -- those all came from Mr. Frank and his allies, who knew that Mr. Paulson's initial ''give me the ball and get out of the way'' approach was a nonstarter. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Frank, in other words, had every reason to exult. Yes, the Senate had larded it with $150 billion worth of tax benefits -- including the now-infamous ''kiddie arrow'' tax break. But as Mr. Frank himself put it, ''If you don't want politics in this process, you probably shouldn't be handing it over to 535 politicians. That's democracy.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Yet he was the only one at the news conference who wasn't beaming from ear to ear. Instead, as others spoke, he closed his eyes and, slightly but perceptibly, swayed back and forth. I've heard it said several times this week that financial panics sometimes end when everyone simply collapses of exhaustion. I don't know if we're at that point yet. But when I saw Barney Frank, I thought: there's a man who needs some sleep.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Although the vote didn't take place until a little after 1 p.m. Friday, everyone knew by 10:30 a.m. that it would pass. Before the debate on the bill, the House had to vote on the rules that would govern it. The Rules Committee had agreed that no amendments would be added to the legislation passed by the Senate on Wednesday. One after another, opponents of the bill rose to object.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''A bad bill got a lot worse,'' railed Representative Steven C. Latourette, a Republican from Ohio, his voice getting louder by the minute. ''This is a financial bailout package! The pork doesn't belong in this bill. This is an egregious rule!''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A reporter next to me said, ''He's in a tough re-election campaign.'' Just off the House floor, the House Republican leader, John Boehner of Ohio, was giving a brief news conference. Mr. Boehner, of course, had actively encouraged the House Republican revolt that had brought about the bill's shocking defeat on Monday. ''It is time to act,'' he said now. ''The members have a responsibility to protect the economy.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Twenty minutes later, the rule passed 230 to 190. ''That's it,'' said someone in the press gallery.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I wandered to the Speakers Gallery, where reporters interview congressmen as they walk off the floor. I joined a scrum of reporters around one of the bill's fiercest opponents, Representative Darrell Issa of California. ''This is a crisis created by Hank Paulson,'' he fumed. ''His fundamental mistake was thinking he could orchestrate these rescues one by one. I voted for this president twice. But I never voted for Hank Paulson.'' A minute later he called Mr. Paulson, with undisguised contempt, ''the day trader from Goldman Sachs.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I asked Mr. Issa whether, given the seriousness of the crisis, he would swallow hard and vote for the legislation. He looked at me like I'd lost my mind. ''This president turned a problem into a crisis,'' he said. ''Can we get out of this mess using tools other than this one? I think so. They could use the F.D.I.C. and the Fed to guarantee any loan made by any bank in the country. That would cost the taxpayers a lot less.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And the prospect that the economy might go down the tubes if this bill didn't pass? ''I realize that people are going to vote for this based on the fact that there is a crisis,'' he sniffed. He, however, wasn't going to be one of them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> By the time I returned to the House press gallery, the debate was in full swing. It was clear that the fear sweeping Wall Street had finally reached Congress. Fear -- fear of what could happen if the credit crisis didn't ease; fear that Congress would be blamed for making things worse -- is why the bill was going to pass. As Mr. Frank put it later, ''On Monday the politically expedient vote was to vote no. By Friday, it wasn't clear what the politically expedient thing was to do.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> One congressman after another recounted hearing from constituents after the Monday vote, who warned about the potentially dire consequences. California was worried about rolling over its commercial paper. People with decent credit were having trouble getting auto loans. Companies were seeing credit tighten, making expansion impossible. On Friday morning, the government announced that 159,000 people had lost their jobs in September -- the highest number in five and a half years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''We are out of choices,'' said Representative Zack Wamp, Republican of Tennessee. ''I voted against it. But pension funds are upside down in Tennessee. The cost of inaction is greater than the cost of this bill. I've been listening to small-business people who said to me, 'Thanks for saying no on Monday. Now hold your hand over your heart and vote yes.' ''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Two people played surprisingly large roles in the about-face in the House. The first was Warren E. Buffett, who said several times this week that the bailout bill could be a good deal for the government. Most elected representatives lack financial sophistication -- so when Mr. Buffett spoke out in favor of the bill it made a big impact. ''Buffett says if we do this right, we'll make a lot of money for the taxpayers,'' said the majority leader, Steny Hoyer, toward the end of the debate. Others mentioned Mr. Buffett as well.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The second person was Barack Obama. A week and a half ago, John McCain made a public spectacle of himself by ''suspending'' his campaign to ''fix'' the bill -- only to become paralyzed once he came face-to-face with the complexities of the situation. Mr. Obama not only supported the bill but made phone calls to members of the Congressional Black Caucus, many of whom voted against the bill on Monday. By Friday, many of them had switched sides.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And then there was John Boehner. Yes, he had voted for the bill on Monday, but he had also undercut it by encouraging the House firebrands who rallied to oppose it. It was clear that he been affected by the panic in the credit markets -- and on Main Street -- after the bill failed. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Boehner was one of the last to speak before the debate was cut off and the vote began. He sounded chastened. By then, the press gallery was packed. To the extent there was drama, Mr. Boehner supplied it. ''We're in the midst of a recession,'' he said. ''It is going to be rough. I ask you to remember the words, In God We Trust -- because we are going to need his help.'' As he walked back to his seat, even Democrats applauded.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Is it, though, in ''the best interest of the American people?'' I hope so -- but I don't really know. And neither does anyone in Congress. That is what makes this so hard for everyone who has to answer to constituents. Putting $700 billion of taxpayers' money at risk could turn out to be our salvation -- in which case they'll be heroes -- or it could turn out to be a giant mistake -- in which case they'll be looking for new jobs. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> For Democrats and Republicans alike, there is no set of principles or ideology to fall back on. Nor is there any precedent -- we're all in uncharted territory. People who are natural foes of this administration, like Barney Frank, joined forces with a Republican Treasury secretary, while natural allies were calling Mr. Paulson that ''day trader from Goldman.'' In the end, the possibility that we are on the brink of economic disaster overcame even election jitters. In Congress, it doesn't get any more serious than that.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As the Democratic leadership news conference was ending, someone brought Ms. Pelosi a copy of the bill -- by now over 400 pages. In her role as speaker, Ms. Pelosi signs bills before they go on to the president for his signature. With the cameras clicking furiously, she prepared to sign it. Just before she did, she glanced back at Mr. Frank and said, ''Do you want to have a look at it?'' She handed him the bill. He opened its big blue cover. And then, finally, he cracked a smile.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Let's hope the credit markets smile on Monday.</span></p>
