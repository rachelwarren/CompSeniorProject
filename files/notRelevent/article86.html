  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When it comes to the issue of taxes, saying that John McCain is running for a third Bush term isn't being fair to George W. Bush. He's proposing $300 billion in new tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and big corporations. That's something not even George Bush proposed. Not even George Bush proposed another $700,000 tax cut to the average Fortune 500 C.E.O. Not even George Bush proposed a plan that would leave out 100 million middle-class families. That's not change.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Senator John McCain</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Senator Obama has made a lot of promises. First he said people making less than $250,000 would benefit from his plan; then this weekend he announced in an ad that if you're a family making less than 200,000, you'll benefit -- but yesterday, right here in Pennsylvania, Senator Biden said tax relief should only go to 'middle-class people, people making under $150,000 a year.' You getting an idea of what's on their mind? Heh? A little sneak peak? It's interesting how their definition of rich has a way of creeping down.''</span></p>
