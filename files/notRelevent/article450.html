  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Milford, Conn.: Hi Shailagh. Timing question -- would Democrats be as nervous if their convention had followed the GOP's?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Good morning everyone, and thanks for participating on this CRAZY day. Tell me what's on your mind. Have you ever lived through a political cycle that's more difficult to read?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Milford -- good question, and something to ponder. I suspect the convention schedules were significant, at least through last week.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kensington, Md.: Though I'm hesitant to second-guess the advisers who so skillfully navigated the primary process for Obama, I'm simply amazed at how many unproductive (and sometimes counterproductive) tangents they are allowing the campaign to be led off on. It seems to me they should be hammering away on the two sides' tax plans. McCain's is Bush redux, while Obama's is populist and friendly to the middle class. Is this not a simple foolproof formula, against a backdrop of all the baggage the GOP now carries? Why complicate things with too-clever ads about disco balls and touchy e-mail references? It's the tax plan, stupid! What am I missing?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Think about all the incoming that the Obama campaign is now processing. From the Palin factor to this latest round of McCain ads -- it's very volatile. Check out the new Obama&nbsp;ad this morning -- it's much more direct than that email ad, which I thought was a little odd considering his struggles with older voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rolla, Mo.: When was the last time we had a vice presidential candidate outdraw the presidential candidate at public events?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Apparently lots of empty seats at McCain's event this morning...no wonder he and the governor are reuniting soon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Still confused: Gov. Palin again brought up Russia's proximity to Alaska in her interview with Charlie Gibson, pointing out that one could see Russia from some (remote) parts of Alaska. But he didn't ask about any dealings she has had with Russian government officials. Have there been any? I've heard nothing about this and really don't know the answer. Also, I am unclear as to just where she went on one foreign trip she has taken in her life, apart from Canada. Did she go to Iraq, or just to an Iraq/Kuwait border post?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: There were a lot of questions in that marathon session that tested what she knew, but not a lot of questions that reveals how she thinks or sees the world. As for Iraq, I'm not sure we know for sure -- apparently she may have crossed the border, but no more than that -- if anyone knows the latest on this, please fill us in.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Missouri: Do you think the revised strategy of attacking the continued and nonstop lies from McCain and Palin will gain any traction? It appears that they are ignoring the fact that they are being debunked by every source, and they still trot out the same lies ... bridge, travel, earmarks ... this should make for a nice ad campaign, just using their own words only. What do you think?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: The McCain folks are trying to make Obama look and act like a regular politician. They are trying to provoke him, in order to diminish his aura. So Obama's challenge is to defend himself, without compromising his appeal, both with his supporters and undecided voters. Needless to say, it's an extremely difficult needle to thread.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rockville, Md.: I may be a bit older than the average person, but that means my first programming class was in 1969 and I do have some knowledge of computers. That means that I am not impressed or dismayed when they say another person does not do e-mail. It is a preference, not a bar exam.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Right. This is what I meant. Frankly I wish sometimes I didn't know how to operate a computer either.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bethesda, Md.: It seems that this country loves to build celebrities up and then break them down. Do you think that Pallin is at the apex of her celebrity yet? Is the homeymoon almost over?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: If I were Sarah Palin's publicist, I'd be a little worried right now. Do I profess to understand what is driving this phenomenon? I do not. It seems to defy categorization. But her challenge will be maintaining a fairly unrealistic, folkloric image in the face of a lot of conflicting incoming information. Sound familiar? That's what Republicans are trying to do to Obama!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Vilcabamba, Ecuador: On a one-hour cab ride from Loja to Vilcabanba in Ecuador, the cab driver in his broken English kept asking me questions about Obama vs. McCain. Amazing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: I was just talking to a pollster about this -- apparently the level of interest, and the amount of information that voters are digesting, is off the charts. We'll see if it translates into people actually voting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lehman, Bear, Meryll, Fannie and Freddie, AIG...: Has either campaign got any real proposals for reforming the financial sector? I'm assuming the Democtrats favor more regulation of the financial industry and the Republicans don't...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: They're both pledging to &quot;clean up&quot; Wall Street. Whatever that means.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Catholic Bishops: I'm a pro-life Catholic. Obama and Biden's varying degrees of support for abortion rights is troubling for me. But why in the world are Catholic bishops only issuing press releases and making public statements about the abortion issue?! The Church is against the death penalty when other means of containing prisoners are available, supports treating immigrants with dignity and respect, and two Popes have spoken out against the Iraq War ... but there is nothing about any of this from American bishops, who seem to have no problem injecting themselves into the political debate when abortion is the issue. How about the bishops say something about McCain's divorce or infidelity to his first wife? There's a commandment about that one, too. Or better yet, maybe they could not use their position in the Church as a launching pad to disseminate their own political ideology!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Well, I'm a Catholic too, and this is certainly a difficult subject these days. We Catholics are just not used to that us vs. them dividing line, especially as it becomes sharper in other demominations. It's an uncomfortable place for a lot of Catholics and it's a risky gambit too, when you're trying to unify millions of people from all walks of life.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: Can anyone tell Sarah Palin that nuclear is pronounced just as it's spelled and not &quot;nucular&quot;? Is there a way to correct a politician without offending him or her?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Lots of people do this! It's so weird!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: So far, it seems that no matter what the Democrats throw at Gov. Palin, she remains standing, and continues to attract much interest among independent voters. Do we expect the Palin attacks to continue, or -- given that they don't seem to be working well to date, should we expect a new line of attack from the Obama campaign? Almost seems like David Axelrod is out of ideas at the moment?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: I wouldn't say that Obama or Biden are themselves unduly focused on Palin. The media certainly is. I think the problem is that nobody notices what the Democratic candidates say, unless they're talkinga bout Palin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Memphis, Tenn.:&quot;The fundamentals of the economy are strong.&quot; -- John McCain on Sept. 15, 2008. Just thought I'd give you that, because the McCain folks later will say he hasn't said that in months.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: I thought the financial markets were pretty &quot;fundamental&quot; to our economy, but maybe I'm biased after all those years at the Wall Street Journal.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Experienced: What is Sarah Palin's position on policy to address the lack of regulation and oversight that has deflated our financial system?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Well, she's on TV right now pledging to clean up that mess on Wall Street.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mansfield, Ohio: There has been a lot of attention given to accusations of &quot;press bias&quot; based on the nth-degree scrutinizing Sarah Palin is receiving. Some of this simply may be because Palin is &quot;fresh meat&quot; of sorts for the media, and many in the mainstream press simply defer by saying much already has been written about Obama back during the primaries.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My question is, does The Post have any intention (for the sake of undecided voters who are now for the first time really paying attention) of requestioning Obama/Biden to the degree they have Palin, and reprinting the potentially negative stories associated with Obama (e.g., Wright, Rezco, Biden's plagiarizing, etc.), or does the press tend to consider this &quot;old news,&quot; because it really is old news ... to them?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: I won't bore you with a lengthy defense of my struggling profession. I mean struggling in a Wall Street sense.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The deal with Sarah Palin is this: she is a totally unknown quantity who has vaulted to the absolute pinnacle of the political world. What are we supposed to do, reprint her Wikipedia page? Certainly folks are writing a lot of about her but HELLO!!!???? What's the alternative -- Pravda? (I wonder if they have home delivery in Alaska).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Nucular&quot;: That poster from New York needs to spend some time in flyover land. &quot;Nuclear&quot; is only pronounced as it's spelled on the coasts. Palin's pronunciation of the word is typical of the north plains (where her parents are from, I believe, and where she was born). She has a regional accent, just as the New York poster has, I'll bet. In fact, I'm sure that Palin wonders why New Yorkers add all those &quot;-er&quot; sounds to words like &quot;potato.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Like &quot;warsh?&quot; as they say in Missour-a.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Nor do the media listen to what McCain says ... unless it is about or in joint appearance with Palin. As frustrating as that may be for the top of the Democratic ticket. in the end, it is worse for McCain, who looks like the weak sister (sorry for the sexist analogy) on the ticket. McCain, it seems to me, is going to get tired of being the second banana here -- and sooner rather than later, I would think.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Yeah, I wonder about this too. Looking out at those thousands of empty seats this morning...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bethesda, Md.: So my wife had my mother-in-law and several of her friends over for dinner last night, and to a person each one of them believes that McCain is pro-choice. And this is a group that I am pretty sure is a lot more engaged and politically aware than most Americans. Then, when pressed on the issue of McCain appointing justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, most of the them seemed to believe that the country never would go back on that issue, and that it is a settled question.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So, why in the world is Obama not making this a bigger issue? We know who the anti-abortion folks in this country are voting for, but Obama is going to lose some of the large majority of Americans who believe in abortion rights, and I suspect some of the strongest believers are women who are disengaged on this issue. This Palin pick is looking smarter and smarter by the minute.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Memo to David Axelrod...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Well, she's on TV right now pledging to clean up that mess on Wall Street.&quot;: How?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Perhaps that question will arise in the debate. Or maybe Sean Hannity will press her on it this week.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington:&quot;Well, she's on TV right now pledging to clean up that mess on Wall Street&quot; You in the media all understand she's the bottom of the ticket, don't you? What, pray tell, is she going to do as vice president?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Dick Cheney found plenty to do.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Avon Park, Fla.: Why has Sarah Palin gotten more media attention than vice presidential candidates normally get, considering the conventional wisdom that they don't impact the race that much?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Because she's so pretty and has all those adorable children!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">No, seriously, when was the last time you saw a measured response to anything?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.: As a reporter, what is your response to the latest McCain campaign cant that they'd be a lot more positive if only Obama had participated in town hall meetings?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: I think Obama made a mistake by turning down this offer. It would have added volatility and uncertainty, but it would have placed the focus squarely on these two men, and forced them to address all these issues that you folks clearly care about, from abortion rights to regulating financial markets.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Iowa: The newest Iowa voter poll, taken after both the conventions, has Obama up 12 points over McCain, so Iowans still are hanging tough for Obama, the caucus winner so many months ago. Bush has now sunk to 25 percent approval in Iowa (a new low), so a continuation of that regime is a hard sell indeed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: I am not surprised by that Iowa poll. Obama spent tons of time there, and McCain spent almost none. Also, Iowans are strongly opposed to the war.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ellicott City, Md.: Regarding the banking news today -- people often say the &quot;fundamentals&quot; of the economy are solid. What do they mean by that? Employment numbers? Productivity? Or is it just something people say while everyone else nods in agreement? I'd love to hear someone ask &quot;what do you mean by that?&quot; the next time a politician says that the fundamentals are strong.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: This is an age-old debate in politics. Who cares if unemployment and inflation are manageable, if gas prices are sky-high, credit is hard to come by, and brand names like Lehman are going bust? That makes people feel insecure and skittish no matter what the reality is. I did think Alan Greenspan's comments about more tax cuts were interesting, and I would expect to hear a lot of that from Obama in the coming days and weeks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: Pronunciation of Nuclear: That has got to be the most creative talking point I have seen yet. As someone from the upper Midwest (Minnesota, to be exact), I can say with some authority that it has nothing to do with some kind of Northern Plains regionalism. The only people who pronounce it &quot;nucular&quot; are those who don't know the correct pronunciation of &quot;nuclear.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Flyover country speaks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mansfield, Ohio: Obama is proclaiming this morning that the current Wall Street mess is the fault of George Bush. Yet I've seen studies that refute this, and point directly to the Bill Clinton administration for the lazy policies that led to the mess we are in. Will any mainstream press like The Post compare the arguments and try to do an even-handed analysis? Or will they mostly just repeat the line Obama has given them?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: The free market rises, and the free market falls. It's an extremely complicated cycle, fueled by many forces. Given its track record in recent years, just be glad Congress has as little control as it does over what goes on.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Garfield, N.J.: Besides the hard-hitting and scrupulously honest former fireman from Long Island, Sean Hannity, what other &quot;journalists&quot; is Palin being interviewed by?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: How about those gals from The View? That would be pretty interesting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I have to sign off for today but thanks for the mountain of comments and questions and I'm sorry I couldn't get to everyone! But I salute all of you for paying attention. Cheers and see you soon, Shailagh</span></p>
