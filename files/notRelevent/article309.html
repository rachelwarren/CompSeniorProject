  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This week's Notebook is a compilation of items from The Washington Post's &quot;Virginia Politics&quot; blog.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The United Food and Commercial Workers Union donated $100,000 to the Virginia Democratic Party, the largest contribution it has received from an individual, business or union in a decade, according to the State Board of Elections and the Virginia Public Access Project.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The $100,000 was credited to the party's state account, meaning it cannot be used to influence this year's presidential or congressional races. But the donation allows the state party to pay its operating costs so it can focus additional resources on raising money for its federal account, which can be used to support Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) and congressional candidates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We are happy to have their support, and we appreciate a shared interest in working families' conditions in Virginia,&quot; said Jared Leopold, a spokesman for the Virginia Democratic Party. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The United Food and Commercial Workers has become one of the biggest financial backers of the state Democratic Party, excluding contributions from candidate and national party committees, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. The union fell just short of the largest single contribution collected by the party in modern times. In 1997, the AFL-CIO gave the state party a $110,000 contribution.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The food workers' donation will certainly become fodder for Virginia Republicans, who have long argued that state Democrats are too closely aligned with organized labor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The party also collected $10,000 from Al Dwoskin, founder and chief executive of a Fairfax County-based real estate corporation, and $25,000 from Hassan Nemazee, an Iranian-born investment banker from New York, according to the State Board of Elections. Nemazee, a major Democratic donor, served as co-chairman of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's (D-N.Y.) fundraising effort during her presidential campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> -- TIM CRAIG <br /><br /></span><span class="c7">Mining Votes for Coal </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) nveiled a radio ad accusing Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama of opposing clean coal technology in states such as Virginia, where thousands of jobs rely on the industry.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Former attorney general Jerry Kilgore (R) said the ad calls attention to Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s contradictory statements on supporting the coal industry while campaigning in southwest Virginia and other parts of the country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's very alarming,&quot; Kilgore said. &quot;This type of doublespeak has been caught onto by southwest Virginians and Virginians.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The focus on coal comes amid signs that Obama is making some inroads in southwest Virginia. A Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that 36 percent of likely voters in the western part of the state support Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> -- ANITA KUMAR <br /><br /></span><span class="c7">Kaine Pledges to Stay Put </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D) pledged to remain governor through his term even if Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama wins the presidency and offers him a job in the Cabinet.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Absolutely,&quot; he said on his monthly call-in show on WTOP (103.5 FM) radio. &quot;I'm going to stay as governor all the way through January 2010.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kaine, co-chairman of Obama's national campaign, had been seriously considered as a running mate for the Illinois senator. The two became friends after they campaigned together during Kaine's 2005 gubernatorial race, and Kaine has returned the favor, stumping nationwide for Obama over the past year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If I was asked to be vice president . . . I would have said yes,&quot; Kaine said. But, he said, he plans to remain a volunteer if Obama wins. &quot;I hope I can be helpful,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> -- ANITA KUMAR <br /><br /></span><span class="c7"> Of D.C., in D.C. but for Va. </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">D.C. Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) opened a local headquarters for Sen. Barack Obama in the District.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It might seem like Obama's campaign has gone overboard when it comes to opening offices. Dating to 1968, no Democratic presidential nominee has received less than 75 percent of the vote in the District. Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) carried the District with 89 percent of the vote in his 2004 race against President Bush.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But Obama's D.C. office will be focused on helping his campaign efforts across the Potomac River in Virginia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fenty and D.C. Council members Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large) and Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) urged 200 volunteers at the office opening to get to Virginia to help knock on doors. Obama offices and Democratic committees in the heavily Democratic Maryland suburbs are also geared up to help turn out the vote in Virginia this year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The D.C. office, in the 200 block of Florida Avenue NW near Eighth Street, will also have buttons, bumper stickers and yard signs for sale.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> -- DAVID NAKAMURA and TIM CRAIG <br /><br /></span><span class="c7">Acting Like a Democrat </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Jason Alexander, an actor best known as perpetually down-in-the-dumps George Costanza on the TV show &quot;Seinfeld,&quot; has weighed into Virginia's U.S. Senate race by helping former Democratic governor Mark R. Warner raise money.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If you thought Seinfeld was a show about nothing, you should check out Congress,&quot; Alexander said in a fundraising letter e-mailed to supporters. &quot;I can't remember such a lack of productivity since the summer of George.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The letter turns more serious after that. Alexander asks for donations, as small as $5, and talks about why he is throwing his &quot;full support&quot; behind Warner in his race against former governor James S. Gilmore III.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;He hasn't just talked a good game,&quot; Alexander said of Warner. &quot;As governor, he actually walked the walk by working across the aisle to deliver results and turn Virginia's struggling economy around.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The two met when Warner was traveling the country to gauge interest in a possible presidential run, Warner spokesman Kevin Hall said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> -- ANITA KUMAR <br /><br /></span><span class="c7">The Issue Isn't Abortion </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama are making inroads into their opponent's political base in Virginia when it comes to abortion.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, 60 percent of registered voters said abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Thirty-eight percent said abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. Voter attitudes on the issue have essentially remained unchanged since 2000, according to previous Washington Post Virginia polls.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain disagrees with the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that established a woman's right to an abortion. Obama supports Roe v. Wade.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But 30 percent of voters who want to outlaw abortions said they also support Obama. Thirty-three percent of those who favor abortion rights said they back McCain.</span></p>
