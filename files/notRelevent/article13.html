  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It seems unlikely that Chris Berman's halftime interview of the two major-party candidates on ESPN's &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; the night before the 2008 presidential election might actually impact on the final outcome.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And yet, didn't you want to stand up and cheer when Barrack Obama, asked by Berman to name the one thing in sports he would like to change, smiled into the camera and fairly shouted, &quot;I think it is about time we had playoffs in college football. I'm fed up with those computer rankings. Get eight teams -- the top eight teams -- right at the end. You got a playoff. Decide a national champion.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Now, before you totally scoff at the notion that Obama's loud-and-clear, no-spin position could win him a vote or two, let's go to the battleground state of Pennsylvania and have a little speculative fun.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Say you're a fan of Penn State's undefeated football team, currently No. 3 behind Alabama and Texas Tech in the BCS rankings. If those two teams win out and finish in the same order, the Nittany Lions and their octogenarian coach could actually get shut out of a shot at a national title, something that would not make you very happy. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> So here comes Obama, saying in prime time--at halftime of a game featuring one of Pennsylvania's most popular sports teams--that he wants to see a college football playoff, one that this season almost certainly would have to include Penn State and Joe Paterno.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> If you were living in Pennsylvania and still undecided on your choice for president, isn't it possible that you might recall Obama's call for a playoff just before you pulled the lever?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And let's take this one step further. Maybe a couple of hundred previously undecided Penn State football fans tuning in to the Steelers game actually based their vote for Obama on his college playoff stance (it sure beats flipping a coin, right?). And then, maybe he wins a critical battleground state that had been up for grabs by those same couple of hundred votes, making it impossible for McCain to win the electoral college.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Stranger things have happened.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> For a prime example, go Google &quot;Supreme Court and Al Gore.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> By the way, John McCain's answer to the same Berman sports-related question was focused on his desire to &quot;take action&quot; on eliminating performance enhancing drugs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Memo to the senator from Arizona: Congress already has tried to take action, even conducting highly publicized (and politicized) hearings starring the likes of Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Roger Clemens. Clearly, this ship has already sailed, leaving McCain (and Barry Bonds) in its wake. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But could you imagine an Obama administration throwing its weight behind a college football playoff following the inaugural parade in January? Whoa Nellie, Keith Jackson might even be tempted to come out of semi-retirement and go rumblin' stumblin' and bumblin' all the way to Capitol Hill to testify in favor of the idea.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And so, let's give full credit to Berman for a job well done on Monday night. Seriously, he asked some really smart, legitimate questions during his edited satellite chats with both candidates, taped earlier in the day Monday. We'll never know what stayed on the cutting room floor, but both Obama and McCain also were definitely good sports for participating &Acirc;&iquest; even if the side benefit was a bit of very free national television exposure the night before the nation's voters headed to the polls.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Perhaps Monday night might also represent a turning point in Berman's own career. He actually looked the part of a legitimate news anchor and got at least one provocative, news-making answer out of the session. He didn't fool around with ridiculous nicknames or his signature &quot;back, back, back, back&quot; call, and he wasn't even featured as a pitchman in a single beer commercial during the telecast.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> We've been saying for years that real anchors don't take money to shill for products in television commercials. So who knows? Maybe Berman has been paying attention and Monday night represented the start of a welcome trend. And now, if the so-called &quot;Swami&quot; gazes into his crystal ball, is it possible he could actually see a new gig as host of Meet The Press in his future?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Just kidding. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ESPN's wide-ranging, seemingly all-encompassing 90-minute NFL pregame show before the Washington Redskins succumbed to the Pittsburgh Steelers predictably used Tuesday's election as a clich&Atilde;&copy;d backdrop virtually from start to finish.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Berman began at the top of the show by telling the audience &quot;thank you for putting us on your ballots tonight.&quot; He ended with his introduction of game predictions from his analyst colleagues by wondering, &quot;will it be a landslide or will it be a split decision?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Still, in between, ESPN, with Berman as a multi-tasking and entertaining ringmaster, offered its viewers an almost overwhelming tidal wave of interviews, analysis, breaking news, pointed opinions, taped highlights from the previous day's games and discussion of various NFL hot topics, all presented by a seeming cast of thousands.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I particularly enjoyed the &quot;C'mon Man&quot; feature, focusing on all manner of football follies -- dropped passes, dumb penalties, big-time fumbles -- each foible followed by an exasperated &quot;C'Mon Man&quot; chorus from the panel of Berman, Cris Carter, Keyshawn Johnson, Tom Jackson and Mike Ditka.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I also had to laugh when Carter actually said on national television that former quarterback Jeff George, one of the great busts in league history, was &quot;more talented&quot; than Pittsburgh's Ben Roethlisberger. Jeff George? The very same genius who once said during a mercifully brief stint with the Redskins that leadership at the quarterback position was overrated?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The good news is that Carter's fellow panelists vehemently and occasionally mockingly disagreed with Carter. Talk about a &quot;C'mon Man&quot; moment.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Redskins fans had to be delighted to hear ESPN analyst and Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young describe running back Clinton Portis and quarterback Jason Campbell as legitimate most valuable player candidates. Young also predicted that in Jim Zorn, Washington has &quot;a coach who's going to be here for 10 years. &Acirc;&iquest; The Redskins can go all the way this year.&quot; Of course, that was said before the 23-6 loss to the Steelers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Former NFL quarterback Trent Dilfer apparently is ESPN's new pregame bomb thrower, and we're not talking 60-yard practice throws during warmups.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In response to the report that former No. 1 draft choice Brady Quinn would be replacing Derek Anderson at quarterback for the struggling Cleveland Browns, Dilfer said &quot;this shows so many layers of dysfunction on the Browns. You don't bench the quarterback on a bad football team. &Acirc;&iquest; I played in Cleveland for a year and I was amazed by how much the front office is influenced by public opinion, one of the reasons this team makes these knee-jerk decisions.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> So Trent, tell us what you really think.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Sadly, Dilfer was only on camera for a few minutes, but this is a guy who definitely needs more air time. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Paralympics have never received much attention from the print or broadcast media save for the occasional uplifting story focusing on these inspirational and, yes, world-class disabled athletes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But that's going to change starting Sunday on NBC and continuing the following week on the Universal Sports network, available to 30 million cable viewers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> NBC has produced a 90-minute special narrated by Bob Costas focusing on eight U.S. individual athletes and the players on the American wheelchair basketball team. They all competed in the recent Paralympics in Beijing following the 2008 Summer Games, including wheelchair racer Tatyana McFadden of Clarksville, Md.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I've seen some of the footage from NBC's Sunday afternoon special (starting at 2:30 p.m.) without Costas's voice-over. Trust me, with the Redskins on a bye week, it would behoove viewers to temporarily tune out the NFL and tune in to NBC for what should be a dramatic and more than occasionally emotional documentary.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Starting on Monday and running through Nov. 16, Universal cable will air four hours a night of previously taped competition from 7 to 11 p.m., a total of 28 hours. It's a fraction of the coverage devoted to the Olympics, but this is definitely a start, as well as sure-fire, must-see television. </span></p>
