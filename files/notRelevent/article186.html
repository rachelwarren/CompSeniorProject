  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">CFA-IAMS CAT CHAMPIONSHIP</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> This weekend both Barack Obama and John McCain will appear at Madison Square Garden. They won't debate, give speeches or sign autographs, and they may not even make eye contact. Any expressed hostilities are likely to be, well, catty.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> That's because this Obama and this McCain are cats. Barack Obama, a Bombay, and John McCain, a silver tabby, will star at the CFA-Iams Cat Championship. Balloting stations will be near their cages, and visitors, especially children, will be encouraged to vote in what promises to be a rather unorthodox election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Our intention is that people will vote for the cat that they like,'' said Allene Tartaglia, executive director of the Cat Fanciers' Association, which sponsors the show with Iams, the pet food company. The championship, she stressed, is never political, at least not in the Washington sense. ''We became aware of this Bombay cat named Barack Obama,'' she said, ''and we thought this could be fun.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Fun is emphasized at the show, which is a family event as well as a serious competition. Young spectators can learn more about the 41 feline varieties, including the American curl, the Russian blue and the Egyptian mau, at the Breed Showcase, which will also offer information like how to bathe a cat (without water, and, yes, carefully). </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And while domestic cats aren't exactly known for jumping through hoops for humans, many are expected to do just that (above, a Japanese bobtail). Cats from TV commercials will demonstrate their abilities, and ordinary pets will show off in the Feline Agility Competition (entries are now closed), which involves navigating tunnels, mazes and stairs. ''When food is introduced, it is amazing what cats will do,'' Ms. Tartaglia said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In addition to the competitors the show will feature dozens of adoptable cats from the Mayor's Alliance for NYC's Animals. All are solid, appealing candidates -- for pets, that is. (Saturday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; the Expo Center, 877-232-7469, cfa-iams-cat-championship.org; $15 a day; $13 for 62+ and 12 and under.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> FOR CHILDREN</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 'ADVENTURES WITH DORA AND DIEGO' (Friday through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The young Latino stars of the Nickelodeon animated television series ''Dora the Explorer'' and ''Go, Diego, Go!'' have taken their expeditions into new territory at the Children's Museum of Manhattan, whose exhibition has separate Dora and Diego environments, including Diego's Animal Rescue Center and Dora's Fiesta. Intended for ages 2 to 6, the interactive, bilingual displays are designed to teach language, science and music skills, as well as facts about Latin America.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY (Friday through Thursday) Creatures that creep, crawl, slither and even swim are definitely the museum's stars. The popular 2006 exhibition ''Lizards &amp; Snakes: Alive!'' has returned, with more than 60 breathing (and hissing) examples, from five continents. The museum is also showing the Imax film ''Sea Monsters: A Prehistoric Adventure'' every hour on the half-hour from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Its subject is not the monsters of myth but very real species, like Dolichorhynchops and Styxosaurus, which swam the oceans while T. rex walked the earth. Open daily, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., at Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5200, amnh.org.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 'ARCHAEOLOGY ZONE: DISCOVERING TREASURES FROM PLAYGROUNDS TO PALACES' (Sunday, Monday and Thursday) Children will step into the shoes of an explorer like Indiana Jones in this exhibition at the Jewish Museum, but the adventures will be purely scholarly. Still, there is plenty of excitement in analyzing artifacts like a jar handle, a clay jug and a bangle and figuring out the purpose behind ancient pieces like a Greek helmet and a bull-shaped vessel. This interactive show also includes a recreated room from the Ottoman period (about 1900), where young archaeologists can dress in costume. (Through June 15, 2009.) Sunday, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Monday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org.

As the title implies, this series is devoted to cross-generational fun, and for its inaugural event it will feature a cross-generational bill: AudraRox, a family-oriented rock band founded by Audra Tsanos, and Toxic Muffin, a tween rock band led by Ms. Tsanos's son Tino.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 'CAPITALS OF MUSIC: BERNSTEIN'S NEW YORK' (Saturday) Leonard Bernstein was a pioneer in creating concert programs for the young, so it's only fitting that the current celebrations of his life and work should include an event for children. This season-opening program in the New York Philharmonic Young People's Concert series (which Bernstein founded) is devoted to his works about New York, like excerpts from ''West Side Story'' and ''On the Town,'' as well as pieces by Gershwin, Copland and Sebastian Currier.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PAUL GREEN'S SCHOOL OF ROCK BEST-OF-SEASON SHOW (Saturday) You don't have to be a grown-up to be a rocker. (Some would argue that adulthood, at least as a state of mind, is a disqualification.) The performers at this three-hour concert will prove it. Ages 7 to 17, they are from various New York and New Jersey branches of the Paul Green School of Rock, the Philadelphia-based music institute that was the subject of the documentary ''Rock School.''
