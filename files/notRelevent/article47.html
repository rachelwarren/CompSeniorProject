  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Wednesday, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, played before a couple of thousand people at a minor-league ballpark in Florida. On Thursday, Mr. Biden drew fewer than 1,000 in a college gymnasium in this Pennsylvania city, home to the Little League World Series.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> That is not to say that the man who has taken to calling himself Joe the Biden is strictly small-time. He appeared Wednesday night before an estimated 20,000 people at the BankAtlantic Center in Sunrise, Fla. (However, he was the undercard for a guy named Obama.) </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> With the political world fixated on the Barack Obama phenomenon and the Sarah Palin curiosity, Mr. Biden is flying low, speaking at smaller locations and in out-of-the-way towns in battleground states. While he avoids the national news media, fearing a major gaffe, he has done an estimated 200 interviews with local television and radio stations and regularly appears on the front pages of newspapers in places like Williamsport; Greenville, N.C.; and Danville, Va.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Biden operation feels more like an early primary enterprise than a campaign in the final week of an intensely contested presidential race. His traveling entourage is relatively small. And the crowds at his rallies -- lately numbering in the low thousands, rather than the low hundreds seen earlier this fall -- are dwarfed by those who come out for Senator Obama, of Illinois; Senator John McCain of Arizona; and Governor Palin, of Alaska.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Yet at the Biden rallies, there is a genuine enthusiasm among the people, who sense the historic nature of the race and for whom a speech by Mr. Biden is as close as they will get this year to seeing a national candidate. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Many at the Biden stops know only the outlines of his biography, but they all know that he has spent much of his life in the Senate, is a foreign-policy expert and is not Ms. Palin, his counterpart on the Republican ticket. They tend to be quite a bit older than the people who show up at Obama events, and, naturally, they are partisans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> An unscientific sample of Florida voters was given a short word-association test this week. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Joe Biden?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Change,'' said Patrice Kelly, 55, a commercial photographer from Jupiter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Good guy,'' said Walt Huston, 57, an unemployed former furniture-store manager from Ocala.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''He speaks his mind,'' said Zonnie Woods, 64, a retired teacher from McIntosh. ''I love him, O.K.?''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Dave Bowden, 65, of Leesburg, a publisher of training manuals for music teachers, said, ''Honest.'' As for the Alaska governor, Mr. Bowden said, ''I think she's gorgeous but, bless her heart, she's not ready to be president of the United States.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Somewhat Silenced</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> On the trail this fall, Mr. Biden has curbed his noted volubility -- or, rather, had it curbed for him by his masters at Obama headquarters, in Chicago. He never goes to the press section of his campaign plane to talk to the reporters who accompany him, he has not held a news conference since early September and he does not take questions from his audiences (not since he told one person that he thought Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York would have been a better choice for vice president). Then again, Mr. Biden's assignment does not include outreach to the national news media. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Still, Mr. Biden has not been fully silenced, leading even Mr. Obama to chide him for what Mr. Obama referred to diplomatically as ''rhetorical flourishes.'' Some Biden musings last week about Mr. Obama most likely being tested by a hostile power in his early months in office were turned into an attack advertisement by the McCain campaign and a spoof on ''Saturday Night Live.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> These days, Mr. Biden races through his thoroughly vetted stump speech, sometimes delivering it in as few as 15 minutes -- a mere throat-clearing for the old Joe Biden. He reads from a teleprompter, altering the text only slightly to mention the place where he is speaking and the local dignitaries who are present. (Mr. Biden will also occasionally slip in a geographically appropriate pander. ''How 'bout them Phillies?'' he said in Williamsport of the team that won the World Series. And on Wednesday in South Florida, he mentioned his longtime support for Israel.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Connecting With Voters</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A national poll from the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press released last week found that 60 percent of respondents viewed Mr. Biden favorably, while 44 percent had a similar view of Ms. Palin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Surveys indicate that he is well regarded in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, states where he has been spending a large share of his time and where his task is to attract blue-collar workers, Roman Catholics and older people.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Because of the lighter security cordon around him, Mr. Biden can connect with voters in a more visceral way than Mr. Obama. Last week, at an ice-cream shop in Charleston, W.Va., he spoke in a whisper for five minutes with Sara Beal, a young woman who had suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm like the one that almost killed him 20 years ago. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> During a stop on Tuesday in Titusville, Fla., he met a 1-year-old named Hunter. That happens to be the name of Mr. Biden's younger son, who is traveling with the campaign this week. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Biden fetched Hunter Biden, 38, from the motorcade and introduced him to the toddler. ''Hey Hunter,'' the senator said. ''Meet Hunter.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And the old man, bless his heart, was beaming.</span></p>
