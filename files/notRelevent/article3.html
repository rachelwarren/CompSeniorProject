  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The final full day of campaigning was a blur of rallies, plane rides and meet-and-greet encounters for the candidates, and at every step of the way four New York Times reporters were there to chronicle the hectic final push. The following are dispatches from Elisabeth Bumiller on the McCain campaign, Jeff Zeleny on the Obama campaign, John M. Broder on the Biden campaign, and Julie Bosman on the Palin campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">8:40 a.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Senator Barack Obama leaves his hotel in Jacksonville, Fla., where he had arrived seven hours before on a late-night flight from Ohio. As he went to the gym for a morning workout, he did not say anything, but he had received word around 8 a.m. that his grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, had died after a battle with cancer. In talking about her later, he called Mrs. Dunham ''a quiet hero.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">9:30 a.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Well, here we are in Tampa, Fla., at Senator John McCain's first stop on a seven-state, 20-hour odyssey across America. He is already running a half hour late. Not a good sign. ''Hurry up! Hurry up!'' yell Secret Service agents at reporters scurrying from the campaign plane into the waiting motorcade.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Within minutes, Mr. McCain arrives at his rally at Raymond James Stadium, the home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and a Barack Obama-sized site with a 65,000-person capacity. Mr. McCain is not actually in the stadium, which sits empty on a warm Florida morning, but across the street in the parking lot. The crowd here is small, in the hundreds, but Mr. McCain is tearing into his stump speech as if he were addressing the Rose Bowl, although with a bit of sleep in his voice. He got to his hotel in Coral Gables, the Biltmore, at 1:30 a.m., after a midnight rally in Miami.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">''With this kind of enthusiasm, this kind of intensity, we will win Florida!'' he shouts. He seems to be waking up. Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida is here, as is Senator Mel Martinez, also of Florida.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. McCain runs through a truncated version of his stump speech. Mr. Obama cannot be trusted to run the country, he will raise your taxes, kill jobs, and so on.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wow, now he is already winding up. ''Fight for a new direction for our country!'' And ''fight to clean up the mess of corruption!''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He is already done. His speech clocked in at a little more than 13 minutes. This might be a record.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">11:03 a.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri steps to the microphone to introduce Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Lees Summit, Mo., and notes that the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, is also in Missouri this morning, at a rally in Jefferson City.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The crowd boos. Ms. McCaskill hushes them. ''As Barack Obama says: 'Don't boo. Vote.' ''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ms. McCaskill then adds, speaking of Mr. Biden, ''Barack Obama chose the very best person in the country who could be president of the United States, and, well, let's just say, John McCain didn't.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">11:15 a.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For more than three hours, supporters have been filling the seats of the hall in anticipation of Mr. Obama's visit to Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Jacksonville, not far from the banks of the St. Johns River. Then the candidate arrives.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">''I have just one word for you, Florida: Tomorrow,'' Mr. Obama says, drawing huge bursts of applause. ''We are one day away from changing the United States of America.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With Mr. McCain already well into his day, was Mr. Obama sleeping in this morning? No, his aides say.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After arriving at the Hyatt in downtown Jacksonville in the early morning hours, he emerged from the hotel at 8:40 a.m. -- yes, that was the Democratic nominee in a ball cap and black sweat pants -- and took a short ride to a Gold's Gym. For about 45 minutes, he worked out.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When he returned to the hotel at 9:28 a.m., he went into seclusion. Aides said he had breakfast, made phone calls and met with a few advisers who were briefing him on his day, which includes rallies in Jacksonville, in North Carolina and in Virginia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Why only three states for Mr. Obama, when Mr. McCain is racing to seven over the next 20 hours? First, aides said, the Obama rallies are held in large arenas, not airport hangars, so they take more time. And second, they said, the rallies are intended to sign up supporters to help on Election Day, so it is important to have a big crowd, rather than just a quick stop for the local cameras.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">11:26 a.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yes, Mr. Obama is using a teleprompter for his speech in Jacksonville, but apparently he is not reading it carefully. About 10 minutes into his address, Mr. Obama is talking about the television commercials that Republicans have been showing against him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">''Here in Ohio,'' Mr. Obama begins. He pauses momentarily, as people in the crowd shout at him. Realizing his mistake, he quickly corrects himself. ''Florida!''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">''I've been traveling too much,'' Mr. Obama says, before continuing with his remarks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">11:50 a.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Stop No. 2 for Mr. McCain, still some 20 minutes behind schedule. Tennessee's electoral votes are not up for grabs in this reliably red state, but Mr. McCain has descended into Blountsville in this far northeastern corner to reach into television markets in southwestern Virginia and a bit of North Carolina, two states he desperately needs to win.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We are in an airplane hangar and the crowd is roaring and big, in the thousands. Mr. McCain's campaign plane is parked right behind him as a backdrop for the television pictures. The day is gorgeous, sunny and crisp. The loudspeakers are terrible.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">''This microphone is brought to you by the Democratic National Committee,'' Mr. McCain intones, to laughter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And here he is, Joe the Plumber. Big boos as Mr. McCain says, yet again, that Mr. Obama wants to ''spread the wealth around.'' And ''he's in the far left lane of American politics.'' And he has never taken on the leaders of his own party. And he said he would sit down unconditionally with dictators. And so on. Mr. McCain is pumped up.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">''The Mac is back!'' he shouts.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On the plane from Tampa, someone asked Mark Salter, Mr. McCain's close adviser, how he planned to get through the day. ''Crystal meth,'' he replied, not missing a beat. ''Me, personally, that's how I'm going to do it.'' He was kidding. But he did not bother to say he was speaking off the record.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">12:36 p.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Palin entourage just arrived in Jefferson City, right in the center of Missouri. We are at a rally staged on the steps of the State Capitol, on a dazzling, sunny 70-degree afternoon. As the reporters are ushered to their workspace, a few people in the crowd throw out a few stray heckles. ''Come on, reporters, why don't you do a good job for once!'' an elderly woman calls out. ''Booo, liberals!'' another man shouts.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There is a large crowd here, but nowhere near the estimate of 20,000 people that a campaign staff member just told reporters. There is little sign of Mr. McCain -- most of the signs say ''Country First'' or ''Reform, Prosperity, Peace.'' A group of women wearing T-shirts that say ''Sometimes it takes a woman to clean house'' are chanting ''Sarah! Sarah!'' and the song ''Everyday People,'' by Sly and the Family Stone, a Palin favorite, is playing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sounding hoarse, Ms. Palin introduces Hank Williams Jr., who delivers an off-key rendition of the national anthem and a song about the ''left-wing liberal media,'' which makes the crowd go wild.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ms. Palin delivers a 25-minute speech, attacking Mr. Obama for his tax proposals, and making a passing reference to the weather. ''The sun is shining on his plans for where he wants to take America,'' she says of Mr. Obama. ''His whole tax plan is so phony that it's already starting to unravel.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She points out a sign in the crowd: ''Like that sign -- not just drill, baby, drill and mine, baby, mine, but vote, baby, vote!''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">1:50 p.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Stop No. 3 Mr. McCain, in Moon Township, Pa. This is one of the great datelines. In fact it is very much of this world -- the site of the Pittsburgh airport and conveniently located in Western Pennsylvania, home to all those pro-gun, working-class voters that Mr. McCain is trying to call his own. Representative John P. Murtha, a Democrat who represents the region, went so far last month as to call it a ''racist area,'' a remark the McCain campaign rejected.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We are in another airplane hangar, the crowd not so big as before. Mr. McCain has just started speaking and he is already shouting that it is time ''to fight to get out economy out of the ditch.'' That's our cue, time to go. He has got this aerobic speechifying down pat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Forgot to mention that at the last stop he brought up Tina Fey's impersonation of his running mate, Ms. Palin, on ''Saturday Night Live.'' Mr. McCain was on the show himself on Saturday and met Ms. Fey.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">''I really believe that Sarah Palin and Tina Fey were separated at birth, I really do,'' Mr. McCain told the last crowd. ''I really do.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">2:30 p.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama hustles up the stairs to his campaign plane, boarding a 53-minute flight for Charlotte, N.C. Since his rally ended more than two hours ago, Mr. Obama has conducted a series of radio interviews, including one with Ann Compton of ABC News.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here are highlights:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ms. Compton: Best moment of campaign?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama: The Iowa caucus night was wonderful.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ms. Compton: Was there a worst moment? Or what keeps you up at night?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama: The night we lost New Hampshire was tough. We had been 10 points up according to the polls going into Election Day and lost by two, and that's one of the reasons why we take nothing for granted in this race and we don't believe those polls.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">3:01 p.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Biden, ordinarily the most superstitious of politicians, can smell victory.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">''There's something in the air, guys,'' he tells a gaggle of reporters on his plane shortly before landing in Columbus, Ohio, for the first of two appearances in the state this afternoon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You can see the confidence in Mr. Biden's smile and his new accessibility to the reporters who have accompanied him for two months. He spoke to them for 20 minutes on his plane, the first time he has done so since early September. He said he had been avoiding his press pack since one news organization reported some comments he had thought were off the record.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">3:55 p.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Stop No. 4 for Mr. McCain, the Indianapolis airport. The tarmac is sunny and pleasant; beautiful golden late-afternoon light. But Mr. McCain's presence here on the eve of Election Day means he is still battling Mr. Obama's incursions into this longtime red state. Not great news for him, but polls show him tied.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Adding to the troubles, there is something wrong with the speaker system. Again? He repeats his dig about the microphone being ''brought to you courtesy of the Democratic National Committee.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He is hard to hear, and on top of that, he is beginning to sound like he has a large frog in his throat. Many of those traveling on Mr. McCain's campaign plane have a spectacular cold, and it sounds like the candidate has caught it himself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">''He's getting a little scratchy,'' Mr. Salter says. ''Only has to do it three more times today.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">4:15 p.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama steps off his plane in Charlotte without talking to reporters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">4:30 p.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama announces in a statement that his grandmother died about 12 hours earlier. He waited to make the public announcement, his aides said, to get through part of his campaign day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">5 p.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama tosses a tiny red and blue football into the air as he makes calls to North Carolina voters. On the fifth call, he turns his back to cameras as he talks about home health care, saying, ''My grandmother was able to stay in a home all the way until recently.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">5:48 p.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Stop No. 5 for the McCain campaign, Roswell, N.M. We are here in the supposed land of space aliens on a warm desert evening. Another airport rally, another rendition of the speech.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">''We need to win New Mexico tomorrow!'' Mr. McCain hollers. ''Get your neighbors to the polls. I need your vote!''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now here is something really different: Out of the blue, he shouts out, ''I am pleased to announce that I have received the alien endorsement!''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This gets a huge laugh. Two more stops to go.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">8:21 p.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Stop No. 6. We're at Henderson Pavilion, an outdoor amphitheater in Las Vegas, in a state leaning in Mr. Obama's direction. Mr. McCain is shouting again. ''What happens in Las Vegas stays in Las Vegas!'' he says. And then, ''What starts here is going to end with us winning this election tomorrow!''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The crowd roar is huge. Mr. McCain doesn't look too worse for the wear, considering that he left his hotel nearly 17 hours ago. Can't say the same for the press corps.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He mentions out of blue that his running mate, Ms. Palin, has ''never been to a Georgetown cocktail party, but she knows how to lead this nation!''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hard to believe this is still not over.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">10:25 p.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As Mr. Obama pulls up to his final rally of the campaign at the Prince William County Fairgrounds near Manassas, Va., a bus driver in the motorcade says, ''Oh, Lord, look at all those people.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A sea of people stretches on to hillsides in the distance, beyond where the eye can see.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As he walks onstage to Bruce Springsteen's ''The Rising,'' Mr. Obama sums up his surroundings: ''What a scene. What a crowd. Wow.''</span></p>
