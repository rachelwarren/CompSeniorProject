  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz has been The Washington Post's media reporter since 1990. He is also the host of CNN's &quot;Reliable Sources&quot; and the author of &quot;Reality Show: Inside the Last Great Television News War,&quot; &quot;Media Circus,&quot; &quot;Hot Air,&quot; &quot;Spin Cycle&quot; and &quot;The Fortune Tellers: Inside Wall Street's Game of Money, Media and Manipulation.&quot; Kurtz talks about the press and the stories of the day in &quot;Media Backtalk.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He was online Monday, Sept. 15 at noon ET to take your questions and comments.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The transcript follows. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Baltimore: Howard -- In today's Media Notes you laud as &quot;well-reported&quot; a New York Times story that demonstrates why so many of us regard the MSM as severely biased and untrustworthy. The Times states of a Palin appointee: &quot;A former real estate agent, Ms. Havemeister cited her childhood love of cows as a qualification for running the roughly $2 million agency.&quot; I'm sure the woman also cited numerous other, far more serious qualification for the job, yet the New York Times chose to cite only one, thereby making both Palin and Havemeister appear to be total fools. Character demolition jobs from would-be-cute columnists are expected, but such cheap shots in what should be straight news stories contribute heavily to the public's distrust of the mainstream media.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: I'm sorry, you may or may not like the Times -- and I've done my share of criticizing the paper, such as on that flimsy McCain/female lobbyist story -- but Sunday's piece WAS well reported. Lots of people were interviewed, including Palin supporters. Everyone was quoted on the record. The pattern of Palin hiring high school classmates and firing those whose loyalty she questions -- described in some other pieces -- was firmly established here. If the former real estate agent had any other qualifications to run the state agriculture division, I'm happy to revise and extend my remarks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pittsburgh: It's still over six weeks till the general election, and I'm already sick, sick, sick of the glut of campaign commercials, not to mention the sleaziness of a lot of them (even for the candidates I favor, let alone the ones I oppose). If TV stations weren't running so many politicial ads, wouldn't they still be filling their commercial time with just as much other (nonpolitical) advertising? Aren't they legally limited as to how much commercial time they can run in any given half-hour of programming, depending, for example, on whether it's in primetime? Are TV stations able to charge more per second for a campaign commercial than for ads for other products, or do political commercials get priority, preempting other ads?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: My condolences. There's actually a law involved here. Networks cannot turn down ads by candidates for federal office, and they can't charge more for them, either. At the same time, they're happy to ring the cash registers with ads for gubernatorial and mayoral candidates and other local politicians. And yes, the effect can be so repetitive that most voters try to tune out most of these ads.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Silver Spring, Md.: I question the notion that journalists are somehow driven by a storyline over which they have no control. I'm thinking of the comment by the West Coast reporter who said Sarah Palin's good looks &quot;seem to be the story.&quot; Palin's genetic advantages are the story only because individual editors and reporters decide to make it the story. I've seen this rationale over and over when journalists are challenged on their coverage of one topic or another. &quot;That's the story.&quot; I say this as a working journalist (copy editor). I never have understood it; it seems mindless to me, and I wonder if you can address this issue.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: They certainly have some control. There's no constitutional requirement that we spend two days on a silly lipstick controversy. Still, the campaigns have substantial ability to shape the coverage. If McCain or Obama mounts repeated assaults on his opponent and airs attack ads on the same subject, we have a responsibility to cover that -- and to report on whether they're sticking to the facts. At the same time, we cede too much in letting them control the agenda. In '88, the candidates didn't want to talk about the looming S&amp;L crisis, and the media mostly ignored it. This year neither candidate wants to talk about the exploding federal deficit, and we have devoted almost no ink and airtime to that issue.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ocala, Fla.: Why do you think there has been so little broadcast and cable coverage about the Charlie Rangel &quot;ethics&quot; flap?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: It's been overshadowed by the presidential campaign and the hurricanes. Rangel, while an important member of Congress who chairs House Ways and Means, isn't a towering national figure. But his failure to pay taxes on an investment property deserves more television coverage than it has gotten.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Silver Spring, Md.: Charles Krauthammer (who for some reason is still writing for an American newspaper) took issue with your characterization of Palin's &quot;Bush Doctrine&quot; moment. It seems that her deer-in-the-headlights, &quot;I knew I should have studied that chapter!&quot; reaction to the phrase was actually a sophisticated, nuanced protest regarding the evolving meaning of the term. Has this post-hoc excuse for her unfamiliarity with the defining tenet of Bush's presidency gained any currency with the political media? I know it didn't impress me.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Charlie Gibson's Gaffe (Post, Sept. 13)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: Everyone's entitled to his or her opinion. Since there are several aspects of the Bush doctrine, I didn't see Palin's failure to immediately answer as some horrible gaffe. What was more troubling was that after Gibson explained that he was asking about the doctrine of preemptive strike, she seemed less than commanding on that or other foreign policy subjects. It's certainly understandable that a governor and former small-town mayor hasn't had to deal with such questions. But her knowledge and judgment in this area are absolutely fair game in a vice-presidential campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Seattle: Why so many people distrust MSM can be summed here, on Palin lying about visiting Iraq: The American press writes that &quot;Obama camp suggests Palin has distorted record.&quot; The foreign press that &quot;McCain campaign admits Palin never visited Iraq.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: The Boston Globe, which broke the story, did not report it that way. The paper said that while Palin had claimed to have visited Iraq, its reporting showed that she had never gone beyond the border of Kuwait. Fact-based reporting, not spin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Reston, Va.: What are the odds that The Washington Post will dedicate some prime, front-page, above-the-fold free advertising for authors of books who are either not critical of the present administration, or who are critical of Barack Obama?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com:&quot; The War Within: A Secret White House History 2006-2008,&quot; &quot; Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: You might keep in mind that Bob Woodward's first book in this four-part Bush-at-war series was quite positive toward the president. And this book, while quite critical of Bush, does credit him for the success of the surge, even while saying that other factors have also been at play in the reduction of violence in Iraq.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Smithton, Ill.: Howie -- I have always considered you to be very fair to both sides (I'm an evangelical conservative Christian), but you're missing the boat on the Palin interview with Gibson/ABC News. Gibson and ABC news totally took out of context her statement about God's will and her statements about Russia (going to war). Martin Bashir dripped with condenscion that Palin was a Christian, like that is a horrible thing. Comments, I know, always are taken out of context but she was made to look like a rabid fundementalist Christian, which she is not, and the media are now picking up the &quot;Jesus was a community organizer, Pontius Pilate was a governor&quot; meme (&quot;Meet the Press&quot; with Tom Brokaw). This madness has to stop!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: I have to disagree. Gibson played the tape of what Palin said in church (yes, he didn't play the whole tape; it's television) and gave her a full chance to respond. When you say someone was dripping with condescension, that's a subjective judgment on your part. I will say that the media in general have taken an openly skeptical approach to reporting on Palin's religion and the practices at her former church in a way that has made me a bit uncomfortable.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Portland, Ore.: Howie, do political reporters have time to read the rest of the newspaper? Especially tne business section -- or even the front page? I ask because while The Post and others obviously are playing the latest problems on Wall Street prominently, this issue does not seem to be appearing in stories on the election. Example from the Sunday talk shows: Greenspan says on &quot;This Week&quot; that the Wall Street meltdown is the worst of his lifetime (and he's old!), yet in the prior segment Stephanopolous asks not one question about what is happening and what each candidate would do to stop the bleeding -- and one of the surrogates is Carly Fiorina, for crying out loud. Tell Balz and Co. to get off the &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; crap and report on something that may cost me much of my (and others') life savings!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: In fairness, The Post hasn't done much with the silly lipstick flap, and the candidates today are starting to talk about the latest Wall Street meltdown. I do think we have to keep the focus on their approach to financial regulation, both in the past and what they're proposing now, even if by tomorrow they move on to other subjects.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">San Diego: Howard -- I was watching your CNN segment this morning (Sunday 9/14) re: the opinions of TV anchors/pundits, and it struck me ... who cares what they think? I don't. I used to work in Washington, for the Clintons. I understand the process, but really, as a regular American now, I'm bored and annoyed by pundits. I'm interested in how average Americans (across the country) respond to the press. Could you bring on a focus group or a few nonpundits to discuss their reactions to the news, punits etc? That would be fascinating! Thanks!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: You're free to tune in or out as you see fit. But I don't think anyone can deny that media coverage, and the punditry as well, has a significant impact on campaigns and how they're perceived by voters. Unlike almost every other show on the planet, I don't have guests on to spout off on how the campaign is going. We cover the coverage. Our focus yesterday, for instance, was on Gibson's questions, not Palin's answers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Journalism School?: Sarah Palin claims to have been a journalism major in college (complete with five transfers in six years, a record which in itself, absent compelling reasons, would raise all sorts of red flags in most human resources departments). My question is, how rare is it for a journalism major who hopes ever to be employed in the field never to have worked on a school newspaper, TV or radio station? This just seems so bizarre to me.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Are there people who were at the colleges Palin claims to have attended (faculty, former classmates) who can even vouch for her having been there? How much can reporters investigate this without violating Palin's legal right to privacy, e.g. whether she actually earned a degree, whether she was ever on academic probation, etc.?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz:&quot;Claims to have attended&quot;? I haven't seen any hint that Sarah Palin didn't attend the colleges she says she did. And I don't think it's odd that someone would major in journalism without moonlighting at some campus publication or station. Palin did work as a sports reporter and anchor after college -- I'm sure you've seen the video of her with the huge '80s hair.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">San Diego: For shame, Howie. Apparently you, as a member of the evil cabal of media elite, are to blame for the McCain campaign's recent (and reluctant, I'm sure) embrace of negativity. If you had just paid more attention to him before, he wouldn't have been forced to accuse Obama of being one-step removed from pedophilia. He also wouldn't have to keep saying that Palin said &quot;no thanks&quot; to the Bridge to Nowhere and never has taken an earmark in her entire political life. So, what do you have to say for yourself, mister?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: No one gets into journalism to be popular.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: You've parroted every anti-MSNBC line of attack out there, but you ignored Joe Scarborough admitting on-air that the mainstream media always will be talking about what the McCain campaign wants the media to be talking about.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: But that is Joe Scarborough's opinion, and the opinion of a former Republican congressman may or may not be more valid than the opinions of Olbermann, Matthews, Maddow etc. As for &quot;parroting&quot; attacks on MSNBC, I was out there largely by myself for months in saying it was questionable for the very opinionated Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews to assume the role of anchors on primary nights and at the conventions. MSNBC President Phil Griffin kept assuring me it was no problem because they wear &quot;different hats&quot; at live events. Now he's changed their mind and removed them from anchoring live political events. So who was right?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: You recently claimed at washgintonpost.com that reporters and pundits are furious at the McCain campaign: &quot;Whether it's the latest back-and-forth over attack ads, the silly lipstick flap or the continuing debate over Sarah and sexism, you can just feel the tension level rising several notches.&quot; But isn't it true that the press chose to cover the lipstick charade? But now, according to you, it's as if the press had to pretend the hoax represented news. I'm all for journalists feeling like the McCain camp has insulted their intelligence in recent weeks, because I think it's true, but spare me the notion that the press hasn't allowed itself to be played and insulted.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: Yes, the media chose to cover the lipstick flap, even while many journalists made clear that Obama wasn't calling Sarah Palin a pig and that the whole thing was trumped-up on the part of the McCain campaign. I think we wasted everyone's time during the two days when this dominated cable news and even led the network newscasts--and said as much on my show yesterday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Annapolis, Md.: Was it my imagination, or did you and your guests on CNN gulp after you said some thought of Sarah Palin as a &quot;boob&quot;? Was that your lipstick moment?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: Apparently you weren't watching the show I was on. I didn't use that word. People may have gulped about something else, but it escaped my notice.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ashland, Mo.: When one compares the Gibson questions to Palin and Obama, the tone and substance seem very different. One explanation would be that it is assumed that people are familiar with Obama's positions but not Palin's. However, this is probably false for those independents who will decide the elections. Shouldn't interviewers assume little to no knowledge by the viewer and interview accordingly?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: Well, it's certainly different interviewing a national candidate that few in the Lower 48 had heard of two weeks ago and a man who's been campaigning for president for a year and a half. But remember when Gibson was co-moderator of an Obama/Hillary debate, and was widely criticized (including by me) for spending the first 45 minutes asking about Obama's lack of flag pin, Jeremiah Wright and other controversies? My point is that he's demonstrated over the years that he can be tough on both sides.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cheyenne, Wyo.: Mr. Kurtz: As The Post's media critic, do you ever monitor the religious press? I ask because the secular media has portrayed the Palin phenomenon as something that arose almost spontaneously in the past two weeks. In fact, Palin has been extensively profiled and lauded in many religous publications, especially since the birth of her child with Downs Syndrome. She had a ready-made audience of evangelical and other pro-life women to whom she already was a hero. That is one reason the crowds are so large. Just one more part of America that the secular media don't seem to know exists sometimes. Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: I do. And I know Governor Palin has been something of a heroine in some Christian communities and the anti-abortion community, especially after the birth of Trig. And I would be the first to say that the mainstream media are wary of, and don't know enough about, fundamentalist Christianity.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Boston: Why is it bad for the primaries and conventions to be anchored by partisans? I mean, especially with primaries, the only objective thing of note is the result. If you need to fill more then 15 seconds of TV time, why not go partisan?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: It is fine for partisan pundits to be ON the broadcasts, offering their views (and even better when they're balanced by partisans of the opposite persuasion). But the anchor role is very different. The anchor is the quarterback, the person who frames the debate. And if that person is a liberal (or conservative) commentator, it skews the coverage in unmistakable ways, as we saw at the conventions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Howard, do you consider &quot;The View&quot; interview of John McCain (two comedians, the wife of a pro quarterback, and a reporter who was famous for asking &quot;what kind of tree would you be&quot;) some of the best journalism/interviews this political season? Could, say, some of the folks at CNN learn something from this (McCain thinks Roe v. Wade should be overturned, he thinks his false ads against Obama are true, Palin opposed earmarks as a governor, and Palin would reform some vague Washington). I mean, they actually asked follow-up questions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: The View is a curious mix, a gossipy chat show that also deals with real issues. And good for Joy Behar and company for trying to pin down McCain. But keep in mind that most of the panelists are liberals.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: &quot;Claims to have attended&quot;: One thing that's struck me about how the media operates, especially the pundits, is that a person is allowed to get on TV and claim X, and then say &quot;disprove me if you don't believe me.&quot; Perhaps that's a reason for the contempt, because the rest of the world operates on a different principle.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: I think we should be skeptical. Trust but verify and all that. But I don't think we should become so steeped in cynicism that we assume every syllable out of a politician's mouth is a lie.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: I've noted Alan Greenspan (who should be hanging his head in shame, after doing nothing to forestall the current financial crisis) is once again all over the airwaves and it struck me: Why does the media continue to tart-up those who were wrong for so long about specific topics (the economy, the war in Iraq, etc.)? Seems to me they'd be better served talking to people who were warning against the tactics approved by Greenspan (and in the case of Iraq, those who were skeptical from the beginning), wouldn't they? Why is the media so backward in this regard?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: Alan Greenspan clearly made mistakes during his two-decade tenure, but he also accomplished some things. He hasn't been the Fed chairman for two years. So I don't think he can be heavily blamed for the current mortgage/Wall Street meltdown, or that he should be banned from the airwaves. The White House and Congress bear a great deal of responsibility as well. Who failed to rein in the obviously risky practices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? Who allowed banks to circumvent federal regulation by creating exotic financial instruments relating to mortgages? Your elected leaders.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Plainsboro, N.J.: Mr. Kurtz: Over the weekend I read a AP story about their recent poll, in which the writer makes the point that Obama's share of the white vote is comparable to what John Kerry polled among the same group. That piece of news surprised me greatly. Most stories I read seem to suggest that most whites are deserting deserting Obama because of latent racial attitudes. But if what the AP article says is true, then there is no racist storyline here. Shouldn't the press explicitly be debunking this racist storyline?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: I don't think the press has been pushing a racist storyline. The news lately is a substantial shift among white women, particularly older white women, from Obama to McCain. The media interpretation is that much of this is due to the Palin pick. However it stacks up against historical benchmarks, it's got to be worrisome to the Obama campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Columbia, Md.: Howard: Big dust-up brewing in the newsphoto world after prominent photog Jill Greenberg ambushed McCain on an Atlantic mag cover shoot. You can find all the images on her site. Thought you would find this interesting on several levels. Regards,from a 20-year Baltimore Sun veteran.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: She did more than ambush McCain. She intentionally shot pictures to make him look horrible, and she admits to it. Fortunately, the Atlantic didn't use those shots. I've got the link in today's online column.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Evangelist Media: With all due respect to Wyoming, the fact that puff pieces appear in religious publications because they admire a politician's anti-abortion stance does nothing whatsoever to educate the rest of us as to that candidate's qualifications for national office. That's what we got real newspapers for. I would say the same about George W. Bush's revealing interviews in the fishing and hunting magazines.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: I think Wyoming was simply making the point that Sarah Palin was well-known in communities that agree with her views on abortion long before most of us knew who she was.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Down South: My sister-in-law has a graduate degree in journalism; her undergrad is from an Ivy League school. She did not work on any paper while in college or graduate school. Doesn't mean a thing. She has done some reporting after grad school, here and there.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Kurtz: On the other hand, I was the editor of my student newspaper, and I don't argue that it makes me qualified to be vice president. Did help me get my first job, though.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thanks for the chat, folks.</span></p>
