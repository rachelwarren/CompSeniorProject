  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With their final debate behind them, Senator Barack Obama admonished his supporters on Thursday to avoid overconfidence and Senator John McCain warned that his Democratic opponent would raise taxes on small-business owners, as the two candidates opened the final chapter of a 19-day sprint to the election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''For those of you who are feeling giddy or cocky or think this is all set, I just have two words for you: New Hampshire,'' Mr. Obama told top contributors during a fund-raising breakfast in Manhattan, alluding to his recent gains in opinion polls. ''I've been in these positions before, when we were favored and the press starts getting carried away and we end up getting spanked.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> With that lesson in mind, Mr. Obama arrived at a rainy afternoon campaign stop here in New Hampshire, a state whose primary he lost nine months ago to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. The outcome set off the longest nomination fight in the party's history.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain rallied supporters in Downingtown, Pa., reprising the character of ''Joe the Plumber'' as an example of business owners who he said would be affected by Mr. Obama's tax plan. But even as he was cheered at the rally, questions and scrutiny of the employment and tax records arose for Joe Wurzelbacher of Holland, Ohio, who had met Mr. Obama at a campaign stop on Sunday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''The real winner last night was Joe the Plumber,'' Mr. McCain said, adding: ''He won and small businesses won across America, they won, because the American people are not going to let Senator Obama raise their taxes in a tough economy.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain then recounted his version of the encounter Mr. Obama had with the man who is suddenly the most famous plumber in America. He is a worker who would apparently get a tax cut under Mr. Obama's plan, but who also expressed concerns that his taxes would increase if he ever makes enough money to buy his own business and net more than $250,000 a year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''You know what Senator Obama had to say to Joe?'' Mr. McCain asked. ''That he wanted to spread his wealth around, he wanted to spread his wealth. What does that mean? He wants government to take Joe's money and give it to somebody else. His hard-earned dollars! We're not going to stand for that. America didn't become the greatest nation on earth by spreading the wealth; we became the greatest nation by creating new wealth.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Here in New Hampshire, Mr. Obama dismissed the criticism from Mr. McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''He's trying to suggest that a plumber is the guy he's fighting for,'' Mr. Obama said. ''How many plumbers do you know who's making a quarter of million dollars a year? I have a different set of priorities.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Trying to keep his supporters motivated, he added: ''Now, in the closing weeks, John McCain thinks he can make this campaign all about me -- but the truth is, this campaign is about you.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain were both headed back to New York on Thursday afternoon for the annual Alfred E. Smith charity dinner at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. In the waning days of the presidential campaign, it will be the second consecutive night -- and likely the last -- that the two rivals will spend time in the same place.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Both campaigns released new commercials on Thursday, which were made overnight after the debate at Hofstra University on Long Island. Mr. Obama's message sought to tie Mr. McCain to President Bush, charging that his rival would ''keep spending $10 billion a month in Iraq while our own economy struggles -- same as Bush.'' For his part Mr. McCain in his ad distanced himself from the administration, saying ''We need a new direction, and I have a plan.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Even as Mr. Obama warned his supporters against overconfidence, he told them he would need their help, not only in the final days of the campaign but also in his administration should he win the election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Once we're done, there is extraordinary expertise in this room, and we're going to need good advice,'' Mr. Obama told about 120 business executives and other contributors sitting in a gilded room in the Metropolitan Club on Fifth Avenue. ''And who knows, there might be even some of you who decide that you want to spend a little time in government. We're going to need people who can roll up their sleeves and make sure that Washington and Wall Street and the country as a whole are working.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In a brief morning speech to contributors, Mr. Obama said the end of the campaign was in sight, but the most the pressing challenges still lay ahead. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''One of the things that I think we have to remember is that we are now 19 days, not from the end, but from the beginning,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The amount of work that will be involved for the next president is going to be extraordinary.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> While in New York, Mr. McCain was preparing to appear on ''The Late Show'' with David Letterman on Thursday evening, Mr. Obama is set to attend an evening fund-raiser headlined by Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel.</span></p>
