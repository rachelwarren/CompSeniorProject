  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Is the definition of companies that are ''too big to fail'' getting broader? Or are some industries simply more important than others?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The seizure of the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is the second time this year, after the rescue of Bear Stearns, that Washington has intervened to prevent a financial collapse. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Now, troubled automakers in the United States are also looking for help, in the form of loans to finance the development of new energy-efficient cars. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Until now, the bailout efforts have largely been reactive, with Washington throwing lifelines over the last decade to businesses in the airline and insurance industries in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and, more recently, those on Wall Street. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Now, many in the financial industry say a more formal debate is needed to set criteria to guide decisions on future requests for help from individual companies or industries. For example, should a large airline be allowed to fail while an automaker is bailed out? Or might one investment bank be judged as less critical to Wall Street's overall solvency than another?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''This presents a very important policy question that people are going to be grappling with for a long time,'' said Robert E. Rubin, who was Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and is now a senior adviser at Citigroup. ''Bear was not too big to fail; it was too interconnected. Fannie and Freddie are both.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Hard choices have been made in the past -- the once-powerful American steel industry was allowed to shrink to a shadow of its former self.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When Washington did ride to the rescue, the overall risk to the economy was considered greater than the downside of providing help -- what economists call ''moral hazard,'' referring to the risk that helping a faltering company will only encourage others to take even greater risks on the assumption that the government will always be there to provide a backstop.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Rubin said that the moral hazard problem was ''extremely important.'' But with Fannie's and Freddie's shareholders practically wiped out, ''the principle has been upheld,'' he added.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Shares of both companies closed below $1 on Monday, down from more than $60 a year ago. Bear Stearns shareholders fared slightly better, ultimately receiving $10 a share, but that was still a fraction of what the shares commanded before the rescue effort in March.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are unusual because of their longstanding relationship with the federal government, but even supporters of the rescue plan say the move raises bigger questions. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Do we live in a market economy or not?'' said Jonathan Koppell, director of the Millstein Center for Corporate Governance and Performance at Yale. ''If we do, it seems companies have to be allowed to fail. If we say companies can't fail because they're too big or the consequences are too great, we have something else.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Foreign policy considerations are also driving the deal to help Fannie and Freddie. A substantial portion of their debt is held by central banks in Asia as well as by private financial institutions in Europe. A default, Mr. Koppell said, ''would make foreign governments scream that they thought they were doing business with the U.S.A. and would undermine their faith in America as a borrower.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The most notable corporate rescues of recent years have involved financial firms, and that is no coincidence, said Sanford Jacoby, a professor of management at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''The financial sector is special, because so much in the financial markets is based on confidence,'' he said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In addition, he said, financial firms now represent an outsize portion of corporate profits and a more powerful force in the economy than they did in the 1970s, when industrial companies were seen as symbols of American might, and Lockheed and Chrysler received government help.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Chrysler's case, Congress extended a package of $1.5 billion in loan guarantees for the troubled carmaker, which had a work force of more than 100,000.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> More recently, after the Sept. 11 attacks, Congress approved $15 billion in direct aid and loan guarantees to the nation's faltering airline industry.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Richard C. Breeden, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and a key architect of the savings and loan bailout under President George H. W. Bush, said the criteria for a bailout should be whether ''the failure of a particular company will cause a ripple effect and otherwise healthy institutions will be forced into insolvency, affecting the overall economy.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> During his tenure at the S.E.C., he noted, the government did not step in to prevent the collapse of Drexel Burnham after a scandal involving insider trading and abuses in the junk bond market. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> This time around, Mr. Breeden said, shoring up Fannie and Freddie ''wasn't even a close call.'' Failing to do so, he added, ''would have caused a wave of problems to institutions around the world, and that's a wave big enough to drown a lot of people.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> On the other hand, helping American automakers might have strong political support but does not meet this economic test, Mr. Breeden said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''If you're trying to win the electoral votes of Michigan, you can promise who knows what, but in terms of risks to the entire economy, it's not as immediate a threat,'' he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In recent months, the automakers' finances have been deteriorating, and Senators John McCain and Barack Obama have voiced support for providing billions in loans to automakers in Detroit.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> On Monday, the chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, Alan R. Mulally, said he expected broad support in Congress for a loan program to help automakers accelerate their development of more fuel-efficient vehicles.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In his first public comments on the issue, Mr. Mulally defended a proposed $25 billion loan package as a critical piece of a larger mandate to improve fuel-economy standards.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The loan program is drawing additional scrutiny because of the federal government's decision to take over the finances of Fannie and Freddie, but Mr. Mulally said his industry was seeking a very different kind of assistance.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He said the bailouts of Freddie and Fannie had little in common with the incentive program for manufacturing advanced-technology vehicles written into the fuel-economy bill. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I absolutely don't think it's a bailout,'' Mr. Mulally said Monday. ''It's going to be a loan at lower interest rates with a caveat to pay it back.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The loans are tied to an energy bill signed last year to raise corporate average fuel economy standards for cars and trucks by 40 percent by 2020. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Ford, as well as General Motors and Chrysler, is hoping that funding for the program can be completed before Congress finishes its abbreviated legislative session this month. The Detroit automakers are still discussing whether their chief executives will appear together in Washington to push for the money.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> G.M.'s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, is expected to address the need for the loan program during an appearance at a Senate Energy Committee panel discussion on Friday.</span></p>
