  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE AD</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Narrator: Barack Obama. Born of the corrupt Chicago political machine.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama: In terms of my toughness, look, first of all, I come from Chicago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Narrator: His economic adviser, William Daley. Lobbyist. Mayor's brother. His money man, Tony Rezko. Client. Patron. Convicted felon. His &quot;political godfather,&quot; Emil Jones. Under ethical cloud. His governor, Rod Blagojevich. A legacy of federal and state investigations. With friends like that, Obama is not ready to lead.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ANALYSIS </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This John McCain&nbsp;ad is mostly accurate and largely pointless.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The one serious distortion is in claiming that Barack Obama was &quot;born&quot; of the Chicago machine. Obama was actually an independent outsider who challenged the party establishment, both in running for the Illinois Senate and in unsuccessfully opposing U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush. Obama did use hardball tactics on occasion but was not embraced by the party apparatus until later in his career.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Three of the four names included here do no damage to the senator from Illinois and serve mainly to reinforce the impression that Obama swims with sharks. Bill Daley may be a lobbyist and the brother of Mayor Richard Daley, but he is a former commerce secretary with a solid reputation. State Sen. Emil Jones gave Obama a boost early in his career, in part by assigning him to shepherd ethics legislation through the legislature. Obama has no connection to allegations that Jones has helped some of his own family members on the state payroll. And while Blagojevich is Obama's governor -- indeed, he is the governor of Oprah Winfrey and Mike Ditka and every other Illinois resident -- he and Obama are not close politically.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rezko is the exception, a major albatross for Obama. He was a key fundraiser for Obama and sold him a patch of land adjacent to Obama's home -- a deal that the Democratic nominee has called a &quot;boneheaded mistake.&quot; But the Chicago businessman, who was convicted of corruption charges in June, was not under investigation at the time of these dealings.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While the ad is a stretch, McCain is trying to tie Obama to the specter of ethically challenged big-city machine politics, undoubtedly hoping the word &quot;Chicago&quot; will turn off suburban and rural voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">THE AD</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We've seen what Bush-McCain policies have done to our economy. Now John McCain wants to do the same to our health care. McCain just published an article praising Wall Street deregulation. Said he'd reduce oversight of the health insurance industry, too. Just &quot;as we have done over the last decade in banking.&quot; Increasing costs and threatening coverage. A prescription for disaster. John McCain. A risk we just can't afford to take.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ANALYSIS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This Barack Obama&nbsp;commercial is based on John McCain's own words, although those words are subject to interpretation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">An article in the obscure journal Contingencies, published under McCain's name, says: &quot;Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous, nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.&quot; The senator from Arizona certainly sounds like the strong advocate of deregulation he has always been. The timing makes McCain sound as if he is defending the loosening of federal rules on banks, now widely blamed for the current market turmoil.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The McCain camp contends that the Republican nominee was referring only to the regulatory change that allowed banks to operate across state lines. But because the article does not specify what he has in mind, McCain leaves himself vulnerable to the charge that he endorsed the full sweep of banking deregulation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There is no evidence that McCain is &quot;threatening coverage&quot; for health care, and the &quot;prescription for disaster&quot; verdict is credited to the Boston Globe -- leaving out that the quote is from the paper's liberal editorial page.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For the spot to cite the &quot;Bush-McCain policies&quot; ignores the fact that McCain has broken with the president on certain issues, including how to ease the banking crisis. The commercial tries to paint McCain as partially responsible for the Wall Street meltdown, although congressional Democrats did little to change the policies in question.</span></p>
