  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">JACKSON, Mich.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> IN this factory town in south-central Michigan, hard hit by the decline of the auto industry and home to a population whose health grimly lags well below national averages, several dozen small-business owners have joined forces in a wellness campaign that rivals those of the country's giant corporations. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> With fewer employees to rely on, small businesses are particularly vulnerable when workers take sick days or function poorly on the job. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''If they're not healthy and alert, they can't do things like designing projects,'' said Mike Shirkey, owner of Orbitform Group, a machine tools company with 55 employees in Jackson. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> An engineering graduate of the University of Michigan, Mr. Shirkey compares the wellness program with the ''measure and improve'' approach that he applies to manufacturing. Two years ago, Mr. Shirkey helped persuade other business owners in Jackson to join a CEO Roundtable, a forum and self-help group for top executives that is trying to address employees' health as a crucial part of corporate strategy, rather than as simply a cost-management problem. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Kirk Mercer, president of R. W. Mercer, a Jackson-based contractor that builds small factories, doctors' offices and other commercial buildings in the Midwest, said he was so taken with this approach that he was urging his small subcontractors, each with a handful of employees, to join the wellness roundtable.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> There, businesspeople share ideas and encourage one another, but each business makes its own health-care decisions and pays for whatever coverage it provides; there is no pooling of employees for insurance purposes or to achieve other economies of scale, and no government contribution to the program. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> If the strategy works, the result will probably be healthier workers and lower medical costs, and that will be striking, when many small businesses are unable to provide any health coverage at all -- and one in seven Americans is uninsured. At least half of them work for small companies or are self-employed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Promoting wellness is especially urgent in Jackson, whose residents have more health problems than people living elsewhere, according to a recent survey paid for by the Allegiance Health system, which operates the local hospital; the county health department; and other local agencies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Jackson County, 70 percent of adults are overweight or obese, compared with 63 percent nationally, and 14 percent have diabetes, well above the 9 percent national rate. More than 1 in 4 is a smoker, compared with 1 in 10 nationally. Many people in the county do not realize they are taking serious chances with their health, the survey found; they do not have insurance and cannot afford health services. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Jackson's economic health is shaky as well. As the city's population has declined slowly to about 34,000, median household income has fallen to $31,000, a third less than Michigan as a whole, and the countywide (metropolitan area) unemployment rate has climbed to 9.7 percent, compared with 9.1 percent statewide in July.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Historically, Jackson has several claims to fame. It calls itself the birthplace of the Republican Party, noting that on July 6, 1854, the party formally organized itself and held its first convention here, according to the city's Web site; among those in attendance was Abraham Lincoln. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Jackson was a major rail hub and the onetime headquarters of Buick Motors, and it remains home to a state prison, now more than a century old, that looms over the city like a medieval fortress and was for decades the largest prison in the country. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> If Jackson's wellness initiative succeeds, the small city may once again be at the forefront of a national trend.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Several states, including Maryland, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, have recently required insurance companies to offer wellness benefits to employees of small businesses, and a foundation-financed business group in Colorado, with encouragement from Lt. Gov. Barbara O'Brien, is also planning a wellness program for small- and medium-size employers. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As part of the broad national debate about health care, Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic candidate for president, has proposed a tax credit for small businesses to help them pay health insurance premiums for their employees. His Republican rival, Senator John McCain, has called for every family to receive a tax credit of up to $5,000 to help pay for insurance, while making employees' health benefits taxable as income. Mr. McCain has recommended incentives to reduce costs, including disease management and health and wellness programs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> No matter what kinds of changes are made in the health system, many policy experts are counting on wellness and disease-management programs to slow the relentless rise of medical costs. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Jackson, the two largest employers are Consumers Energy, the local power company; and Allegiance Health, the local hospital, and the latter has been especially involved in the initiative. ''We hope we can develop ways for the providers and payers to work together,'' said Georgia Fojtasek, a nurse with a doctorate in education who is the chief executive of Allegiance Health. Allegiance administers the wellness program and spends $2 million annually to support community health projects.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Among the small-business participants in the wellness program is Bob Lefere, president of the Pioneer Foundry, which is paying for a nicotine patch to help a 30-year-old mold maker quit smoking. He was the last smoker on the foundry's 15-person staff.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The link between smoking and dangerous lung and heart problems is widely recognized, and some large companies require workers who smoke to pay higher premiums unless they at least try to quit. Pioneer Foundry, a union shop for 50 years, already provides for annual physicals and 12 months of infant care under its contract with the Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics and Allied Workers International Union. Mr. Lefere said that when contract talks open next year, he might propose adding a health club membership for workers. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Orbitform has already installed a fitness center, with exercise machines and showers that workers can use at lunchtime and before and after work.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At Great Lakes Industry, which makes power-transmission equipment and auto parts, Larry Schultz, the president, marshaled some fellow exercise enthusiasts to clean up a storage area and transform it into a small fitness center. Mr. Schultz also got rid of the candy machines and offers free fruit and vegetable snacks. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Running on one of its treadmills helped Gary Lykins, a shipping and customer service manager at Great Lakes Industry, shed 45 pounds he had gained after he left the factory floor for a more sedentary job. ''I run 100 miles a month on that thing,'' Mr. Lykins said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Great Lakes Industry and Orbitform also pay for health coaches, provided by Allegiance Health, who meet several times a year with employees and their spouses to guide them toward goals like losing weight, eating healthy food and lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''There are a lot of things you just don't think about until somebody sits down with you and explains,'' said Robert Dean, 36, a machinist who works the night shift at Great Lakes Industry. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> His wife Sarah, 28, said she had not smoked for almost two years after they met with a coach for the first time. ''We both smoked before that, and we tried to quit a lot of times,'' she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mrs. Dean, who operates a day care center for 11 toddlers, said she put on weight after she and Robert were married. ''I didn't have to fit into my dress anymore,'' she said. ''It was kind of a mental thing.'' Now, with daily exercising and dutifully eating fruits and vegetables, she has slimmed down. ''I fit into a size 8,'' she said. ''I haven't fit into an 8 since sixth grade.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Great Lakes Industry, which is self-insured, offers single employees a $681-a-year reduction in their health insurance premiums if they participate in the wellness program. Married employees get the same reduction and an additional $681 discount for their spouses, who are required to join. The deductible is also waived, and co-payments for medical services are halved to 10 percent for participating workers. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The health coaches help establish goals for the workers, who are expected to ''make an honest effort'' to reach them, Mr. Schultz said. The coaches give special attention to people with chronic conditions like diabetes, asthma and heart disease.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Last year, Great Lakes Industry added fully paid health ''prevention benefits,'' including immunization shots and physical exams. Participants must select a primary-care doctor and follow her recommendations.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> With 95 percent of its 65 or so employees participating in the program, health costs for Great Lakes Industry employees average $7,363 each last year, including $200 for the coach. That was down from $9,158 in 2006. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But ''return on investment is difficult to measure,'' Mr. Schultz said, because a small company's health costs were likely to be erratic from year to year, with variables like births, accidents and illnesses. He is estimating an average cost of $8,095 for 2008.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I believe we have at least flattened or dampened the trend line,'' he said, referring to annual cost increases. His employees have been paying 14 to 20 percent of total costs, and he does not want to shift more of the costs to them. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''These are factory folks,'' Mr. Schultz said. ''Health care is an important benefit. I don't believe the solution to the cost problem is to shift more to families. If they are actively participating in improving their health, we as an employer can afford to provide them with a rich benefit plan.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> His daughter, Dr. Amy M. Schultz, began learning about health insurance when she helped out at Great Lakes Industry as a teenager; now she is director of prevention and community health at the local hospital, and she works with Prof. Dee Edington, director of the University of Michigan Health Management Research Center, which advises the Jackson programs. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Participants fill out questionnaires about their medical history and health-related behavior, and the health risk appraisals and analyses for the employers are conducted through the U.M. Health Management Research Center, Dr. Schultz said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Phil Sponsler, the president of Orbitform, said he was ''a big proponent'' of the program. He is 6-foot-3 and weighed 248 pounds when he learned that his blood pressure was high, he said. Now he gets up early and works out with a friend (who happens to be his cardiologist). When he gets to work at 6:30 a.m., he eats his own concoction of cereal, nuts, olive oil, flax seed and cinnamon for breakfast. He said he now weighs 231 and his blood pressure is managed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Ms. Fojtasek of Allegiance Health said businesspeople on the hospital's board, like Mr. Shirkey and Mr. Schultz, had encouraged the hospital to push for health improvements in Jackson.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Healthy employees are good for business in more ways than one, Mr. Schultz said, adding, ''We treat our customers and each other better when we are feeling good.'' </span></p>
