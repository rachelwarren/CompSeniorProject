  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Washington Post associate editor Robert G. Kaiser was online Tuesday, Nov. 4 at 7 p.m. ET to break down the general election returns as they're announced and examine what they mean for the parties, the executive branch, Congress and the nation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He was joined at points during the evening by Mark Blumenthal, editor of Pollster.com; Ryan Thornburg of the Project on Public Life at the University of North Carolina; Washington Post reporter Kevin Merida; and Robert Struckman, editor of New West. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Special Note: Because of the anticipated length of the discussion, responses will be posted in reverse order, with the most recent answers at the top.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chicago: I just returned home from the Grant Park celebration outside the fence. What a happy occasion, where the goodwill, relief and peacefulness was palpable. The crowds were somber and subdued and perhaps introspective, but incredibly happy. A few passing cars with horns blaring, but few whoops. On the walk over I joined a diverse group of young adults just coming off the L that hadn't heard Obama had been declared the winner. Their faces lit up as if a breeze came over embers, and for a moment there was pure, quiet joy. Walking home I noticed a black woman security guard at a college building leaning out the door to be a part of this moment, and the same reaction from a parking lot attendant across the street. The sense of peace and hopefulness was pervasive.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Folks, we're done for the night but I wanted to post this nice from-the-scene report before we wrapped up. Join us tomorrow for a special discussion hosted by Post reporter Dana Priest that will bring in six guests to examine various aspects of how the Barack Obama administration will be built and may govern. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">San Antonio, Texas: Now that it's finished, will he rule from the left or the center?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kevin Merida: Obama will probably try to capitalize on the working majorities he has in Congress, though there are such pressing national issues that spin from the economic calamity, that his domestic agenda will likely need some reworking. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bethesda, Md.: Wonder why McCain decided to be the man he always was tonight. Had he run the true-but-gracious warrior style, he might have won -- or at least had a closer race that would have made it hard to say that Obama had a mandate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kevin Merida: There will be a lot of postmortems about how mccain ran his campaign. was he too nice or too mean? did he stray from the independence he had carved out for himself in the republican firmament and decide to placate his right flank? or did he not run hard enough and persistently enough at obama's weaknesses? there will be a lot of questions, but those are for another day. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: How remarkable is it for a newbie senator, ranking just about at the bottom of the pack, to become the new president? It feels like one heck of a promotion. Is there much precedent for that? I'm wondering how it compares to JFK, for example.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kevin Merida: JFK also was very young, and considered untested. but he had many of the qualities that seem to have attracted people to obama. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Los Angeles: Good evening from California. I'm 36, almost 37 years old, and I never have been as proud of America as I am right now. After the most recent two elections I didn't think we had it in us as a nation to do what we are doing tonight. Tonight we show the world again that America is full of suprises and that we can again be a moral, spiritual beacon for the rest of the world. Thank you.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks for this.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Posted 0:17 a.m., 11.5.2008 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: Mr. Kaiser, I'm really appreciative for your chats at key moments in the nation's history, and I'm here tonight again. I'm already starting to hear some pundits demand &quot;bipartisanship&quot; from Obama -- and, of course conservatives (for whom it's suddenly very convenient, after eight years of caring nothing for it) are calling for the same. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My question is simple: With Republicans having left the economy in tatters, involved us in an unnecessary war, run Congress in a brutally single-party fashion and turned government into a cash-cow for their supporters, why on earth would Obama want to involve them? Isn't that like rehiring Brownie to run FEMA? Thanks for your comment!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks for this. Being a hopeless romantic myself, I'm going to disagree with you. I've written a book, coming out in January, about how our politics descended into the toilet over the last 30 years. One of the important reasons was partisan warfare. If we can't break out of the cycle of zero-sum, all-out war between the parties, we won't be able to deal with the huge problems before us. Will we? I have no idea. Is it worth a try? I think it is. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Posted 0:17 a.m., 11.5.2008 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Helena, Mont.: Do you think that now the Republicans finally may see that the American people don't want more culture war -- the constant fight against gays, the abortion debate, the theocrats trying to impose their god on us -- and just want competent government? And when will McCain do a mea culpa on all the sleaze of this campaign and redeem himself with the media?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Don't know. Thanks for posting. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">To Washington from an African-American woman: If black people voted only for black people, Alan Keyes would have tied Obama in 2004, and tonight might have looked a lot different. Or Alan Keyes would have been elected senator in Maryland in 1988 or 1992. To go with your supposition, Keyes should have split the vote with Obama tonight -- he ran under the Constitutional party. None of that happened, because blacks, whites, Latinos, Asians, young, old, rich, poor -- more than 45 million people voted for him. It's policy and ideals and beliefs and hope that got Obama elected, not skin color. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks for this. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yonkers, N.Y.: To get back to grimy politics, the Democrats wanted to break into the Western region, and they seem to have done so. The GOP stands accused of being a Southern regional party.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Don't forget the upper plains states. But you're right, it's a smaller Red America for sure. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Posted 11:43 p.m., 11.4.2008 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: When will the African American community allow itself to be held accountable for its own bigotry? Tomorrow, I hope we ask African Americans who voted for Obama why they voted for him. Because he is a socialist? Because he is pro-abortion? Or was it primarily because he is black? Sadly, Obama's race is likely to be the primary reason that most African Americans chose Obama. That is bigotry.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: If I may say so, and I guess I can, this is a really small and nasty comment. I thought about ignoring it, but decided to let everyone see it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The exit polls show that more than 40 percent of white voters cast their ballots today for Obama. Why did they vote for Obama? Might they have thought him the best man for the job? Might black and brown voters had the same opinion? </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Oak Hill, Va.: Great concession speech by McCain. Had that been his message all along, I would have voted for him. I wonder why he went Rovian instead of staying on board the Straight Talk Express...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Posted 11:38 p.m., 11.4.2008 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fairfax, Va.: My memory of Gore's and Kerry's concession speeches is a bit fuzzy, but is it common to hear boos from the crowd whenever the winner's name is mentioned? I found it to be an odd reaction to the name of the next president-elect of the United States</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: I thought that was a remarkable moment. Those initial boos were indeed typical of such situations; the emotionally committed supporters didn't want to acknowledge what had happened. But McCain's powerful speech overcame those initial emotions. Soon the crowd was applauding McCain as he congratulated Obama for his accomplishment. Quite something. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Posted 11:38 p.m., 11.4.2008 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eastern Shore, Md.: From an Obama supporter: McCain is giving what sounds to me like a pretty gracious concession speech. If his campaign had been conducted in a similar tone, he might have had a different result.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Posted 11:26 p.m., 11.4.2008 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ann Arbor, Mich.: Yes, fireworks are legal (different chatter&amp;#33) John McCain's concession speech is proof at how his campaign was grossly mismanaged. He already sounds like the fantastic senator we knew before. We were blessed with two amazing candidates, and are lucky two great Americans want to lead this country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks for this. I agree; it is a remarkable speech, still going on. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Posted 11:24 p.m., 11.4.2008 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: Robert -- do you believe that campaign insiders (on either side) are generally surprised by the incredibly narrow margin in the popular vote nationally? To what extent has the electoral map really been &quot;redrawn&quot; given this tight margin?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: I don't thnk the margin will be narrow in the morning. Remember, California. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Posted 11:24 p.m., 11.4.2008 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barbados, West Indies: Not a question but a comment. I am very happy that Elizabeth Dole lost. I hope that this will make politicians think twice about extremely negative ads.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Posted 11:18 p.m., 11.4.2008 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ann Arbor, Mich.: In the middle of the city, there are fireworks going off.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Is that legal? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Posted 11:18 p.m., 11.4.2008 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Economy, Stupid: If that's what got Obama in, how long a honeymoon is he going to have? It's not clear to me how a president turns around an economy on a dime. Might disappointment settle in rather quickly if economic malaise continues or increases?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Presidents' ability to improve an economy are indeed very limited. FDR didn't do throughout the '30s. But he won support from a depressed nation by trying very hard to make things better. Don't know if Obama could do that.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I do think we have opened a new door, and are moving out on something entirely new that we should not try to judge by the standards of the old politics. I could of course be wrong!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Posted 11:18 p.m., 11.4.2008 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Happy in the Heartland: Whatever else Barack Obama does as president, the enthusiasm he has summoned in our young people is truly gratifying. I work on a college campus, and four years ago I had students in my office weeping when Bush won. In the past year, I have been so heartened by the hope and energy Sen. Obama has inspirted in these young people. Our country will need all of that youthful energy to work its way back.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Posted 11:15 p.m., 11.4.2008 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Asheville, N.C.: Response to speculation posted earlier, on Virginia and North Carolina -- these states have a history of voting for Democratic governors and senators but Republican presidents. In other words, voters have a history of splitting tickets in these states. I tend to think anyone voting for Hagan or Warner would be inclined otherwise to vote for a generic Democrat over a generic Republican, but don't leap to the conclusion that it necessarily is racial. Man am I hoping North Carolina goes to Obama. I may be up late waiting for that call.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fairfax, Va.: How many votes are left to be counted?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Millions, but we know the result. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Posted 11:06 p.m., 11.4.2008 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lewisville, N.C.: After living through a very dark and divisive time in American history, for the first time in many years I am feeling truly optimistic about our future. My 10-year-old son got very involved in the political process -- we placed a yard sign, carved an Obama &quot;rising sun&quot; jack-o-lantern, he participated in exit-polling at his school and I took him with me to the polls where he and I pressed the touch screen together for Obama, after waiting in line for three hours (during which I explained to him that waiting three hours was no big thing compared to the sacrifices by those who ensured our ability to do so). This is certainly a historic election that I mark as a turning point -- in which we live in an America where anything is truly possible, anyone can grow up to be president, and extremism no longer rules. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thank you for sharing this. </span></p>

Many who make less than that pay capital gains on stocks and business sales. At some point he said he would raise that tax as much as needed. What's your feeling about where the capital gains tax will go under an Obama administration?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: I expect Obama to propose major tax reform. Capital gains tax and taxes on dividends could both go up. </span></p>

Dole is out -- and as you mention, McCain was viewed as even more negative. Is it a fluke this year that negative campaigning didn't work, or is it a seismic shift?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Good question. And I think we can assume for more than the moment that Obama is our president-elect. He has 202 electoral votes on The Post home page, and there are 73 more to come from California, Oregon and Washington alone.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He needs, as I know you remember, 270 to win.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Negative ads defeated Liddy Dole, I'd argue. They hurt all the Republicans running for Senate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But they did no good for McCain, obviously. I doubt we've seen the last of them, not least because some will argue that Obama's negative ads helped him. </span></p>

While I firmly believe in the Democratic Party, the fact that our country is so evenly divided means it would be difficult for any branch to make major changes to our systems. As much as I would love to see some Democratic measures passed, I'm glad we have Republicans to temper any extremes. Thank you to the founding fathers for a system that, in its basic principles, works well. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On a side note I'm incredibly excited at the prospect of an Obama administration -- not because I think he's going to change the world, but because I think he's going to inspire us all to participate in our communities, in our country, in our world.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tarboro, N.C.: It has been said in many television reports that Sarah Palin was a &quot;drag&quot; for the McCain ticket. Many so-called &quot;experts&quot; claim that her down-home image appeared to many voters as phony, which in turn hurt the McCain campaign. Do you think that there is any truth to those statements?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Los Angeles: Regarding why are Americans apolitical, in my humble opinion it's in part a result of our system. We have fixed terms, so there's almost no chance of a change of government between elections; even when Nixon resigned, another Republican took his place, and it would have been his chosen running mate if Agnew hadn't had to resign as well.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Compare with a parliamentary system -- you don't have a powerful president, and it's the balance of parties that determines who is prime minister; there is no fixed election schedule, and the press always is saying what would happen if an election were held today; and if the government makes a terrible gaffe -- like Bush has done so often -- they can be out of office instantly via a no-confidence vote. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">All that makes parties and a parliamentary majority more important compared to politicians, which in turn makes issues and policies important compared to the personal qualities that are stressed in the U.S. Gov. Palin is a choice example. Our Constitution was set up in part to constrain the president's (king's) power, but European parliamentary countries have evolved to a point where the monarch has so little power that they're not relevant, and the checks and balances operate at other levels rather than between parliament and the crown.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: thanks. I don't agree, but it's an interesting comment. I think we're apolitical because we're apolitical. DeToqueville saw it a long time ago. </span></p>

She was perhaps the best colloquial presenter for a long time in this election -- no mean feat, given her experience. Do you think she is finished as a leader?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Here's a link to a good column from The Post on Palin. What happened in this campaign was fascinating. When the country first met her in early September, she was widely liked and admired, the polls reported. But since then her standing has plummeted. She became a real drag on the ticket.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ryan Thornburg: I think the ad was a big part of it, although a recent Elon poll found that North Carolinian's thought McCain's campaign was more negative than Doles. Also, negative ads tend to work in North Carolina -- and elsewhere.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A big part of it might have been a Winston-Salem Journal story earlier in the campaign saying that Dole spent little time in North Carolina. The Dole campaign said the article was inaccurate, but I never saw their proof to the contrary. In any case, from anecdotal conversations, I think that article played in to a belief that many North Carolinians had about Dole not being as visible on constituent service as Helms had been. </span></p>

The map is shaping up about that way. Is this election a firm repudiation by the rest of the country of the kind of politics represented by George W. Bush, Trent Lott, Mitch McConnell, Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ryan Thornburg: I'm not sure what kind of politics those are, other than Republican politics, but it is interesting to note that McCain appears to be winning the values voters in the South while Obama is winning the voters for whom the economy is the most important issue.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I also think that the lines between &quot;South&quot; and &quot;not-South&quot; are blurring. See another book, &quot;Dixie Rising.&quot; </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ryan Thornburg: That's a good question. I'll certainly be looking at North Carolina's largest 15 counties -- many along the I-85 corridor from Durham down through Charlotte -- and comparing returns there to the other 85 counties.

I just heard on the local NBC affiliate that 50 percent of eligible voters in Virginia had voted by 10 a.m. this morning. I think this is astonishing (in a great way&amp;#33). I mean, when was the last time 50 percent of eligible voters turned out for anything, much less that early? I'm thrilled to be part of this.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ryan Thornburg: The early turnout will be interesting to watch to see whether overall turnout is boosted. I believe that turnout in Virginia in 2004 was around 60 percent of the voting age population. In North Carolina, about 40 percent of registered voters turned out early, but lines were short today -- perhaps an indication that the pool of voters hasn't changed much. They may have just changed when the voted. The head of the state Board of Elections here had made aggressive turnout predictions that now appear to be a bit shy. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Blumenthal: It is a little early to try to form judgments about that, since what we are seeing now are preliminary estimates. As we learned in 2004 and during the primaries this year, those early estimates can sometimes be off by more than a few points.

Political scientists have spent many years studying political engagement in many forms, though I'm not sure I have a quick snappy answer to your question.

Unlike the raw count, they know that there results are representative (within predictable ranges of error) and so they can make such calls.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bottom line: They are not relying on the raw and often unrepresentative results we see crawling at the bottom of our TV screens. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Albany, N.Y.: For Mark Blumenthal: You folks on Pollster repeatedly have noted that the key to Obama doing well in the South is an extremely high black turnout, which reduces the share of the white electorate Obama needs to win. From what you can tell so far, is the black turnout high enough (or, conversely, the white vote low enough) to make any of the Southern states reachable for Obama?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Blumenthal: At the moment, the national exit poll is showing a 13 percent African composition, which if it holds would represent a 2-percentage-point increase since 2004. However, I think it is a little premature to be making too much of these early exit poll numbers. The racial composition will likely change as the vote estimates used to weight the exit polls gradually improve over the course of the evening.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Big blue: If Barack Obama pulls out a win in North Carolina (the initial tabulations show him with a slight lead) it's certainly a sign that black turnout was high enough. </span></p>

I had given his very little thought before (embarrassingly), but it is frankly galling, in my view, that full-fledged, taxpaying United States citizens simply, 100 percent, are shut out of the legislative branch of our government, that every other citizen is entitled to participate in.

In actual cloture votes, as they are called, where 60 votes are needed to end a Senate debate and bring the pending matter up for a vote, I would expect the next Senate to reveal interesting intraparty differences.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Laurel, Md.: In 2004, CNN started the evening by listing the nine battleground states: Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Iowa, New Mexico, West Virginia, New Hampshire and a couple of others. At 11 p.m., when the polls had closed across the continental U.S., they had called the other 39 states, and none of the contentious ones. Will it be midnight before a battleground state gets called?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: I strongly doubt it. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pittsburgh Transplant: McCain's closing forays into Western Pennsylvania scared me. Having lived in the area, I know race is a strong underlying issue. I question the will of many (not all) to vote for a black man in that area. How do you analyze for that impact? Or, what type of voter was McCain targeting?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: You know, all the best polls have had Pennsylvania clearly in Obama's corner for weeks. Personally I have quite a lot of confidence in these findings. We'll know soon enough if that confidence was warranted. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Southern Maryland: I'm a registered Republican woman, and today I cast my first vote ever for a Democrat. I simply could not vote for the &quot;politics of fear&quot; -- whether the messenger is John McCain (a man I respect) or Sarah Palin. (Can she focus on the issues vs. telling us what's wrong with everything?) I am proud of my vote, especially having just viewed the new Republican Party ad featuring the Rev. Wright. To my party leaders: We are done with the Rove-scare-tactics approach to politics. Real life is scary enough. You lost my vote because you focused on hate and fear instead of the real world. President Obama will lead us, not scare us.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: thanks for this. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Temecula, Calif.: I am very nervous. I can't watch, but I have to watch. When can Obama supporters feel encouraged? What states, what times? How will we know when we'll have a long night?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Soon, soon. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Helena, Mont.: I know that anecdote is not data, but I'm working in Indiana and it's just astounding -- early voting in Franklin, Ind., (Johnson County) is off the chart. There were four-hour waits all last week (Monday through Saturday) and today. I never ask anyone who they are voting for because I never reveal that to anyone (not even close family) but this seems like such a good thing to me -- people wanting to vote and willing to stand in line for it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Many such anecdotes reaching us today. But don't trust anecdotes! Before the night is done we will be able to evaluate the turnout -- not definitively, but with quite a lot of confidence. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Posted 7:11 p.m., 11.4.2008 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Stanford, Calif.: I'm puzzled by how little I'm hearing about the possibility (or likelihood?) that with 20 percent to 30 percent of the electorate voting early, a huge number of votes won't be looked at till tomorrow, or maybe later. My understanding -- which could be way wrong -- is that typically, the mail-in votes aren't counted on Election Day. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I'm even less sure about how and when the early voting votes get counted (the voting usually doesn't take place at the normal precinct place). And then there are the vote-by-mail folks who bring their ballots to their precinct and drop them into a special box -- who knows when they get counted? I also wonder if this is a topic that doesn't get much publicity because people like to think their votes are part of the &quot;deciding&quot; votes when winners are declared on Election Night. Any thoughts from you or your experts on this? </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: You are wrong; most absentee and early votes will be counted today.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Hopkins, my distinguished producer, has given you a link here to a helpful discussion. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Brisbane, Australia: What do you think of Obama's chances in North Carolina and Indiana? The way I see it, if Obama can secure those two states the race is over.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Hello Australia! You have asked the right question, and we don't have to guess about it, we can have the actual numbers in the next half hour. I think. We decided to start this chat at 7 p.m. because of the importance of these two states. So stay tuned, or come back soon. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Weston, Fla.: Thanks for doing this. Why wasn't control of the Supreme Court more of an issue is this campaign?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: I wish I knew. It seems to be a fact that most voters don't think of the Court as one of the stakes in a presidential campaign. I don't think we've ever seen a year in which it was a real factor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Partly this reflects a fact about America that the political class doesn't often acknowledge: This is an apolitical culture. As political scientists keep telling us, a great many American voters are ignorant about many basic details of our government and how it works. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: How scared are the pollsters tonight?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Our pollster, Jon Cohen, seems remarkably calm. The best pollsters have (with reason) a strong sense that their numbers will be born out, as they have been for many years really. Yes, I'm sticking my neck out a little, but let's see what happens... </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Posted 7:05 p.m., 11.4.2008 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Santa Barbara, Calif.: Regardless of the outcome of the results today, I am very, very glad to say goodbye to the era of Bush, Cheney, Rove and DeLay, and their abusive politics. What a disservice they did to our country. It really can't get worse than the past eight years, can it?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: thanks for this. Regardless of whether others share your conclusions, there's no doubt about your larger historical judgment: we are ending an era in the United States. What comes next is going to be very different.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By the way, I was intrigued by the news that Rove himself predicted a big Obama victory over the weekend. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chicago: Will exit polling play a large role in tonight's reporting after the screw-ups in 2000?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Good first question. Exit polling is enormously helpful, eventually. Through the night we will get more and more numbers, which will give us useful demographic information. But we have to be careful, which means slow for a while. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Good evening. We've done this often, but I think tonight is going to be special, and memorable. We have many hours of discussion ahead of us. I will do as much of it myself as I can, but there is a splendid supporting cast on hand to help me out and give me some breaks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Washington Post newsroom is buzzing in a way it only does once every four years. Dozens of journalists are deployed, and I can walk around and ask questions, so don't be shy about asking. Washingtonpost.com gives you a zillion ways to follow what's going on--take advantage!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yes, we do have some exit polls, but we are not yet confident enough in what we have to write about them. I can say now only this: at this hour, we have not been amazed by anything we have seen. I will tell you a lot more as the evening proceeds, and as my colleague Jon Cohen, our director of polling, allows me to report actual numbers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Please feel free to offer your own commentary as the night goes on. I will post readers' comments, often without any additional comment from me. </span></p>
