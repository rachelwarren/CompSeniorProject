  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain vs. Barack Obama, Round One. It'll happen one of these days.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Though this election's first presidential debate, which was scheduled for Friday, is now in doubt, the importance of such debates is itself a point of debate. Sure, voters tune in to see how convincingly each candidate answers the questions and performs under pressure. Some might even be hoping for a knockout blow or a dramatic implosion. But if history is a guide, they're likely to be disappointed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ever since the titanic face-to-face Nixon-Kennedy battles in 1960, few moments in the history of modern presidential debates have altered the course of a campaign. There have been some notable verbal blunders by candidates, but it is the more subtle things that often make the debates influential. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The first notable gaffe took place during the 1976 debate between President Ford and Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter. Asked about Soviet-U.S. relations, Ford concluded that &quot;there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration.&quot; Despite his campaign's best efforts to paper over the flub the next few days, the comment made him seem ill-informed on foreign affairs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Did it cost Ford the election? Not likely. He was already behind in the polls after his very unpopular decision to pardon Richard Nixon. And Ford had been the butt of many jokes by comedian Chevy Chase about being clumsy and accident-prone.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When emotion matters</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Flash forward to 1988 and the final debate between Vice President Bush and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. Dukakis had been accused in a political ad of granting a convict named Willie Horton a prison furlough only to have Horton commit a rape while on a weekend pass.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When asked by the debate moderator what he would do if his wife were the victim of such a rape, Dukakis' reply was bland and bloodless and his face expressionless -- a demeanor that had long defined him. Dukakis said: &quot;I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life. ... I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.&quot; Bush was judged to have won the debate by 49%-33%, according to an ABC instant poll.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">More typical of the subtlety of turning points was a comment by President Carter in his 1980 debate with California Gov. Ronald Reagan. Carter related an improbable conversation about nuclear proliferation that he claimed to have had with his daughter, then 13. &quot;I had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was. She said she thought nuclear weaponry -- and the control of nuclear arms.&quot; The comment was interpreted as evidence of Carter's tendency to exaggerate or stretch the truth.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the greatest impact in that Carter-Reagan debate was on women. Reagan had been lagging behind Carter in the polls, especially among women who feared that he was trigger-happy. During the debate, though, Reagan instead came across with sweet reasonableness and gave many female voters the reassurance they needed to support him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Finally, few zingers over the years have gotten as much play as Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's savage put-down of Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana in the 1988 vice-presidential debate. When Quayle tried to defend his lack of experience by comparing himself with President Kennedy, Bentsen replied: &quot;Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy.&quot; Though it was a great example of verbal swordsmanship, Bentsen's remark couldn't save the Dukakis ticket from defeat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The outcome of the debate is more likely to turn on something that might go unnoticed by many voters. The classic example of this was in 1960, when Vice President Nixon's sallow complexion and profuse sweating went unnoticed by a radio audience that proclaimed him the winner of the presidential debate while the TV audience, noting Nixon's discomfort, proclaimed the suave, composed Sen. Kennedy as the victor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">More recently, President George H.W. Bush's impatient glance at his watch during a question on the effects of the recession in the 1992 debate in Richmond, Va., or Al Gore's exasperated sigh in a 2000 debate with George W. Bush, both played into stereotypes of the candidates that were well established: H.W. Bush as detached and out-of-touch with the problems of ordinary Americans, and Gore as haughty and self-righteous.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What to do -- or not to do</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What advice could we give to Obama and McCain that might at least enable them to head off embarrassment, if not actually score a major coup? The eloquent and composed Obama must discipline himself not to come across as supercilious. Whatever the substance of his remarks, he must take care not to play the law professor. McCain's task is somewhat harder. Less eloquent than Obama, McCain can't afford to sound or look his age. He must guard against verbal slip-ups and should, as Reagan did in his 1980 debate, dial back on his bellicose rhetoric. These are the little things that turn out to have a big effect in presidential debates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Above all, both men, who have made efforts to appear above partisanship, need to maintain a level of civility that would reassure voters who claim to want an end to political polarization.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If it is any comfort to the candidates who might be suffering from pre-debate jitters, nothing that they say or do not say is likely to be a game-changer.</span></p>
