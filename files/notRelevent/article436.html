  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington Post opinion columnist Eugene Robinson was online Tuesday, Sept. 16 at 1 p.m. ET to discuss his recent columns and the latest news.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Discussion Group: Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The transcript follows.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Archive: Eugene Robinson discussion transcripts</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eugene Robinson: Hello, everyone, and welcome. Today I'm guessing we'll talk about politics and the economy. Somehow, lipstick doesn't seem to be such a burning issue. This morning's column, for reference, was about Sarah Palin's passing acquaintance with the truth.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Oz (or so it seems): Mr. Robinson, while reading your column this morning, it struck me that the American presidency is one of the only jobs in America that one can get in spite (or because of?) falsifying one's resume. If one made false claims on her resume in applying for, say, a managerial or academic or medical or legal position, then she (presuming she was caught) surely would not get the job, right? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">How can it be that, in the quest for the jobs that matter most (president and vice president), candidates are permitted to manufacture their own &quot;truth&quot; and rewrite their resumes to fit their wishes? The rest of us surely do not get to do that in our efforts to secure the little jobs we do! Sometimes I have to stop and wonder if this all really is happening...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Running on a Lie (Post, Sept. 15)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eugene Robinson: Sometimes I have to stop and wonder, too. I don't understand how being unencumbered by knowledge of Washington or foreign affairs is somehow a recommendation for high office.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Baltimore: Mr. Robinson, it seems that you didn't listen to all of what Karl Rove had to say, and conveniently left out the part of how untruthful Obama's ads have been. You try to paint this image that only Republican candidates stretch the truth, but make no mention of the many untruths the Democrats have spread. Why the one-sided reporting?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eugene Robinson: The traditional definition of news if &quot;man bites dog.&quot; It is no surprise that Karl Rove would criticize a Democratic candidate's ads. That would be &quot;dog bites man.&quot; It is indeed a surprise that he would question the Republican candidate's ads.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Election and the Economy: What people want to see are energetic, solution-oriented politicians who are on the case. They must have energy and a vision, and it would be good to see them anxious to convey their belief in it to the people of the country, to take delight in their knowledge of the field. Little things like a &quot;credit agency&quot; here or &quot;regulators&quot; there do not really cut it. I want someone who will grab the bull (so to speak) by the horns and say &quot;here's what we're gonna do.&quot; And it might not be a bad time for them to ask something of U.S. As a Democrat, I'm afraid there so far has been only one person in particular who fits the bill. Pun intended.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eugene Robinson: I think you make a great point. I have said before, and say again, that the candidate who is able to offer a compelling vision of how to restart the economy and give people hope for a better and more prosperous future will seize the initiative in this election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">J. Francois Kerry: You claim that Palin lied when she stated that she told Congress &quot;thanks but no thanks for that Bridge to Nowhere up in Alaska&quot; because she supported the bridge while running for governor. Mainstream media outlets and Alaskan Democrats concede that she killed the project. That makes her statement consistent with the facts. Do you have any evidence that she has stated that she &quot;opposed&quot; the &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot; from the start, or is your attack based on distortion? That might make it a smear.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eugene Robinson: Her statement is not consistent with the facts. She killed a project that was already dead. She tries to give the impression that she opposed it when in fact she supported it when she ran for governor and while she was in office. If she were to say that she was in favor of the bridge but came to oppose it after it had become a national embarrassment, and took the money anyway for other projects, that would be truthful and I'd have no problem.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Oviedo, Fla.: Why is it accepted for Obama to be spoken of in the same breath with Thurgood Marshall, Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King Jr. of course and the entire civil rights movement/history of black struggle? He had nothing to do with any of that. The honor earned by brave blacks who broke barriers all accrue to him, now, just because he is black? And we &quot;old&quot; white women (I just turned 50) are bitter, shrewish battle-axe types when we are just as excited about the symbolism of Hillary Clinton's 18 million votes? Or for that matter, enjoy the overnight spotlite on Sarah Palin?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In short -- why is it cool to break barriers as a black and tedious and even offensive to note similar gains for females? The new ground for Obama is sacred and above critique, while that for Clinton and Palin is simply a bigger stage where they are savaged as being too entrenched or not established enough, and so on. What gives?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eugene Robinson: First of all, you're certainly not &quot;old&quot; as far as I'm concerned. Second, I guess I don't agree with your premise. I do agree that Hillary Clinton's campaign and Sarah Palin's candidacy are historic. But how can you suggest that Obama hasn't been subjected to critical scrutiny? And shouldn't Palin be scrutinized as well?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Charlotte, N.C.: With all of Obama's hand-wringing about focusing on the issues, do you think he now wishes he would have done the joint town hall meetings with McCain? It seems to me this would have kept the focus of both campaigns where they need to be. I thought it did not jibe with his &quot;new politics&quot; campaign when he denied McCain's offer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eugene Robinson: That's an interesting question. I guess I don't buy John McCain's claim that the campaign would have been like a graduate school seminar if only Obama had agreed to the town halls. That sounds like an invented rationalization to me. But I wonder if we wouldn't have been better served by seeing the candidates side by side in some kind of series of encounters. We'll still have the three debates, but I would have liked to see more.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Seattle: McCain supported Bush's efforts to privatize Social Security and invest the money in Lehman Brothers, Bear Sterns, Merill Lynch, etc. Will McCain run into a lot of trouble regarding this?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eugene Robinson: I would think the Democrats might want to mention McCain's ideas about Social Security.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Norfolk, Va.: Eugene, Obama's&nbsp;ad questioning McCain's honor -- and the 527 ad trashing his time as a POW -- are really beyond the pale. They go way beyond McCain's dirty little ads. Doesn't Obama risk tarnishing his reputation by getting down in the gutter like this? My father always said &quot;never mud-wrestle a pig -- you'll get dirty, and the pig likes it.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eugene Robinson: The Obama campaign has a fine line to walk. The 527's on both sides are going to mud-wrestle, and the campaigns, by law, can't be involved. After McCain's&nbsp;ad accusing Obama of supporting sex education for kindergartners, I don't see how Obama could avoid firing back on the issue of honor. But every day spent on this back-and-forth is a day not spent talking about the issues, and the issues are where Obama has an advantage because he's more in tune with public opinion than McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Denver: I read an interesting piece yesterday that got me to thinking ... how would I feel about any one of the four candidates taking over at Lehman Brothers? If any of them leave me feeling squeamish about their qualifications in that role, how could I possibly consider that same person in the role of commander in chief? Suddenly my vote became clearer than ever.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eugene Robinson: That's an interesting way to look at it. Being a CEO isn't exactly the same thing as being commander in chief, but you could argue that there's enough overlap to make this a useful thought experiment.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rockville, Md.: Gene, wouldn't it be fair to say elections these days essentially are lying contests? The candidate that lies most convicingly (&quot;I'll get A, B and C done&quot; or &quot;my opponnent did X, Y and Z horrible things&quot;) wins, no? I'm not saying Palin's a convincing liar, but...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eugene Robinson: I hope we haven't devolved to that point. I hope this election can ultimately be about McCain's vision of the future versus Obama's -- and about either candidate's ability to take us there.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roseland, N.J.: If I managed my kids the way the SEC managed this market, I'd be in jail for child abuse. They'd be sticking their finger in the socket, and I'd be saying, &quot;I'll let the current sort out whether that's a good idea or not.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eugene Robinson: The prevailing philosophy in Washington has been that we need more deregulation and less oversight. Not the way I would manage my kids, either.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.:&quot;I don't understand how being unencumbered by knowledge of Washington or foreign affairs is somehow a recommendation for high office.&quot; It's ironic that you can't see that your attempt to belittle Sarah Palin actually applies more aptly to ... Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eugene Robinson: Obviously, people have questioned Obama's experience. That's a legitimate issue. It doesn't seem to be a dominant issue, however, because McCain -- who has, unquestionably, tons of experience in Washington -- is now all about change.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Virginia Beach, Va.: Any comment on David Brook's article in the New York Times this morning? Do you see other conservative columnists following in his footsteps?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Why Experience Matters (New York Times, Sept. 16)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eugene Robinson: I thought David Brooks' column was eloquent. Even if he works for Brand X.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: After reading your article, I'm a little perplexed about campaigning about big government. These same people want to get big government contracts, or big government business loans. Then, when they become successful, they don't want to pay taxes because they feel as though they are giving away their hard-earned money, which for the average people was how they became successful in the first place. Most of all, if they don't like big government, why are they trying to get elected and take control of this wonderful big government?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eugene Robinson: That's a great question. If you don't believe in government, why spend all that time and effort campaigning to... run the government? Why not leave that to someone who believes that government is necessary and good?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eugene Robinson: My time is up, folks. Thanks to all for tuning in, and I'll see you again next week. By then we'll be getting ready for the first presidential debate. Elections don't get more exciting, or consequential, than this one.</span></p>
