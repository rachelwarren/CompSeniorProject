  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">DAILY UPDATES: WED </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten's humor column, Below the Beltway, appears every Sunday in The Washington Post magazine. It is syndicated nationally by the Washington Post Writers Group.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At one time or another, Below the Beltway has managed to offend persons of both sexes as well as individuals belonging to every religious, ethnic, regional, political and socioeconomic group. If you know of a group we have missed, please write in and the situation will be promptly rectified. &quot;Rectified&quot; is a funny word.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Tuesdays at noon, Weingarten is online to take your questions and abuse. He will chat about anything. Although this chat is updated regularly throughout the week, it is not and never will be a &quot;blog,&quot; even though many persons keep making that mistake. One reason for the confusion is the Underpants Paradox: Blogs, like underpants, contain &quot;threads,&quot; whereas this chat contains no &quot;threads&quot; but, like underpants, does sometimes get funky and inexcusable.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Submit your questions, comments and other detritus before or during the discussion. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Important, secret note to readers: The management of The Washington Post apparently does not know this chat exists, or it would have been shut down long ago. Please do not tell them. Thank you.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Weingarten is also the author of &quot;The Hypochondriac's Guide to Life. And Death&quot; and co-author of &quot;I'm with Stupid,&quot; with feminist scholar Gina Barreca.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Good afternoon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here is our Holy Crap moment of the day:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Sunday, the Post magazine printed an excerpt from Old Dogs, which chronicled the life and death of my dog Harry. In the accompanying editor's column, Tom the Butcher wrote about his fears of losing Sally, his nine-year-old lab-hound mix. The column included a picture of Sally.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Sunday morning, Chatwoman opened up the magazine and her jaw dropped. She fired off an email to Tom:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;My dog, Page, is the same age as your Sally -- we adopted her in the fall of 1999 -- and bears an uncanny resemblance to Sally. Page was originally named &quot;Stacey&quot; by the Rappahannock Animal Welfare League, who had found her in a pound in rural Page County, Va. (hence her name). She's a lab-hound mix. Here's a pic of Page.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">---</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This was Tom's response:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We got Sally also from the Rappahannock Animal Welfare League! She was born sometime in the summer of 1999. That's a pretty big coincidence. How many times have you seen that pink nose? Wow, my guess is they are sisters! They found her wandering around in some semi-rural Virginia county. Is Page around 40 lbs? Does she run with her nose to the ground?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">--</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This was Liz's response:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Yep, about 40 pounds and that nose is ALWAYS on the ground. Which is why it takes us an hour to get around the neighborhood.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sisters. I'd bet on it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">---</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The book excerpt got a lot of mail, many with attached photos of bygone old dogs. One of the best was from Lisa Laparan, who wrote about her little dog, Chuck, and included two pictures. This is Chuck at 4 months. And this is Chuck at 16 years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">---</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The first dog profiled in the book was Honey, a female pit bull who lives in my neighborhood. In the final year of Harry's life, Honey was his only outside interest; the two dogs would trudge together side by side for blocks, hardly interacting but content in each other's company. Honey -- who, at nine, was much younger -- would slowing her pace so that Harry could keep up. Because Harry's romantic interests had always been for males, I compared this pairing to what happens when an old gay man returns to his wife to end their time together on a porch under and embroidered lap shawl.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They've come full circle now. Honey died yesterday, peacefully, the way all dogs should.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There are 63 dogs profiled in the book; all were between 10 and 17 years old when Michael Williamson photographed them, and some of the pictures were taken as long as two and a half years ago. Anticipating the inevitable question, in the intro of the book we wrote that if anyone wants to know how many of the dogs are still alive, our answer will be: &quot;All of them.&quot; Honey, too.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">---</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Many, many Jewish people wrote in last week to defend their synagogues' practice of selling seats for the High Holy Day services, pointing out, correctly, that synagogues do not pass collection plates since observant Jews cannot deal with money on the Sabbath. It's a completely reasonable means of fundraising and to any extent that I implied otherwise, I apologize. By way of abject atonement, and in the spirit of the season, I hereby present this as today's CLOD. It was submitted by Andrew Hoenig.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">---</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Please take Today's Poll. Yes, there are correct answers, which I will obnoxiously reveal midway through the chat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">---</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A poor comics week was rescued by a strong Sunday: CPOW is Sunday's Doonesbury, First Runner-Up: Thursday's Doonesbury. Honorables: Sunday's Zits, Sunday's Argyle Sweater.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Unsa, ID: You didn't say &quot;Okay, let's go,&quot; so I'm not sure if the chat has started.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Okay, let's go.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: I clicked on the poll, read it in its entirety, read it a second time, then closed it without voting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I know that quirky is your schtick, but that just sucked. The very idea of putting those thoughts and those words to music is an insult to music. Never mind that there was nothing profound in all that. I've seen pithier, more thoughtful bumper stickers. On Republicans' cars. I didn't read a single one of those lines without an annoyed &quot;hunh?&quot; Rather than &quot;brilliant&quot;, &quot;true&quot;, and &quot;funny&quot;, I might have included a category for &quot;most likely to have been written by a college freshman newspaper columnist desperately wishing to be seen as politically active and insightful, but failing.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I'm sure that if you post my comment, you'll include some sort of slur on my intelligence (or maybe my looks or state of sexual satisfaction). I get that; she's your friend. Have at it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Hardly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I acknowledge you are a person of average intelligence.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Falls Church, Va.: After three great years together, my boyfriend proposed last spring. Marrying him is something that I had thought about for a long time, and was sure I wanted. Now that we've been engaged for a little while, traits that had annoyed me are grating on my nerves like never before. It's all litlle things (like that he has the worst taste in television, repeats the same corny jokes over and over, and talks to our dog in a baby voice), but it's nothing that has changed about him at his core. And all the important things (honest, easy to talk to, fun to be with and good in bed) are still there. But when I think about having to hear the same punchline a thousand more times I want to throw something at his head. Is this something that can chalked up to nerves, or a sign that I'm about to marry the wrong person? We're in our mid-30s if it matters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I am going to put this up to the group. I am thinking it is a sign you are marrying the wrong person.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rhetoric and Responsibility: Gene: Reports are coming out in the news that the McCain/Palin supporters at their rallies are getting so fired up about the anti-Obama rhetoric that pushes boundaries even in the no-holds barred environment of politics that it is eliciting racist and violent remarks, so much so that one person even shouted out &quot;Kill him!&quot; in response to a Palin comment. So here is my question: To what extent should Palin and/or McCain or ANY of their surrogates be responsible for violence either toward Obama himself, minorities or other supporters that arise from their comments? On one hand, I generally believe that McCain/Palin are not responsible for the actions of any of their listeners/supporters, but on the other hand, they clearly INTEND to incite a fair amount of hatred against Obama as part of their tactics, so should they be held to account for the consequences?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I think this is all going to backfire immediately. I think the electorate is scared and wants and adult. I don't think they want to hear the tooth gnashings.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: So...Governer Palin did better than I expected, but what is with the winking? This is a Vice presidential debate - we are choosing the back-up for the president of the most powerful country in the world. This is not a time for winking and shout-outs to Joe Six-Pack. It was like watching a high school debate where a popular girl is running for class president. I'm sorry, but this is a serious time in this country. People are losing homes, jobs, life savings and their lives and she's WINKING at the camera. What is up with that?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I think her entire candidacy comes off as a satire. It exactly the satire Mencken was referencing in that first quote.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This is the inevitable endpoint of a TV-era presidential marketing process that for 50 years has been emphasizing style over substance and &quot;narrative&quot; over experience.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Actually, the same process gave us Barack Obama, I suppose, only we lucked out with that one. In addition to narrative, he has depth, intelligence, reflection, judgment and temperament.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin, however, seems the perfect distillate of everything flashy and nothing important. I know the McCain implosion is being driven mostly by the economy, but I am thinking that there's some Sarah in there, too. I think, finally, Americans are understanding they've been handed a pig in a poke. With or without lipstick.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: The disturbing thing about the Palin Pit bull tour is the degree of angry nationalistic fervor. I will not make the fascism connection, I will leave that to others.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I think it would be scary, but I think it is going to implode. I don't think we're that stupid.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cuzzins: I thought the relatives/cousins quote in the poll was brilliant. I also thought it was funny. According to the masses, I couldn't be more wrong.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: One of my favorites in there! I will soon be explain, patiently, which the best are.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McLean, Va.: I emailed you this a year ago this week. (I think it got caught in the Vista wormhole, because I know you would have responded if you saw it.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My parents are putting my 18-year old dog to sleep today. I am 30. This means I got this dog when I was in the 7th grade. He was there for those awkward junior high years, a move to a different state, all of those crazy high school years, college, entering the workforce, getting married, and now having my first child. That is a very long time. Even though he has lived with my parents all these years, and I have only seen him on visits, he is my dog, the dog that I picked out at the shelter, the dog that fit in one hand when we brought him home, the only dog I've ever met that sucked his thumb and never barked. From now on, everything that happens will fall into the after-Tuffy era. I don't even know what to make of that.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tuffy's ashes now sit on my dresser. My question for you in the year 1AT is this: My husband has never owned a pet. He says he can't do it, because he know he would have to go through losing it at some point and there is no reason to volunteer for that. How can I convince him that it is completely worth it, so that we (and our children), can one day own a dog?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Are you doing any book signings, so I can come give you a big hug?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: The book is out in stores and available on Amazon, but I'm not sure about signings yet, other than a presentation Michael Williamson and I are going to do on Oct. 30. My guess is a few will be scheduled closer to Christmas.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Your weapon with your husband is the children. Children need pets, to help them understand love. This argument has the dual advantage of helping your cause and being true.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Op, US: I can't believe Berke Breathed is retiring...again.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Seriously, I was a huge fan as a high school student, a moderate fan as a college student, and a passing fan as an adult. I mean, it's a character-driven strip that hasn't been daily for nearly 20 years, so it's not like we had much opportunity to get re-attached for the last three. I just can't get choked up the way I would for, say, Trudeau or like I did for Larson or Watterston. Or like I did for Breathed, twice already.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Well, Berkeley has been teasing us for weeks now. It's no surprise.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I liked Opus, and it remains one of the best drawn strips on the comics pages, and I will miss it. But I think the decision to go Sunday-only may hae doomed it from the start. It's very hard to gain traction without a daily dose of your characters, particularly, as you say, with a character-driven strip.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I began to feel that Berkeley's heart was not entirely in this latest enterprise when more than once we found ourselves looking at recycled Bloom County gags.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: But: Week after week, Opus delivered some of the best sky-is-falling allegorical hang-wringing about the political hypocrisy afoot in our land. It's not a voice I would vote to lose and I'm sorry to see it go.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Manassas, Va.: How do you know Harry came from a puppy mill?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And how do you define &quot;puppy mill&quot;?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Harry came with papers. The name of the place was something like the Happy Valley Dog Gestation Camp.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pic, KY: Gene, After reading your essay in this Sunday's Magazine, I realized you were the perfect person to offer advice on a dilemma I'm currently facing. My new boyfriend (3 months) is a great guy - very attractive, funny, incredibly intelligent, and great to be around. He is, as they say, something special. There's just one problem...he's deathly allergic to cats and dogs, and has been his whole life. He's tried allergy shots, all sorts of medications, and nothing has worked. I have cats, and every time he's been to my place he's ended up feeling ill and short of breath. It's obviously frustrating to me, and it's frustrating to him as well; he likes animals, but simply can't be around them. I've always assumed that pets would be a part of my life, but he's a really great person who has, as they say, &quot;long term potential.&quot; (Apologies for using such a terrible phrase.) So what would you advise this cat &amp; dog-loving 26-year-old to do?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: You have a difficult decision, as you know. Make it soon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: Please explain to me why my three-year-old niece is afraid of an animatronic dinosaur, but is curious about a dead body in a casket.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: You can't be scared by a dead body until you have a sense of what death is. You don't need any existential help to be scared of a lizard with big teeth.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Somewhere in Georgia: I guess this makes me elitist, but if I had used Gov. Palin's lazy brand of English is such a formal setting, I'd hear it from my mother for days. One thing she (and the rest of the adults in my family) always stressed was speaking clearly, ending my &quot;ing&quot; words with the actual &quot;ing&quot; sound, and avoiding slang. I absolutely detest her folksiness --- why did I work all those years to speak like an adult when she can go on national TV and sound like that?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Sarah is appealing to the least of us.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I woke up this morning intending to write an ode to the people who are supporters of Sarah, who think her candidacy are a good idea. I'm still mulling the contours of it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">These are people who have the lowest possible expectations for our country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Baltimore, Md.: Gene, Is it just me or did Krauthammer endorse Obama on Friday? With an enormous backhand, but still...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I read it as such, yes. I think he would call it predictive, not advocative. I call it advocative.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We've already heard similarly from George Will.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I believe that the right thing to do in this election is becoming plain to many, many people.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Also, plain is an anagram of Palin.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Language not safe for work.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Not bad. Some excellent lines, like the Putin one.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shameless flatte, RY: Gene,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My 16-year-old daughter read the story about Harry in the magazine on Sunday and was absolutely charmed! (Unless you've forgotten pretty quickly, it is no small matter to thoroughly impress a 16-year-old.) She even said that she thought that the author, whoever he was, was amazing. I described your accomplishments and attributes as best I could, and mentioned a few other of your more notable offerings, such as the articles about the Great Zucchini and Joshua Bell. However, I can't seem to find them in The Post archives. Can you help a poor mom out? She even summarized your article for her current events class......</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: They're all here. Right side of the page.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Thankew.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pal, IN: I think the best description of Palin's performance is that she still thinks she's competing in a pageant: It's about the toothy grin, the coquettish laugh, and playing to the audience.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: And pleasing her handlers. Doing what she was told to do, and dadgumming, getting it all out there before the buzzer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Annapolis, Md.: Someone relatively charming came into my place of work last week and talked my ear off about life in general. But then he remarked that he loves to read but can't stand fiction because &quot;anyone can write it.&quot; I was taken aback but didn't have a real response.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I have, on my desk, 5 books: The Bhagavad Gita, a couple computer textbooks, a book of local hikes, and a Wodehouse collection. The only work I'd classify as being inimitable is the Wodehouse collection.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So what's your take on this? I pretty much dismissed that visitor as an uninteresting cuckold after the remark.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I read mostly nonfiction.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I've never really understood why until recently. I tend to read fiction competitively: Could I do that? It's nerve-racking.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Win, KY: Richard Cohen has a good piece on Palin today. I think his comments about the media &quot;grading on a curve&quot; couldn't be more true. Obviously the conservatives were going to say she hit a home run, but I was shocked at how many people said she generally did a an excellent job. Sure, she didn't faint, but if that's as good as she can do...is she really VP worthy? (But then again, look at Cheney)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Another excellent point from Cohen...&quot;Can you imagine the reaction of the press corps if Clinton had given the audience a 'hiya, sailor' wink?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: This Debate's Biggest Loser, ( Post, Oct. 7)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Yep.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She was terrible. Really terrible, not answering questions, being both shallow and transparent, masking her ignorance with folksiness.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We did grade on a curve. I did, too, even in my own mind, until I watched it again.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A really good way to look at it is through the SNL veep debate skit. Liz, can you link?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Columbia, Md.: To the poster who is concerned that her perfect-but-irritating fiance might not be the one for her, she'd do well to remember that while love is usually the triumph of imagination over intelligence, sometimes your intelligence has to kick in. Speaking purely logically, do you really think there is anyone on the face of the earth who has no habits that will irritate you and grate on your last nerve? Once you've realized that there will always be -something- not-perfect about another person, then you let the imagination part back in--just pretend those irritating habits don't exist (as your fiance probably does already with YOUR irritating habits).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: But you know what? It's pretty early in that relationship to be getting annoyed at quirks and mannerisms.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dupont Circle: I was talking with someone over the weekend who opined that whomever wins the election will end up being a one-term president, since the situation he will inherit is already so horribly effed-up. What do you think? I don't think (or maybe I hope) that won't be the case; it didn't happen after FDR was elected, and he came into a similar economic vortex of suck.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: It won't be the case if the public perceives that the guy is trying. We are, ultimately, fair minded.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Okay, the poll.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You did quite well, except where you didn't.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The best way to corral this is to pull out the ones that most impress you, and THEN try to figure out why. Doing it that way, I get these five:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democracy is a pathetic belief in the collective wisdom of individual ignorance.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Every man sees in his relatives, and especially in his cousins, a series of grotesque caricatures of himself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Legend is a lie that has attained the dignity of age.</span></p>

No, we have to try on dozens of pairs to find out that they don't exist. We have Mystery Size X which is actually the same size as Mystery Size Y in another brand, and neither fit just right. In some jeans, I need to wear &quot;relaxed fit&quot; (fat) jeans. In others, I wear &quot;natural fit&quot; (what is that?) or &quot;regular fit&quot; and in one brand I even fit into &quot;slim&quot;. Boot cut, tapered leg, flare leg, long, petite, regular length, low waist, ultra low waist, &quot;comfort&quot; waist... All different for different brands, and none of them tell me what I need to know. I'd buy men's jeans in retaliation except they are designed for people without hips. And the weird part of this whole story is that I'm an average sized woman. Taller than average, but not unusually so, not very fat, not very slim, not very bottom heavy, not very top heavy.

Christine exchanged some email with me and sent me the lyrics and a link to an early draft recording of the song. I never expected anything like that -- I just hoped for her web guru to maybe point out something obvious that I had missed on the site. I think Christine is just great. Everybody reading this chat should run right over to Amazon or her web site and buy multiple copies of all her recordings, and her children's book, too. Go! Now!</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The product of a Kansas puppy mill, son of a bitch named Taffy Sioux, Harry had been sold to us as a yellow Labrador retriever. I suppose it was technically true, but only in the sense that Tic Tacs are technically &quot;food.&quot; Harry's lineage was suspect. He wasn't the square, shiny, elegant type of Labrador you can envision in the wilds of Canada on a hunting trip for ducks. He was the shape of a baked potato, with the color and luster of an inter-office envelope. You could envision him in the wilds of suburban Toledo, on a hunting trip for nuggets of dried food in a carpet.</span></p>

I'm male, late 50s, good health, and physically capable of standing long enough to drain the hose, but when I'm at home, and even at work where there are private one-holers (toilet only), I will take the occasion to drop my pants and set a spell. It's a nice break to the day, and it's like on Metro -- Why stand when a seat is available?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a public place, I use the urinals if they're aren't otherwise occupied. They're quick and convenient, and honestly, I wouldn't mind getting a urinal installed at home. That would be useful.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a public restroom, if only a toilet is available, I'll do a stand up there, especially in places with questionable sanitation. But I lift the seat (generally with my toe--and I have nothing but contempt for the lazy clods who leave the seat down) and direct the stream to the edge of the bowl to avoid the noise and splashing. Maybe some guys get a kick out of that sound and like to build up a nice head of bubbles in the bowl. I'm not one of them tho. And this doesn't even consider the whole question of back splatter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And I always check the color. This might seem obsessive but I have a good reason. When I was ten years old one night, I looked down and the bowl looked like it was filled with Hawaiian punch. I was bleeding internally from a undetected congenital cyst. Within two weeks, I was in the hospital with one less kidney than I was born with. No problems since then, but I always check just to make sure.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I think you're right. I can only speak from my own experience, but I had no doubts about marrying my husband. This cold feet/nerves thing -- I don't get it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I think cold feet is probably common; it's the going public with it that, to me, bodes poorly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Collateral Damage: The ugly tone of the McCain-Palin race just cost me a friendship. Here's the deal: Said former friend send me a link to a video that attempted to place all the blame for the economic meltdown on the Dems. I politely wrote back and said the video was disingenuous because there's plenty of blame to go around.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Well. That merely birthed a rash of e-mails from her, each more partisan and vitriolic than the last. Ultimately, I told her to stop writing to me. Now we're ex-friends, which is too bad, because we have friends in common I like very much.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In any case, I blame all this on the hysterical tone taken by the McCain-Palin campaign, and its Obama-is-the-Antichrist rhetoric. Jerks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: There is some funny stuff on the Web in response to the charges about Obama and Bill Ayres, the former Weather Underground leader.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They &quot;photos&quot; of Obama, at age 8, conspiring with the then-criminal Ayres.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Woodbridge, Va.: Gene: Once McCain chose Palin, and it became manifest just who she was, I contend the moral and loyal American no longer could vote for that ticket.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I have loyal and moral friends who are still voting for him for one reason -- taxes. They believe McCain won't raise them and Obama will. That's it. Taxes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: That is not a moral or ethical stance, obviously.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If you do not think Sarah Palin can be a competent president, you cannot ethically vote for that ticket.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Okay, thank you all. I will be updating through the week.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">UPDATED 10.8.08</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Iro, NY: Gene Weingarten: The three most brilliant will inevitably include the one that is most true, because brilliance relies on truth. That one would be democracy-innocence.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fairfax, Va.: Sarah Palin's appeal is that she ... says &quot;See? I'm a buffoon, and yet here I am running for Vice President for a man who is unlikely to make it to the end of one term! You can do it, too!&quot; Gene Weingarten: But really, what percent of the population is stupid enough to find that remotely reassuring?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I think you answered your own question.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Seriously, I'm a big Obama guy, but I just don't understand the myopia of my liberal friends on Palin. In every election since 1980, the candidate who successfully created the image of himself as &quot;just a regular guy, who understands you and your problems because he's like you&quot; has won (I suspect this may have been true in 1976, too, but I'm too young to remember).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clearly, that's the mantle McCain's going for. For him, it's hardly accurate, but been pretty successful for the nuclear physicists, movie stars, Rhodes scholars, Yale graduates, and so forth who have successfully claimed the title before, so why not? And he's done pretty well in creating that narrative for himself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With Palin, it's even easier, because there's actually quite a bit of truth to it. The strong religious commitment, small town origin, blue collar husband, unwed pregnant teenage daughter, and checkered educational history that you decry are exactly the source of her appeal to the trailer trash in rural Ohio and Colorado who are going to decide this election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sure, those things make you, me, and most of the rest of the chatters hate her. But we were never going to vote for McCain, anyway. We wouldn't have voted for McCain/Ghandi. So, yeah, he choose a running mate who wouldn't appeal to people who weren't going to vote for him. You'll have to forgive me for failing to understand how that's a major blunder.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The real question is, does she appeal to the people the McCain campaign needs her to appeal to? Your acknowledgement of the brilliance of the Menkin quote (not to mention the last 30 years of electorical history) says she does.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: It's too bad you don't remember 1976, because that one is the one that may best parallel this year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The country had just been through Watergate. The voters were sick to death of the Republicans. Gerald Ford was trying to distance himself from Nixon, but could not -- not just because of his ill-advised pardon, but because his party was inextricably linked to it all. People wanted something really different -- in fact, they wanted a smart guy to fix things.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yeah, Jimmy Carter was a likeable peanut farmer, but he was also knowledgeable about nuclear physics, and was generally seen as the brains in that race. Gerald Ford was seen as the amiable dunce. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Par, ODY: I submit the following Love/lust song parody for, well general amusement. NSFW!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Thank you. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Richmond, Va.: The boyfriend and I were having a meandering discussion about moral issues in relation to politics, such as gay marriage and abortion. I used to be conservative, but have been marching towards the left in recent years. He is a moderate and tends to be more interested in where candidates stand on the issues than with what party they are affiliated.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He mentioned hearing a discussion on talk radio about Sarah Palin's decision to have her baby with Down Syndrome and it was stated that most liberals support aborting fetuses that will have disabilities when they are born. I asked him what channel or show it was and he couldn't remember. I asked if maybe he was only half listening as he drove, noting that the only criticism I've heard recently about Palin and her baby was that people have been praising her for choosing to have this baby, considering that she is pro-life and would deny the right to choose for other women. He said he was pretty sure that wasn't what was being said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So I went online and tried doing a search. I found one blog, something like America for Capitalism, where the person flat out said it was economically irresponsible to bring children like that in the world. I found other blogs with people furious over what the first blog said. I found a blog that quoted Phyllis Schlafly as saying that if Sarah Palin were a Democrat, she would have aborted the baby. I found another blog that said the Left hate children and listed the extreme views that would support that statement. Since I was wading into wackadoo land, I decided to stop there.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Not that I want you to make blanket statements about liberals and conservatives, but would you say this is a common belief?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I assume it's a common belief, because I assume it is true.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Why wouldn't the part of the population that is supportive of a woman's right to choose abortion be more likely to also feel that aborting a mentally retarded fetus is jsutifiable? Surely a larger percentage of these people would believe it justifiable than would people who believe that abortion is tantamount to murder and should be a crime.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's a leap to presume that the MAJORITY of people who are pro-choice would support aborting a fetus with Down syndrome, but it wouldn't surprise me. It seems to be among the least &quot;frivolous&quot; of reasons to choose abortion, and if your position (as mine is) is that abortion can be morally justified, wouldn't you sort of BEGIN there? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">B.D. Grins!: Hi Gene,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's been over a week, but I'm still smiling about seeing B.D. smile in Doonesbury.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I loved Trudeau's whole sequence about Sam's Sarah Palin doll, but the most touching thing was seeing B.D. get so tickled as Boopsie tried to explain to Sam that Palin shouldn't be her hero (or her vice president). We've seen B.D. recover from his amputation and deal with his PTSD and even reach out to other characters -- but I'm pretty sure this is the first time he's smiled. It made me unreasonably happy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And wide-eyed Boopsie has come a long way since B.D.'s injury, too. She's been a rock for B.D. And it's nice to see her get steamed about Palin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I can't believe how emotionally invested I've become in these characters lately. Trudeau has always been brilliant, but this is ridiculous.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Yeah, this was the best day of a good week. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Old Dog Story: I won't go on too much about how cool my dog is (thats been covered in general?) but there is one story I always like telling. Growing up my mom always had these &quot;super intelligent&quot; (for dogs) Arabian hunting dogs. When I got my promised puppy I got a sled-dog mutt who, bless his heart, was as dumb as a door nail.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now one of those kind of mean, but not really, things we'd do basically once with each dog at some point was the peanut-butter-on-the-nose-trick. We'd only do it once because while funny and harmless we felt a little bad proving we were smarter than the dogs. After watching them try and lick the stuff off the top of their nose for 30 seconds we'd clean their nose off, give them a treat, never do it again, and all was forgiven. Well when we got my dog (the stupid one) we tried this stunt. He licked at the air once, realized that wouldn't work, made straight for the nearest couch (it happened to be a nice one) wiped the peanut butter off on the furniture and proceeded to lick the furniture clean.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yea, we stopped doing that one...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: This had me laughing aloud. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Brainerd, Minn.: Funny clip of Sarah Palin being interviewed by Marge Gunderson.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I've lived in Northern Minnesota for a good part of my life -- Palin has a Northern Minnesota accent, youbetcha!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">According to an article in Slate, a bunch o' Norskies from Minn-e-SO-ta were relocated to Palmer Alaska (near Wasilla) in the 1930's. This may explain the accent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This somehow reminds me of my favorite Dilbert cartoon, which I can't find.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">First frame: Pointy-haired boss tells Dilbert he's working with a new hire who graduated from Yale.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Second frame: Dilbert asks &quot;Sven&quot; (who's wearing an eye patch) about Yale.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Third frame: Sven says &quot;I yust got out last week&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(Had to be there, I reckon!)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I love that Gunderson interview, and the Dilbert. </span></p>
