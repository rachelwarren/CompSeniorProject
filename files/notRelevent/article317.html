  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ''candidate'' had just finished detailing her energy policy, trashing her opponents and predicting her victory.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> There was only one more obligatory thing to say.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I'm Paris Hilton and I approved this message,'' the celebrity heiress cooed, '' 'cause I think it's totally hot.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Political satire? To be sure. But like every other convention spun on its head by the amusing Internet spot Ms. Hilton created this summer to spoof the commercials by Senator John McCain that likened Senator Barack Obama to her, the humor comes from its similarity to reality.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Ms. Hilton's closer works because like hundreds of candidates for federal office, she did not just leave it at, ''I approved this message.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> That was, after all, the only thing the 2003 election reform law demanded: that politicians acknowledge in their own voices their responsibility for advertisements they run on public airwaves. But five years later, the ''I approved'' has become a pivotal device in commercials for Congress and the White House, a place for candidates to make a declaration of intent, summarize the message or take a parting shot. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, for instance, made it an important part of his first general-election advertisement in June, emphasizing his patriotism with, ''I approved this message because I'll never forget those values, and if I have the honor of taking the oath of office as president, it will be with a deep and abiding faith in the country I love.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> That's a mouthful, political observers say, and not as smooth a use of the legal disclaimer requirement as would be desired. The aim should be to make the disclaimer as seamless as possible because it already forces candidates to use precious seconds of expensive 30-second advertisements.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''You try to fit it in where it's the least distracting,'' said Eric Potholm, a Republican campaign strategist whose firm is creating commercials this year for Congressional candidates in Florida, Kansas and New Mexico. ''You don't want it to sound clunky. I tend to like to do it in the body of the ad or toward the end, something like, 'I approved this ad because I want to do a, b or c.' ''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Potholm and others called the requirement an albatross, a linguistically unappetizing time-waster especially when the candidate's voice is heard throughout the advertisement.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Still, there is no significant effort to curtail them; at least for this election cycle, they can be counted on to be even more constant in political advertisements than waving flags or, in negative commercials, foreboding music.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The intent of the law was twofold: to inform the public of who paid for the advertisement and to discourage candidates from slinging so much mud at one another. The first part has worked, said a Vanderbilt University political science professor, John Geer, but the level of political vitriol has not changed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''This reform was completely counterproductive,'' Mr. Geer said. ''Everybody complains about the sound bite as it is and here we took the ad and made it shorter. And it didn't work. The 2004 campaign was more negative than 2000 by far.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> What's more, the phrase is now a political cliche, as evidenced recently when ''Saturday Night Live'' spoofed it by having a Senator McCain doppelganger approving increasingly ridiculous attacks on Senator Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A University of New Hampshire rhetoric professor, James Farrell, was irked as far back as the 2004 Democratic primary campaign, the first time the disclaimers were required. Then, as now, he said, advertisement writers were coming up with awkward non sequiturs just to slip in something extra. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Farrell noted a current commercial for Representative Don Cazayoux, Democrat of Louisiana, in which the candidate said, ''I'm Don Cazayoux and I approved this message because that's who I'm fighting for.'' That, Mr. Farrell said, is ''an amphiboly, a logical confusion created by a grammatical ambiguity.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Of course, if asked, the candidate will say he means he's fighting for the middle class,'' said Mr. Farrell, of the spot's theme. ''However, one could easily conclude that the disclaimer addition refers to the candidate himself, as in, 'I'm Don and that's who I'm fighting for.' ''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Most candidates use the moment for a declaration. Former Gov. Mark Warner of Virginia approved a message in his current bid for Senate, ''because we cleaned up the mess in Virginia, and now it's time to clean up Washington.'' Senator Gordon H. Smith, Republican of Oregon, approved of ''working together across party lines -- and this ad.'' Dr. Victoria Wulsin, a Democrat challenging Representative Jean Schmidt, Republican of Ohio, approved one message ''because we've been fleeced enough.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Several candidates use the tag to reiterate buzzwords. The comedian Al Franken, running as a Democrat for a United States Senate seat from Minnesota, used the word ''serious'' in the disclaimer of two advertisements to emphasize his sincerity about public issues. In Alabama, a Republican Congressional candidate, Jay Love, used ''Christian'' in his disclaimers -- as in ''because I think Alabama could use some Christian, conservative Alabama values'' -- to appeal to Christian voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Sometimes candidates use the disclaimer to take a final dig, as Dr. Wulsin did. Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas tried this twice with a Republican rival, Mitt Romney, before the 2008 Iowa caucuses.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In one, he opened the advertisement with: ''I'm Mike Huckabee and I approved this message because Iowans have a right to know the truth about Mitt Romney's dishonest attacks on me and even an American hero, John McCain.'' In another, he said he approved the advertisement, ''because I believe most Americans want their next president to remind them of the guy they work with, not the guy who laid them off.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Similarly, Angie Paccione, a Democrat who in 2006 lost to Representative Marilyn Musgrave, Republican of Colorado, approved one commercial ''because if Marilyn keeps lying about my record, I'll keep telling the truth about hers.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''It was a way of saying, 'OK, if you're going to continue to say these things, we're going to fight back,' '' Ms. Paccione said in an interview. ''We knew we were taking a risk with it, but it was what I would say to her if I had seen her face to face. I had people stop me on the street and say, 'You go, girl.' ''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Political consultants frown on such an approach, preferring distance between the candidate and the harshest statements. Mark Putnam, whose firm writes advertisements for Democratic Senate candidates in Alaska and New Mexico this cycle, puts disclaimers in the beginning of critical commercials to create a separation between the attacks and the politicians making them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''The candidates shouldn't be the one to deliver the summation of a negative argument,'' Mr. Putnam said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Huckabee also used the disclaimer for humor. An advertisement titled ''Chuck Norris Approved,'' featured the actor declaring his support and closed with, ''I'm Mike Huckabee and I approved this message. So did Chuck.'' Mr. Norris is then seen shoving his fist into the camera.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Cazayoux, too, was whimsical in other commercials this year when he won an open seat in a special election. Those spots, created by Mr. Putnam, feature the candidate's parents and children making fun of him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I'm Don Cazayoux,'' he deadpans in one, ''and believe it or not, I approved this message.''</span></p>
