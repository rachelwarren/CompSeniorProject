  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The name William Ayers is perhaps more widely known today than it was when he helped found the Weather Underground four decades ago. Back then, there were only three television networks and no Internet or cable television to spread the word far and wide and over and over.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But now, you can hardly tune in (to TV) or turn on (your computer) without coming across a reference to Mr. Ayers, the 1960s radical who has said the Weathermen were responsible for a dozen bombings in the early '70s and had planned attacks on the Capitol and the Pentagon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Ayers's chief publicity machine these days is the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain, which has made Mr. Ayers a household name. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The McCain campaign brought him up all last week even as the Republican candidate slipped further behind his Democratic rival, Senator Barack Obama, in the polls.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain's running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, began last week by saying Mr. Obama was one to ''pal around with terrorists who targeted their own country.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And the McCain campaign released a new commercial on Friday that lumps Mr. Ayers into a dog's breakfast of negative buzz words: ''Obama's blind ambition. When convenient, he worked with terrorist Bill Ayers.'' It veers to a mention of ''risky'' subprime loans and almost begs the listener to link Mr. Ayers and Mr. Obama with the collapse of the housing market.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> With fewer than four weeks until the election, why is the McCain campaign so focused on Mr. Ayers?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain told ABC News in an interview broadcast Friday that Mr. Ayers was not just ''a guy in the neighborhood,'' as Mr. Obama has said, and that Mr. Obama had ''launched his political career'' in Mr. Ayers's living room. (Mr. Ayers held a gathering for Mr. Obama in 1995, one of several in which Mr. Obama discussed whether to run for office.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I don't care about two washed-up old terrorists that are unrepentant about trying to destroy America,'' Mr. McCain told ABC, referring to Mr. Ayers and his wife, Bernardine Dohrn, who was also a member of the Weather Underground. ''But I do care, and Americans should care, about his relationship with him and whether he's being truthful and candid about it.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain added, ''I don't care about Mr. Ayers, who on Sept. 11, 2001, said he wished he'd have bombed more.'' (Mr. Ayers said in an interview with The New York Times that was published on Sept. 11, 2001, ''I don't regret setting bombs,'' and added, ''I feel we didn't do enough.'' He later said he meant that he did not do enough to protest the Vietnam War.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In any case, it is clear that Mr. McCain thinks -- or hopes -- that the Ayers issue has traction, and some analysts agree that it might, at least with the Republican base and possibly with the dwindling number of undecided voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Darrell West, a political scientist at the Brookings Institution, said Mr. Ayers was a potent symbol.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Bill Ayers combines 9/11 and Willie Horton into one target,'' Mr. West said, referring to the convict in Massachusetts who was let out on a prison furlough and raped a woman and whose image was used against Michael Dukakis in his failed 1988 presidential campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. West added: ''Ayers represents someone who is far out of the mainstream and who endangered American security. So in the age of terrorism, he's a great symbol.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Robert J. Thompson, a professor of popular culture at Syracuse University, said Mr. McCain was trying to plant seeds of doubt about Mr. Obama's character and who he really is so that undecided voters would think he is ''risky.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''He's just hoping that if you throw enough doubts out there, one of them will find its way to the craw of an undecided voter,'' Mr. Thompson said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> This has been evident at McCain rallies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Who is Barack Obama?'' Mr. McCain asked at a recent rally in New Mexico. The answer came back: ''Terrorist!'' At another rally in Pennsylvania, someone shouted, ''He is a bomb!'' At yet another rally, a supporter called out, ''Off with his head!''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio, a Democrat, looked at the McCain tactic this way: ''The McCain-Palin campaign and some of their followers unfortunately want you to be afraid of Barack Obama.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And some people say they are. One man at a McCain rally on Friday said he was ''scared'' to raise a child under a President Obama. Mr. McCain pulled back, saying Mr. Obama was a decent man, only to be jeered by his own supporters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama himself has highlighted Mr. McCain's tone as a way of contrasting it with his own. ''It's easy to rile up a crowd by stoking anger and division,'' he said Friday. ''But that's not what we need right now in the United States. The times are too serious.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A McCain spokesman, Brian Rogers, instantly fired back, saying in a statement that ''Barack Obama's effort to silence and shame those who seek answers should make everyone wonder exactly what he is hiding.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Despite the McCain campaign's zeal for invoking Mr. Ayers, however, Mr. McCain himself did not bring him up at his debate with Mr. Obama on Tuesday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He may have been concerned about doing it face to face with Mr. Obama -- and did not want to provoke Mr. Obama into responding with a reference to Mr. McCain's own questionable ties to Charles Keating, of the savings and loan scandal (not a good reminder in a time of financial crisis).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Whatever the reason Mr. McCain did not bring up Mr. Ayers, that he continues to focus on him on the trail suggests that he thinks the name is energizing his base, those voters who are already committed to him, and perhaps those who are looking for a reason not to support Mr. Obama. And he wants to ensure they remain energized through Election Day.</span></p>
