  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Seeing is not always believing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill of PBS, my former Times colleague, who has a book centering on Barack Obama and other rising black political leaders due to come out on Inauguration Day, kept her cool when her impartiality was questioned as she was about to be the moderator of the Palin-Biden debate. Her reaction was expressed in these words: ''The proof is in the pudding. They can watch the debate.'' And sure enough, she played the moderating role commendably straight.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the ''pudding'' -- the debate -- was not what supplied the proof. Ifill, like most who use that ''old saying,'' shortened it in a way that leached out its historic meaning. The saying is not ''the proof is in the pudding,'' but ''the proof of the pudding is in the eating.'' Same thing, no? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">No. The first dispute over this saying is in its coinage. The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations says only that it dates from the ''early 14th century,'' and the backup provided me by Oxford's Jesse Sheidlower cites King Alisaunder around 1300 writing ''Jt is ywrite that every thing Hymself sheweth in the tastyng.'' (See? You can read Middle English. But no puddyng.) The Oxford English Dictionary cites William Camden's ''Remains Concerning Britain,'' dated 1605: ''All the proof of a pudding is in the eating.'' Bartlett's Quotations, 17th edition, however, cites Miguel de Cervantes's novel ''Don Quixote,'' first published that same year. That was a later English translation; Cervantes's phrase in the Spanish original means ''you will see it when you go to fry the eggs.'' I'll let these magisterial sources fight it out, but apparently this phrase, in more than one language, was in the air about four centuries ago, and all agree that in the eating was in the quotation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Why am I burdening you with this arcana? The proof, better defined as ''test,'' is not in the pudding, which could be delicious or fattening or themeless; rather, the judgment is in the mind of the person conducting the test -- in the eating. As Ifill concluded, ''Watch the debate'' and then it's up to you to decide what the test proves. That was her substitute for ''is in the eating.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In The Daily Telegraph of London in 2004, Michael Quinion of worldwidewords.org took on this tasty subject. ''The principal trouble with 'the proof is in the pudding' is that it makes no sense,'' Quinion, a leading British word maven, wrote. ''The full proverb is 'the proof of the pudding is in the eating' and the word 'proof' has the sense of 'test.' The proverb literally says that you won't know whether the food has been cooked properly until you try it. Or, putting it figuratively, don't assume that something is in order or believe what you are told, but judge the matter by testing it; it's much the same philosophy as 'seeing is believing.' ''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">See what you miss when you chop off the end of an adage? I will allude to the contrast of literally (''exact, verbatim'') and figuratively (''metaphorical, symbolic'') toward the end of this column, but first to Quinion's reference to the related seeing is believing. This was coined in 1609 by a student at Cambridge around the time Cervantes was writing ''al freir de los huevos lo vera,'' ''you will see it when you go to fry the eggs.'' The seeing-is-believing proverb was effectively undermined by a scene in the 1933 movie ''Duck Soup'' in which Chico Marx, disguised in bedclothes and a mustache as Groucho, demands of Margaret Dumont, ''Who you gonna believe, me or your own eyes?''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Verbal Tics</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A tic is a frequent minor muscular spasm, usually of the eyelid or cheek, sometimes accentuated at moments of tension.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A verbal tic is a word or phrase used frequently by a speaker who may be unconscious of its repetition but is noticed by the audience. It is a figurative tic, not a literal one.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain's tic was my friends, interjected into many of his ad-lib sentences. Alerted to its repetition in this space last month (and the history of the salutation's popularization by F.D.R.), he cut down on its overuse.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's tic was distraction, his word chosen to brush aside any criticism, which he also has reduced since the device was well remarked. As the days of campaigning dwindle down to a precious few, the refutation that springs most often to his lips begins with ''I've got news for'' (whomever, usually McCain), which has been magnified in his commercials to the point that McCain, in the campaign's second TV debate, used it himself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe Biden's tic is the adverb literally. After observation here and elsewhere of his undue reliance on the intensifier, he clapped his hand over his mouth -- figuratively speaking -- and has literally, if not radically, reduced its usage. (Biden's legendary verbosity recalls the self-mocking line of Hubert Humphrey, also a speaker who went on and on, who said, ''I'm like the little boy who learned how to spell 'banana' but never knew when to stop.'')</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sarah Palin's repeated Americanism does not qualify as a verbal tic because she uses it consciously, along with a deliberate, nonspasmodic wink. Now that it has been widely called to her attention, is she likely to continue to use it? ''You betcha!''</span></p>
