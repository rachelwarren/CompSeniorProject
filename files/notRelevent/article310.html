  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Washington Post associate editor Robert G. Kaiser was online Thursday, Oct. 2 at 10:30 p.m. ET to critique the performances of Sen. Joe Biden and Gov. Sarah Palin in their vice presidential debate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The transcript follows.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Good evening. I have to say at the outset, this was really fun. I love the fact that a political event could create real excitement. I certainly felt it tonight. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This debate followed three dreadful weeks for Sarah Palin -- she was not starting afresh here. So an important question is, did her performance tonight add gravitas to her public persona? Did she come out of this debate looking more like a political heavyweight than she did on CBS News over the last two weeks, and on Saturday Night Live? After this debate, does she look more like a plausible president? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Was it smart of her handlers to encourage her to call Obama na&Atilde;&macr;ve and dangerous by proposing to deal directly, diplomatically, with dictators? Does she sound like an expert judge of such matters? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">No doubt she reminded some of the people who were enthusiastic about her selection as McCain's running mate of what they liked about her. We saw again the feisty, smiling, engaging Sarah Palin tonight. She probably re-invigorated the Republican base. But did she make progress with the independents who, the polls indicate, turned sharply against her during September? I certainly don't know, and I eagerly await the evidence we'll get in the days ahead. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This was first of all Palin's night, her big test, and I hope you'll tell me how you think she did. But it was also a test of Joe Biden, famous for long-windedness, master of the gaffe on many previous occasions. I covered the Senate 30 years ago, when Biden was young and green, and I've watched him ever since. For me he had a good night tonight -- disciplined, on message, and effective in criticizing John McCain. He did show gravitas, I thought -- the benefit of three decades in the Senate. But, as always, my reactions are insignificant -- what were yours? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Philadelphia: Bob, the thing I noticed most with Gov. Palin was that her answers generally were acceptable, but she acted as though she was reading from a script, i.e. her answers often had nothing to do with the question she was asked, and she just recited talking points.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks for this. I welcome such comments from everyone, and will post as many as I can. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Minneapolis: Ms. Ifill was a terrible moderator -- her questions were not crisp, there was no follow-up, no control. The entire event made a mockery of the concept of a &quot;debate.&quot; Your thoughts?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: I think you're being too harsh, but I agree that she didn't have full control. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ottawa, Ontario: She was totally incoherent in those interviews. Tonight she was talking in sentences and sounding frightening faux-reasonable. What happened? Will her performance play to the &quot;heartland&quot;?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks for this. What happened, I think, was that she realized she could ignore questions and say what she had practiced saying, which she did. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I couldn't bear to watch...: Summary please? Thank you.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Biden and Palin Square Off On The Economy and Foreign Policy (washingtonpost.com, Oct. 2)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Read the story... </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Boston: Palin said nothing concrete. She couldn't produce any evidence and avoided answering questions that she struggled with. I think Biden won the debate hands down.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: I think this was a significant shortcoming in her performance. There were no real arguments from her, many assertions. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">London: Mr. Kaiser, I stayed up way past my bedtime to listen to this debate, and what I heard was not reassuring. I'm sure you know that Europe is appalled at the choice of Gov. Palin as Sen. McCain's running mate, and nothing she said tonight is going to change this view. I'm sure she's a lovely person who would make a lovely neighbor, but she's simply not qualified to be president. We still are having major problems with your re-election of the current president, but this would make things substantially worse. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks for staying up and sharing your sense of it. You will see, in my opening comment above, that I too wonder if she reassured people who already had doubts about her. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Bob, do you think Gwen was a little cowed by the early criticism that she was in the tank for Obama? So many of Biden and Palin's responses begged for follow-ups, but there was really nothing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: I know Gwen, who used to work at The Post, and I am confident she was not cowed. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Reston, Va.: Biden had the right touch -- not terribly dominant, but aggressive enough to deflect Palin's punches. What about his choke? Do you think this would be seen as favorable or unfavorable?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks. Lord knows how the choke played. I think it seemed very real. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gaithersburg, Md.: Answering questions as she felt like it -- dangerous strategy or brilliant spoiler? Will the voters buy into that kind of evasion?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Good question. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Grand Rapids, Mich.: To me, Sarah Palin was blah. Talking points, no real substance -- very disappointing. I ended up liking Biden, which was pretty shocking. He seemed pretty straight.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bethesda, Md.: This says more about me than about the debaters, but I'm a little disappointed that I thought they both did fine. No major gaffes or blunders. Sen. Biden stuck to the point more than usual. I don't think Gov. Palin changed many minds, but she didn't come across as a fluffy airhead the way she did in the Couric interviews. Everyone who was waiting for something major now has to wait longer (this is not necessarily a bad thing).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: What does it say about you? That you're fair-minded? Not an egregious sin. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Athens, Ga.: I thought they both did well. I was impressed. Now, if only the presidential candidates were watching, and show the same passion and skill as these two. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Blairsville, Pa.: Did you get the feeling that Sarah Palin really didn't answer many of the questions she was asked? She danced around many questions and kept referring back to Alaska and energy, even if she wasn't asked anything that had to do with energy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Yes, if we read the transcript tomorrow, we will see how often Palin did her own thing, without being intimidated by the actual content of the questions. This is a tried and true debate tactic; candidates have used it for as long as we have had debates. Does it work? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Phoenix: I am a Republican, so please factor that into my comments. I just want to say that I am very, very proud of Sarah Palin tonight. After the tough couple of weeks that she's had, I thought it showed real guts to put in such a strong performance. She certainly removed any lingering doubts I had about voting for John McCain in November.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks for this. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Bob, do you think there was any kind of game-changer tonight, or did both sides do what they needed to do and that was it?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: No game-changer. I think it's important to recognize that the game has turned against McCain since the financial crisis burst upon us. His decision today to give up on Michigan was a very telling moment in this campaign, and an ominous sign, as The Fix has said already. I hope we can link to him here. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My sense is that Palin did not really &quot;do what she needed to do&quot; tonight, because I doubt that she managed to radically alter perceptions of her in this debate. But I could be wrong!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: The Fix: McCain's Move Out of Michigan, and What It Means (washingtonpost.com, Oct. 2) </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ottawa, Ontario: &quot;What happened, I think, was that she realized she could ignore questions and say what she had practiced saying, which she did.&quot; Actually, someone who debated her in Alaska said that's what she did there. ... What I'm wondering is if the, urk, Joe Six-Pack will see that or will buy the illusion of straight-talking. I guess we'll see...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Yes we will. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: As for the negatives: Biden seemed less energetic but progressively warmed up. Some of his responses were data-heavy. He did have some poignant statements, particularly when he spoke about his background/family and his connections with ordinary citizens.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: Transcript, please. I'd like a word count on Sarah Palin's use of &quot;also.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: We'll have a transcript -- interlaced with video clips and point-by-point analysis -- on the site tomorrow morning, at this Web page.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: I too look forward to the transcript. Here's where to find it -- in the morning. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sterling, Va.: My goodness, Palin's delivery is one big run-on sentence. Anyone have a count how many times she completed each statement with the word &quot;also&quot;? I'm embarrassed that a major political party thinks it can trot out someone so inexperienced.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Palin did not look like an idiot. Biden did not look like a condescending jerk. Hooray, everyone's a winner! I hate how completely scripted and practiced this entire thing has become. The president of the United States does not always get to practice for days to answer questions. I want to know how these people will act in a crisis, not how they will read the State of Union.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Good comment -- thanks. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liberty, Mo.: Who was Gov. Palin trying to attract through her references to Ronald Reagan? What do you make of her interpretation (flexibility) of the vice president's role? I am not a Palin supporter. I didn't hear much substance in her remarks this evening.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Reagan is an icon for Republicans -- not, interestingly, for others, according to polls now. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Atlanta: As a teacher, Gov. Palin's answers reminded me of one of the problems with No Child Left Behind. Some teachers will teach the answers to the test. It seems as though this was a test for her. She memorized answers, but it was for the wrong version of the standardized test. That did not seem to stop her from reciting the answers she memorized.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Pointed comment! Interesting, too. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chantilly, Va.: Meh. They both seemed to do okay, and they both mostly just played to their respective strengths. It is hard to see this changing the race in any significant way.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: I think you're right, and I think that's bad news for the Republicans. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Santa Rosa, Calif.: She's got moxie and confidence in spades -- I'll give her that -- but otherwise seems mostly bluster and bluff and not a lot of real substance based on lengthy experience. One thing I noted that was good: She looked directly at the camera as though addressing each of us. It appears Bidden picked up on this and followed suit -- good move.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks. Good observations, though it seemed to me that Biden was also looking at the camera a lot from the first minutes of the debate. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cedar Rapids, Iowa: I think Palin benefited from the format of the debate -- there was not much opportunity for follow-up questions. Her comment on the &quot;flexibility&quot; of the office of vice president was really frightening; I hope she is asked to elaborate on what she meant. Biden started out strong, but got a little emotional and negative at the end, which probably hurt him a little.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: We have a lot of good arm-chair pundits tonight. Thanks. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Plano, Texas: I was wondering if you noticed Biden's significant usage of the word &quot;I.&quot; I feel as if he came off as arrogant and condescending. Do you think that Obama and Biden's main downfall is Biden's ego? Thanks for your thoughts!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Anyone running for president or vice president has a huge ego -- this is one of the key lessons I have taken from my 45 years in the newspaper business and watching these people run. I don't think there's any &quot;downfall&quot; here. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: As an Obama supporter, I was relieved at Biden's performance tonight -- he was disciplined, serious and human. I was grudgingly impressed with Gov, Palin. Win or lose in November, she has a future in national Republican politics.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hamburg, Wis.: Biden looked like a tired, old man.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: I think Biden and I are almost exactly the same age, so I am going to withhold any comment on this one. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anonymous: Mr. Kaiser: If Iran or North Korea ratchets up the conflict and Palin doesn't know the answer, she can't decide not to deal with the problem (answer the question) and say &quot;I know energy.&quot; Does ignoring debate questions mean she'll ignore future problems? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: No it does not. She had a very specific assignment from her handlers tonight: stay on message, mention McCain as often as possible, attack the Democratic ticket, and avoid any topic that makes you uncomfortable -- I'd bet those were key ingredients in her instructions. And I think she followed them. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: I am a Democrat, but I thought both candidates did well. They both attempted to and succeeded in addressing the concerns of their respective parties. What I can't get a sense of is which of the two candidates will appeal to independents. I would love to hear the opinion of that elusive group.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: CBS had a group of uncommitted voters, including a disproportionate number of people who said they had a slight preference for Obama-Biden, watching tonight with those gizmos that register their reactions. According to this group, Biden won the debate. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Vallejo, Calif.: The things Palin pushed hardest -- continued presence in Iraq, drilling our way out of the energy crisis -- are positions the voters already have decided aren't working. Too much of what she had to say was clearly scripted and often pulled out of a bag of answers like refrigerator magnets and stuck on the screen regardless of the question.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thank you, Vallejo. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McLean, Va.: First, I hated the format, which turned the first half of the debate into a muddled mess (&quot;I want to go back to the last question before I answer this one&quot;) and kept things at a pretty superficial level. I think Palin did fine if you didn't actually listen to her answers. I also think she'll get clobbered by Tina Fey this week on Saturday Night Live for the winks and the &quot;darn rights.&quot; I personally think it's a sad day for our democracy when people are impressed with a vice presidential candidate because they're spunky, decide not to answer the questions asked of them or plan to avoid &quot;the filter of the media.&quot; But maybe I just expect a little too much of our elected officials. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks for this. As today's good story on disquiet among voters about Palin made clear, a lot of people have higher expectations for their leaders. As you'll read here, our new poll shows that by 60 percent to 35 percent, Americans do not think she has the experience needed to be an effective president. Tina Fey had something to do with this, of course, but Palin herself had more to do with it, I suspect. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Skepticism of Palin Growing, Poll Finds (Post, Oct. 2) </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">San Diego: So who won? Drudgereport says 75 percent Palin; MSNBC says 78 percent Biden. Where's the middle ground?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: &quot;Winning&quot; is not a clearcut concept in these debates. Look at last Friday: the pundits seemed to share a strong consensus that the Obama-McCain debate was a tie; some thought McCain prevailed. But all the polling I've seen this week suggests that Obama not only won the debate but did his campaign a great deal of good (with help of course from the financial crisis) by his performance on Friday. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So, be patient. It will take a few days at least to get a clearer sense of 1) who won and more important 2) how big an impact the debate had. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">To repeat myself, the only big impact I think is possible here would be if Palin was able to substantially change that 60-35 conclusion that she isn't ready to be president. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Brisbane, Australia: I thought that Gov. Palin did very well in the debate by appealing to the emotional side of Americans. But is this enough? Was there any substance in her answers? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Appealing to the emotions is not enough, I suspect, but nor can I be certain that that's all she did. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Regina, Canada: How can Palin emphasize her so-called energy expertise while suggesting that you don't really need to know what caused climate change in order to fix it? Her answer to this issue, and to the few other issues that she actually did address, were wishy-washy -- and if boiled-down, empty. Biden was dry and fact/number/data-heavy as mentioned, and while most people won't understand every issue he touched on, at least he came across as being informed and knowledgeable. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If we have indeed entered an era where the average person can't be expected to understand all the issues facing the country, we need to at least be able to leave the big decisions to people who do. I think Biden comes across as someone who gets it, while Palin comes across as someone who barely understands the big issues any better than any other average American. Any hockey mom with a college education could have done as well with the coaching Palin's had.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks for an interesting comment. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Germantown, Md.: I got to know Sen. Biden better, and appreciated the chance. I thought Gov. Palin did far better on foreign policy questions than Tina Fey led me to believe she would; I'm sure the debate tactics contributed to that, but I thought she showed well. They both scored points with me with their economy answers. I have to say, I'm still undecided. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks for this. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: Wow! Gov. Palin had a remarkable debate -- honest, homespun (ooh, that is a big negative among those with gravitas, but I like it). I wish she were the presidential nominee and McCain the running mate. Oh well, far better than an angry old man (I am one, so I know one) as vice president and an inexperienced, say-anything-to-get-elected newbie. I would be totally comfortable with Gov. Palin as president after hearing this debate. She is likely to listen to advisers and take a reasoned approach to problems. Obama is likely to think he has all the answers (watch his debate performance) and run us off the road into disaster. Go Sarah!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: &quot;Wow!&quot; is right. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Weston, Conn.: Why is it that Gov Palin and Republicans believe that her experience in a state with a smaller population than Hartford, Conn., and no tough budget decisions, is relevant? Joe talking about family touched my heart -- that was the most real moment of the whole debate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thank you, Weston. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Toronto: I thought Biden was irked by the constant needling at his record, and talked a little fast, which undermined the gravitas factor. Palin seemed unusually polished early on, but had rather a weak finish, practically disappearing into rote script, especially considering the Biden choke-up. I was disappointed that Biden rarely responded to her, but instead focused on McCain; I've experienced a rare sense of schadenfreude in the past five weeks at the Republican ticket's expense and I was hoping that it would reach its zenith with this debate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Columbia, S.C.: Bravo, Sarah Palin&amp;#33 She was quite effective in showcasing Biden and Obama as Washington insiders and she and McCain as Washington reformers. Her &quot;say it ain't so, Joe&quot; made Biden look ineffective in trying to associate McCain with Bush. Actually, Biden looked as if he was quite charmed by her in the way he smiled at her.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: I bet you a dime that Biden practiced that smile all week long. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Puckeridge, England: To aid Sarah Palin: Experience in foreign affairs isn't really necessary. What did John McCain learn from all those trips abroad and all those meetings with foreigners? He still didn't know enough not to vote to go to invade iraq.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Hmmm.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For what it's worth: Watching the CNN coverage with their tracking of a handful of undecided voters, when Palin talked about Iraq and winning there, the line was dead flat. No response. When Biden talked about Obama having the only real plan for getting us out of Iraq, the responses went off the charts in a positive direction. I hope the pundits keep this in mind -- that much of the American public have given up on Iraq. They want out.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks. The CBS group reacted similarly. I think your point is an important one. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Portland, Ore.: What is your reaction to Palin's comment that she &quot;wasn't necessarily going to answer the questions in the way that Gwen or Sen. Biden wanted her to&quot;? I think there is something to be said for following the rules of a debate. While both vice presidential candidates seemed to stick to their time limits, only Biden seemed to truly answer the questions directly and with substance.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks for this. I too remarked on that answer, which was obviously a bit of preemptive defense. She and her handlers knew from the outset what she was supposed to say, and she planned to say it whether or not it answered Ifill's questions. Or so it seemed. And as I said earlier, this is hardly a new debate tactic. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bethesda, Md.: Did I hear correctly? Did she say the Constitution left room for interpretation of the vice president's role; that she did not disagree with Cheney's assertion that he was not necessarily part of the executive branch?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Yes you did. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Addison, Ill.: Haven't even the undecideds heard these talking points already? Was there anything that she said that was memorable as a game-changer? Any new points? Or have I just heard everything because I'm a news junky?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: As I said earlier, I saw nothing remotely like a game changer here tonight. But that's a lot to ask of a vice presidential debate. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dallas: I thought she was struggling mightily, but her ability to continue to spout those talking points covered it somewhat. I laughed when she messed up one of them, &quot;toxic mess on Main Street that is affecting Wall Street.&quot; And her reference to long-dead Civil War general McClellan was rather entertaining. But, as Maura Liason said it on Sunday (Fox News, no less), anything more than &quot;babbling incoherently&quot; for her was a success.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: You misunderstood McClellan, who is our general today in Afghanistan. No relation to Lincoln's McClellan I don't think. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I don't think I agree with Maura. Palin is in a deep hole now; most Americans don't think she is qualified to be president. To do well tonight she had to change that perception. As I've said, I don't know if she did that, but I tend to doubt it. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Seattle: As a woman, I think Biden handled his interactions with Palin really well and struck just the right tone -- not condescending, not overly cautious. The smile was genuine, I think! He spoke to her a long time after the debate, when the families were on stage -- I wonder what they talked about. She listened, but didn't engage as much as he did.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: I agree with you, and suspect that Obama and his inner circle are very relieved. Their guy did not fall into the many pitfalls that theoretically at least were in his path. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Madrid, Spain: It is incredible that we still do not have an answer from McCain or tonight from Palin about whether they will talk to the Spanish government if elected. It is scary what type of foreign policy will emerge from a McCain-Palin administration. If you cannot talk to a EU nation and a NATO member, how in the heck are you going to start using diplomacy with countries like Iran? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: In fairness, McCain has made it clear that he muffed that question and didn't mean to rule out meeting with your prime minister. But he couldn't come right out with a confession of error either. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fairfax, Va.: How hard do you think Biden was biting his tongue when Palin referred to the commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan as McClellan, instead of McKiernan -- not once, but twice?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Well, I just made the same mistake above! Sorry about that. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Florence, Mass.: I think Palin was a little too flip with her &quot;[aw shucks] we made some blunders in Iraq.&quot; Obviously, those blunders cost lives. Her folksiness can backfire on her if she isn't careful.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Scotland: She put me in mind of a female version of Peter Sellers in the movie &quot;Being There.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: I'd say that's most unfair. Sellers barely spoke a word in that part, if memory serves (and perhaps it doesn't, I should admit, but I'm pretty sure of this). She did not lack for words. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: Am I alone in finding it ominous that Gov. Plain was not able to cite a single occasion on which she fundamentally changed the way that she thought about an important issue?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Don't know how much company you have, but I have a powerful hunch that all we really learned from that answer is, it was a question that Palin's trainers had not anticipated, so she had nothing ready to use to answer it. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Boston: The aren't-I-adorable voice that Palin got whenever she started getting out of her depth was extremely annoying to me. Luckily, I was also watching CNN's gizmo lines and was happy to see the panel agreed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Nothing like finding your own views confirmed, is there? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Las Vegas: I'm dissapointed that Biden didn't mention that McCain wants to tax employees for insurance benefits paid by their employers. This is a huge tax for all working people at the same time McCain wants to give huge tax breaks for corporations and rich people. If he mentioned it, I apologize, but I did not catch it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Well he did mention it, in some detail. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">State College, Pa.: I'm a registered independent leaning toward Obama ... if I had any questions, this solidified it for me. Palin said both she and McCain are &quot;mavericks&quot; -- I don't think we need both the president and vice president shooting from the hip. I think that Biden showed that Obama/Biden is a much safer choice -- especially when I have a 2-year-old boy whom I don't want to have to send to Iraq in 18 years&amp;#33</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Portland, Ore.: Did Sarah Palin really say to a guy whose first wife died in an accident that his second wife's &quot;reward is in heaven&quot;?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: I think she was using an old saying about our underpaid teachers (like Jill Biden), whose rewards on this earth are rather paltry... </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">State College, Pa.: I think that they both did rather poorly. Biden made several blatant lies about Iraq and clean coal, but he had more &quot;real&quot; responses than Palin (I particularly liked his response about Pakistan). Both candidates, in my mind, spent too much time reiterating their stump speeches. I felt like I heard about an hour of fluff, and then 20-30 minutes of real interesting stuff. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Okay. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: As one who was hoping Gov. Palin would fall on her face (again), I have to note that she did all right, though her importuning appeals to the &quot;American people,&quot; as she kept saying, were equal parts bluster and folksy maneuvering. It pains me to realize that her folksiness probably plays well to many voters. As for me, I just wonder why she can't enunciate the &quot;g&quot; that ends her participles, and why she can't segment thoughts into sentences that begin and end.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.: I think one of the greatest failures of Palin's answers tonight was when asked if, with the change in the economy, there was anything that has been promised by the campaign that might need to be reconsidered. First off she tried to avoid the question, but wasn't allowed -- but to flat out say we wouldn't have to change anything is a dangerous answer. She could have talked about reprioritizing, etc. -- something aside from nothing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Given that that was Jim Lehrer's first question last Friday, I was surprised she didn't have an answer ready for it -- as Biden did. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cheshire, Conn.: Is it me or did Sarah Palin not understand what &quot;Achilles Heel&quot; means? Not your positive attributes, your negative ones.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: We have to check the transcript, but I had the same reaction you did. She also, I think, misunderstood Gwen's question about nuclear weapons. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Los Angeles: I have the feeling that a lot of people made up their minds in the past ten days, to the detriment of the McCain campaign. Palin didn't go down in flames, but her performance was still like a caricature of herself. She showed she can spew talking points, but not that she can think on her feet. Biden wins.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thank you. Interesting comment. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nashville, Tenn.: Palin held her own -- not a lot of substance, but then again I'd like the McCain strategy for change even if a monkey was preaching it. It's time for a change, and Biden's not it. I'll take real-life experience and common sense over political experience any day. It's time to take the politicians out of politics and put in people who know what they're doing (or at least know how to find and ask people who do).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Pardon me if this seems rude -- I of course don't know you from Adam or Eve. But this kind of remark drives me crazy. Why should politics not be practiced by politicians? Why should we think that &quot;political experience&quot; is a bad thing for a politician to have? Thomas Jefferson and George Washington were politicians; Abe Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt were too. This is a fact; governments are run by politicians. If they hadn't had extensive political experience, our country would in all likelihood not be anything like what it is today. Or so it seems to me. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Flower Mound, Texas: Do you think the greatest success for both of them was in following the first rule of &quot;first, do no harm&quot;?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Yes, but as indicated above, I think Palin had to do a lot more than that to help her ticket tonight. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anonymous: How many questions are you receiving tonight?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: About 600 so far.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Here's the answer from my estimable producer Chris Hopkins. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chicago: I'm one of those students watching for extra credit that Palin spoke of. Palin spent the majority of the time defending McCain (rather than on the offensive side) and evading questions. This is a matter of business, and she didn't provide viewers with anything substantial. She may be feisty, but I wouldn't call her the pitbull America needs to run the country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks. Hope you get an A. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kansas City, Kan.: My elementary school boys (who have signed up for a debate club and watched the debate) were shocked and dismayed at Sarah Palin's use of colloquial slang &quot;darn it,&quot; &quot;doggone it,&quot; &quot;heck&quot; (these are words they are taught not to use even in regular speech)&amp;#33 I am left with an image of her rolling her eyes and saying &quot;there you go again, Putin.&quot; Eye-rolling is considered rude by most families I know, and it saddens me that this kind of behavior is legitimized in a national debate. I fail to understand how her unprofessional demeanor passes for good style.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: What an interesting comment. Thank you for it. You remind us all how diverse a country we live in. Obviously, the McCain aides prepping Palin tonight told her to do just what annoyed you. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Los Angeles: My guess is that Palin's quip about teachers' reward being in heaven will be featured in an Obama&nbsp;ad pointing out that improving our education system starts with rewarding teachers better here on Earth.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Thanks. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arnold, Md.: Some noticed, as I did, that Palin occasionally referred to her notes; however Biden did about the same amount of note-reading.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: Under the rules, I believe, neither could bring notes into the debate, so the notes referred to were made while it was going on. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cartersville, Ga.: Bob, I have been glancing at several of the large newspapers and their stories. Most of them mention that Palin seemed to hold her own. However, when I read some of the online conversations like this one, it sounds as though people felt that she provided canned answers and/or didn't answer questions at all. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: I haven't been able to read the stories, but I refer again to the &quot;heavyweight&quot; evaluation of the McCain-Obama debate on Friday, which I thought was wrong then, and which I think polls now confirm was wrong. Obama won the debate and did himself a lot of good, though the stories called it a tie and a lot of pundits thought McCain won. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New Orleans: How could the moderator get Palin to actually answer the questions (really answer what she is asked)?!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert G. Kaiser: This will be the last one tonight. We'll be back next Tuesday for the next Obama-McCain encounter. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">These debates are seriously imperfect. Gwen had no good choices when the candidates wandered off the reservation. There was an agreement on &quot;five minute segments&quot;; I suspect it was violated more often than it was respected. But only by making a real pain in the neck of herself could she have &quot;forced&quot; answers to her questions, and that is simply not her style. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sometimes I wish we could import some of the BBC's splendid inquisitors to anchor a debate here. I nominate James Naughtie, my favorite, who is merciless when questioning British politicians on his Today show every morning on BBC radio. By comparison our media are a tribe of wimps -- polite wimps to be sure, but, well, less interesting. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Again, thanks for the good participation from all. Good night. </span></p>
