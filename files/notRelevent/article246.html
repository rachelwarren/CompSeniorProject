  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> AS FOCUS TURNS TO PIRATES,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Crisis in Somalia Worsens</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Somali pirates demanding millions of dollars for their hijacked ship full of weapons have grabbed the world's attention, but the slow-burn suffering of millions of Somalis seems to go almost unnoticed. Unemployment, drought, inflation, a squeeze on global food supplies and a war that will not end combine to push Somalia ever closer to the abyss in what United Nations officials have called ''the forgotten crisis.''

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PROTEST BY IRANIAN MERCHANTS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Merchants in traditional bazaars in several large cities in Iran closed their shops this week to protest a decision by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to enforce the nation's first sales tax. Bazaars are the backbone of the country's traditional economy, and still wield significant power. Some analysts said the driving issue behind the closings was really the worsening of the economy.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> TODAY'S EPISODE: THE OFFICE SEEKER</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Thomas King made his name as Tom King, the straight man in ''The Dead Dog Cafe Comedy Hour,'' a popular and long-running series of 15-minute radio programs he created and wrote. Now he is trying to trade that role for a seat in Canada's House of Commons. He reasoned that it was finally time to leave ''night shift politics'' for a more conventional political platform. PAGE A8</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CHRISTIANS FLEE IN WAKE OF KILLINGS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Hundreds of Christians are fleeing Mosul, Iraq, in the wake of a string of killings that appear to be singling out Christians in the city where many had taken refuge from persecution in other parts of the country. The shootings in Mosul come on the heels of an angry dispute over the Iraqi Parliament's decision to drop a provision in an earlier version of the provincial elections law that ensured political representation for Christians and other minorities. PAGE A10</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PARTIAL COMPLIANCE BY RUSSIA</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> European leaders confirmed that Russia had met a deadline to withdraw troops from buffer zones outside the breakaway enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, though the French foreign minister said Russia had only ''partially complied'' with a European-brokered peace accord. Georgia formally protested the continuing presence of Russian troops in two areas. PAGE A9</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> BOMBER HITS ANTI-TALIBAN MEETING</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A suicide bomber detonated a vehicle laden with explosives during a meeting of elders in Pakistan's tribal territories, killing more than 40 people and injuring more than 100. The attack came after elders in the Orakzai area had vowed to push Taliban extremists out of their region, and were planning the details of how to wipe out a Taliban headquarters.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Obama to Controversial Group</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Senator John McCain's presidential campaign stepped up its efforts to tie Senator Barack Obama to a community organizing group that has been accused of involvement in problematic voter registrations in several hotly contested states, including Colorado, Indiana, Nevada and North Carolina. The Obama campaign described the charges as a spurious attempt to tie Senator Obama to potentially fraudulent voter registrations. PAGE A13</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> BOARD RULES FOR SUICIDE BARRIER</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> After decades of debate -- and unknown numbers of lost lives -- the board that controls the Golden Gate Bridge took a major step toward building a suicide barrier, voting to erect a net under the span. The current plan still must pass an environmental review and also needs funding. But despite that lingering uncertainty, supporters of the plan hailed the board's decision. PAGE A11</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> RESTORING CITY'S BELOVED CEMETERY</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> For 158 years, Atlantans have congregated in Historic Oakland Cemetery for picnics, battles, weddings and, of course, funerals. But even proud old Oakland could not withstand the tornado that battered downtown Atlanta in March, crushing trees, decapitating stone angels that guarded family memorials and toppling gravestones. And in a city famous for rising from ashes, Oakland is working hard to recover. PAGE A11</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> MARS ROVER'S MISSION IS A GO</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Despite another overrun that could push its cost to more than $2 billion, NASA's next generation Mars rover mission remains on track for launching next fall, NASA officials said. Because of delays in some components like motors to move the rover's joints, additional staffing and resources were needed to keep the project on schedule, said the director of the Mars Exploration Program.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE UNSEEN RESIDENTS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Of Yankee Stadium and Shea</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It has all been quite private and on the sly; the Yankees and Mets have never officially permitted the ashes of the departed to be scattered in their stadiums. But the fact is, when demolition crews start their work on the House That Ruth Built and Shea Stadium, they will be dealing with the ghosts of more than just former players like Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio. There are fans like Ned Marvin. PAGE A17</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> REPUBLICAN STRONGHOLDS TURNING</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Some longtime Republican strongholds in New York are becoming increasingly Democratic, a change driven by demographic shifts, intense voter registration and sagging Republican fortunes. The state as a whole has grown steadily more Democratic in recent years, but now Republicans are falling behind even in places like Long Island, where Nassau County -- once home to the most formidable Republican machine in the country -- reported this week, for the first time in its history, having more registered Democrats than Republicans.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A FORMER STAR-TO-BE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Now Faces Twin Challenges</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When his former team, No. 3 Louisiana State, plays No. 11 Florida in front of 92,000 fans and a national television audience Saturday night in Gainesville, Fla. Ryan Perrilloux will be in Richmond, Ky., playing for Jacksonville State against Eastern Kentucky. That's because Perrilloux miscalculated once too often with Coach Les Miles of L.S.U. and found himself an ex-Tiger. Now he faces the twin challenges of redemption and reckoning. PAGE D5 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> FULL-TIME PART-TIMER</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Alex Cora's job -- he prefers the term ''utility player'' -- requires persistence and perseverance. He prepares every day as if he were a starter for the Boston Red Sox, even though he rarely is. In some respects, he is a victim of his own talent: he is adept at playing intermittently, not an easy role to fill. Cora hit .270 in 152 at-bats spread over 75 games. Among A.L. shortstops with at least 150 at-bats, Cora ranked first with a .371 on-base percentage. More than anything, Cora is a slick defensive player, a must for a reserve infielder.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A POSSIBLE GOOD SIGN FOR BONDS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Tammy Thomas, the former elite cyclist who was convicted in April of making false statements to a grand jury in connection with the Balco investigation, will not serve time in prison. That could be an encouraging sign for the former Giants slugger Barry Bonds, who faces similar charges. Thomas was sentenced to six months' house arrest and five years' probation. Her case had been closely watched by lawyers for Bonds. PAGE D6 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As Global Crisis Draws Nearer</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Japan, with the world's second-largest economy, had seemed enviably immune from the global financial contagion; its cash-rich banks held little of the subprime debt that contaminated the books of financial institutions in the United States and Europe. But the country is suddenly feeling a lot more vulnerable to the global turmoil, which in recent days has finally begun to show signs of damaging the nation's $5 trillion economy. PAGE B4</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> FOREIGN DEPOSITORS PETITION ICELAND</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The words being exchanged between London and Reykjavik are the most bellicose since the so-called cod wars over fishing rights in the 1970s. Britain is trying to recover deposits stranded in Icelandic banks that failed in the last two weeks. And it is not the only claimant: across Europe, countries, companies and consumers are scouring their portfolios and discovering exposure to the three main Icelandic banks, all of which have been taken over by the government.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> FEAR AS A JOB SEARCH HURDLE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Networking in a job search brings up many of the same fears as dating -- of rejection, of looking like an idiot, of overstepping boundaries, of failing. And even if you can overcome those anxieties, you have to know how to do it right. ''Networking needs to be planned and learned,'' said one career services director. PAGE B6</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I'LL TAKE WHAT HE'S HAVING</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warren Buffett got rich using uncommon common sense: investing only in businesses he understands, buying shares when they were cheap and holding them for a very long time. For small investors lacking the time, discipline, guts -- and clout -- to follow his method at a time like this, one approach is either to buy what he buys or else buy a piece of his corporate alter-ego, Berkshire Hathaway.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> YOUTUBE GOING LONG</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> YouTube plans to start offering full-length episodes of some television shows on its sprawling Web site, catching up with other Web sites that have promoted long-form video for some time. The longer videos will include advertising before, during and after each episode. Google, YouTube's owner, is under pressure to raise more revenue from the nearly four-year-old video-sharing site.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> With ad pages plummeting across the industry, Hearst announced that it was shutting the teenagers' magazine CosmoGirl. The December issue will be the magazine's last. After that, subscribers will receive Seventeen, another Hearst magazine. The company will continue to run the profitable Web site CosmoGirl.com.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> James Bamford's first book on the National Security Agency in 1982 earned him the threat of prosecution. His second, in 2001, got him a book party hosted by agency officials. In 2005 he joined a lawsuit accusing the agency of breaking the law. Now he has a third book, ''The Shadow Factory: The Ultra-Secret NSA from 9/11 to the Eavesdropping on America,'' due out on Tuesday. He is not expecting another party. PAGE C1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PALIN VIDEOS LIFT COURIC</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The three most popular YouTube videos of Katie Couric's interviews with Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska have been watched far more than similar interviews by other anchors. The segments have reasserted Ms. Couric's role as an anchor and may provide a template for the future, tapping into the Web as a neon road sign directing traffic to CBS broadcasts, and perhaps, eventually, as a destination itself.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> REHAB IN THE KITCHEN</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> There is no competition for a single winning spot on ''The Chef Jeff Project,'' a new reality series beginning Sunday on the Food Network. The six participants are working with Jeff Henderson, a former drug dealer who spent his 10 years in prison before working his way to snazzy chef posts. And their lives have been no barrel of laughs, either. PAGE C11</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> BOOK REVIEW</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Goldman Sachs has found itself alone on Wall Street, remaining profitable as its former peers in investment banking either merged or evaporated during the financial crisis. Charles D. Ellis, the author of ''The Partnership,'' an immense history of Goldman Sachs, would suggest that this is not an accident. PAGE 19</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> TRAVEL</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> New York has a way of reminding everyone from hourly wage strivers to uptown trust-funders that it is always possible to have more, and to spend more. But big-ticket amusements often obscure the city's more enjoyable corners. New York on a budget of $250 a day. PAGE 1 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gradually, and without getting much media attention, AC/DC has become the most popular currently active rock band in the country, to judge by albums sold. And with its new album, ''Black Ice,'' increased visibility for the band's catalog at Wal-Mart and a tour that starts Oct. 28, it's possible AC/DC could sell more CDs overall this year than any other act in pop music.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SUNDAY STYLES</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A Massachusetts woman dreams she is grilling Nancy Pelosi on the economy. A songwriter wakes up in the middle of the night to check on the Asian markets. A Brooklyn accountant is mortified when her five-year-old says ''I'm John McCain, and I approve this message.'' Red flags for obsession, perhaps. But there's so much news, and it's increasingly easy to plug in. PAGE 1</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I miss August. August was neat. The Dow was over 10,000 and nobody had ever heard of Sarah Palin. In August, female politicians were afraid of going negative because it might make them look too strident. Amazing, the things you wind up being nostalgic for. page A23</span></p>
