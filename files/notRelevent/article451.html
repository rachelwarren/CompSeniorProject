  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">EARLIER this month I was flying home to Los Angeles from the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, which I attended as a pundit, not a politician. Sitting next to me on the flight was a charming young man named Tom Morello. Ruthless questioning elicited the fact that he is the lead guitar for a fabulously successful band called Rage Against the Machine. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> This band sings about inequality and oppression in the world, mostly, as far as I can tell, in the Western world, and, these days, mostly in George W. Bush's world. In the process, all of the band members have become well-heeled indeed. Raging against the machine -- which I am morally certain is done by the band with utmost sincerity -- pays well sometimes. I must add that Mr. Morello is a gentleman and amazingly talented and that I would be happy if I had his composure. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But as I pondered this band's act, my brain turned to the presidential campaign. In particular, I was struck by how angry both sides are at ''Washington.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I am not certain what they mean by Washington. The city itself has terrible humidity and awful traffic, but that's clearly not what they are talking about. I think they mean the way government does business, and here I am puzzled by both sides' anger, but especially by Senator John McCain's.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> First, there's the endless complaining about waste, fraud and abuse in Washington. I have been following politics since I was 7, when Dwight D. Eisenhower first ran against Adlai Stevenson. In that election and all those after, and probably long before, all candidates told us how there was a lot of waste, fraud and abuse, and that they would find it and rip it out root and branch, and that the government would then run cleanly and thriftily.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Somehow, it never happens. There always seems to be more waste, fraud and abuse to complain about. And if my poor old memory doesn't fail me, the endless investigations of waste, fraud and abuse turn up pretty small potatoes in a federal budget approximating $2.4 trillion. And even if earmarks were totally wasteful, I read that they totaled $18 billion last year. Not pennies, for sure, but a tiny blemish on a federal budget roughly 150 times that sum.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Besides, what one person calls waste -- say, an urban economist talking about ethanol subsidies -- is, in the eyes of an Iowa corn farmer, basic salvation of our energy independence. What another person calls waste -- an enormously expensive new fighter bomber -- is a defense of freedom to another equally patriotic American. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It's sometimes awfully hard to define waste. It's largely subjective. And as far as I can tell, it's either not a huge number, or it is so deeply woven into the fabric of government that it cannot be determined. So maybe we should not pay much attention when Senator Barack Obama tells us that he will read every line of the federal budget, which contains thousands upon thousands of lines, and extirpate the projects that are wasteful. (How could he find the time? How would he know on a reading which were wasteful? )</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Maybe we shouldn't pay much mind when Senator McCain promises to embarrass legislators who want pork for their districts. I imagine that he may want to have a few friends on the Hill, and I notice a lot of new highways in Arizona on my frequent trips there.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Then there is that aspect of the war against Washington in which candidates -- very often, my fellow Republicans -- rage against the machine of regulation. Indeed, this is a constant refrain of the conservatives I call my pals. Regulation is stifling growth and entrepreneurship, they say.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> With respect, I don't see it. Look at the major debacles in the economy in the past quarter-century. The junk-bond scandal of the 1980s was largely a result of a failure of regulation. The tech boom of the 1990s and the subsequent bust were greatly facilitated by a lack of regulation over fiduciary behavior by underwriters and investment banks. The problem was not too much regulation, but far too little.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> OR look at the current financial madness caused by wildly imprudent lending by major banks and investment banks. Basically, a major piece of deregulation, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, overturned most of the laws that had kept commercial banks and investment banks separate. This made it much easier for monster-size banks to lay down enormous bets on the direction of housing prices. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When these bets turned out to be wrong, the losses to the banks and their stockholders were staggering. (Naturally, those who approved these wagers left, if they left at all, with monster-size severance. You and I will pick up the monster-size bill in many different ways.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> My point is that Washington -- that is, the federal government -- is not really to blame for all of our current problems. (One glaring exception is the war in Iraq.) Or, to put a finer point upon it, in some ways Washington was not doing too much, but should have been doing more -- meaning more regulation and more prosecution.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I know that it's all just politics and that politicians will say a lot to be elected. But it's good to know the truth, too. The government is just a lot of men and women. Most of them are working hard, trying to do their best and not stealing anything. Most are modestly paid, and sometimes they wear uniforms, carrying M-4s and risking their lives for us. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Washington is not the problem. Human nature is the problem, and that's going to be a tough nut to crack. That's the machine to rage against. </span></p>
