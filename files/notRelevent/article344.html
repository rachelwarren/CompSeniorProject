  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Two weeks ago, Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign gleefully publicized a spate of news reports about misleading and untruthful statements in the advertisements of his rival, Senator John McCain. Asked by a voter in New Hampshire if he would respond in kind, Mr. Obama said, ''I just have a different philosophy, I'm going to respond with the truth,'' adding, ''I'm not going to start making up lies about John McCain.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Yet as Mr. McCain's misleading advertisements became fodder on shows like ''The View'' and ''Saturday Night Live,'' Mr. Obama began his own run of advertisements on radio and television that have matched the dubious nature of Mr. McCain's more questionable spots. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A radio advertisement running in Wisconsin and other contested states misleadingly reports that Mr. McCain ''has stood in the way of'' federal financing for stem cell research; Mr. McCain did once oppose such federally supported research but broke with President Bush to consistently support it starting in 2001 (his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, does not support it). </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A commercial running here on Thursday morning highlighting Mr. McCain's votes against incentives for alternative energy misleadingly asserts he supports tax breaks for ''one source of energy: oil companies.'' Mr. McCain's proposed corporate tax break would cover all companies, including those developing new sources of power.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A new television advertisement playing in areas with high concentrations of elderly voters and emphasizing Mr. McCain's support for President Bush's failed plan for private Social Security accounts misleadingly implies Mr. McCain supported ''cutting benefits in half'' -- an analysis of Mr. Bush's plan that would have applied to upper-income Americans retiring in the year 2075. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A much criticized Spanish-language television advertisement wrongly links the views of Mr. McCain, who was a champion of the sweeping immigration overhaul pushed by Mr. Bush, to those of Rush Limbaugh, a harsh critic of the approach, and, frequently, of Mr. McCain. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The advertisement implies Mr. Limbaugh is one of Mr. McCain's ''Republican friends,'' and quotes Mr. Limbaugh as calling Mexicans ''stupid and unqualified.'' Mr. Limbaugh has written that his quotes were taken out of context and that he was mocking the views of others. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In all, Mr. Obama has released at least five commercials that have been criticized as misleading or untruthful against Mr. McCain's positions in the past two weeks. Mr. Obama drew complaints from many of the independent fact-checking groups and editorial writers who just two weeks ago were criticizing Mr. McCain for producing a large share of this year's untruthful spots (''Pants on Fire,'' the fact-checking Web site PolitiFact.com wrote of Mr. Obama's advertisement invoking Mr. Limbaugh; ''False!'' FactCheck.org said of his commercial on Social Security.) </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Some Democrats expressed concern that Mr. Obama, in stretching the truth in some of his advertisements, was putting at risk the ''above politics'' persona he has tried to cultivate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I do think there is a risk,'' said Joe Trippi, a longtime Democratic strategist. ''The risk is that they seem to be different, that the appeal for Obama is 'it's not the same old politics.' ''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Nevertheless, Mr. Trippi described the advertisements as ''an eye for an eye.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And other Democrats shrugged off the questionable advertisements, saying they were relieved Mr. Obama was responding to continuing, frequently misleading assaults from Mr. McCain. They did not distinguish between advertisements that are tough on Mr. McCain and those that are misleading.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Some Democrats argued that Mr. Obama had yet to produce spots along the lines of two from Mr. McCain that drew criticism two weeks ago: One that wrongly asserted Mr. Obama supported comprehensive sex education for kindergartners and another, created only for the Internet, that incorrectly asserted that Mr. Obama had been referring to Ms. Palin when he said of Mr. McCain's new message of change, ''You can put lipstick on a pig; it's still a pig.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''All's fair in love, war and politics,'' said Chris Lehane, a Democratic strategist who was Vice President Al Gore's press secretary in 2000. ''Given the fact that the other side has come after him for quite some time, he has every right to fight back, and I think people understand that.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Mr. Obama, said the campaign stood by its advertisements.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Our ads discuss serious differences on critical issues like stem cell research, Social Security and energy policy,'' Mr. Vietor said. ''John McCain's ads are about Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, and have been called some of the most frivolous and dishonest ads in campaign history.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for Mr. McCain, said, ''It's bad enough that Barack Obama fictionalizes his own record, but it is a disgrace that he lies about John McCain's.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The disputed spots from Mr. Obama coincide with a significantly increased advertising push by his campaign and the Democratic National Committee that has taken a decidedly negative tone in the past few weeks, perhaps reflecting the natural progression of a tight campaign. CMAG, a group that tracks political advertising, said Thursday that the $10 million Mr. Obama had spent over the previous week on advertisements represented a nearly $4 million increase from the week before.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The increased advertising push has been accompanied by a campaign by the Democratic National Committee featuring an emotional advertisement shown on African-American-oriented programs meant to encourage blacks to register to vote. It opens with violent images from the civil rights era of black marchers being attacked with power hoses and the words, ''Thousands died so you could vote,'' the advertisement states. The advertisement was not publicly announced by the party.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Some of the advertisements that have drawn criticism were similarly started without fanfare. Mr. Obama's campaign did not announce it was running its new radio spot that said Mr. McCain ''has stood in the way, he's opposed stem cell research.'' That ad concluded, ''John McCain doesn't understand that medical research benefiting millions shouldn't be held hostage by the political views of a few.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The radio advertisement correctly asserts that Mr. McCain's running mate, Ms. Palin, is against the use of federal funds for stem cell research. But since 2001, Mr. McCain has consistently supported the financing. Last year, he voted for the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, which Mr. Bush vetoed, and in 2004 signed a letter to the president with 57 other senators, urging him to change his policy on stem cell research. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The campaign has said Ms. Palin will defer to Mr. McCain on the matter should they win the White House.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As backup for the advertisement's implication that Mr. McCain is against stem cell research financing, Mr. Vietor of the Obama campaign pointed to a recent report in The Los Angeles Times that Mr. McCain had told evangelical leaders he was open to learning more about their concerns, though the article stated, ''McCain did not offer any indication he would change his mind.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The stem cell advertisement hit the airwaves around the same time Mr. Obama released his Spanish-language commercial about Mr. Limbaugh. Bill Adair, the editor of PolitiFact, the fact-checking Web site of The St. Petersburg Times and Congressional Quarterly, said that until last week, the McCain campaign was more frequently guilty of including the most egregious falsehoods in its advertisements. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But the advertisement with Mr. Limbaugh, he said, prompted PolitiFact to deliver its worst rating, ''Pants on Fire,'' to Mr. Obama for the first time (as opposed to six times for Mr. McCain). The ''Pants on Fire'' rating is defined as, ''not just false, but ridiculously false,'' Mr. Adair said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I think the Obama campaign in the last two weeks has been very aggressive with its advertising,'' Mr. Adair said. ''And ads like the stem cell ad and the Spanish-language ad are just not accurate.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama has been previously challenged over falsehoods or misleading statements in his advertisements. For instance, the campaign has frequently been criticized for implying that Mr. McCain has singled out ''big oil'' as the sole recipient of his broad, corporate tax cut. Mr. Obama does it again in his latest spot, in which the announcer says he ''does support tax breaks for one source of energy: Oil Companies.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Vietor said the assertion was technically true.</span></p>
