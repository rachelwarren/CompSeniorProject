  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Last month, the Sunday Source section invited readers to compose original songs about their pets, record themselves singing them and send in the videos. Dozens of people did so, using guitars, dulcimers, and pink wigs to pay tribute to the beloved dogs, cats, and rats in their lives.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sunday Source's Joe Heim and Dan Zak, along with contest judge and classical music critic Anne Midgette, were online Monday, October 20 to discuss the results of Sunday Source's inaugural Pet Songs contest.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Click here to see all six finalists' videos and vote for YOUR favorite!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A transcript follows. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: Welcome to this chat. Despite its ridiculousness, it will be more entertaining than your only other chat option in the 1 o'clock hour (&quot;Waterborne Diseases&quot;? Really? Who wants to chat about sewage overflow during lunch?). If you haven't already, please take a moment to view the Pet Song videos. I have a favorite: &quot;Bones,&quot; all the way. That song is boss. Now let's have a really controversial discussion about SINGING TO YOUR PET.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For the critics ...: Your comments were tongue-in-cheek, right? You weren't REALLY trying to &quot;review&quot; these, right? Just looking for the silly song you liked best?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne Midgette: Well, this represented a rare chance for a classical music critic. I usually only get to review animals in music when a stage director puts a horse on stage at the Metropolitan Opera. And I missed the night when a dog began singing along with Renee Fleming in &quot;Manon&quot; (subsequently immortalized in the children's book &quot;The Dog Who Sang at the Opera&quot;). So obviously I wanted to make the most of this opportunity.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As to my degree of seriousness, I would say that my comments stood in the same relation to serious music criticism as the entries did to MTV videos.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Which is to say, my remarks were just as tongue-in-cheek as the songs were. You decide.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McLean, Va.: How many submissions did you get in all? And how bad were the ones you didn't include?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: We got maybe 20-something submissions -- way more than we expected. None of them were horrifying, although some definitely tended toward the pathetic. But pathetic in a good way, you know? I mean, what do you expect when you ask a nation of cat people to send in home videos?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: Individually, which would you say are your favorites? Outside of the group staff or critics' picks?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe Heim: I think Georgia was the sweetest and Mr. Scrappers the most entertaining. But Bones has a delicious edge, so that's probably my favorite.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: There's something to like about each. The dulcimer in Rat Song, the sweetness of Georgia and Sami Cat, the production value of Rescue Dog, the lyrical inventiveness of Bones, the insanity of Scrappers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Singing Dog: Our family had a dog (that actually looked a lot like Bo Bo) that used to howl along ONLY when we sang Happy Birthday. Weird, huh?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe Heim: It probably had some unpleasant associations with birthdays. Aging seven years every year can't be easy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Atlanta, Ga.:&quot;Georgia&quot; isn't doing very well in the votes, but I can say it was the one that stuck in my head the most. And it's so sweet! I liked that the videos ran the gamut from silly to sincere.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: I've been singing &quot;Sami Cat&quot; for a solid month now. The melody just sticks in your brain. Very sweet. And Georgia isn't getting votes because it lacks the flash of Scrappers and Rescue Dog Rock. Georgia is almost too sincere and wistful to be the crowd favorite. But we're glad you like it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne Midgette:&quot;Georgia&quot; certainly grew on me on a second hearing. I think its straightforward production values perhaps masked its musical charms; I give this points as a diamond in the rough.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anonymous: Mr. Scrappers is hilarious! But Georgia is the best musically; great voice and guitar playing. I loved watching these. I love that people take the time to do stuff like this!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe Heim: We love that people take the time to do this too. There are lots of talented readers out there. For our next contest we may ask readers to compose and recite an epic poem on video. Must be at least 45 minutes long. That should get page views.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne Midgette: I see the makings of an annual competition here. It is but a short step from here to a &quot;Capitol Pet Song Video Festival&quot; on the Mall.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: Maybe we could do a contest of people singing about Peeps?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: I hate you. I have been singing &quot;Mr. Scrappers, you're a good boy ...&quot; for two days now.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe Heim: Don't hate us. Hate Randy Scope. He wrote the song.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: Or hate Mr. Scrappers. I get the feeling he's a snooty dog.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington DC: In your estimation, which of these dogs could have a chance on the hit TV show &quot;America's Greatest Dog&quot;?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne Midgette: This is impossible to answer, on the grounds that &quot;Rescue Dogs&quot; alone presented far too many candidates to evaluate in a mere 60 seconds.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But I suspect that popular opinion would lean toward Mr. Scrappers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: If destroying mail were a prerequisite to winning America's Greatest Dog, then Scrappers would definitely win.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hmmm: Gee... thanks so much for captioning the videos so that those of us with a hearing loss could enjoy them too! Please note the sarcasm here...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: Noted for next year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rats!: Mr. Scrappers is good but you can't beat the whimsy of &quot;We've got three rats.&quot; Rats are cool but much maligned and this song is an anthem for rats.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne Midgette: I was also inclined to give &quot;We've got three rats&quot; points for originality on the grounds that all the other videos I saw were cat- and dog-centric. I don't know whether to infer from this that lizard, ferret, fish or parrot owners are somehow less vocal in their admiration for their animal companions or that their videos just didn't make the final cut.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: We didn't get any lizards, ferrets, fish or parrots. The rats were by far the most exotic of the animals. The rest were cats and dogs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne Midgette: And this on a day when Book World devoted two whole pages to reviews of books about parrots.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">D.C.: Why were critics even brought into the process? Don't you think you marginalized the Source staff by doing so?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: The Source staff loves being marginalized. It's a fetish.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Actually, the staff was in charge of narrowing the field down to six finalists. So we did have a say. But we though it would be funny to have the Post's heretofore serious critics look at these videos with the same eye/ear they'd use to assess Dylan, Scorsese or Ivan Fischer interpreting Mahler.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne Midgette: After all, the Source staff picked one favorite. And we critics, acting in the time-honored contrarian spirit of our breed, picked a different favorite. (Voting was, of course, anonymous.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne Midgette: I should add that I'm a little worried about that &quot;heretofore serious&quot; comment. (Perhaps this implies that criticism is now going to the dogs?)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rescue Dog respect: This is a wonderful contest. I voted for Mr. Scrappers, no contest there, but would have chosen the rescue dogs as No. 2. The video is a little over the top (pink boas? c'mon!) but leaps with dog-love. Yea to Washington Post for the concept. I loved the illustration in the paper edition.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: You loved the illustration? Liliane, is that you? (Liliane's our art director.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anyway, yeah: Rescue Dog Rock was impressive. These people sunk serious money into producing the video. And it's kinda for a good cause too. But if you judge everything purely by melody, this one definitely loses.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne Midgette: I don't know - I love melody as much as the next critic, but I thought the production values on Rescue Dog Rock were pretty impressive.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I suppose to be consistent, Josh DuLac and I should have judged mainly the music and Ann Hornaday should have judged mainly the merits of the videos/productions, but I suspect that we all took it upon ourselves to espouse a more global approach.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Manassas, VA: I liked the Rescue Dog one and Bones and found it hard to vote for 1 but I did. I liked the production and the message of Rescue Dog. I liked the bluesy ness of Bones.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I voted for Rescue Dog. It looks like my niece's dog.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe Heim: It's just like voting for president. Choose the one that most reminds you of your niece's dog.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: Which is why I'm writing in a vote for Fred Thompson.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Westminster, MD: Technically, your chat is also competing with Wilbon but since he's also about 30 minutes late-I think you're in the clear.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: Who is this Wilbon fellow?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">DC: grrr ruff ruff ruff grrr ahroooooo ahrooooo!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: Down, boy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe Heim: down boy!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne Midgette: This would appear to be a comment from Bo Bo, who is understandably resentful of all the attention going to Mr. Scrappers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">No originality here: I, like others I am sure, sing to my pets, though not original songs. Felix the dog's song is, naturally, sung to the tune of Feelings: &quot;Felix, whoa whoa whoa, Felix...&quot; Lulu, my other dog, does have a crazy, maniacal sing songy call which my boyfriend made up, &quot;Luuuuluuuuu&quot; which makes her come running over to frantically start to lick your eyelids. Upon reflection, I guess that's pretty original!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe Heim: Be sure to send a video next year. Sounds extremely promising.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">DC: Can the winners be judges next time around?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe Heim: The winning pets or their owners?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">D.C.: Mommy first read the page in the Post and decided this was a family voting endeavor. So the parents collected the 3 year old Amelia and 1.5 year old Wachemo to watch and listen. Daddy liked Georgia -- best musically, truly impressed when he read that the artist first learned her guitar skills at 12. After replaying all the tunes three times, Amelia said she liked Rats best. Why? &quot;Because I do.&quot; Wachemo grooved best to Rescue Dogs and Bones, when he wasn't trying to rip the newspaper. And Mommy's choice ... toss up between Georgia and Sami, with the edge to Sami. We all laughed at Mr. Scrappers and could totally relate. Big question: how can we download these to add to our music collection???? Great job everyone!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: Wachemo!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne Midgette: While I am vastly entertained by your description of your own judging process, I fear that you are delinquent in having failed to submit a song yourself. Wachemo is obviously just waiting for his big chance. (I am not entirely clear from your post whether Wachemo is of the animal or human persuasion, but my observation stands regardless.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: I figured Wachemo was human. Hence my reaction. But whichever: Great name.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ballot Box: No question, just a comment! My kids are very sad that you're only allowed to vote once- they're all under 13 and therefore unable to (legally) have their own WaPo account. My 7, 5, and 3 year old argued for half an hour before I was allowed to cast our solitary vote for Bones (had I been voting on my own, I would have picked Georgia, and my 7 yr old is still bummed that she didn't get to vote for Sami Cat). Once we voted my 3 year old was ready to listen to Bones and Mr. Scrappers the rest of the day. I finally had to turn the computer off so he'd quit asking.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thanks for doing this, it was a huge hit at my house!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: Children should be focused on their studies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe Heim: I recommend taking them down to the local library and letting them vote on as many different computers as they can. You're never too young to learn about ballot stuffing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anywhere: Tough, tough, tough call between &quot;Mr. Scrappers&quot; and &quot;Bones.&quot; In the end I picked &quot;Bones&quot; and was rewarded with the revelation that I'd chosen the, ahem, underdog.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: Bones is running a solid third behind Scrappers and Rescue Dog (due partially to what I suspect are very successful get-out-the-vote campaigns).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">College Park, MD: I was afraid to vote for Bones, my favorite tune, because of the verse about cat killing. What can I say, I'm a crazy cat lady. What a relief to read that the real dog is mellow and not at all like the alter ego of the song! I can enjoy the song without guilt. Go Bones!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne Midgette: I found it striking that the dog-related songs tended to be flashy and involve fairly intricate production values, while the cat songs were mellow, female, and accompanied by guitar. Are there conclusions to be drawn here?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But I am glad to hear that a cat person can enjoy dog music. The premise we critics were given about &quot;Bones&quot; is that the song was exploring the dog's imaginary inner life.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bethesda, MD: I think Mr. Scrappers attacking the mail is what sealed the deal for me. Maybe McCain can borrow that for an ad and he might just close the gap on Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe Heim: We don't have a dog in this fight.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Richmond: Did Michael Vick submit an entry?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: Yes. The video consisted of pit bulls dancing to Jailhouse Rock.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">LonelyTown USA: I Love My Dog My heart goes a flutter Everytime I reach for A jar of peanut butter He doesn't care where I choose to spread it He's just so happy When I yell COME AND GET IT!!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What do you guys think?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anne Midgette: Unfortunately I cannot give an official review to an entry submitted outside the time limits of the competition. (We classical music critics are uptight that way.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Off the record, I'd say, Get that on a video and send it in next year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: Uh, on second thought: Don't get that on video. Our contest rules specifically state &quot;no pornography.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Zak: Okay, that's enough. Thanks for chatting, and forward the video links to your friends. If you can only vote in one election this season, vote for Pet Songs!
