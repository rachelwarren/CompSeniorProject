  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Republican National Committee began running this advertisement Monday in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. It was produced and distributed by the party's ''independent expenditure'' unit, which is prohibited from planning its advertising in coordination with the party's direct leadership or that of the campaign of Senator John McCain. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE SCRIPT A male announcer says: ''Meltdown. Wall Street squanders our money, and Washington is forced to bail them out with -- you guessed it -- our money. Can it get any worse? Under Barack Obama's plan, the government would spend a trillion dollars more, even after the bailout. A trillion dollars. Who pays? You do. New taxes. New spending. New debt. Barack Obama's plan: It will make the problem worse. The Republican National Committee is responsible for the content of this advertisement.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ON THE SCREEN A ''Wall Street'' street sign melts and morphs into the facade of the New York Stock Exchange, the image wobbling as if reflected in a fun house mirror before melting away to reveal the words ''Bailout with our money.'' The spot switches to a gauze-filtered image of a man and a woman apparently going over their household finances. It then shows a shadowy image of Senator Barack Obama walking in slow motion before a large crowd as a series of headlines flashes across the screen: ''Obama's Spending Plan: One trillion more after the bailout. You pay''; ''New taxes. New spending. New debt''; ''It'll make the problem worse.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ACCURACY This spot's assertion that Mr. Obama will increase spending by $1 trillion ''after the bailout'' is not entirely accurate. Mr. Obama has said the current financial crisis means that he would probably have to reorder his budget priorities and delay some spending. But the initial figure is in dispute and was based upon a McCain campaign formulation that Mr. Obama's spending plans will add roughly $900 billion in new federal spending. The formula ignores Mr. Obama's envisioned cuts and tax policy changes. In fact, the most recent, comprehensive analysis of the candidates' spending and taxation plans, by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group, found that the costs of Mr. Obama's plans were not necessarily that much higher than those of Mr. McCain's. If Mr. Obama's pre-crisis proposals were fully enacted, the group reported, they would add $286 billion to the annual deficit by the last budget of the next presidential term, that of 2013. If fully enacted, Mr. McCain's pre-crisis proposals would add a maximum of $246 billion to the annual deficit in 2013 and a minimum of $180 billion, according to the group. The spot is somewhat accurate in saying Mr. Obama would impose ''new taxes''; he is proposing an increase for those making more than $250,000 a year, and a tax cut for all those making less than that.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SCORECARD Voters who see this advertisement during their regular newscasts may be confused by its content: it comes as Mr. McCain is publicly advocating for the very bailout plan that is portrayed so negatively here. It is also running in markets where Mr. Obama is telling viewers, in a two-minute spot, that he intends to lower taxes for most Americans. So, all in all, it remains to be seen just how effective the commercial will be in hurting Mr. Obama, or, for that matter, in helping Mr. McCain. JIM RUTENBERG </span></p>
