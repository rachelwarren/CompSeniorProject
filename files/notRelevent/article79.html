  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Conservative MSNBC senior campaign correspondent and Daily Beast contributor Tucker Carlson and liberal Radar Magazine Washington editor and Time Magazine blogger Ana Marie Cox were online Thursday, Oct. 30 at 2 p.m. ET (and every Wednesday afternoon through Nov. 5) to dissect and debate the issues and latest developments in the 2008 campaigns.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The transcript follows.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________ </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ana Marie Cox: Hello. I'm in Real America with Sarah Palin, who assures me that it's real.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Minneapolis: Ana Marie -- read your post on Nicole Wallace, then I heard that even Palin was &quot;blaming&quot; her too. The Latest is that Palin called to smooth things over with her. I read the transcripts but was there subtext/tone that you picked up on?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: A Q and A With Nicolle Wallace, Palin's Chaperone Daily Beast, Oct. 28</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ana Marie Cox: I think Nicole was understandably annoyed and frustrated that someone who was a total stranger would call her a coward on national TV, and one of the reasons why we're all so captivated by stories like this is that this is the story of a losing campaign -- the sniping and the blame game. Nicole's a smart girl, and knows that even talking about it feeds into that narrative, and so she was frustrated. She doesn't even know who to be frustrated with.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The other weird thing about that story is that we know who spent that money -- it wasn't Nicole. There's a name on the bill the RNC put out.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And an aside: Here's how real the America I'm in -- I can't even get 3G access for my lap-top right now.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Garfield, N.J.: Hey, love The Beast, and Time, well, it's not that bad either. Which is more startling, Palin going into business on her own, or Sheppard Smith straying from the straight Roger Ailes line? Did you see him go after that formidable intellectual Joe the Plumber? At first I wondered if Fox had taken away his parking spot, but I notice that Chris Wallace has transgressed more and more frequently in recent days. Could this be a slight course shift at Fox to mark the collapse of Bush/Cheney radicalism and the emergence of MSNBC as the liberal network? An effort to move slightly to the center, like candidates do?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: Good afternoon. And thanks for the nice words about the Daily Beast. I did see the Shepard Smith/Joe the Plumber clip. Amazing. But I think you may be reading too much into it. I doubt what Smith said was a reaction to any another network, or part of larger strategy. My impression was, he simply couldn't stand to listen to remarks that stupid without challenging them. It happens.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ana Marie Cox: I think Fox and Friends is a remarkably low bar for intellectual discussion, but Sheppard has always struck me as at least concious of his own intellectual dignity. I also think the Fox Network is properly seen as a GOP instrument, not a Bush instrument -- they pushed back very hard on his immigration plan. I think this is part of the breakdown you see with McCain at the top of the ticket vs. the &quot;Real America.&quot; With mcCain looking like he'll lose, Ailes may be positioning the network for after the election, not wanting to look like they're part of the McCain campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: I'm an Obama fan, but I thought that his 30-minute infomercial was a bit much. That whole &quot;amber waves of grain&quot; opening shot did not tear at my heartstrings, it made me roll my eyes. Was this smart campaigning? To me it was just overkill, and it emphasized that I want this election -- more so the campaign -- tediousness to be over with, ASAP!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: To Obama people, there's no such thing as too much Barack. The concept doesn't even compute. Could you have too much happiness? A glut of joy? A surfeit of inner peace?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let's be honest: It's a cult. They're not moderate on the subject of Obama's greatness.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ana Marie Cox: Well, I think there is a segment of Obama supporters who deserve Tucker's sarcasm, but I think you should remember that the majority of the people who will vote for him haven't gotten a tattoo or worse. They're average Americans who have decided that they want him to be their next president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If there was any risk of overkill, I think those people avoided the show. I think strategically for Obama, the bigger thing was that people knew he bought prime-time ads on seven different networks. He could have shown the Yule-Tide log or burning stacks of cash for half and hour and it would have sent the appropriate message -- I have so much money, I can do whatever we want.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Please define: What does it mean to be &quot;functionally tied in the battleground states&quot;? Thank you.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: It means we don't have confidence in the poll numbers we're getting, so who knows what could happen?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ana Marie Cox: Again, I'm forced to agree with Tucker. It means they're functionally unable to admit that they're probably going to lose. They are right that anything could happen, though.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I think &quot;functionally tied&quot; brings a whole new definition to &quot;functional.&quot; I don't think I want my contractor telling me &quot;your toilet is functionally fixed -- try it out, see what happens!&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roseland, N.J.: Tucker, any comment on Cloris Leachman lasting longer on &quot;Dancing With the Stars&quot; than you?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: I'm not surprised. I haven't seen the show lately -- or any non-campaign-related television -- but I'm sure she's better than I was. Anyone would be. I was terrible, remember? It was a blessing to be euthanized after one episode.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Baltimore: So, will Joe Lieberman have a committee chair come January? Heck, will he have a committee seat anywhere come January?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: Democrats badly want to kick Lieberman out of the party. Badly. I don't think there's any question they'll try to prevent him from being chairman of anything in the new congress.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ana Marie Cox: I that has to be balanced with the fact that Democratic leadership realizes it won't do much good to punish him. It would be an ego-trippy thing to do that would have meaning only within the Senate. There are other ways to punish Joe Lieberman. He has to be Joe Lieberman for the rest of his life. I'm not saying it won't happen, but there are more rational heads in the game who might prevent it from happening.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Iowa: Looking back on this painfully long and torturously twisted election campaign, what single event surprised each of you the most?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: Hillary losing. I never thought it could happen. The Clintons considered the Democratic Party their personal property, and for good reason. They controlled everything. Except apparently they didn't. I'm still amazed she's not the nominee. I suspect she feels the same way.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ana Marie Cox: I'm going to invert Tucker's answer and say Barack winning the nomination. I never was fully sold on the Clinton candidacy, but I think the extraordinary campaign Obama has run and his incredible story don't stop being incredible just because he's on his way to the White House. People talked about him running four years ago, and there once was a glimmer that Colin Powell might run for the presidency, but I think even a year ago there was a good percent of Americans who would not have believed that with the very sordid racial relations history we have that we'd get to this point so quickly, and with so little violence or controversy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Columbia, Md.:&quot;Powerful House Democrats are eyeing proposals to overhaul the nation's $3 trillion 401(k) system, including the elimination of most of the $80 billion in annual tax breaks that 401(k) investors receive.&quot; If this is true, why would anyone want to vote for Obama and the Democrats?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: Good question. It's hard to believe they could get away with that, though. There'd be a revolt.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ana Marie Cox: I think that too. This has been another edition of &quot;What Tucker Said.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Richmond, Va.: Ana, has Butterstick endorsed a candidate yet?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ana Marie Cox: I think Butterstick is running on his own ticket. He would win, but there are some questions about his citizenship I think. Talk about a unity ticket, talk about some racial healing. The Stickman. I'd vote for Butterstick. The Stick in '16.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sniff: However are we going to cope after next Wednesday? Its like having our favorite couple written out of one of our soaps. Surely, you two are not going to leave us? CNN, I got an idea for you...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: Thanks. But take heart: as in your favorite soap, no matter how preposterous the storyline, we can always be written back in.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ana Marie Cox: That's right. And remember -- we'll be back on Wednesday after the election. It'll be like the reunion episode of a reality show, only we won't fight. You will find out that we've been secretly married the entire time.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I think someone should put Tucker and I on a reality show. I'm not sure what we would do. Maybe cook?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: Bicker, but in a charming way.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: As a person who studied political propaganda in college, and who ended up writing several film school papers and a politics papers on propaganda, I have to say that Obama's half-hour ad rivals the work of Leni Riefenstahl in terms of its balance of imagery and symbolism in its attempts to redefine nationalism. From purely a talent standpoint I think that their campaign has raised the bar of propaganda, getting A-list directors involved in campaigning for them, and I worry this is going to happen more in the future, as most Americans are not trained to separate being in favor of a politician's policies vs. being swayed by beautiful imagery, soft music and excellent narration. Thoughts?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: Are you suggesting that people pay closer attention to pictures than to words? As someone who works in television, let me take a pass on that.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ana Marie Cox: First of all, the Obama campaign's design aesthetic I think is one of the most innovative of any campaign, although compared to normal commercial presentation it isn't as impressive. It takes the design standards of companies like Apple and applies it to a politician. If you look at his campaign's branding scheme, it's flawless. It's pervasive. I think the cult-like atmosphere that Tucker talked about can be seen in this. People have embraced Obama almost the way they would a band.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Raleigh, N.C.: Good afternoon. There's a faction of the Republican party that is pre-blaming their losses this year to insufficient conservatism. I'll buy that with regard to the prescription drug program, but I don't see any evidence that that bill is hurting the Republican slate. Other than that, in what areas have the Republicans been too liberal, on things that really matter? By that I mean, you can't say earmarks, because earmarks are pretty small potatoes in the context of our budget, and include popular items such as aid to Israel.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ana Marie Cox: I think the bailout struck a lot of conservatives as not being conservative at all. And McCain has a whole history of party apostasy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: That's for sure. It's pretty hard to argue you're the conservative free-market guy when you're in favor of nationalizing industries.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ana Marie Cox: The seemlessness of Obama's branding and the relentlessness of it tends to make people think of that candidate as less a person working for them, which is what politicians are. When you have someone set themselves up as less your employee and more as your leader, it becomes harder to set the same standards for them. It's something that happened with Republicans with Reagan and carried over to Bush, and he was able to be a terrible leader for years and years before the cult of personality wore off. People need to think of Obama as just another person who happens to be president, with the same capability for mistakes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bayonet Point, Fla.: Here in West Central Florida, the campaign has gotten very ugly. Every day there are letters and editorials in the local papers denouncing the &quot;Socialist Obama.&quot; Today there was actually a letter stating that Democrats were &quot;anti-Christian&quot; and that a vote for Obama was a vote for Satan. This has gotten ridiculous! People actually are destroying political signs on private property. My question is, no matter who is elected. Do you think these wounds and divisiveness ever can be healed?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: Yes. A blowout will lower the volume. I'm not impressed by Obama's ideas (to the extent I even understand what they are) and I'm not voting for him. But I do think a decisive victory would improve the atmosphere, because landslides always do. We had three elections in a row ('92, '96 and 2000) in which the winner didn't win the majority of the popular vote. This allowed the losing party to act as if the guy who beat them didn't really win and wasn't really the legitimate president. By contrast, when you get unequivocally spanked -- Mondale '84, for example -- you have no choice but to accept that you lost fairly and deal with it. That's a good thing. So while I'm not hoping for an Obama victory, I do hope that if he does win it's by a significant margin, simply so we won't be arguing about it for the next four years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ana Marie Cox: I'm trying to avoid having all my answers be &quot;Tucker has a good point,&quot; although he does. But I don't think the popular vote will be that much of a blowout. Not that it matters, except in the sort of psychological ways Tucker mentions. However, I think the people behaving in the terrible ways Bayonet Point mentions are a very small minority who will be properly shamed. I think they're responsible for McCain falling in the polls, really. I don't know if anyone's seen the Liddy Dole ad accusing Kay Hagen of literally being godless, but it's the most over-the-top thing outside of &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; I couldn't even get offended by it, in a way, because I didn't think anyone would buy it. People will turn off their television sets and vote for Kay Hagen. I think this is why you're seeing a lot of Republican defectors -- they don't see anger as the proper campaigning tone for the mood of the country, and they're rejecting that anger, probably moreso than they're rejecting McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: Wednesday: Which pundits should we be watching Wednesday for the most egregious over-statements and/or greatest chance of on-air heart attack?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ana Marie Cox: Well, Chris Matthews never really fails to deliver moments of high drama, and he does often seem to be hyperventilating if not actually having a heart attack -- and I say that with love. But I think there's a lot of people, mostly in New York, who are going to be giddy -- I waxed sort of rhapsodic about Obama's place in history myself and I think you'll see a lot of that. &quot;Oh wow, we're such a great country for doing this!&quot; And if he loses, I think a lot of media elite will operate on the assumption of voter fraud.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: Voter fraud, but also -- perhaps mostly -- racism. A McCain victory would, in the eyes of the media, prove decisively that this is a bad country. Once the rioting stopped, we'd never hear the end of it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I've never seen an election where the press framed the choice in starker moral terms: Obama deserves to win. All we need to do is get out of the way and let the right thing happen. In other words, this is more than a political contest; it's a referendum on our decency as a nation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That's the bottom-line message from the pundit class.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Evanston, Illinois: Dana Milbank, in his chat, just endorsed Cynthia McKinney on the grounds that she would be the best material for his work. In your opinions who would be the best choice for the comedy industry?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ana Marie Cox: I might be alone in this, but I think that with great power comes great comedic potential. People have been saying that Obama has been so on-point it'll be hard to find laughs, whereas McCain would be a font of humor. But when you put someone in a position of tremendous responsibility, they're automatically opened up for ridicule. That's how it should be. Thou shalt make fun of your leaders.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: You'll never shake me from my conviction that Al Sharpton would have been the most amusing president ever. (Full disclosure: He promised to make me head of Amtrak if he won, so I had a vested interest in promoting him.) This year, though, Dennis Kucinich stole my heart in the first few debates, and never gave it back. The biomass campaign bus? The Department of Peace? The Roswell connections? Come on. He was the best.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bethesda, Md.: Tucker, I loved your essays about traveling with the 2000 Straight Talk Express (especially the boozing driver). How has the McCain campaign changed since then?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: I was a magazine writer then, not a TV guy, so I had a much more tactile sense of the campaign then I do now. But I did travel with McCain in the primaries and have many friends on the road with him now, and my sense is it's a lot more buttoned-up and regimented and sober, and probably less profane and fun. Of course it would have to be. There's more at stake this time. But the main difference is obvious to anyone watching the coverage from home: In 2000, when he was running against Bush, the press liked McCain and gave him the benefit of the doubt. Now that he's a speed bump on the way to the Obama coronation, he gets no such courtesy. The media have contempt for him, and he for them. All very hostile. It's sad to see. The 2000 McCain campagin really was fun as hell to cover.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mt. Vernon, Va.: Can we bury the myth of the &quot;October Surprise&quot; once and for all? Every presidential election year pundits predict one, yet as far as I know such a surprise never, ever has occurred.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: There are all sort of October surprises. I've got an in-box full of them right now, some of which are probably even true. The thing is, they never change the course of the election. People discount late revelations as false or unfair even when they're not. Plus, this year a lot of the voting has already taken place.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">North Carolina: Honestly, is this race sewn up for Obama? Is there a reason to stay up on Election Night?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: Of course there is: To watch cable news.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Florissant, Mo.: I have to say, it would have been nice if Obama taken some of the half-hour to focus on what's important -- Jeremiah Wright, Bill Ayers, endangering children, being a celebrity, Paris Hilton, Britney Spears and ACORN. Instead we heard all about people whining because they can't make ends meet, then paying over $20 to take their families out to dinner. Whiners.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ana Marie Cox: Phil Gramm, is that you?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Asheville, N.C.: Watching so many prominent centrist Republicans walking out on McCain, it's hard to remember this was once the guy who's biggest problem was going to be motivating the &quot;base.&quot; Frankly, today's loss of the center just seems shocking in that context. Was it really all Palin, or was a civil war in the Republican Party inevitable this year?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: Both. The choice of Palin did shock a lot of establishment Republicans, though some have used to her as a pretext to do the convenient thing and bail on a losing campaign. But the real problem is what you suggest: The GOP has no idea what it is at the moment. Big-government social conservatives (i.e., many evangelicals) have just about nothing in common with socially-liberal free-market types. Huckabee and Giuliani, in other words, really don't belong in the same party. So whose party is it? That's what the current fight is about.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Germantown, Md.: One of the two senators must lose the election; who has burnt more bridges with his party and Senate colleagues? I would think that, in part because of age, Sen. McCain might have less influence (unless of course he becomes a Sen. Byrd or Sen. Stevens).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ana Marie Cox: I think, despite what we were saying about Lieberman earlier, that the Senate is such an exclusive club than civilians might think. McCain is a known quantity. I think he might have some trouble with Chris Dodd and Joe Biden, because of how they used their relationship with him to delegitimize him, but I don't think any of McCain's actual relationships will be affected. I think Obama, win or lose, will be one of the most popular guys in the Senate. No senator would say no to that kind of fundraising power.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I have to go, thank you, and thanks Tucker. I've got to go into the bunker for a Palin rally.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Evanston, Ill.: Hey Tuck Tuck -- I loved the fact that you supported Ron Paul and featured him on MSNBC. What did you make of those racially provocative newsletters that surfaced from the '90s? Apparently Lew Rockwell ghosted them, but they still were published and disseminated under Paul's name.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tucker Carlson: Ron Paul has a lot of great and interesting and important things to say. The problem with libertarians is that they have trouble keeping the wackos out of their movement. They so hate to tell other people what to do, they have trouble drawing the line. It's a temperament thing. What makes them decent people(their hatred of authoritarianism), makes them terrible at politics. It's too bad, I think.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thanks a lot for having me. See you next Wednesday.</span></p>
