  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">THIS Tuesday night, as history of one sort or another is being made, where will you be watching election returns?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> If you happen to be in Alaska, know that the doors of the Wasilla Multi-Use Sports Complex will be flung open at 3 p.m. for food, beer, wine and -- in between updates on giant televisions -- dancing to a new local rock band, Sarah and the Pit Bulls. Although this Civic Festival is ostensibly nonpartisan, it is billed on the Web as a ''victory celebration.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At the same hour in Washington -- 7 p.m., East Coast time -- the doors to the New Bethel Baptist Church will be flung open for what the Rev. Walter E. Fauntroy, a former aide to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., calls a ''watch-night service,'' also replete with food and televisions (but minus the alcohol).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I am cautiously optimistic that before the night is out,'' said Mr. Fauntroy, the church's pastor, ''I will experience what I do at weddings: someone singing, 'This is the moment.' '' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> On the evening of Nov. 4, true believers from each party will gather at churches, meetings halls, block parties, bars and parks between Wasilla and Washington, anticipating a communal exaltation of historic dimension.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But for millions of others, it will be a night infused with body-quaking fear on a seismic scale, about the economy, employment, war. Conversations last week with quotidian voters -- as well as not-so-quotidian ones -- suggest that many people may want to gather less for a party than for a huddle, a support group. Republicans are hedging their bets. Democrats say they are wary, skeptical, superstitious even. Judging by them, and not the polls that favor Senator Barack Obama, if there's a donkey braying in the land, that would be Eeyore.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I don't know anyone who is planning to whoop it up,'' said Diane Asadorian Masters, an Obama supporter from West Lafayette, Ind.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Kyle T. Smoke, chairman of the College Republicans at the University of Texas at Dallas, said that his group will not attend the student government's bipartisan party. Instead, members will watch with the grown-ups at the Dallas County Republican Party's gathering. ''Tensions are high,'' he said. ''We think it's in the best interest to be with our own people so we can either celebrate or sulk together.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Ayelet Waldman, a novelist from Berkeley, Calif., who campaigned hard for Mr. Obama, will fly to Chicago on Tuesday to work the phones, knocking wood and spitting over her shoulder as she does so. ''I cannot take comfort in the polls,'' said Ms. Waldman, who, with her husband and four children, planned to gather with Obama supporters that evening in Grant Park. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Referring to the tight races in 2000 and 2004, she said: ''It's like Charlie Brown and the football: once, twice, a million times burned. I'll be in Chicago because I either want to celebrate with Barack or grieve with him''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Pam Young, a Republican mother of three from Fort Worth, Tex., said she would probably have a few friends over. ''I think my guy is going down for the count,'' she said, referring to Senator John McCain. She has many liberal friends with whom she traded nyah-nyah text messages during the debates. On Tuesday night, she said, with a sigh, ''They will abuse me with it.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The evening presents an emotional challenge for Susan Bodnar Schatsky, a Manhattan Democrat. She'll be struggling to contain her battle-scarred cynicism, even as she encourages the excitement of her children, 9 and 11, who baked money-raising cookies and knocked on doors in Pennsylvania for Mr. Obama. ''Our kids need to be allowed to idealize,'' she said. ''We'll acknowledge that it's a special, fun night. But if it doesn't work out, we need to have a protective place for their tears.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Bob Casselman has his protective place ready. Mr. Casselman, a middle school teacher from Zionsville, Ind., said he was voting for Mr. McCain but was apprehensive about the outcome of the evening, which he intended to spend at home with his wife. He has a shrinking retirement account and two college tuitions to cover. ''I'll certainly watch the returns,'' he said, ''but I'll also be reading a fun book'' -- David Baldacci's ''Stone Cold'' -- ''so I can take my mind off the serious stuff. I've been saving it for election night.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> By contrast, the ebullience of organizers of Tuesday night's events in Wasilla and Washington seemed unassailable. Perhaps that was because they will be celebrating themselves as much as their candidates. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Wasilla, Mr. McCain and the Republican Party seem like afterthoughts, wafting after what is essentially a love-fest for Sarah Palin and small-town Alaska.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Typically on an election night, said Lynn Gattis, an organizer of the Wasilla event, ''We go to a local bar or watch on our own TVs, but this one is a big hoo-hah.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The festival will feature gun-safety sessions, a flag ceremony from the Boy Scouts and vendors hawking Palin memorabilia, including wineglass charms -- trinkets to identify one's glass at an event -- in shapes like lipstick and high-heeled shoes. The Colony High School Marching Band from nearby Palmer will perform what Mrs. Gattis contended would be a special preview.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''The band is going to the inaugural parade!'' Mrs. Gattis said. ''We bought their uniforms on eBay, and they've been practicing. I've got my inaugural ball gown, tan-spray can and all.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Across the country, Mr. Fauntroy, a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, sees in Mr. Obama the fulfillment of a dream more than 40 years old. ''This is the great harvest,'' he said, his voice breaking. ''The moment for which Martin Luther King Jr. gave his life. I've been saying to people ad nauseam: 'Pray and then vote. Put feet to your prayers.' ''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He expects at least 500 people at New Bethel on Tuesday night. ''I am so full of anticipation that I am ashamed of myself,'' Mr. Fauntroy said. ''I can almost hear the children singing and the church bells ringing.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As if to defuse their anxiety, some hosts have intentionally created bipartisan guest lists. The marquee bipartisan party in New York is likely to be the one given by Harvey Weinstein, the ardent Democrat (and film and theater producer), and Georgette Mosbacher, the ardent Republican (and top executive at Borghese, the beauty company), along with Cindi Leive (undeclared) and Jim Nelson (Democrat), the editors in chief, respectively, of Glamour and GQ.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> During a conference call with Ms. Mosbacher and Mr. Weinstein, that notion of friendship trumping partisanship was almost savaged, especially when Ms. Mosbacher, alluding to the candidates' tax proposals, described herself as ''a small-business owner.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Weinstein all but gagged.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I have a $100-million business,'' Ms. Mosbacher explained. ''I have to make a payroll on the first and the 15th of the month!''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Their guest list includes Robert. M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney; Eva Mendes, the actress; and Salman Rushdie, the writer. There will be, Mr. Weinstein chimed in, ''a lot of small-business owners of $100 million and above.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''And a lot of limousine liberals,'' Ms. Mosbacher shot back.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Each acknowledged the gravity of the election, as well as the historic symbolism. If and when a winner is announced, Champagne will be served. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''If Barack wins, I'm buying,'' Mr. Weinstein said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''And if McCain wins, he'll still be buying,'' she added.</span></p>
