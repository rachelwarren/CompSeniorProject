  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pennsylvania has voted for Democrats for president since 1992. But no one ever said winning it would be as easy for Senator Barack Obama as, say, ladling Cheez Whiz onto a Pat's steak.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In April he managed to insult the state's rural voters, saying they cling to their guns and religion because they are bitter about their economic plight. And he lost the primary to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Since winning the Democratic nomination, Mr. Obama's campaign has labored to secure his standing here. It has conducted a ferocious voter registration drive, flooded the airwaves with commercials and dispatched thousands of volunteers to knock on doors and make phone calls. It has opened 65 offices across the state -- four times as many as Mr. McCain has -- and more than it has opened in any other state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Still, Craig Schirmer, the Obama state director, said on a conference call with reporters Wednesday that he expected the race here to be ''incredibly close,'' within ''a couple'' of percentage points. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Maybe he was just lowering expectations.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But a new Quinnipiac poll released on Thursday shows that Mr. Obama's lead over Mr. McCain in Pennsylvania has shrunk to three percentage points (48-45) from seven percentage points on Aug. 26. (The sampling was taken Sept. 5-9 of 1,001 likely Pennsylvania voters with a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points, making the results statistically a dead heat.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain has narrowed the gap in Pennsylvania by wiping out Mr. Obama's lead among independent voters, said Clay F. Richards, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. Mr. Obama still holds a three-point edge ''by convincing previously uncommitted Hillary Clinton primary voters and Catholics to move into his camp -- the Catholics perhaps because of some help from running mate Joe Biden, a Catholic from Scranton,'' Mr. Richards said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain has also gained ground among white women, according to this poll and others, perhaps reflecting a positive reaction to his choice of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his vice-presidential running mate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A raucous rally here Tuesday with Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin -- what Mr. McCain calls ''this team of mavericks'' -- provided fresh evidence of what Mr. Obama is up against in this state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin drew a cheering throng of 7,000 people to the sports center at Franklin &amp; Marshall College, practically a tidal wave compared with Mr. McCain's once-sleepy audiences (although a bit smaller than an Obama rally nearby a few days earlier).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Once they arrived in the arena, Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin spent 10 minutes just working their way through the crowd to the podium as Jerry Goldsmith's stirring theme music from the football movie ''Rudy'' washed over them. ''Sarah!'' they chanted. ''Sarah!''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In her 14-minute speech, Ms. Palin, wearing a red jacket, black dress and red patent-leather heels, essentially repeated her acceptance speech from the convention, including some information about her record that has been disputed, and she highlighted Mr. Obama's remark about small-town voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Here in Pennsylvania,'' Ms. Palin said, ''we don't know what to make of a candidate who lavishes praise on working people when they're listening, and turns around and talks about how bitterly they cling to their religion and their guns when they're not listening.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The crowd booed a mightily.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The remark struck at the heart of one of Mr. Obama's weaknesses, the blue-collar, Reagan Democrats who generally favored Mrs. Clinton in the primaries.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gov. Edward G. Rendell, a Democrat who backed Mrs. Clinton in the primary but is now hustling for Mr. Obama, indicated during the conference call Wednesday that these working-class voters were still proving elusive for Mr. Obama. He said the McCain campaign had misrepresented Mr. Obama's economic plan and had ''confused the electorate.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''We haven't advanced the ball as much in that category as we have in expanding the base,'' Mr. Rendell said, referring to the addition of hundreds of thousands of new Democrats, who now outnumber registered Republicans by 1.1 million.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The inclination of blue-collar voters toward Mr. McCain is evident in the new poll. It shows Mr. McCain with a substantial lead in the southwestern part of the state, for example, a region dominated by Reagan Democrats, and among people without college degrees. That region, and those without degrees, voted heavily for Mrs. Clinton.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> All told, the poll says, Mr. McCain wins perhaps one in five of those who went for Mrs. Clinton in the primary, which should be a big red flag to the Obama campaign that it is not connecting with those voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Of two former Clinton supporters who were interviewed at the rally, they were split between Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain. Celia Fauth, 50, a real estate agent, now backs Mr. Obama while her daughter, Lindsay, 28, a marketing coordinator, is backing Mr. McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Celia Fauth said that while Mr. McCain's pick of Ms. Palin made her like him more, she said she would vote for Mr. Obama because Mr. McCain is ''too tied to Bush.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But her daughter is voting Republican because Ms. Palin''brings youth and energy,'' Lindsay Fauth said, ''and it would be wonderful to have a working mom as vice president.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Lancaster County, made up of small towns and the relentlessly expanding exurbs of Philadelphia, is an interesting piece of the Pennsylvania puzzle in presidential politics. While the city of Lancaster is Democratic, the county is overwhelmingly Republican. In 2004, it voted for President Bush over Senator John Kerry by 66 percent to 34 percent, even as Mr. Kerry narrowly won the state. Voters here are deeply religious and generally oppose abortion rights and gun control.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In this year's primary, Lancaster was one of the few counties in the state where Democrats voted for Mr. Obama over Mrs. Clinton.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And in the Republican primary, voters were not all that enthused by Mr. McCain. Even though he was already the likely nominee, Mr. McCain drew only 73 percent of the vote. Representative Ron Paul won 16 percent and former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, 11 percent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Now, according to the Quinnipiac poll, Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama are virtually tied here in central Pennsylvania.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain needs to hold down Mr. Obama's support here because Mr. Obama will have substantial support from Philadelphia, where the poll shows him leading Mr. McCain by 3-1, as well as in Pittsburgh.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But strikingly, Mr. McCain shows a slight lead in the Southeast, home to the state's all-important Philadelphia suburbs, where most statewide races are traditionally decided -- the battleground within the battleground. While these suburbs were staunchly Republican for decades, they have generally voted Democratic for president since 1992. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> If the rally here on Tuesday is any indication, Ms. Palin has galvanized enthusiasm for the Republican ticket, especially among social conservatives and white women.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Shirl Schober, 43, a real estate title searcher in Lancaster County, said that the addition of Ms. Palin to the ticket rekindled her interest in Mr. McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I was starting to worry; I thought he didn't want the presidency, and I was getting a little disillusioned,'' said Ms. Schober. ''But when he picked her, I decided, he does want it.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Ruth Ecklin, 46, a retailer in Lancaster, who brought two of her four daughters to see Ms. Palin, said, ''I'm more enthusiastic now, no question.'' They waited for two hoursoutside as part of an overflow crowd and watched her on a big screen.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The day after the rally -- as some national Democrats began to fret publicly about the state of the race -- the Obama team held a conference call to tout the progress it had made in its ground operation in Pennsylvania.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Schirmer, the state director, shrugged off a question about how Ms. Palin had changed the political landscape, saying she had not and that Mr. Obama was the true agent of change.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But Mr. Rendell responded to that question by mentioning Mrs. Clinton, saying she had always planned to campaign heavily in the state even before Ms. Palin was picked.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''We're going to see a lot of Senator Clinton in Pennsylvania and she will be a big help in defusing some of this popularity,'' Mr. Rendell said, being careful to add that Mrs. Clinton would take on Ms. Palin on the issues, not personally.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama has 54 days to try to solidify his lead here. The next potential game-changer comes in 15 days with the first presidential debate.</span></p>
