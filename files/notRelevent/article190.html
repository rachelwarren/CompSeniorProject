  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ken Johnson, senior vice president for communications and public affairs at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the giant drug lobby, is trying to clamp down on what he sees as staff abuse of administrative leave.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So he sent his 20 staffers a sharply worded e-mail ordering everyone to get approval well in advance if they want to take some time off. &quot;In the future,&quot; he said, &quot;if you send me an email at 1:00 pm. saying you have a doctor's appointment at 3:00 pm, you had better be dying or it will count toward your vacation time.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Requests to attend to family matters,&quot; he continued in the Oct. 2 missive, &quot;or other personal matters, religious holidays and anything of a similar nature must also be approved in advance. Additionally, all vacation requests must continue to be submitted in advance as well.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Johnson, asked about his unusual management style, said the company's human resources department had already &quot;told me that wasn't the appropriate way to word it, but they understand my dark sense of humor.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Johnson said the e-mail was sparked by his having seen an aide walk into a nearby department store. But when he inquired as to the aide's whereabouts, he was told the fellow was at a doctor's appointment.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;In retrospect, I violated my own cardinal rule never to put it in an e-mail,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;I should have just gone in and ball-and-chained the person to his desk.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I push my people pretty hard some times, but the tone was meant to be a jest. Obviously someone didn't take it that way. I have never denied anyone's request for personal leave for any reason,&quot; he said, &quot;vacation, religious holiday or just time off to get away from me.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Which isn't easy with a ball and chain.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">Security and Numbers </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Should Barack Obama be lucky -- or unlucky -- enough to win the presidency, he's going to find the transition process a lot easier than Bill Clinton or George W. Bush did. Both predecessors inherited a government run by the opposition party, obliging them to clear out most anyone left on Jan. 20 and then refill several hundred key jobs as fast as they could.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That meant waiting for FBI clearance checks, with delays of up to two months, before people could be named to top posts or have their names sent to the Senate for confirmation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama would inherit similar circumstances, of course. But the 2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, passed as part of the post-9/11 Commission reforms, allows both candidates, after they are formally nominated, to submit an unspecified number of requests for security clearances for prospective transition-team members &quot;who will have a need for access to classified&quot; info.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That obviously applies to folks working on transition teams involving national security -- the Pentagon, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence agencies. But it's fuzzy enough to sweep in many more who'll be involved in the Department of Health and Human Services (biochem and all that), Transportation, Treasury, and the Justice Department -- along with the White House itself. It could include chiefs of staff, counsels and others who might need the clearance.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In all, the number could be anywhere from 100 to 200 people, and the Obama transition has been sending names over to the bureau for some time. (Unclear whether the McCain transition team has taken similar advantage of this opportunity, but they would not necessarily be confronting a near-void at senior positions.) The law says the FBI should complete the investigations by the day after the election, a manageable deadline at least for those people who held clearances in the Clinton administration.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Since many transition-team members have been known to move into top jobs where Senate confirmation is necessary, this should also speed nominations and reduce the number of &quot;home alone&quot; Cabinet members, a problem at some agencies that can last for several months after Inauguration Day.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">Faster Than a FEMA Trailer </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's getting down to the wire for people with old television sets to switch to digital before the Feb. 17 deadline. A just-completed Consumers Union poll shows general awareness of the impending change to be 93 percent. Given that, some folks at the Federal Communications Commission think resources should now go to a system to answer calls and to assist seniors, the disabled, non-English speakers and others with their converter boxes and such.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But FCC Chairman Kevin Martin, back home yesterday in Charlotte, a hotbed of NASCAR activity, announced a nifty new public awareness project to have the FCC sponsor NASCAR driver David Gilliland and put a digital awareness ad on his No. 38 Ford in three races, starting Sunday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">FCC folks, alluding to idle chatter that Martin may be thinking of a run for GOP Rep. Sue Myrick's seat when she retires, are wondering about the NASCAR gambit, which is budgeted at $355,000. Martin, in his news release, said it's &quot;an extremely effective way&quot; to make sure racing fans know about the switch.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">Upper House or Big House? </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Back in much happier times, specifically on April 12, 2007, a couple of dozen senators rose on the floor of the chamber to pay tribute to Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) during the week he became the longest-serving Republican senator in history.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Senator after senator rose to pay homage to the man they reverentially called &quot;The King of Pork.&quot; Counting those who later added their tributes, some 30 of his colleagues rose to honor Stevens. All but four were Republican. The Democrats included his close friend Sen. Daniel Inouye (Hawaii), who noted that he and Stevens &quot;have received the crown of being 'pork men of the year.' We are number one in add-ons in the U.S. Senate.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Robert Byrd (W.Va.) called Stevens &quot;a man of immense integrity, high personal principles and unqualified honesty.&quot; There were warm toasts from Sen. Edward Kennedy (Mass.) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (Nev.).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now Stevens's Senate career may be in the hands of 12 residents of the District of Columbia, the jury in his trial in federal court on charges of failing to report more than $250,000 in gifts and home improvements he received from a pal at an oil services company.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If the jury finds him not guilty, the political pundits say, he may well retain his seat. He's only slightly behind in the polls as it is. If he's convicted, well, there may be some lawmakers who'll want to, as they say, &quot;revise and extend&quot; their remarks.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">Democrats' Good News, Bad News </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Speaking of legal and ethical matters, Democrats are bemoaning the increasingly kinky news out of Florida, where incumbent Democratic Rep. Tim Mahoney enjoyed a healthy lead until news broke of his alleged affair with, and alleged subsequent payments to, a former staffer. And then there were reports of an alleged affair with another woman.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This is in the district long represented by Republican Mark Foley, who was forced to give it up after certain e-mails surfaced involving male ex-pages. (What's with that district? The water? The heat?) So that district, which leans GOP anyway, appears lost to the Dems. There are reports that the party is pulling the plug.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the upside is that they stand to save maybe more than $1 million they would have spent on ad buys in a fairly expensive media market, trying to hold it for Mahoney. That money now can be spent on other candidates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On the other hand, the Democrats have so much money they wouldn't even notice the savings.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Must be nice.</span></p>
