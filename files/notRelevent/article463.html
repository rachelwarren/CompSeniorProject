  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Barack Obama and his campaign launched a promised counterpunch against Sen. John McCain on Friday, portraying him as an aging, out-of-touch politician who would cater to &quot;fat-cat&quot; lobbyists and continue President Bush's economic policies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With two new television advertisements, a campaign memo to supporters and a two-day trip through New Hampshire, Obama sought to regain his footing amid faltering poll numbers, a continuing assault by his Republican presidential rival and rising worries among Democrats about his campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;They've been talking about lipstick and they've been talking about pigs and they've been talking about Paris and Britney,&quot; Obama told a boisterous crowd of 1,500 packed into a gym at a technical college here. &quot;They will spend any amount of money and use any tactic out there in order to avoid talking about how we're going to move America forward to the future.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Attempting to shift the focus away from Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and to McCain, Obama quoted his opponent saying Thursday night that &quot;it's easy for me to go to Washington and, frankly, be somewhat divorced from the day-to-day challenges people have.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;So from where he and George Bush sit, maybe they just can't see,&quot; the Democrat told supporters and some self-identified undecided voters earlier in the day in Dover. &quot;Maybe they are just that out of touch. But you know the truth, and so do I. . . . We just can't afford four more years of what John McCain and George Bush consider progress.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If Democrats were expecting a dramatic change in words, tone or temperament, they did not get it. While McCain attacked him as a pampered, fading celebrity, a sexist and a desperate bully, Obama stuck to familiar themes linking the senator from Arizona to Bush and Washington lobbyists.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Even after being prodded by the audience in Dover, Obama appeared reluctant to get too aggressive. Glenn Grasso, 39, a doctoral student, pleaded: &quot;When and how are you going to start fighting back?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama responded by calling McCain's ads &quot;just fabricated&quot; and &quot;just made up,&quot; an answer that spurred some to shout out: &quot;Lies.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Lies, that's the word,&quot; Obama said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Not everyone was reassured. &quot;Truth be told, I'm extremely worried&quot; about Obama's dip in the polls and McCain's attacks, said Jaimee Rudman, 30.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's use of McCain's words from a forum Thursday on volunteerism invited a biting response. McCain had suggested that he was out of touch as a way to defend Palin's record as a small-town mayor. But Obama also came to her defense at the forum, saying mayors fill potholes, trim trees and make sure the garbage is collected, while senators &quot;yak.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's a shame that Barack Obama is using a discussion of service on September 11th as the basis for a distorted political attack. Especially when you consider that during the same event, Barack Obama reduced his own service in the U.S. Senate to mindless yakking,&quot; McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds responded in a statement.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ads from the Obama campaign took different approaches: One attacked McCain directly, the other tried to reinforce Obama's message of change with the candidate talking to the camera.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The attack was direct, accusing McCain of being out of touch after 26 years in Washington. Using jaunty, humorous music, a picture of a younger McCain with shaggy hair and the hint of sideburns, and images of massive, antiquated cellphones and a Rubik's Cube, the ad is the clearest evocation yet of McCain's age. The Republican turned 72 late last month.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;He admits he still doesn't know how to use a computer, can't send e-mail. Still doesn't understand the economy, and favors $200 billion in new tax cuts for corporations, but almost nothing for the middle class. . . . After one president who was out of touch,&quot; it concludes, &quot;we just can't afford more of the same.&quot; The Obama campaign said the ad would be aired nationally on cable and on other outlets in swing states.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a memo to supporters, Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said: &quot;In recent weeks, John McCain has shown that he is willing to go into the gutter to win this election. His campaign has become nothing but a series of smears, lies and cynical attempts to distract from the issues that matter to the American people.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Plouffe assured supporters that &quot;we will respond with speed and ferocity to John McCain's attacks and we will take the fight to him, but we will do it on the big issues that matter to the American people.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama got something of an assist from the hosts of &quot;The View,&quot; who challenged McCain on the integrity and honesty of his campaign. Joy Behar questioned two ads he is running against the Democrat -- one accusing him of supporting &quot;comprehensive&quot; sex education for kindergartners, the other saying he called Palin a pig when he used the saying &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; in reference to McCain's claims to be an agent of change.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We know that those two ads are untrue,&quot; Behar said. &quot;They are lies.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When McCain defended them, Barbara Walters noted that McCain had made the same lipstick on a pig comment about Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's health-care proposal.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;About health care,&quot; McCain said. Obama &quot;chooses his words very carefully. He shouldn't have said it.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain has portrayed Palin as a reformer unwilling to accept pork from Washington, but Walters and Behar pressed. &quot;She also took some earmarks,&quot; Walters said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;No, not as governor she didn't,&quot; McCain responded, inaccurately.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama campaign quickly produced newspaper articles about Palin seeking various earmarks as governor. In February, her office sent Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) a 70-page memo outlining almost $200 million worth of funding requests for her state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The McCain campaign also kept up its attacks on Friday, releasing an ad titled &quot;Disrespectful&quot; [See Ad Watch, A8] that kept up its celebrity attack on Obama even as it continued to play the victim card with Palin. The spot says &quot;they&quot; dismissed her as &quot;good looking,&quot; said she was just doing &quot;what she was told&quot; and called her a liar.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;He was the world's biggest celebrity, but his star is fading,&quot; the ad intones.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The independent FactCheck.org weighed in quickly, saying the ad -- already airing in Denver -- continues a pattern of distortion, taking quotes out of context and twisting meaning. &quot;The new McCain-Palin ad . . . goes down new paths of deception,&quot; the Web site concluded.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On the stump, Obama focused on his tax plan, which offers sizable breaks to middle-income families, while raising taxes on families earning more than $250,000. He said McCain has been &quot;simply dishonest&quot; about that plan, asserting repeatedly that an Obama administration would raise everyone's taxes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I will make a firm pledge: I pledge under my plan, no one making less than $250,000 a year will see any type of tax increase, not income tax, not capital gains taxes, not any kind of taxes,&quot; Obama said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And he slammed McCain's proposal to tax the value of employer-based health-care plans as income and use that to help finance tax credits to buy health insurance. The senator from Illinois called that &quot;a $3.6 trillion tax increase&quot; on working families.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Convinced that McCain's message on taxes is doing serious harm to Obama, Pennsylvania Gov. Edward G. Rendell (D) sent a memo on Friday to every elected Democrat in his state to get the word out that Obama's plan would cut taxes for the middle class far more than McCain's would.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In an interview, Rendell said the Obama campaign is beginning to push back successfully on McCain's character attacks, but the Republican's charge that Obama would raise middle-class taxes may be more damaging. The McCain ads are &quot;just despicable, but nowhere are they lying more clearly than on the tax issue,&quot; he said.</span></p>
