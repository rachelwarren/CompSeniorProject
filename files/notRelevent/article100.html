  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On a visit to her husband's campaign office here the other day, Michelle Obama was handed a phone and a script of talking points and made calls to a few undecided voters. Mrs. Obama mixed policy on taxes and health care with chitchat about Ohio, laughter about her life in politics and tidbits about her family.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> After a couple of calls, she realized that she had not been following the typewritten notes. ''I didn't look at the script,'' she said, speaking more to herself than to the volunteers on the phones next to her.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But no matter. While some of Senator Barack Obama's advisers once viewed Mrs. Obama as an unpredictable force who sometimes spoke her mind a little too much, she is now regarded within the campaign as a disciplined and effective advocate for her husband. She has also, advisers believe, gone a long way toward addressing her greatest unstated challenge: making more voters comfortable with the idea of a black first lady. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mrs. Obama and her aides have carefully chosen her appearances on the national stage this fall, mostly selecting high-profile venues that are politically safe. Joking Monday night with Jay Leno on ''The Tonight Show,'' she told of her older daughter's ordering Mr. Obama not to ''mess with my TV'' regarding his 30-minute commercial on Wednesday night, which will pre-empt some shows. She also expressed some sympathy for Gov. Sarah Palin over the recent wardrobe controversy, while noting that the Obamas bought their own clothes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> By the standards of a national political campaign, Mrs. Obama does maintain a somewhat limited schedule. (She has stumped outside Chicago on 20 of the 57 days since Labor Day, the traditional start of the fall election season.) Most of the time she is at home taking care of the couple's 10- and 7-year-old daughters, a choice that advisers hope will pay dividends among women of all races who can relate to her priorities.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But when she is at political events -- occasionally with Mr. Obama, though much more often on her own -- she is drawing large crowds, speaking with new confidence and generally avoiding gaffes as she confronts one of the trickiest tasks in the campaign. Many voters view first families as symbols of the nation, and Mrs. Obama is selling a package that for large numbers of Americans poses a real change.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Addressing a raucous rally in a gym here on Friday, Mrs. Obama had the crowd -- a mix of a few thousand black and white voters -- laughing and cheering throughout.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''So many precious little babies like that one!'' she said after noticing one infant near the stage. ''Just completely delicious!'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The audience roared with delight. And many clapped, too, when she said: ''I also come here as a mother; that is my primary title, mom in chief. My girls are the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning and the last thing I think about when I go to bed. When people ask me how I'm doing, I say, 'I'm only as good as my most sad child.' ''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In one sign of the campaign's confidence in her, Mrs. Obama is being deployed where it matters most. Since Labor Day, she has spent three days campaigning in Florida and two days each in Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as days in other swing states (sometimes two in a day).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> She usually holds rallies (her biggest was with 11,000 people in Gainesville, Fla., last week) or small round tables on the needs of working women and military families, the two groups she speaks about the most. On Saturday, she delivered the Democratic Party's weekly radio address, urging her husband's supporters to turn out on Election Day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As first lady, Obama advisers say, Mrs. Obama would focus first on her family and then on the issues facing women and military spouses as those groups deal with the economic crisis and the return of troops from Iraq. She also plans to take up national service as an issue, aides say. She will not have a major policy role, they say, and does not plan to have an office in the West Wing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Advisers to the spouses of past Democratic nominees -- Teresa Heinz Kerry in 2004, Tipper Gore in 2000, Hillary Rodham Clinton in 1992 -- say they spent more time campaigning in the fall than has Mrs. Obama. All their children were older, however, and Mrs. Kerry and Mrs. Clinton were often sent to secondary media markets, because they were unpopular with some undecided voters and independents.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Chris Lehane, an adviser and spokesman for the Gore campaign, said Mrs. Gore traveled constantly in the fall of 2000, and he described a somewhat larger traveling retinue than Mrs. Obama has. (She is accompanied by a handful of aides and a Secret Service contingent, but there is no press corps on her plane.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Echoing private comments of some Obama advisers, Mr. Lehane said he believed that the Obama campaign had been unsure at first about Mrs. Obama's potential appeal, in part because of some early missteps and in part because of the novelty of a black woman's auditioning for the role of first lady.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''My sense,'' Mr. Lehane said, ''is that the campaign was initially apprehensive, because they recognized that she was going to be treated unfairly and held to a hard-to-meet standard.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Indeed, for months Mrs. Obama was a political target. A Fox News anchor referred to an affectionate fist bump between the Obamas as a ''terrorist fist jab.'' Republicans, including Cindy McCain, criticized her for saying in February that ''for the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country.'' (They omitted the words that followed: ''And not just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry for change.'') A blogger supporting Senator Clinton spread an unfounded rumor that Mrs. Obama had once used the word ''whitey.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Obamas' need to deal with race as a factor in the campaign came to the fore this spring as Mr. Obama confronted incendiary remarks by his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., who had married the couple and baptized their children. As the son of a white mother from Kansas and a black father from Kenya, Mr. Obama has often drawn on his biracial experience to help bridge racial divides. Mrs. Obama does not have that background to draw on, making her political challenge that much more complex.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's chief strategist, said in an interview that Mrs. Obama, not being a politician, had gone through a period of ''getting comfortable'' with campaigning. She learned a great deal on her own, Mr. Axelrod said, noting that aides had not had to tell her to avoid fist bumps or remarks like ''proud of my country'' in the future.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I didn't think she needed to be told,'' he said. ''She is very, very smart and sensitive, and I think she learned from experience that in this business, you have to be very precise with your words so people don't misinterpret them. That's part of the learning experience. There's no question that she's learned.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Still, the Obama campaign has limited interviews that would entail tough questions from national newspapers and cable news programs. ''There is not one vote she will get from doing Wolf Blitzer,'' an aide said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Instead, she has appeared several times on the morning network programs and on entertainment shows like ''The View,'' ''Ellen,'' ''The Daily Show,'' ''Rachael Ray'' and, twice each, ''Access Hollywood'' and ''Entertainment Tonight.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> If Mrs. Obama is not as blunt as she once was (in describing some of her husband's habits, for instance), she is by no means hiding herpersonality, either. On ''The Tonight Show,'' she noted that she and her husband still sparred privately like the lawyers they are, and added: ''You want to know how Barack prepares for a debate? He hangs out with me, and he's ready.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At the Akron rally, she drew appreciative laughter from many in the audience when, her voice at once growing hushed and yet rising in pitch, she referred to her husband as ''baby'' while sharing an anecdote. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''My assumption,'' she said, ''is that Barack Obama is going to be the underdog until he is sitting in the Oval Office. At the start of this, I said to him, 'Look, baby, you can do a lot of things.' He believes he can do a whole lot. If he works hard, he can change the world.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But, she added, if he is to win, he needs for his supporters to be sure to vote. The audience erupted in applause.</span></p>
