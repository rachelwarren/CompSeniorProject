  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As Russia Dismantles Checkpoints</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The brokered peace between Russia and Georgia appeared fragile as accusations flew. Russia accused Georgia of ''seeking to provoke new hostilities,'' while Russian authorities were dismantling checkpoints outside South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Abkhazian authorities said that a border guard was killed during an exchange of fire with gunmen on the Georgian side, and the past few days have been marked by other violent episodes. Russian officials reached out to France, demanding that they help enforce the peace they had brokered. Page A8 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CHRISTIANS PROTEST IN BAGHDAD</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> About 75 Christians and others assembled in Baghdad to demand the reinstatement of a provision of the provincial elections law, which ensures political representation of minority groups. The provision allows for council seats for Christians and two other minority groups. Its elimination was the most significant political development for Christians since American troops overthrew Saddam Hussein in 2003. Page A6 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> AFGHAN DENIES LINK TO DRUG TRADE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Ahmed Wali Karzai, the brother of Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, denied recent accusations that he was linked to the heroin trade, calling them ''baseless'' and saying they were part of political pressure being applied to the president following his denouncement of American air strikes. The denial came in response to a New York Times article that examined the concerns of senior American officials that Ahmed Wali Karzai might be involved in heroin shipments. Page A14 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PANEL WARNS OF EXTINCTION CRISIS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A quarter of all mammals are in danger of extinction because of habitat loss, according to a study by a leading global conservation body. The situation was called an ''extinction crisis'' by the group, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which added that hundreds of species could be lost in the present generation's lifetime as a result of human actions. The report, presented at a conference in Barcelona, Spain, was the group's most detailed study of mammals in more than a decade. Page A12 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> RAIN FOREST TRIBES CLAIM NEGLECT</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Resentment is boiling in Venezuela among indigenous tribes, who claim that negligence on the part of the government is leading to the deaths of dozens of their people. The neglect appears to be linked to President Hugo Chavez's decision to expel American missionaries from the region, accusing them of espionage. The missionaries had ministered to the tribe member's health, acting as administrators and ensuring they were cared for. Since their absence, the plight of the native people has worsened.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Put Cities in Financial Bind</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Wall Street's troubles are squeezing cities around the country as the crisis takes it toll on principal sources of city revenue. In addition, loss of usually sound investments and the credit in the municipal bond markets -- where local governments turn for relatively cheap, fast money --has left some cities facing their worst fiscal crises in decades.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SENATOR'S CALLS TAPED BY F.B.I.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In the second week of the trial of Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, the prosecution played three conversations between Mr. Stevens and a friend, Bill Allen, in which Mr. Allen informed the senator that their relationship might also be the subject of a corruption investigation. The phone call was recorded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with whom Mr. Allen was cooperating. Mr. Stevens is accused of knowingly concealing about $250,000 in gifts and services from Mr. Allen, mostly for renovations to his Alaska home. PAGE A16</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> COURT HEARS TOBACCO FRAUD CASE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In its first argument of the court's new term, the Supreme Court heard from the plaintiffs in the Altria Group v. Good case, in which smokers say they were defrauded by tobacco companies that marketed ''light'' cigarettes. At issue is whether smokers should be able to sue under state law given that a federal law bans at least some claims concerning smoking and health. PAGE A17</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> HOUSING EXPANDS IN U.S.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Census Bureau said that the number of houses, apartments and mobile homes in the nation rose by almost four million from 2005 to 2007, to 128.2 million. The numbers also find a possible cause for the difficulty in meeting monthly housing costs: Among owners who reported making a down payment on the homes they occupied, about a third put down only 6 percent or less of the purchase price.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> FAN IN ROOM LOWERS INFANT DEATH</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A study published in The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine found that sleeping in a room with a fan lowers a baby's risk of sudden infant death syndrome by 72 percent. It is the latest evidence to suggest that a baby's sleep environment is a critical factor in the risk of SIDS, which is diagnosed when an infant's sudden death cannot be explained by other factors. The study did not say why fans made a difference, but researchers think that fans circulate air and lower the risk of ''rebreathing'' exhaled carbon dioxide. PAGE A16</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CITY TO CHANGE THE WAY IT GRANTS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Licenses for Crane Operators</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The New York City Buildings Department said it would overhaul its procedures on licensing crane operators, and the written and practical tests for lower-level crane operator's licenses will now be given by the National Commission for the Certification of Crane Operators. The move stems in part from allegations of corruption surrounding the city's acting chief crane inspector, who was arrested this summer on charges of receiving bribes. PAGE A26</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> HERE HE COMES TO SAVE THE DAY</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Clyde Haberman writes that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's decision to try to run for a third term is essentially a lofty proclamation: ''I make a gift of myself to New York to lessen its misfortune.'' But, he adds, that flies in the face of the expressed will of New York City voters, who voted twice in the 1990s to limit the mayor and other officeholders to two terms. PAGE A27</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> On an Ugly Crisis</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The marketing departments of major financial institution have a tricky task: trying to assuage the fears of a jumpy public. (''We love Chase,'' reads the headline of an ad for Washington Mutual. ''And not just because they have a trillion dollars.'') The thrust of many of the ads seems to be: ''You're O.K.''

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> LURING CORPORATE MONEY BACK</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In an attempt to ease the credit crisis, the Internal Revenue Service announced that it would allow corporations to ramp up their use of tax-free loans from overseas subsidiaries. The aim is to encourage American corporations to bring hundreds of billions of dollars kept overseas back to the United States, and could help combat a major problem of the credit crisis: the reluctance by banks to give companies the short-term loans needed for daily business.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> NERVOUS DAYS FOR HEDGE FUNDS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The crisis in the markets has the hedge fund industry on edge, putting even giants like the Citadel Group of Chicago on the defensive. Many of them are considering reducing some of the lavish fees that investors pay Citadel to tend their fortunes. And some investors are already asking for their money back. PAGE B1 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> OIL PRICES CONTINUE TO FALL</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As recently as this summer, energy analysts and traders were predicting that the price for oil would top $200 a barrel by 2010 or sooner. But weakening global demand has sent oil prices on a skid, and prognosticators are talking about prices falling to $70 or lower. Still, economic worries have offset any relief commuters may feel.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> AN AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Camouflage</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> How can a disease that afflicts three million Americans, 90 percent of them women, be as obscure as Sjogren's syndrome, in which the body attacks its own secretory glands and tissues? Experts say it is one of the three most common autoimmune disorders, but few lay people know of it, and doctors rarely think of it when patients describe its symptoms. PAGE D7</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> LESS-INVASIVE PRENATAL TEST</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> For three decades, scientists have been trying to develop a noninvasive prenatal test for Down syndrome that would replace amniocentesis, which can cause miscarriages. Now, scientists using powerful genetic techniques are closing in on that goal with tests that require only a blood sample from the pregnant woman. down PAGE D5</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> RIVALS DIFFER ON ENERGY PLANS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The presidential candidates claim to see America's energy future, but their competing visions have a certain vintage quality: the hard path versus the soft path. The soft path is energy conservation and power from the sun, wind and plants -- the technologies that Senator Barack Obama emphasizes. Senator John McCain is more enthusiastic about building nuclear power plants, the hard path. PAGE D1</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Among the Lockheeds</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Breaking Ground: A Dance Charrette,'' is a yearly event in which five choreographers put together five-minute pieces, and the site is revealed only five days before performances. This year's installment was in Hangar B at Floyd Bennett Field, New York's first municipal airport at the edge of Brooklyn. Roslyn Sulcas says it is decidedly the best dance location of the year.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> DEAR BUBBE: PLEASE VOTE OBAMA</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Sarah Silverman, the acid-tongued comedian who has become a regular presence in viral videos, is now starring in ''The Great Schlep,'' a new video by the Jewish Council for Education and Research, a political action committee. The premise: asking young Jewish voters who are going to vote for Barack Obama to head to Florida to convince their grandparents, who may be on the fence or wary about doing so. ''Who has more power with them than their grandchildren?'' Ms. Silverman asks. PAGE C1</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A number of naturalist artists have made their careers portraying birds. Four new books illuminate the confluence of science, art and ornithology. And though sketching may have given way to the high-tech tools of zoology, the authors agree that drawing continues to be the superior tool. PAGE D4</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Manny Ramirez may be the most dangerous hitter on the Los Angeles Dodgers, who may be the most dangerous team still alive in the baseball postseason. As his team heads into the National League Championship Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, he faces Charlie Manuel, the Phillies manager and Ramirez's former hitting coach, who may best know how to stop him.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> N.B.C.'s ''Football Night in America'' broadcast is loaded with on-air talent -- and that's not necessarily a good thing, writes Richard Sandomir. There are too many moving pieces, and the show does not take advantage of what should be one of its strong points: the reunion of Keith Olbermann and his former SportsCenter co-anchor, Dan Patrick.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The economy may be in turmoil, but that should have little impact on demand for all the luxury suites that will be in the soon-to-be-completed stadiums of several New York sports teams. There are many corporate headquarters in New York and teams like the Yankees remain huge marquee draws. Indeed, for some stadiums, the expensive luxury suites are already sold out.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> She survived a series of Broadway flops before winning critical acclaim in ''The Subject Was Roses,'' in 1964. She went on to play Liz Matthews, a moneyed matriarch, on the television soap opera, ''Another World,'' for which she won an Emmy in 1979. ''Every plummy-voiced English rose of an imitation actress should be dragged to see Miss Dailey,'' a critic wrote. ''She sweats love, breathes hate, weeps desire.'' PAGE B14</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> There is a small cadre of respected bankers and lawyers who have been summoned repeatedly over the last few months to devise ways to help some of the country's ailing financial institutions during the economic crisis. Sometimes they are representing the same firm. Other times they are on opposite sides of the table. And as the Treasury Department looms larger and larger in the crisis, they have even begun representing the government. PAGE F1</span></p>
