  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- John McCain crisscrossed Florida on Wednesday, trying to keep the state in the Republican column as some supporters worried about whether he can catch the better-funded Barack Obama. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I wish I didn't feel like it was over,&quot; said Dawn Poole, a McCain backer who saw him speak at a lumberyard in Miami. &quot;It looks that way, but it's not going to stop me from voting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Maybe we'll be surprised,&quot; she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Greta Rodriguez, a retired administrative assistant from Miami, is &quot;hoping and praying&quot; for McCain to prevail. While Obama is &quot;a little bit ahead in the poll,&quot; a &quot;silent majority&quot; could emerge and pull out Florida for McCain, she said. McCain needs to open the &quot;Pandora's Box&quot; of Obama's background to win, said John Piscola, a former New York school principal who lives in Miami Beach.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A series of Florida polls released between Monday and Wednesday showed Obama with anywhere from a 2- to a 7-percentage-point lead.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We've got to win the state of Florida, my friends, and we're going to win here,&quot; McCain said in Miami.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republican Gov. Charlie Crist and Sen. Mel Martinez, who traveled with McCain on Wednesday, echoed the Arizona senator's optimism about Florida.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain continued to hammer Obama on Wednesday on the economy and national security, saying the Democrat lacked the experience to handle either. The question is whether Obama &quot;has what it takes to protect America from Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda, and other grave threats in the world,&quot; McCain said in Tampa. &quot;And he has given you no reason to answer in the affirmative.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Retired major general J. Scott Gration, an Obama campaign spokesman, criticized McCain for supporting a Bush foreign policy that has not captured bin Laden.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both candidates hit prime time TV on Wednesday. Obama ran a 30-minute commercial at 8 p.m. ET, and a McCain interview in Tampa with CNN's Larry King aired at 9 p.m. ET.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At events in Miami and Riviera Beach, McCain warned that Obama and a Democratic Congress would raise taxes, slowing down the economy even more. After a brief meeting with local business owners in Riviera Beach, McCain criticized Obama's half-hour &quot;infomercial.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;As with other infomercials, he's got a few things he wants to sell you,&quot; McCain said, blasting Obama's plans for &quot;government-run&quot; health care and redistribution of income. He said Obama broke his pledge to take public financing and voters should remember that the ad &quot;was paid for with broken promises.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama, during a speech in North Carolina, said McCain is distorting the details of his economic plan. &quot;If you make under $250,000, you will not see your taxes increase by a single dime,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Tampa, McCain conducted a national security roundtable featuring former military officials and supporters such as former Pennsylvania governor and Homeland Security secretary Tom Ridge and Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut independent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain also criticized Obama for being soft on former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. McCain said he would only meet with new ruler Raul Castro &quot;after they empty the political prisons.&quot; <br /></span></p>
