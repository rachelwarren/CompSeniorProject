  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CHINESE OFFICIAL FIRED</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Growing Milk Scandal</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Chinese authorities arrested a dozen people, fired a senior government official and acknowledged that a wider range of milk products showed traces of a chemical used to disguise poor quality. Officials said a fourth infant had died from tainted baby formula, while health regulators in neighboring Hong Kong announced a broader recall of mainland Chinese-made milk, yogurt and ice cream contaminated with the chemical melamine.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ZIMBABWE TALKS STALLED</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Power-sharing talks between President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai deadlocked over Mr. Mugabe's insistence that he retain control of the state's vast security forces, as well as virtually every other crucial ministry, a senior opposition official said. On Monday, Mr. Mugabe agreed to a deal that requires him to give up some of his powers for the first time in 28 years in office. But he has since proved unwilling to let go of any of the levers of state-sponsored authority he has regularly wielded to repress his rivals. PAGE A10 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> GATES URGES CAUTION ON RUSSIA</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said that he would urge NATO ministers meeting in London to adopt a cautious and deliberate approach toward Russia that reassures newer members along the Russian border without provoking hostilities. In Moscow, the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, said he hoped that Russia and the United States could find a way to improve relations. But Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, in a speech in Germany, said the West must stand up to the Kremlin's ''bullying.'' PAGE A6</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> G.I. HELD IN DEATHS OF TWO SOLDIERS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> An American soldier was in custody in Iraq in the shooting deaths on Sunday of two fellow soldiers at their patrol base near Iskandariya, the American military said. The military did not name the soldier who was being held. An American military spokesman in Baghdad would not say whether the soldier was being held on suspicion of deliberate killing, negligence or for other reasons. PAGE A8</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> MORE WOMEN IN POLITICS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Women have entered politics in greater numbers than ever in the last decade, reaching 18 percent of parliament members worldwide, according to a study by the United Nations Development Fund for Women. If the rate of change holds constant, it will take until 2045 for women to reach parity in the developing world, which the study by Unifem, as the development fund is known, defined as holding between 40 percent and 60 percent of elected parliamentary seats.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Financial Aid for College</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A panel of education experts and researchers proposed a broad reconfiguration of federal policies on financial aid for college, including a simpler application process, Pell Grant maximums linked to the consumer price index and federally financed college savings accounts for children in low-income families.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> AFTER HURRICANE IKE, STILL NO POWER</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Hundreds of thousands of Midwestern residents remained without power after remnants of Hurricane Ike swept through the region on Sunday, bringing torrential downpours and strong winds. Many residents may not have electricity for several more days, utility companies said. PAGE A12</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CHICAGO UNVEILS A GREEN PLAN</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago unveiled perhaps the most aggressive plan of any major American city to reduce heat-trapping gases. The blueprint would change the city's building codes, to promote energy efficiency. PAGE A13</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> TODD PALIN REFUSED TO TESITIFY</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Todd Palin, the husband of the Republican nominee for vice president, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, has refused to testify in a legislative inquiry into whether Ms. Palin or members of her administration abused their power in the dismissal of a top state administrator, a spokesman said. PAGE A14</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CELLPHONE BAN FOR TRAIN OPERATORS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A day after federal investigators said that an engineer in last week's deadly train collision outside Los Angeles had been text-messaging on the job, the state of California temporarily banned the use of all cellular devices by anyone at the controls of a moving train. The crash occurred after the train ran a red light and led to the deaths of 25 people, including the engineer, and injuries to 130 others. PAGE A11</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CARP CAN HAVE CARBS, FOR NOW</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> After being berated for two months by visitors, business owners and elected officials, Pennsylvania has temporarily called off a plan to ban people from feeding bread to carp in Pymatuning Lake. An estimated 500,000 people trek to the lake every year to see a veritable carpet of carp in the water and the state wanted to end the 70-year tradition because it was generating litter and attracting geese that were defecating on local beaches and campgrounds.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 14,600 Acres in Adirondacks</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A 14,600-acre piece of the Adirondacks long prized by environmentalists for its forests and wetlands, including a pond where Ralph Waldo Emerson led a ''philosophers' camp,'' was bought by the Nature Conservancy for $16 million, the group said. The property will not immediately be open to the public because of leases that will last several more years. But the Nature Conservancy said the land would be protected and ultimately added to the Adirondack Forest Preserve in Adirondack Park. PAGE B5 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE GREEKS KNEW WAR</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Bryan Doerries translates the plays of Sophocles for modern audiences, emphasizing those centered on war and its shattering effects on the men who wage it and the families that grapple with its consequences. A recent audience included 11 cadets from the United States Military Academy at West Point. What Sophocles had to say is ''still on point all these years later,'' one said. Clyde Haberman, NYC.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE GALA MUST GO ON</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Share prices, indexes, people's spirits may all be falling, with bleak economic news seemingly at every turn, but the pursuit of money -- for charitable purposes -- still has its place. And so the Champagne flowed on the wraparound patio of Denise Rich's Fifth Avenue penthouse triplex. PAGE B1 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> LOOKING AHEAD TO STARDOM</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At the Tender Age of 5</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Willie Parker predicted his own football future at the age of 5, his father, Willie Sr., remembers. Willie the Younger has long since made good on that prediction, reshaping the image of the Pittsburgh Steelers' running game. Since 2006, he is second in the N.F.L. with 3,053 rushing yards.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> BORN IN OHIO, RAISED IN THE BRONX</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Osborn Engineering Company of Cleveland turned its knowledge of bridge design into an expertise in sports architecture early in the 20th century that made it the creator of an all-star team of facilities including the Polo Grounds, Forbes Field and Fenway and Comiskey Parks. And also a certain structure in the Bronx, now not long for the world. PAGE D2 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE GROUNDWORK FOR A DYNASTY</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In 1993, the last time the Yankees failed to make the post-season, the team faded by losing 12 of 17 games in an agonizing stretch and watched the Toronto Blue Jays sprint away. Still, there was a sense of accomplishment about coming so close. Soon, good and then very good teams followed. PAGE D1</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Means Still Paying for It</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> They are known as ''short sales,'' when a property is sold for less than the value of the mortgage on it, and they are increasing as home prices are tumbling. Reluctantly, banks are agreeing to let some short sales go through. But instead of writing off the unpaid portion of the debt, they want homeowners to sign a note promising to pay some or all of the balance due. PAGE C1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> FUNDS UNINTERESTED IN BANKS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Less than a year ago, the sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East spent billions of dollars for minority stakes in Wall Street banks. But as the values of banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are swooning, Middle East funds are not biting. Bankers in the region say plenty of other, more attractive assets are out there right now. PAGE C4</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> RUSSIA MOVES TO SHORE UP MARKETS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Russian government will inject $20 billion into domestic stocks in an effort to halt the free fall of the Russian stock markets, President Dmitri A. Medvedev said. The two main Russian stock exchanges remained closed after authorities halted trading Wednesday afternoon. The question is whether injecting capital -- which thanks to oil profits, Russia has plenty of -- will restore investor confidence, or whether it will be seen as a sign of desperation.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> FORD SHOWS MORE EFFICIENT F-150</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Ford showed reporters the 2009 model of its F-150 pickup and pitched its fuel economy. The new model, Ford said, is, on average, 8 percent more fuel efficient than its predecessor -- an improvement of roughly one or two miles per gallon. Some versions will be as much as 12 percent more efficient; a new version, the F-150 SFE, or ''superior fuel economy,'' will get 21 miles per gallon on the highway and 15 in city driving, the company said.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The great-grandson of Heinrich Engelhard Steinway, the illiterate German immigrant before the ampersand in Steinway &amp; Sons, he was the last Steinway to run the piano-making company his family started in 1853. PAGE B7</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Getting to them requires clambering over rocky mounds, crab-walking down steep slopes, sliding into irregular niches and scooching into crevices. But those willing to put in the effort can be witness to about 2,000 rock paintings, called pictographs, created by ancient artists and scattered over the 860 rugged acres of Hueco Tanks State Historic Site near El Paso, Tex.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> TRAILING THOREAU</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The north woods of Maine are not exactly as described by Henry David Thoreau a century and a half ago -- for one thing, the virgin forest trees have been cut, regrown and harvested again. But replacement evergreens stand tall again, the ''continuousness of the forest,'' as Thoreau put it, still ''uninterrupted.'' And hiking or paddling in his ''footsteps'' was made easier last year by the inauguration of the Thoreau-Wabanaki Trail. PAGE F4 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The spirits are restless, not to mention irritating, and left a lot of loose ends lying about. Enter our misanthropic dentist, (Ricky Gervais) and a resurrection of past movie figures like W. C. Fields and Cary Grant, along with current ones, like Greg Kinnear and Tea Leoni, in ''Ghost Town.'' A buoyant picture, packed with snappy dialogue, the chemistry of the three leads keep it afloat when similar films have sunk, writes Stephen Holden. Page E8 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> If cowboys had been able to stop at the local saloon, grab a drink and a girl and retreat to the photo booth to produce some memories, it might have looked like this. ''America and the Tintype,'' at the International Center of Photography, exhibits examples from this early form of photography, which was almost like the photo booths of today, albeit with a muddier- looking issue, writes Karen Rosenberg.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Yes, immigration is a complicated and combustible issue -- and the economic meltdown is everyone's top priority.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> This supposed new era of federal activism in the marketplace is going to confront some old problems: the lack of information available to government planners, the inability to keep up with or control complex economic systems, and the fact that political considerations invariably distort the best-laid plans. page A19</span></p>
