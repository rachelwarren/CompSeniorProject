  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain pledged to inspire a new commitment to public service Thursday, as they set aside the rancor of an intense presidential campaign during a two-hour forum on the seventh anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The best way to commemorate, and the best way to show our appreciation for and our love and sympathy for the families of those who have sacrificed, is to serve our country,&quot; McCain said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The question, Obama said later, is how to recreate the spirit of service &quot;not just during times of tragedy, not just during 9/11, but how do we honor those who died, those who sacrificed . . . how do we honor them every day?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In back-to-back conversations largely devoid of partisan recrimination, McCain (R-Ariz.) and Obama (D-Ill.) each urged Americans to honor the victims of the country's worst terrorist attack by dedicating their time to service through teaching, the military, the Peace Corps and faith-based volunteering. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the reality of Campaign 2008 -- a contest that has turned particularly ugly in recent days -- was never far from the surface as both men were challenged by the questioners to explain the often angry tone of their competition for the White House.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain acknowledged the &quot;rough&quot; nature of the campaign and praised Obama's service as a community organizer -- something his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, had mocked during her speech to the Republican national convention.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain defended Palin, saying she had been responding to a barrage of criticism of her own experience as a small-town mayor. But he appeared to chide his supporters who derided Obama's efforts as a young man.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Of course I respect community organizers. Of course I respect people who serve their community,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama did not disparage Palin's service as mayor of Wasilla, praising small-town mayors and noting the presence of many at the Democratic National Convention in Denver last month. &quot;We yak in the Senate. They actually have to fill potholes, trim trees and make sure the garbage is collected,&quot; Obama said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He expressed only &quot;surprise&quot; at Palin's decision to belittle his work as a community organizer, displaying no anger and keeping the sometimes subdued tone that some Democrats have argued he must shed if he is to rally Democrats and appeal to voters waiting for him to display his passion.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama called McCain's service in the military &quot;legendary,&quot; adding that &quot;one of the wonderful things about this campaign is his ability to share that story.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some of the more lighthearted moments of the evening came when each man was asked if he would create a Cabinet-level position on public service -- and then appoint the other to it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain chuckled and said yes before adding that he believes there are too many Cabinet secretaries already.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama laughed and said, &quot;If this is the deal he wants to make right now, I'm committed to appointing him.&quot; Asked whether he would serve in McCain's Cabinet, Obama said, &quot;We've got a little work to do before we get to that.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain also drew laughter when he was asked about encouraging older Americans to participate in public service. They are &quot;living longer and they're more vigorous,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm here to tell you that's a fact.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The 72-year-old candidate then cocked his head and pretended to fall asleep for a moment, letting out a &quot;Zzz.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While the tone of the event was civil, McCain and Obama did outline differing roles for the federal government in fostering volunteerism.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain stressed that the government should not compel service, argued the private sector should take a larger role in disaster relief and said he hoped private companies would allow their employees to volunteer in the community. He declined to put a price tag on his service initiative.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;When you compel someone to do something, you basically are in contradiction to the basic principle of people wanting to serve,&quot; he said, adding later that he would sign a bipartisan Senate bill that would expand government support of service programs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama, who has proposed a $3.5 billion service program, emphasized his belief that government and the private sector could work together to augment each other's efforts.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The solution, he said, is to offer people more ways to volunteer, and he said the government needs to do more to encourage that. &quot;The government is going to have a role,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;My sense is the country yearns for that,&quot; Obama said. &quot;It's hungry for it. What has been missing is a president in the White House that taps into that yearning in a serious way. . . . The choices we offer young people today are too constraining.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Each made a bit of news in the forums.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain pledged to sign a bipartisan bill on national service that is being introduced Friday, prompting applause from the audience in Columbia University's Roone Arledge Auditorium at Lerner Hall.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama said he thought it was wrong for Columbia -- his alma mater -- and other colleges to turn away the Reserve Officers' Training Corps because of differences some students have on military policy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think we've made a mistake on that,&quot; he said. &quot;We should have an honest debate while still having opportunities to serve.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Last month, Jay Winuk, a co-founder of MyGoodDeed.org and the brother of a Sept. 11 victim, wrote to both campaigns, asking them to set aside campaigning to participate in the event.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Winuk's younger brother Glenn was a partner at the law firm Holland and Knight and a volunteer firefighter in Jericho, Long Island, who died after rushing into the World Trade Center to provide assistance on 9/11.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Earlier in the day, the presidential rivals made a joint appearance at Ground Zero to honor the victims of the terrorist attacks. They chatted as they walked side by side down a long ramp to the site, where they talked with family members of 9/11 victims as well as first responders before laying roses in the reflecting pool commemorating the attacks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both men had promised to take a break from politics for a day, suspending all television commercials and other campaign activities. A day after a barrage of attack e-mails from both sides poured into reporters' inboxes, there were none from McCain, Obama or their respective political parties.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Today, we honor the memory of the lives that were lost on September 11, 2001, and grieve with the families and friends who lost someone they loved in New York City, at the Pentagon, and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. We will never forget those who died,&quot; a statement from Obama read.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the morning, McCain paid a somber visit to the field where United Flight 93 crashed, marking the moment that passengers overwhelmed terrorists onboard the ill-fated airliner.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The evening forum, in which both men took questions for roughly an hour from Time magazine's managing editor, Richard Stengel, and PBS &quot;NewsHour&quot; senior correspondent and political editor Judy Woodruff, was organized by ServiceNation, a group dedicated to increasing service by Americans, and hosted by Time and CNN. McCain went first, and Obama was allowed to listen, organizers said, because they would not be asked identical questions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While Obama and McCain put aside their attacks, the Illinois Democrat continued his rapprochement with former president Bill Clinton with a long, private get-together in Harlem. Over sandwiches and pizza, the two chitchatted about Clinton's commute from suburban Chappaqua, the work of the former president's international charitable organization and the presidential campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I've agreed to do a substantial number of things&quot; for Obama, Clinton told a small pool of reporters. &quot;Whatever I'm asked to do.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We're putting him to work,&quot; Obama chimed in.</span></p>
