  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PUZZLED-SOUNDING PUTIN</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Defends Georgia Invasion</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Vladimir V. Putin spent more than three hours before a collection of Russia experts from around the world, trying to make the case for Russia's having sent columns of armor into Georgia. In tones that were alternately pugilistic and needy, he expressed only bafflement that those in the West did not accept Russia's explanation that it had simply acted in defense of its citizens.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> INDICATION OF A COVER-UP</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A secretly recorded conversation played in a Miami courtroom indicated that members of Argentina's government may have participated in a cover-up with the government of President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela to hide the fact that $800,000 seized at a Buenos Aires airport was intended as a secret campaign contribution to Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who was elected president of Argentina two months later.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> FIGHTING DEMOCRACY IN THAILAND</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The thousands of protesters on the grounds on the prime minister's office in Bangkok may look like the kind of pro-democracy uprising that has toppled dictators from the Philippines to Serbia. But the new order they propose would replace an elected Parliament with one that is mostly appointed, keeping power in the hands of the country's royalist, bureaucratic, military elite. PAGE A12</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE DAY THE BOMBS FELL</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Residents of Palomares, Spain, would like to forget the day more than 42 years ago when a United States bomber exploded during airborne refueling and dropped three of its hydrogen bombs around the poor farming village. But it is hard to forget when radioactive snails turn up and fresh tracts of land are confiscated for additional testing and cleanup. PAGE A13</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> JAPAN NEGOTIATES IRAQ WITHDRAWAL</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Japan said that it wanted to withdraw its remaining military personnel from Iraq by year's end, wrapping up an overseas mission that has pleased Washington but divided Japan. Defense Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said that the country was negotiating a withdrawal of its small military airlift mission because of the improved security situation in Iraq and that his country wanted to shift its priority to Afghanistan. PAGE A10</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PRAISE FOR NEW PAKISTAN LEADER</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan said that he had found a better working environment in Pakistan with the election of the new president, Asif Ali Zardari, above, welcoming what he described as the ''serious and fundamental change'' in Pakistan's attitude. Mr. Karzai had an often testy relationship with Mr. Zardari's predecessor, Pervez Musharraf. PAGE A10</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> An unusually detailed study of people newly infected with H.I.V. in the United States has confirmed that the majority of new cases occur among gay and bisexual men and that blacks are most at risk. But the data show that whites and blacks tend to be infected at different times in their lives with the virus that causes AIDS. PAGE A17 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> MONTANA GOVERNOR SPARKS STORM</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A political dust-up has blown up in Montana over a speech by Gov. Brian Schweitzer, above, from earlier this summer, archived and recently recovered on the Internet, in which he said he had exerted influence to swing the 2006 Senate race in favor of Jon Tester, a Democrat whose narrow victory swung majority control of the United States Senate to the Democrats. Mr. Schweitzer, a Democrat, now says the stories in the speech were entirely made up. PAGE A15 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> HEALTH CARE CEDES POLITICAL STAGE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As energy and the economy consume more of the country's political discourse, health care is an issue that can seem to vacillate in importance by the day, the place and the audience. In some Congessional contests it has been placed front and center. But in others it has become absorbed by the electorate's broader anxiety. PAGE A20</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> BIDEN ON THE TRAIL, GAFFES IN TOW</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> On the campaign trail with Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, a day without a cringe-inducing gaffe is a rare blessing. He has not been too blessed lately. Just this week, Mr. Biden mused that the Democrats' nominee for president, Senator Barack Obama, might have been better off with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton as his running mate.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> GREGORY MCDONALD</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> An Edgar Award-winning crime writer whose acidly funny novels starring the subversive sleuth I. M. Fletcher, breezily known as Fletch, have sold millions of copies and inspired two Hollywood films, he was 71. PAGE A21</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> MARTIN TYTELL</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Perhaps the greatest of typewriter repairmen, he was a boon to American spies during World War II, the defense lawyers for Alger Hiss, writers like Dorothy Parker, newsmen like David Brinkley and thousands of everyday scriveners who needed him to keep their typewriters (not to mention their computer-resistant pride) intact. He was 94. PAGE A21 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Tampa Bay's Playoff Drive</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Tampa Bay Rays arrive in Yankeeland having taken two of three games against the Boston Red Sox in rather dramatic fashion. They got only two hits in 36 at-bats with runners in scoring position in the series. One was a three-run home run to win the finale. The other was a double to drive in the decisive run on Tuesday. ''We're in a good place right now,'' Manager Joe Maddon said. PAGE D5 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> HIS FATHER'S SON</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Chicago Bears fullback Jason McKie's father, Nevil, was a military man, a lifer, the kind of guy who retired from the Air Force after 21 years and 3 months of service. When it came time last year for McKie to choose a focus for philanthropic works, his father told him, ''Think about what you're close to.'' He did. The Jason McKie Foundation helps the families of soldiers. PAGE D32</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> JUDGE THROWS OUT CHARGES</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> From Steroids Investigation</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A judge threw out criminal indictments against the central figures in a wide-ranging national steroids investigation, citing a series of blunders and missteps by prosecutors for the Albany County district attorney, P. David Soares. If upheld, the decision could unravel other elements of Mr. Soares's criminal investigation, which has spanned at least four states and so far resulted in 17 guilty pleas.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> AFGHAN INTRIGUE IN A COURTROOM</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The trial of Haji Bashir Noorzai, an Afghan man charged with running an international drug ring, is not unusual in having produced widely contrasting portraits of Mr. Noorzai's intent and motives. But the case has an extraordinary degree of intrigue about it because it has brought into a New York City courtroom the chaos of Afghanistan and the grip of its narcotics trade, and the looming figure of Mullah Mohammad Omar, one of the most wanted men in the world. PAGE B5 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> BUSH DEDICATES MEMORIAL</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> For President Bush, the seventh anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks brought to mind a very specific number: 2,557, the number of days, as of Thursday, that have passed without another attack on American soil. Mr. Bush invoked that figure during a ceremony at the Pentagon, where he presided over the dedication of a memorial to honor the 184 men, women and children who died when a hijacked plane crashed into it.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Falling Gasoline Prices</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Hurricane Ike has forced thousands to fill up their car's gas tank and evacuate inland, draining many gas stations of their supplies completely. The storm has also forced oil companies to shut down major production and refining facilities in Texas, the second storm in two weeks to do so, forcing up gasoline prices even as the price of oil continued to decline on international markets. PAGE C1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CHINA PRESSES FOR UNIONS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> China is putting pressure onsome of the world's biggest corporations to allow state-approved unions to form in their Chinese plants and offices, a move that seems to be part of an effort to address some of the ugly consequences of China's dynamic economic growth. But many companies fear that allowing the unions will significantly increase the cost of doing business there. PAGE C1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A.I.G. CONTINUES DECLINE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> With investors looking at Lehman Brothers and worried that A.I.G. may be another collateral victim, A.I.G. shares closed down again, and are now nearly 50 percent off their value when the company's new chief executive, Robert B. Willumstad, took over in June. But a spokesman said the company would not let the market pressure it into speeding up the publication of the new business plan, scheduled for Sept. 25. PAGE C1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SHORTCHANGING UNCLE SAM</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Downside: Monitoring by an arm of the Internal Revenue Service found that almost two out of three independent tax preparers -- the most numerous category -- failed to fill out accurate returns for their clients. Potential upside: Of those inaccurate returns, most were in the clients' favor. More downside: About one-third left clients paying too much. PAGE C4</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> DEUTSCHE BANK WANTS POSTBANK</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Deutsche Bank is poised to announce on Friday that it will buy a controlling stake in Postbank, a relatively modest but profitable German institution. Postbank's falling share price in the last month helped tip the balance in favor of an acquisition, analysts said, outweighing concerns that its less-affluent client base would make for an uneasy fit with Deutsche Bank's own retail operations in Germany. PAGE C4</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> JULY IMPORTS OUTPACE EXPORTS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The trade deficit reached a 16-month high in July despite a 3.3 percent increase in exports from June. Demand rose for motor vehicles, consumer goods and industrial products. Imports were up 3.9 percent for the month, largely because of the surging cost of foreign petroleum and oil-derived products. A separate report said that prices of non-petroleum imports dipped slightly last month, an encouraging sign that inflation may have slowed. PAGE C4</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But Not a Spray Can to Be Found</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Street life conjures up a barrage of imagery. Graffiti, loud music, laughter, love and violence. The art of the streets often matches this explosion. ''Street Art Street Life,'' opening at the Bronx Museum of the Arts, is an exhibition of mostly black and white photographs, with some video installations, of city dwellers wearing their lives on their streets, writes Holland Cotter. Page E27 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> N.E.A. CHAIRMAN TO STEP DOWN</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When Dana Gioia was appointed president of the National Endowment for the Arts, he was ascending to a snarled mass. Infighting and politics had earned the organization a slashed budget and an uncertain future. Now that the agency has recovered somewhat, Mr. Gioia has decided to step down to focus on his own writing. Page E3 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> LETTING OUT YOUR INNER CLOWN</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Clowning may be the new source of solace for the troubled. Not the clowning of big red shoes, but that of physical clowns like Charlie Chaplin or Lucille Ball. Workshops, classes at major universities and a general influx of instructors to America display a trend. Leaving only the question: How do you teach people to be funny? Page E5 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> BLACK IN AMERICA, VIBRANT IN PAINT</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Aaron Douglas, muralist and painter, offers his vision of being African-American in 1920 America in ''Aaron Douglas: African-American Modernist,'' an exhibition at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Bringing an Afro-centric image, overlaid with a heroic, triumphant flavor, his works, such as a self-portrait, above, feature concentric bands of light, writes Ken Johnson. Page E29 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It runs along the southern edge of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, but the lakes country -- west of Asheville, N.C., and south of Knoxville, Tenn. -- is free of Appalachia's standard roadside attractions and souvenir clutter. What it does have is fishing and hiking and mountain-biking and five dam-created reservoirs that some have called the Finger Lakes of the South. PAGE F1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> LOW-TECH GETAWAYS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A weekend home away from the distractions of the 21st century requires not only skipping the cable or satellite TV access, Internet, cellphone or BlackBerry. Going low-tech calls for even less: no electric can opener, no microwave (except under certain extenuating circumstances) no dishwasher. Relax. It can be done. PAGE F2 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Two years ago, Inspector General Earl Devaney said: ''Short of a crime, anything goes at the Department of the Interior.'' It now appears that crime could be part of the mix. PAGE A22</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A MESSAGE FROM JOHN MCCAIN</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The most disheartening aspect of a scurrilous Republican ad falsely accusing Barack Obama of promoting sex education for kindergarten children is its closing line: ''I'm John McCain, and I approved this message.'' PAGE A22</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> DAVID BROOKS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Goldwater's vision was highly individualistic and celebrated a certain sort of person -- the stout pioneer crossing the West, the risk-taking entrepreneur with a vision, the stalwart hero fighting the collectivist foe. The problem is, this individualist description of human nature seems to be wrong, and it is the main impediment to Republican modernization. PAGE A23</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE ORIGINS OF THE UNIVERSE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In an Op-Ed article, Brian Greene, a professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia, explains how the Large Hadron Collider, which was turned on this week in a lab where many of the scientists wore pajamas, above, could help unlock the secrets of the universe and its origins. He also explains why the much-discussed risks of the collider creating a black hole that will devour the Earth are wildly overblown. PAGE A23</span></p>
