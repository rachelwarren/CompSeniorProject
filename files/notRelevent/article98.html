  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Raleigh, N.C.: Good morning. Have you been hearing any buzz about more retirements from House Republicans? Informed speculation? My understanding is that, unlike the Senate, it's no fun to be in the minority in the House. The Democrats figure to pick up another 20-30 seats, and a key factor has been House Republican retirements. Is that going to get worse?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Good morning everyone. Six days left! Can you believe it?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I see Raleigh is already jumping the gun. I have not heard talk of new retirements but that is certain to be a concern -- if there are indeed Republicans left to retire. It would be hard to be believe that the GOP hasn't hit rock bottom this cycle. But let's see how the Democrats handle their supermajorities.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pennsylvania: Shailagh, given that (almost) everyone pretty much has called the election for Obama, is there any sense that the still many days left to go works against Obama -- i.e. do you think his campaign wishes that the election was now, and that the longer there is to go, the more McCain could actually pull closer (and maybe even pull this out)?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: No question, the Obama campaign would love this election to happen right now. Who wouldn't? But in fact it is happening right now because people are voting early in so many states, at a pace that suggests we may be heading into an era when elections take place over the course of several weeks, with the first Tuesday in November viewed as a deadline as opposed to a starting point.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: Brava on your appearance in the drinking game video with Milbank. You are braver than I.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Washington Sketch Video: Buzzword Bingo (washingtonpost.com, Oct. 16)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Thanks! I must say, that video got far more attention than any debate story I've ever written. And that was non-alcoholic beer, for the record.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fort Lee, N.J.: No matter what happens on Tuesday, has Howard Dean's 50-state strategy been vindicated, just because the GOP has had to fight in areas they never thought they would have to visit again?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Absolutely it's been vindicated. This election is being fought not just state by state, but in Maine and Nebraska, within individual congressional districts. How great is that? At some point both parties will figure this out and then anything goes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And that was non-alcoholic beer, for the record: I'd think just hanging out with Milbank and Balz would be intoxicating enough!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Absolutely. My colleagues, my heroes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bethesda, Md.: Do you think Obama's 30-minute infomercial is a good strategy? Seems like overkill at this point, and delaying the World Series seems like a bad idea.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Doesn't it all seem like overkill at this point?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Keep in mind the guiding principle of the Obama campaign: the more time people have to get to know him, the more inclined they are to support him. So consider this part of the effort to close the deal.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Assuming Obama wins, any idea what cause Michele Obama would pursue with the First Lady's pulpit? I thought Kathleen Parker's article about Laura Bush's influence was interesting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Laura Bush's Bully Pulpit (Post, Oct. 29)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: She's been focused on military families these past months, and I would expect that to continue. I would be shocked to see her take on a big ambitious policy agenda. It's not her style.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fairfax, Va.: Who is in greater danger: Saxby Chambliss or Mitch McConnell? What chance do you give that either loses on Tuesday?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: I will go out on a limb and say Saxby Chambliss. He hasn't been around as long, and Obama has a lot of strong support in Georgia, including hundreds of thousands of African American voters who weren't even registered before this year. Either would be a big upset, and would surprise me, but the Obama factor makes Georgia the bigger wildcard.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Voter Registration: The Canadians have a very simple and fool proof voter registration system: You check off that you would like to be registered to vote when you file your taxes. Why can't we just import the system?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: I'm not sure about Canada, but elections are run by local governments here, so it's very tough to take any sort of national approach to voting in the U.S. Check out some of websites that keep track of early voting -- it's astonishing how much the rules vary.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain-Palin Friction: Is this story growing in intensity with the whack-job and ignoramis comments being floated out of teh McCain campaign? It seems the campaign is falling apart just at the time they need it to close ranks? Or is this an internal indicator of the McCain campaign staff deciding they're going to lose, so it's every man/woman for themselves?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Losing campaign fall apart, that's just political gravity. And of course Sarah Palin is going to take a lot of the heat, because for better or worse, she has defined the last six weeks of the election. Chances are we haven't seen anything yet, compared to the stories that are likely to flow after next Tuesday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Girard, Ohio: Obama's not delaying the World Series -- the first pitch will be thrown on time, but the pre-game show will be truncated, according to FOX account executive Joe Coppola. Just FYI.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Thanks for the clarification.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: Why were Democrats unable to get these new African American voters to the polls in previous election cycles?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Because they didn't compete for a lot of states that have large black populations -- like much of the South.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Minnesota: What do you think about Palin in 2012? It seems to me that her base of support is too narrow to be at the top of a ticket.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Remember when people were wondering about Obama after his 2004 speech? Hard to believe that was just four years ago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I'm not sure Palin has the talent to climb that high, that quickly. Strictly as the chief executive of his campaign, Obama has no rival in politics. But I'm fully prepared to be surprised.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Takoma Park, Md.: Has Biden had plastic surgery? His face looks odd. Reminds me of Greta Van Susteren on Fox News.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: I don't know!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Keep in mind that Biden has undergone two rounds of mega-brain surgery, which means two de facto face lifts. It was 20 years ago, but still -- he was in his 40s. So maybe that's what people are seeing. He doesn't look different to me, compared to a few years ago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bloomington, Ind.: Good morning Shailagh. Where are you? Still reporting about that old presidential campaign? My lovely companion can't wait for the election to be over because it's all I talk about. As a pro, how do you get away from all the political chatter?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: The country is going to sink into a massive national depression after this is over. People will have no idea what to do with all the energy they've spent stressing out about their candidate, watching all that cable TV, and refreshing websites.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I recommend a fantasy baseball team. It's basically the same exercise described above, but you can win money.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fort Myers, Fla.: Pew has Obama up by 16 points, but Rasmussen has him up by only 3. What gives? They're both decent pollsters, right?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Polls are so scary these days, because of the cell phone factor and the uncertainty about who will vote. Focus on the averages compiled on websites like fivethirtyeight.com and pollster.com and on the individual state polls, which are sampling more narrow groups.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chicago: Hey Shailagh, what drinking game are you and Milbank going to play on election night?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: I sure wish Dana were going to be in Chicago on Tuesday, but I think he's planning to spend the evening in Arizona.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Why is Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) running unopposed for re-election? I find it hard to believe that the GOP could not find someone to run against him. If he really is that popular, does he have national aspirations?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Republicans had terrible problems recruiting this year, and we're about to find out why. Actually, in the interest of being fair and balanced, I wouldn't call this a standout year for Democratic Senate and House candidates, either. The 2006 crop was far more impressive.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Princeton, N.J.: I am 70 years old. When I was young there were the Taft wing and the Rockefeller wing of the Republican Party. The Rockefeller wing is dying. The Taft wing has been taken over by anti-intellectual religious zealots. Is their any hope that the Republican Party can get back to its roots?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: It certainly doesn't seem to be headed in that direction now. But how the Republican Party picks itself up and moves forward will surely be a fascinating parallel narrative over the next few election cycles.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Avon Park, Fla.: As an Obama supporter I'm a little concerned that his infomercial tonight could cause overexposure, which could lead to voter fatigue about him. Is there a significant chance that people could get tired of Obama and thus move to McCain as a result?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: I can tell you're an Obama supporter because you're exhibiting the telltale signs: anxiety, impatience, paranoia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sure, this probably is overkill. It's also a novelty, so it won't come off as just another ad, but it certainly is a splashy way to end.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Purcellville, Va.: Do you see Mark Warner's impressive lead in Virginia having a coattail effect not only for Obama but for Democratic candidates for the U.S. House? For example, many people may not be familiar with the 10th District's Judy Feder, but while they're voting a Democratic ticket, will she likely get a boost?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Maybe. Dozens of marginal House seats fall into this category, especially suburban districts and those that include college towns. If Obama has massive turnout, and McCain does just okay getting his folks to the polls, there could be a tsunami.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: Good morning, Shailagh. What congressional races in particular will you be watching on Election Night to determine overall trends, including a possible Democratic wave? Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Great question.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here's a list of a few where the polls close early and that we consider telling: Virginia 2, Indiana 3, Kentucky 2, Florida 21 and 25.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Scarsdale, N.Y.: Thanks, Charlie Crist. Thanks a lot, traitor. You just handed Florida to Obama by extending the hours for early voting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shailagh Murray: Or maybe he was just trying to keep the Supreme Court out of this election. My guess is Florida doesn't want another voting controversy on its doorstep.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Folks, I can't believe I am saying this, but goodbye until after the election!!! And when you vote on Tuesday, wear comfortable shoes and bring a book.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cheers, Shailagh</span></p>
