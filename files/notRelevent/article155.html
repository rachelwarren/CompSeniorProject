  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I spent a few minutes with Barack Obama on my last campaign outing, and one thing struck me during our brief chat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He was genial and relaxed, but more than that, he wasn't on, the way so many politicians are when courting voters or journalists. He wasn't trying to impress me. He was just being himself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A small thing, to be sure, but rather unusual in his profession. The first time I had a lengthy conversation with Bill Clinton, he was fascinating and charming but also performing, conveying the impression he had nothing better to do in the world than talk to you. The first time I tagged along with George W. Bush, he was joking and talking baseball with me and other reporters on his campaign plane, most of whom had already received nicknames.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But Obama marches to his own drummer. He's a low-metabolism guy, even during periods when he's under assault and the pundits are urging him to get mad. That, aides tell me, is the way he is, never too high or too low. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We've always known this, on some level, in that we've seen his reserved manner, the way he listens sympathetically to people on the trail but doesn't usually hug them or outwardly feel their pain. In the past few weeks, though, as his cautious response to the financial crisis has been contrasted with John McCain's zigzag approach, the Democratic side has been touting this as a major selling point. No Drama Obama and all that.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And it matters: A new poll gives him a 20-point edge over McCain for having the &quot;right temperament.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But is that quality also responsible for his difficulty in &quot;connecting&quot; with working-class voters, as opposed to more educated types who admire his speechmaking and writing abilities?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This trait comes up in three recent pieces and is worth pondering as Obama prepares to leave the trail to visit his ailing grandmother in Hawaii. Matt Bai, in the NYT Magazine:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Obama's greatest asset as a candidate, the trait that has enabled him to overcome both a thin r&Atilde;&copy;sum&Atilde;&copy; and the resistance of his own party's establishment, is his placidity. Even more than through his ability to give a rousing speech (plenty of other candidates, from Ted Kennedy to Howard Dean, could do that), Obama has differentiated himself from recent Democrats by conveying a sense of inner security that is highly unusual in a business of people who have chosen to spend every day asking people to love them. He does not seem like a candidate who's going to switch to earth tones in his middle age or who's going to start dressing up in camouflage to rediscover his inner Rambo. Obama is content to meet the world on his terms, and something about that inspires confidence.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;And yet that same lack of pathetic neediness may in fact be a detriment when it comes to persuading voters who, culturally or ideologically, just aren't predisposed to like him. I once heard a friend of Obama's compare him with Bill Clinton this way: if Clinton sees you walking down the other side of the street, he immediately crosses over to shake your hand; if Obama sees you coming, he nods and waits for you to cross.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Waldman, in American Prospect:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;While McCain's campaign is showing who he is and what he'll stoop to, voters are discovering that whatever else you think about Barack Obama, the man is calm. Like a human Xanax, he soothes all those around him. Unlike McCain, who reacted to the economic crisis with as many different policies as there were days in the week, Obama related the events to his fundamental message of change, and assured Americans in Rooseveltian terms that the country would endure. As they watched the debates, many voters were no doubt surprised to see not the crazy radical they had been led to believe Obama was, but a perfectly sane fellow who sounded more reasonable -- and much more in control -- than his opponent.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">David Brooks sees the same qualities:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;He has shown the same untroubled self-confidence day after day. There has never been a moment when, at least in public, he seems gripped by inner turmoil. It's not willpower or self-discipline he shows as much as an organized unconscious. Through some deep, bottom-up process, he has developed strategies for equanimity, and now he's become a homeostasis machine . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;At Obama rallies, the candidate is the wooed not the wooer. He doesn't seem to need the audience's love. But they need his. The audiences hunger for his affection, while he is calm, appreciative and didactic.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Human Xanax. Homeostasis machine. Not usually the qualities associated with ambitious candidates. And could it lead to what journalists secretly fear most: a boring presidency?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now for the new numbers: Obama leads McCain 52 to 42, &quot;with a growing number of voters saying they are comfortable with his values, background and ability to serve as commander in chief, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Fifty-five percent of voters say Gov. Palin isn't qualified to be president if the need arises, up from 50% two weeks ago. And when given a list of possible concerns about Sen. McCain, voters were by far most likely to say they worry about Gov. Palin's qualification to be president.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By the way, I'm all for candidates looking good, but doggone it, do they do this in the &quot;real America&quot;?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The Republican National Committee appears to have spent more than $150,000 to clothe and accessorize vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and her family since her surprise pick by John McCain in late August.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This includes a K$75 $75K shopping spree at Neiman Marcus. What would Joe Sixpack say about that?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At times Palin seems to be putting us back in the Clinton administration. First there was Troopergate, and now Travelgate:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Gov. Sarah Palin charged the state for her children to travel with her, including to events where they were not invited, and later amended expense reports to specify that they were on official business,&quot; the AP reports.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The charges included costs for hotel and commercial flights for three daughters to join Palin to watch their father in a snowmobile race, and a trip to New York, where the governor attended a five-hour conference and stayed with 17-year-old Bristol for five days and four nights in a luxury hotel.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Total expenses charged for the three daughters: $21,012.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the absence of the slightest bit of media outrage, McCain and his allies are pressing the issue of whether it's fair for one candidate to amass $150 million in a month while the other one is limited to $42 million. National Review Editor Rich Lowry wonders what would happen if the situation was reversed:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Imagine if a Republican presidential candidate had pledged to take public financing, but instead dealt the post-Watergate campaign-financing system a blow from which it will never recover. If he raised $600 million and out-advertised his opponent nationwide by 4-1. This candidate's campaign would be pronounced 'an obscene effort to buy the election.' Powell, no doubt, would be 'troubled.' But Barack Obama does it and everyone stands back in admiration.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Speaking of Lowry, he accuses a CNN correspondent of distortion for telling Palin that someone at his magazine had written: &quot;I can't tell whether Sarah Palin is incompetent, stupid, unqualified, corrupt or all of the above.&quot; Lowry is right -- the NR piece was about the way the media covers her: &quot;Watching press coverage of the Republican candidate for vice president, it's sometimes hard to decide whether Sarah Palin is incompetent, stupid, unqualified, corrupt, backward, or -- or, well, all of the above.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">First I reported that Maureen Dowd had become persona non grata on the McCain plane, and now Politico reports that the club is growing:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Time columnist Joe Klein, who's been a forceful critic of the McCain campaign (and already said he's unwilling to accept a post-election apology), has found himself without a seat on the McCain or Palin planes the past four months. In June, Klein was kept from boarding the McCain plane over what they said had been a security issue. More recently, when trying to fly on the Palin plane last week, Klein told Politico over e-mail that the campaign's response was he 'couldn't be accommodated at this time.'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot; 'I've done nine presidential campaigns and this is the first time this has ever happened to me,' Klein said. 'I was even allowed -- I won't say welcomed -- on the Clinton plane in the summer of 1996 after I was revealed as the author of Primary Colors.' . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Campaign spokesperson Michael Goldfarb responded that 'we don't allow Daily Kos diarists on board either.' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kind of a low blow, if you ask me.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here's the Joe Klein response to bloggers' suggestions that Time should pull all its correspondents in solidarity:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;My job is different from Jay Carney's, Michael Scherer's and Mark Halperin's. They are paid to report and, to a certain extent, analyze. They operate under real, and valuable, journalistic restrictions. Their jobs are especially tough when covering a campaign as despicable as McCain's has been: an important part of their brief is to try to see the race through the eyes of the McCain campaign and explain to the rest of us what that looks like . . . I'm paid to have opinions.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tina Brown is sympathetic to John McCain's running mate:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I suspect that Palin is harboring an angry contempt for her running mate and his handlers. The way they chose her in the first place reeked of dismissiveness. When Hillary got whacked, they made it clear that any skirt on the ticket would do, as long as she was sure to rouse the base. Then they treated her as a retard and wouldn't let her talk to a reporter. The Couric debacle was just about those idiots giving her the wrong lines . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The new received wisdom is that when the Republicans lose, Palin, with a supporting Reality Show cast of Todd, Bristol, Track and Trig, will cash in politics to become a high-rolling TV star. Why does it have to be either or?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Christopher Hitchens, on the other hand, is . . . not:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The problem with Gov. Palin is not that she lacks experience. It's that she quite plainly lacks intellectual curiosity. It is not snobbish to harbor grave doubts about somebody who seems uninterested in reading for pleasure or recreation and whose only interest in her local public library is sniffing round its shelves for books that ought to be removed for expressing impure ideas.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Nor is it snobbish, let alone sexist, to express doubts about someone who, as late as March 2007, could tell Alaska Business Monthly, 'I've been so focused on state government, I haven't really focused much on the war in Iraq. I heard on the news about the new deployments, and while I support our president, Condoleezza Rice and the administration, I want to know that we have an exit plan in place.' This statement deserves to be called mindless, because, first, it is made up of stale and received and overheard bits and bobs from everyday media babble and, second, because you cannot really coherently say that you support both the administration and an 'exit plan.' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At Right Wing Nuthouse, Rick Moran tells his fellow nuts to get a grip:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The point is very simple -- too simple for some who seek to complicate matters by ascribing the absolute worst possible motives to Obama and fear his coming administration as medieval peasants feared the appearance of a comet. Ignorance of history and a lack of common sense has caused many on the right to go stark raving, around the bend, screw loose, bat out of hell nutzo.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Obama will not turn America into a Marxist state. There will be no gulags or prison camps where conservatives and Obama regime opponents will be rounded up and sent for re-education (even though there is a sizable subset of Obama supporters who would no doubt crave such treatment of righties).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Obama will not cancel future elections, initiate Soviet style restrictions on free speech (more on the Fairness Doctrine later which, btw, is hardly 'a Soviet style restriction'), make us stand in line for toilet paper, or place his smiling visage on 10 story high office buildings in order to perpetrate a cult of personality (I think).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Obama will not 'take away' your guns, close churches, shutter conservative newspapers, shut down Fox News, darken conservative blogs, or take any other actions that would smack of dictatorship or authoritarianism.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Holy Christ! We just went through 8 fricking years of listening to the left babble on about all of this crap and now we have to read this kind of garbage from conservatives? Will you listen to yourselves? We have stood shoulder to shoulder these past 8 years laughing at, belittling, screaming about, and pointing a finger of shame at the left for saying many of the exact same things about Bush that you are already saying about Obama.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama has been on a roll with newspaper endorsements, winning a bunch in papers that backed Bush last time. But former Philadelphia Inquirer staffer Tom Ferrick points out:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The Inquirer endorsed Barack Obama on Sunday. Sort of.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;There was a dissenting opinion that ran below the main editorial that stated the case for John McCain. Insiders at the paper tell me that was added at the insistence of Brian Tierney, a life-long Republican who also happens to be the newspaper's publisher.&quot;</span></p>
