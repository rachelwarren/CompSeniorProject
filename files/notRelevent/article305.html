  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Post TV columnist Lisa de Moraes was online Friday, Oct. 3 at 1 p.m. ET and wants to know who you think does folksy 'n' adorable better -- Fey or Palin, what show should be shot now that &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; is good 'n' dead, and whether a Rosie O'Donnell variety special makes NBC crazy like a Fox, or just plain ol' nuts.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The transcript follows.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa Blogs From the Press Tour| TV columns| On TV discussion transcripts. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">De Moraes has written &quot;The TV Column&quot; for The Post since 1998. She served as the TV editor for the entertainment industry trade publication the &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; for almost a decade.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Providence, R.I.: If McCain and Palin lose, how long before she gets her own TV show?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Hi. My money's on her becoming &quot;The Daily Show's&quot; Senior Moose Field-Dressing Correspondent the following week.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Los Angeles: Did you catch &quot;Dirty Sexy Money&quot;? I liked it, but what exactly was the re-tool? Getting rid of most of the women (girl twin, drunk wife, transexual girlfriend)? Is the twin character gone for good? I seem to remember the actress had some personal issues. Did they explain what happened to her, or is she like Tiger from &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; ... disappearing, never to return or be mentioned again?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Yes, Twin Chick has been disappeared without explanation. Also, priest son is now working for Daddy Sutherland, Lucy Liu has takent her Predator Chick routine to the show, and Peter Krause's character is no longer so tightly wound he won't deck Junior after catching him making out with his wife, Lisa. All welcome changes...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Silver Spring, Md.: Isn't &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot; amazing? I think that if I were depressed, that show would cheer me right up. Maybe their new ad campaign should be &quot;Pushing Daisies: Better Than Prozac.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Yes, it's amazing how drenching the screen with color cheers you up. I'm surprised all the other shows haven't figured this out. Maybe &quot;Heroes&quot; should give it a try -- based on this week's numbers. But did't you find Voiceover Guy just a teensy bit too much this week?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Silver Spring, Md.: I cannot wait for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; this week (and wow I don't say that often). Not only is Tina Fey coming back to play Palin, Oprah is going to play Gwen Ifill. And Darell Hammond probably will add another old white character to his resume and play Joe Biden. Also, I think Anne Hathaway is hosting. I wonder if they'll make fun of her jailed ex-boyfriend.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: I'm guessing they had to take a pledge to not do any jokes about her ex in order to snag her as host. Letterman, to his credit, asked her about it when she popped up on her show to plug her new flick and she said rather icily she was not ready to discuss it...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Obligatory David Caruso question: Will the day come when Caruso embraces his &quot;Caruso-ness&quot; and, like William Shatner and the late Robert Goulet, figure out that self-parody is the surest route to being loved and to enjoying a career well into your '70s? Or does he really think he's a serious actor?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: David Caruso appears to be going down the Self-Parody Road already. For the CBS upfront presentation two Mays ago, he'd recorded pretty funny video in which he took off his shades, peered into the camera and announced which day of the week the programming chief was now going to discuss..</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Harrisburg, Pa.: Pookie, Maybe it's the still new crop of sycophants or maybe it's the addition of his little private-eye buddy, but it sure looks like Dr. House has nuked the fridge. What do you think?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: It's tragic. I think he's even getting highlights in his hair now. He looked suspicious like he's going to Ryan Seacrest's hair person last week...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Jumping the Shark: Lisa, I believe your assessment of &quot;Big Bang Theory&quot; is that it's jumping the shark. Getting rid of Penny is not good for the show. Who really wants to watch two geeks get it on? But watching the geek strive for the pretty girl provides good commontary. Penny provides good comic relief to the over-people's-heads comments made by the scientists. Brings the show down a little. Now, you want to add another scientist? Sorry Pookie, but if they get rid of Penny, the show is done. I'm not a fan of Haley Cuoco (never have been), but she is what's keeping the show on an even keel.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Quite the contrary. I think the show is better the less of Penny we have to suffer through. If Penny was being played by a better actor, that would be another story. The role is a good one, it's just not being very well executed...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Larry Wilmore:&quot;The Daily Show's&quot; Senior Black Correspondent was absolutely brilliant with his report last night. Why don't they assign him other topics? Or do I need to vote for Barack Obama just so Wilmore will be given more air time?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Wilmore is priceless. I don't know why they don't feature him more often. Yes, he wears a lot of other hats, including occasionally writing for &quot;The Office&quot; -- and, way back when, he was e.p. on Fox's &quot;Bernie Mac&quot; show, so I don't know if it's a case of him being busy working on other projects, or &quot;The Daily Show's&quot; choice. But &quot;Daily Show&quot; can't use Wilmore too often, if you ask me...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Up North: I don't know why, but I've watched both episodes of &quot;Gary Unmarried.&quot; I think I continue to watch to see if Jay Mohr is capable of doing a non-whiny voice. For some reson &quot;New Christine&quot; makes divorce funnyl; this show does not.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Okay, here's what I really want to know: What HAPPENED to Jay Mohr? He's gotten so, um, fat? He's gotten so, um, un-edgy? I miss &quot;Action&quot; Jay Mohr..</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;90210&quot;: Now that Shannon Dougherty is leaving &quot;90210,&quot; when does Tori Spelling arrive? I can't wait to view this train wreck!!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Tori said she had to spend more time with her new child first. Which I'm guessing means another week?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot; 'Til Death&quot;: Pookie, please help me understand. You have a failing show (&quot; 'Til Death&quot;) with a shaky premise -- old, jaded married couple play off young, married believe-in-romance couple. So to save it, you kill off what little premise you have, focus more on the unlikable old married couple, thereby heightening the viewers' awareness that the old couple really is unlikable, and add a strange African American character whose &quot;jive&quot; style actually can induce winces and the desire to donate liberally to the NAACP. Are you indeed saving the show, or is it just proof Dr. Moreau is in charge of the island after all?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Usually, though I don't know if this is the case here, it means the star is the executive producer of the series. This show needs to be put out of our misery, for sure.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Lisa, I know that &quot;Scrubs&quot; has moved to ABC, and that they've finished shooting this season's episodes ... but when will it actually air?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: No launch date announounced yet. Much speculation, but it's just that...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Indianapolis, Ind.: How does one get a job as a &quot;Little General&quot; spotter at a Standards and Decency group? I think I would be well-qualified for the job. And I could learn to wag my accusing finger as well as the next person.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Get in line. I too am angling for a Little Colonel Spotter job at CBS, now that the network has been forced to see the obvious need, thanks to the Parents TV Council's having filed an indecency complaint against the network in re it's Peekaboo Penis episode of &quot;Survivor.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It sure looks like Dr. House has nuked the fridge: I don't know what that means! I'm pathetically out of it! Please 'splain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: I think it's the new &quot;jumped the shark&quot; ...ages ago we seemed to reach an agreement the expression was sadly in need of updating...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.:&quot;ALF&quot; is back! (And not just in pog form - thanks Milhouse!) &quot;ALF&quot; didn't do well the first time around, right? Is there really a nostalgia feeling for that show? Does it get better with a second viewing? Do the cats eat &quot;ALF&quot;?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Re: A second viewing, see for yourself (Hulu).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: ALF was huge!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: ABC is aggressively trying to get viewers for &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot;? What? I'd be interested in the show if they would give me the opportunity to see the first season. I'm sure I'm not the only one who misses re-runs. Couldn't they have burned off a first season marathon on SoapNet or something? Why should I be loyal to a show I haven't seen since early last winter?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: It was a huge mistake for ABC to not even air the reruns over the summer and then spend half of the first episiode this season trying to explain the show's set-up, which is extremely complicated, though lovely. Yes,they should have run a marathon on the ABC broadcast network before the start of the season,or at least on ABC Family or something. Unless I missed it, in which case, Never Mind...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;90210&quot;: Wait -- how did I miss that Shannon Doherty was leaving &quot;90210&quot;? Did she only sign on for a few episodes? What about Jennie Garth?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Both are signed for a limited number of episodes. But Doherty's are just more limited than Garth's. Doherty is, let's admit, dreadful on the show.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Greensboro, N.C.: I love the show &quot;Life,&quot; but they replaced the female boss with Donal Logue -- what happened? Did the actress get a better job?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: I like the change. Fun chemistry between him and Damian Lewis. Sadly, it appears to be too late. None of this fall's Do-Over series launched very well: &quot;Life,&quot; &quot;Chuck,&quot; &quot;Pushing Daisies,&quot; &quot;Private Practice,&quot; &quot;Dirty Sexy Money&quot; -- all freshman shows from last season that got hurt badly by the writers strike and which their networks -- NBC and ABC -- decided not to bring back when the strike ended. Instead, they decided to try to re-launch them this fall.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I Hate &quot;Grey's Anatomy&quot;: I decided to watch the season premiere of &quot;Grey's Anatomy&quot; with my wife; I almost didn't make it. The horror, the horror. Do any of these idiot doctors actually, you know, practice medicine? And the lead character -- she was so whiny and self-absorbed that I felt like throwing a lamp through the TV whenever she was on.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Meredith could talk of nothing else but McDreamy last week and I think she's forgotten entirely how to practice medicine. After watching the season debut, I was sure I would never ever ever want to find myself at that hospital. The doctors are so distracted, so self-absorbed. No wonder the hospital fell to No. 12 in the Country's Best List. I was left wondering how it made the list at all. Sadly, I don't think that's what the show intended viewers to walk away with...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Colorado Springs, Colo.: How does Fox expect me to catch up when they don't put new episodes of &quot;House&quot; online until after the next episode has aired? I'm not going to watch it live until I've seen the previous episodes. Maybe I have to wait until World Series time to catch up?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: I'm guessing the rules are being in some way being set by the show's owner, NBC Universal. I'm frankly surprised Fox gets to replay them at all...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Hi Lisa. What about &quot;24&quot;? When does its season start? Will Fox continue with the multiple-torture episodes? I liked it the first few seasons, but am wondering if it has jumped the shark yet. Thanks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: The &quot;24&quot; play pattern has included a January launch for several years now. This TV season is no different. BUT, FOx is going to air a two-hour &quot;24&quot; movie, &quot;24: Exiled&quot; during the November sweep. Can't wait!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now that we have &quot;The Mentalist&quot;: Does that mean &quot;Medium&quot; is gone?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: If &quot;The Mentalist&quot; and &quot;Psych&quot; can co-exist, why can't &quot;The Mentalist&quot; and &quot;Medium&quot;? They're on different networks and everything! NBC has said &quot;Medium&quot; will re-join its Sunday lineup in the first quarter..</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The Ex-List&quot;: So part of the premise of this show is that she has to get married within a year. Does that mean they already decided it probably wouldn't last more than one season? Otherwise they'll have to find some excuse to keep her running around looking for &quot;The One&quot; after the year is up.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: You assume the show is playing out in &quot;real&quot; time, like &quot;24.&quot; Given that no one ages on these shows -- you have high school dramas in which the students are all there for six or eight years and no, they're all not flunkies, so why can't a show in which she finds her mate in a one-year deadline last for four years?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This Season: Should I be watching &quot;Private Practice&quot; or &quot;Grey's Anatomy&quot;?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Given the ratings on Private Practice, I'd say &quot;Grey's Anatomy.&quot; And, of course, they've added Kevin McKidd to the cast of &quot;Grey's&quot; which moves it up the Watch-o-Meter about eight notches.. Yup, stick with &quot;Grey's&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bethesda, Md.: Billy Bush has started appearing on &quot;Today&quot; from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. Is he trying to go into more serious news? I just cannot take him as a newscaster, period. But I wonder, what's next for him? I'd say &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; all the way.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: If they're showcasing him on NBC News's &quot;Today&quot; show, it's just a matter of time before he joins the lineup of MSNBC...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: Why can't a show in which she finds her mate in a one-year deadline last for four years?: And those stupid &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters never get any older either!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: My point exactly...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bowie, Md.: What happened to &quot;Chuck?&quot; I was so excited to return to this great show, but they changed so much of it in the first episode that I'm tempted to stop watching it. This season's first episode might as well have been for some completely different show starring the same actors. Why did NBC feel they needed to tinker with a good thing?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Because it's ratings were sliding. All of the Do-Over series seem to have made substantial changes to the show -- some good, some not so....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tempe, Ariz.: Do they put the naked lady in water every week on &quot;Fringe,&quot; or is that just a sometimes thing?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: It is definitely working for the show, so I'm guessing it will become a regular feature. After all, they have to find some geeky pretext for getting her clothes off...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: I read a review of the new season of &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; in the New York Times this week, and it's only on DirecTV until it begins again on NBC in February. Would you know if it's possible to see DirecTV shows online? Although you aren't, I am a huge fan of the show.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: I don't know but I will find out. Given that DirecTV is paying to offer its subs original programming, it would seem unlikely...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Huey: What was up with all the Huey Lewis songs in &quot;Chuck&quot;? Is he making some kind of comeback, or are his songs just really cheap to get the rights to nowadays? It hurt my ears.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: smells like product placement to me...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Without a Trace&quot;: Did &quot;Without a Trace&quot; jump the shark? What's with showing us where the victim is and what's going on during the investigation? Adding Steven Weber to the cast I like; this new change, not so much. I hope it isn't going to continue.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Weber is a great addition -- I continue to be surprised to discover he can act. It's going to take years to get over seeing him on &quot;Wings.&quot; The show has been moved around CBS's schedule a lot and I know they wanted it to start with a bang this season, which explains the episode you did not seem to like much...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Falls Church, Va.: When is Rob Thomas's retooled &quot;Cupid&quot; going to debut on ABC? I loved the Jeremy Piven/Paula Marshall version ... is it going to be worth watching with different leads?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: I'm willing to put up with lack of Jeremy Piven for the sake of lack of Paula Marshall. Sarah Paulson is a major step up, and I'm willing to give Bobby Cannavale a chance because I loved him on &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;..Oh, did I just say that out loud?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Billy Bush: Already is on &quot;Access Hollywood.&quot; He took over &quot;anchoring&quot; when Pat O'Brian left (I'm sad that I know this). Is anybody else freaked out by how much he looks like his cousin?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Yes,I think the person who asked that question was aware he is already on &quot;Access H.&quot; Hence the crack...and yes, as time goes on, he looks more and more like W...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fairfax, Va.:&quot;Doherty is, let's admit, dreadful on the show.&quot; Wait, I'm confused: Are you talking about &quot;Charmed,&quot; the original &quot;90210,&quot; the new &quot;90210,&quot; pre-Tracy Morgan &quot;Scare Tactics&quot; or &quot;Our House&quot;? Face it, sister can 't act -- between that and her famous tantrums, how does she keep getting work?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: No, talking about &quot;90210.&quot;....and of course she got the gig because the producers wanted to trot out several of the old cast members from the original &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. I'm guessing they thought Doherty would be a great get for just the reasons you named. It absolutely got the new show boatloads of cost-free attention in the celebrity suck-up press so -- Mission Accomplished!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">'Splain further: But &quot;jumping the shark&quot; had to do with an actual episode. Was there some sort of bizarre refrigerator accident that happened on &quot;House&quot; to spawn that saying?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Nuke the Fridge (Urban Dictionary)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Here you go...</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Watertown, Mass.: Any news on when &quot; Emergency!&quot; is coming back? Or &quot;Courtship of Eddie's Father&quot;? Is a new &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; in the Works? Man, them were the days!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: No, but I did hear that NBC is bringing back yet another old show it's remaking -- no doubt one its programming chief, Ben Silverman loved to watch as a child. If I'd had any coffee this morning, I might even remember which show it was. Alas, I did not and I cannot...</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fairfax, Va.: How does Julia Louise Dreyfrus look better now than she did 10 years ago on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Yes, she looked a lot better on Conan O'Brien's show the other night, in a shortish skirt,revealing top, styled hair, than in the Annie Hall-esque get-ups they used to put her in on &quot;Seinfeld.&quot; But, to cut to the chase, if you're really asking me are those breasts real, I do not know.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Columbia, Md.: Paul Potts, a cell-phone salesman and opera singer, wins the hearts and minds of Britain singing &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot; and becomes the winner of &quot;Britain's Got Talent&quot; (and a huge YouTube sensation). Neal E. Boyd, an insurance salesman and opera singer, wins the hearts and minds of America singing &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot; and becomes the winner of &quot;America's Got Talent.&quot; Coincidence? Nuttin' But Stringz was one of the few original talent acts on any of these competition shows. They were robbed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: I cannot explain why TV viewers will vote for an opera singer but they will not actually pay to listen to an opera singer. It's one of those great mysteries of TV....</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Santa Fe, N.M.: I don't want to watch TV's &quot;Crash.&quot; Do I have to?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: No, pookums, you don't have to watch anything you dont' want to. And in the case of this series, I would not recommend it...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Greenbelt, Md.: So Mark Burnett is going to have to hire a staff of nipple/pubic hair/Li'l Colonel watchers to make sure they're on the ball (no pun intended) with the pixellation? Good grief. This is not the same thing as the Janet Jackson fiasco ... there's intent and then there's something that slips by, because, well ... we're not really looking for it. It sometimes seems like these people are trying to find something like that, and if they do, they freeze-frame their Tivo and try to watch it over and over again. I think their priorities are a little skewed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Yes, reminds me of those blue-hairedladies who noted to Samuel Johnson that the first English dictionary, which he wrote in the 18th century, did not contain any dirty words. He responded something to the effect, &quot;Ah, that means you went looking for them.&quot; Or maybe I just dreamed that...</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shonda Rhimes: Why does she hate relationships? Seriously, nobody on &quot;Grey's Anatomy&quot; ever can have a normal relationship. If she tries to tell me that's just how relationships are, I will vomit.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: No, Shonda Rhimes would never say anything that revealing. She's a mystery wrapped in an enigma, or however that goes...but, to be fair, aren't normal relationships boring on drama series? If she didn't have the whole staff emotionally stunted, then she'd have to have look up a lot of medical terms, like on &quot;House.&quot; I'm guessing emotional train wreck is easier to write...and certainly appeals to chick viewers, judging by the numbers.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That poster is nuts: Shannen Doherty was the best part of both old-school &quot;90210&quot; and &quot;Charmed.&quot; She may not be the best actress in the world (I see no Oscars in her future) but she's definitely fun to watch, and brings something to the shows. Quite frankly, I've been watching the new &quot;90210,&quot; but if both Kelly and Brenda are gone now, I think I am too.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: Shannen Doherty is in desperate need of a makeover. Can someone please cut her hair and give her braces? That said, she'd be a perfect addition to &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; and yes I am aware I am now just babbling...</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Without a Trace&quot;: I thought the preview made it clear that following the victim was a one-time thing, similar to the episode where they showed everything from the family's point of view?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa de Moraes: They made it clear, but if it had been a whopping big ratings success, that doesn't mean they wouldn't make it a more regular thing... I'm out of time. See you next week...</span></p>
