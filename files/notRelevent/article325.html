  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: Good morning to everyone. Another busy day in Washington, with the Senate scheduled to vote on the economic rescue package and many eyes on the financial and credit markets. Senators Obama, McCain and Biden will have to vote on the package so they'll be back in town later. Governor Palin is doing her debate prep in Arizona in advance of Thursday's big event in St. Louis. Time to get started.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: Isn't it disingenuous for Sarah Palin to reference Joe Biden's age when John McCain is six years older?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: Katie Couric asked her about that in the interview that aired last night on CBS. Governor Palin said no, it wasn't a reference to age. She said Biden has experience while she is a fresh face, a new person. She said that's the contrast she was drawing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Asheville, N.C.: Seems to me members in Congress are in a no-win situation. If they approve a bailout/rescue and avert a crisis, then political opponents gleefully will claim the absence of the crisis proves the bail-out was unnecessary. On the other hand, if they vote down the bill and a crisis erupts, they get blamed for that too. However, if you can tune out the experts predicting doom and find a few telling you what you want to hear, then a winning possibility shimmers into view -- vote against the bailout and hope a crisis does not occur. In that scenario, you look like a genius. Regardless of the likelihood of that scenario, isn't the psychology of the situation as obvious as the wisdom of a 50-year, negative-amortization mortgage?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: You've got a lot of thoughts tucked into that question. Clearly it's a tough vote for members of Congress, given the uncertainty of the economy and how it will respond to Secretary Paulson's plan, if finally approved. Some members voted no on Monday and hoped there wouldn't be the response by the market that there was. There may be fewer who want to take that risk on a more permanent basis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Annapolis, Md.: Let's say that McCain and Palin win. Does that mean we are back to the secret email accounts and hidden agenda that we have had to suffer through for the past eight years?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Palin Had Another Private E-Mail Account, Company Says (Post, Oct. 1)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: Not necessarily.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Danielson, Conn.: Haven't each of the presidential candidates failed to show leadership during the financial crisis? And didn't we have a right to expect more from them, given there past history of independence and bipartisanship? The election seems to have diminished both of them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: The fact is that neither has a direct role to play here, other than using the forum of their campaigns to try to guide the negotiators, members of Congress and voters. Both have tried and to limited effect, though theytried in quite different ways. McCain has been criticized for what he did last week. Obama has been criticized, though less harshly, for the way he's handled it. Neither has the powers of a president and neither is in the leadership of the Senate. So they do what they can do. That said, it's likely all of this will have some impact on the campaign. We're already seeing what appears to be a shift toward Obama of uncertain size.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Floris, Va.: The internals of the new Post poll you wrote about today shows that you interviewed significantly more Republicans and fewer African Americans than last week. Were you intimidated by the yelps from the McCain campaign after last week's polling or is the new data base a correct adjustment. If so, what do you base it on?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Most Voters Worry About Economy (Post, Oct. 1)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: The methodolgy is the same, except in the previous poll we did what's called an oversample of African Americans. That is designed to give us enough black voters to be able to say how what they think about different questions. But in the overall numbers, they are weighted to their share of the population. As for the split between Republicans and Democrats, that varies a bit from poll to poll, although generally not dramatically enough to change the findings significantly. So no, we did not make any adjustments in the way we conducted the poll.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dunn Loring, Va.: If even the supposedly objective moderator of her debate is writing a book praising Obama, and stands to earn more money if Obama wins, why is it improper for Gov. Palin to wonder if the media might be against her?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: Gwen Ifill is a long-time friend and colleague. She also is a total professional. I believe any criticism of her over this book is totally misplaced. She is promoting nobody's candidacy. Whether Barack Obama wins or loses this campaign, his candidacy has been a breakthrough in terms of African Americans and politics. That story is worthy of a book no matter what the outcome of the election. Gwen is ideally suited to write the story of the evolution of political leadership within the African American community.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hampton Cove, Ala.: Dan, call me skeptical, but last week your ABC/Washington Post poll that showed Obama up by 9 was big news, and many said it was why McCain pulled his &quot;stunt.&quot; A new Post poll yesterday showed Obama's head had shrunken to only 4 percentage points, but that was not on the washingtonpost.com homepage or ABC News. Instead, the Gwen Ifill poll-pickers have gone with the Quinnpiac Poll, which always has favored Obama. Have you ever heard of a case where ABC and The Washignton Post ignore their own polls?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: The new poll was on the front page of the Post today and as far as I know was on the home page last night.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Raleigh, N.C.: Good morning. I've noticed Obama surrogates starting to use the word &quot;erratic&quot; in describing John McCain. But they're not &quot;flooding the zone&quot; with that word either. Do you think that word is a talking point, or have a couple of Obama surrogates out of a dozen or more just happened to use the word? (I guess I'm using a specific case to ask a general question about the process by which a campaign gets its message of the day out. I wonder how tightly scripted it is.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: Campaigns send out talking points to a wide list of surrogates and so it's possible that this is part of the Obama team's current set. Sometimes surrogates pick up ideas and language from the general chatter and recycle it. It could be either.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chicago: Michael D. Shear has a piece in The Post today about McCain appearing combative in a meeting with the Des Moines Register editorial board. One of the topics the board challenged McCain on was the &quot;sex ed for kindergartners&quot; ad. I'd like to point out something on that topic that largely has gone unreported. The Centers for Disease Control has funded a policy for years that calls for HIV education at all levels, K-12. The same CDC policy language shows up in board of education policy documents in places like Tennessee and Alabama. So the Illinois bill hardly was unusual in this regard.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Candidates Follow Up on Plan (Post, Oct. 1)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: Thanks. Posted without comment.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anonymous: Paulson's plan was three pages. The House plan was 111 pages. Now the Senate plan is 451 pages. Are House members upset that the Senate has brought this bill up first?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: House members may be glad to see the Senate go first this time. They're little shell-shocked after what happened Monday. You might wonder how many senators are pleased at going first!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: I am an Obama supporter, but I am a little troubled by the revelation that Gwen Ifill has written a book that no doubt will portray Obama positively and included his cooperation. We hold government officials accountable for even the appearance of impropriety, and it seems here that Ifill is perilously close to the edge.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Indeed, if Palin gets knocked off her stride by an Ifill question or two on Thursday night, the GOP will scream bloody murder regarding Ifill's objectivity. And, frankly, I think the GOPers would have a more than legitimate claim. I am aware of some of the counterarguments, especially that the book was not a state secret and that the GOP could have objected earlier, but I do think there remains a whiff of favoritism. What do you think?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: See my earlier answer on this. This book has been in the works for many, many, many months and was, as you note, not a secret. I think you can look at Gwen's work throughout this campaign and answer the question of whether she's been even-handed. She has and will continue to ask tough questions of everyone.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dunn Loring, Va.: Are you aware of any reporters, including at The Post, who are planning to write a book about the presidential campaign? Of those, how many are assigned to the Obama campaign?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: I am writing a book about the campaign and have had a contract for more than a year. My co-author is Haynes Johnson, a Pulitzer-prize winning ex-Post reporter and author who teaches at the University of Maryland. It is a broad book about the campaign and the country during what we believe is one of the most critical elections in modern history. I know of several others at other organizations who are writing books about the campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This has been one of the most interesting and consequential campaigns we've all witnessed -- a truly remarkable story -- and I believe worthy not just of one or two books but potentially many. There is a book in Obama's candidacy. There is a book in Senator Clinton's campaign. There is certainly a book about Senator McCain's amazing rollercoaster of a campaign. There's a book about the country in historic times. Lots of stories to be told from this campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Riverdale, N.Y.: Mr. Balz, you've been at this game for many years, so this probably sounds like a naive comment, but doesn't it look like this presidential election is the most minutely-examined and painstakingly overanalyzed one we've ever had? We've got state-by-state examinations of minutia, like how many white single women are supporting Gov. Palin in Eastern Wisconsin, and the like.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I don't think we've ever seen this degree of overkill before; it's paralysis by analysis, sort of like people in the Middle Ages arguing how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. We've got a month to go, and I'm getting a headache. After a while, it's just getting the people out to vote. Remember when someone hired Yogi Berra to teach hitting, and instead of giving a lengthy dissertion on how the hitter should stride and where your hands should be, he just said &quot;hell, give me that bat and watch me,&quot; whacking line drives all over the place. As of today, this doesn't look like a landslide for anybody, so who looks more likely to get their people out to the polls? That's what I want to know.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: Your point is well taken. We all can get pretty deeply into the weeds looking for THE answer to the question of what's going to happen. Your question is also good and unanswerable at the point, except to note that the Obama campaign has a huge voter mobilization operation around the country, with volunteers and paid staffers. However, the proof of its prowess doesnt come until election day. The Republicans did a terrific job of this in 2004, so they know how if they're as well organized this year. At this point, people give an edge to Obama's operation, but so much of this is invisible until the day it really counts.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Baltimore: I heard yesterday that Gwen Ifill had fallen and broken her ankle. Isn't air travel a bad idea with a freshly-broken bone? Will she be able to make it to St. Louis? Who's her backup if she can't?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Gwen Ifill Breaks Ankle (TV Newser, Sept. 30)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: Yes, it's true. Gwen fell at home on Monday night, but the last I heard she was planning to go to St. Louis and moderate the debate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: Palin and the (Unnamed) Media: Hi Dan. What was your take on Palin's comments in the CBS interview about what she reads -- specifically her claiming that she reads all papers and magazines, whatever is put before her, but failing to name a single one? I couldn't tell whether she was afraid to say The Post or the Times because those are ostensibly part of the &quot;liberal media elite&quot; that she has complained about, or whether she honestly couldn't think of any papers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: I'd like to think she reads the Post online and other papers as well. I don't know why she didn't name a few publications.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rolla, Mo.: I've been reading that during Palin's debates in Alaska, she was quite good. However, she had a tendency to avoid answering specific points in favor of using anecdotes to connect with viewers. The McCain camp's push for the traditional format for the vice presidential debate really makes sense, as it allows for her to continue that tactic without significant challenge by Biden. Can we expect that if she shows up, answers coherently, and is &quot;likeable&quot; the media will declare it a Palin &quot;comeback&quot;?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: Let's not judge the debate before it happens. Both Governor Palin and Senator Obama have a lot on the line Thursday night. I'm looking forward to it as are millions of Americans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gwen Ifill: Hopefully she will make a quick recovery from her injury this week. Just a comment: I've never seen Ms. Ifill as in the tank for Obama (I think she clearly favored Clinton). She interviewed Obama during the primaries and it was a tough interview. No one should think that because of her ethnicity, Ms. Ifill can not be a fair moderator. That's like saying Tom Brokaw can't moderate the presidential debate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: I agree.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Southwest Nebraska: McCain was interviewed on NPR and lauded Palin's expertise on energy and talked about how he relied on her for information about even Middle Eastern oil politics. Why is he doubling down on this ugly bet?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: He doesn't see it the way you see it. He believes she has brought energy and enthusiasm to his campaign, that she represents the kind of shake-em-up maverick style that he sees in himself. He probably believes much of the criticism of her is politically motivated.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Denver: How does increasing FDIC insurance to $250,000 help those nearing forclosure? I would assume that those with $250,000 in the bank are not having many financial issues. Is this just a small thing that Congress is harping on?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: The proposal is aimed at heading off any panicky runs on bank deposits. The credit system, as has been reported, is in danger of freezing up and anything that keeps things calm is seen as helping to alleviate that problem. It does not directly help a homeowner facing foreclosure, but it apparently would help not just individuals but small businesses as well.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Madison, Wis.: I don't see any way Biden will be able to come out ahead following the debate tomorrow night. The bar for Palin has been set so low that she will probably exceed expectations just by showing up. And, as an article on your Web site suggests, she probably doesn't need to say anything substantive, so long as she delivers it in that cute, folksy way of hers. Any thoughts on ways for Biden to overcome this? Can he out-cute her?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Shooting From the Hip, With a Smile to Boot (Post, Oct. 1)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: I don't think he can &quot;out-cute her,&quot; as you put it. He needs a solid, respectful, restrained and on-point performance. He has to defend Senator Obama, he has to make points against Senator McCain and he has to do it without looking heavy-handed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Minneapolis: Is it safe to say that both parties are somewhat operating without leadership right now? The problem seems more acute for the Republicans, but the Democrats don't quite seem to be marching to one drummer either. My question is, how will this be reflected on Nov. 4?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz: I think that's right. That's why this election is so consequential.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We're out of time today. Thanks to everyone who participated. Enjoy the debate! And have a great week.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Balz.</span></p>
