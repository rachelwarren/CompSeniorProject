  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WASHINGTON -- When President Bush came on television at 7:35 a.m. Monday to urge passage of a $700 billion Wall Street rescue plan, fellow Republicans working out in the House gymnasium jeered his remarks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hours later, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., attacked Bush's &quot;failed economic policies&quot; on the House floor and credited Democrats for improving the proposal, Republicans got angrier.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bush's weak political standing even in his own party and sharp partisan divisions in the House may have contributed to the plan's demise, but it was old-fashioned politics that killed the bill. In the end, too many lawmakers weren't willing to risk losing their jobs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's mainly political fear, the reaction back home,&quot; said Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., who backed the bill. &quot;It's the most difficult time for people to be statesmen, 37 days before an election&quot; in which all of the 435 House seats are on the ballot. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ever since Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson presented his plan to Congress 12 days ago, lawmakers had been skeptical. They didn't like the $700 billion price tag or the plan for the U.S. government to take over bad private debt, mostly distressed mortgage securities.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Since then, compromises made to appease conservative Republicans and populist Democrats in the House made the vote close. But proponents couldn't overcome these obstacles:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">*Political fear. More than 75% of House members who are in close races in the Nov. 4 elections wouldn't vote for the bill when their phone calls and e-mails were running 10-to-1 against it. &quot;As much as anything else, it was the barrage of phone calls that everyone received,&quot; said Rep. Jim Marshall, D-Ga. He voted for the bill even though his southwest Georgia district is rated a tossup by the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republicans facing tough re-election challenges deserted their leaders in droves. Thirty-two of 37 Republicans listed as endangered by the non-partisan Cook Political Report voted no, compared with 18 of 29 Democrats in the same category.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On the flip side, 22 of 29 Republicans who are leaving the House this year voted for the bill. Two of the six retiring Democrats voted against bill.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;There weren't many vulnerable members who voted yes,&quot; said David Wasserman, House editor for the Cook report. A yes vote, he said, would give &quot;every opponent a new blistering ad to run against you.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">*&quot;Bailout&quot; language. No matter how the Bush administration tried to describe the complex rescue plan, it kept appearing in news media accounts as a &quot;bailout&quot; of Wall Street. &quot;When you call something a 'bailout,' there aren't a whole lot of people who are out there who are in favor of a bailout,&quot; said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">*Presidential politics. Republican John McCain interrupted his campaign to jump into negotiations on the bill, while Democrat Barack Obama -- who said he was wary of injecting presidential politics into the negotiations -- sought to influence the White House and his colleagues by phone. In their debate Friday, both were non-committal. On Sunday, both backed the bill. On Monday, McCain said Obama and his allies injected unnecessary partisanship into the process, and Obama called his rival's response to the crisis &quot;irratic.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">*Bush's weakness. Four months from retirement and holding a 27% approval rating in the latest USA TODAY/Gallup Poll, Bush couldn't force enough Republicans to vote yes. He and Paulson were joined on the phones Monday by Vice President Cheney and a bevy of top White House staff members -- to no avail. &quot;Some people committed to voting for the bill,&quot; Fratto said. &quot;Others remain skeptical.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The president's embrace may cost them re-election,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;They're running like scalded dogs from the White House.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">*Pelosi's rhetoric. Republican leaders expected more of their colleagues to vote for the package. Only 65 of the 199 House GOP members backed the bill. Some blamed the Democratic speaker's speech. &quot;A bipartisan solution is only as good as the last person who throws a bomb into the room,&quot; said Minority Whip Roy Blunt, R-Mo., his party's chief vote-counter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, scoffed, &quot;'Somebody hurt my feelings, so I will punish the country.'&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cold water, hot tempers</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The day's political and financial gyrations may have been foretold inside the House gym Monday morning, and not just because Republicans jeered their president. The hot water ran out.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It was an early sign of market failure,&quot; quipped Cooper, who watched the Republicans react to Bush's speech.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">House leaders scheduled four back-to-back votes on unrelated issues starting at 8 a.m., giving them time to take members' pulse on the rescue plan. It quickly became clear they were in trouble. &quot;We're struggling,&quot; said Rep. John Murtha, a Pennsylvania Democrat close to Pelosi.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As the three-hour debate unfolded, the political maneuvering began. Because the bill was so unpopular, neither party wanted to take primary responsibility for its passage.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The deal worked out between the leaders was &quot;we would have half the votes, and they would have half the votes,&quot; Pelosi said later. Blunt told reporters afterward that he thought he had 75 GOP votes when the roll call began. He emerged with just 65.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., acknowledged some &quot;fear of what might happen&quot; if the bill didn't pass but added, &quot;My heart says no, and I'm very likely to vote my heart.&quot; Three hours later, he did.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As the day wore on, retiring House Republicans became a focus of GOP lobbying. Rep. Jim McCrery, R-La., had calls from Bush and Douglas Holtz-Eakin, McCain's top policy adviser.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I have lost a lot of sleep over this,&quot; McCrery said. He voted yes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">All day, lawmakers faced lobbying by outside groups. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which supported the plan, sent e-mails to several thousand members Sunday, urging them to bombard lawmakers with their opinions. &quot;We unleashed a full-court arsenal,&quot; said R. Bruce Josten, the chamber's top lobbyist.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That didn't sway enough Republicans, usually the chamber's allies. Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas said only a few lawmakers changed their minds in the final minutes of the vote.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We came here today willing to swallow hard,&quot; Hensarling said. &quot;But we can't swallow everything. ... Any model that essentially has taxpayers having to bail out Wall Street is fundamentally a flawed model.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Many lawmakers waited to the last possible minute. As the 15-minute roll call counted down to zero, 54 House members had yet to cast their votes. At that moment, the tally was 195-185 against the bill.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As Democratic and Republican leaders tried to corral members and switch votes, the tally against the bill mounted. Pelosi, visible in her cream-colored suit as she wove through a throng of navy jackets, buttonholed Democrats.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Congressional Black Caucus members Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and John Lewis of Georgia sat stoned-faced as Pelosi leaned over to talk with them in the final minutes of voting. All three had voted against the plan.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pelosi told them, Jackson said, that the stock market was falling fast and asked for their support to help revive the bill. Lewis shook his head and neither Jackson nor Thompson budged.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Jackson said he wants an economic stimulus package and regulations barring banks from buying mortgage securities included in any bailout. &quot;We have to give a carrot and stick at the same time to Wall Street,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Then Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., shouted to his Republican colleagues, &quot;The Dow just dropped 600 points!&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For vulnerable Republicans, a call from Bush didn't matter as much as thousands of calls from back home. &quot;America just seems to be in a populist mood right now,&quot; said Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., who is not running again and voted in favor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, voted no. He said the plan bestowed too much power on Paulson. &quot;I don't want the government owning everything in America,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Owning 'the Great Depression'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Once the results were in, the recriminations began. Democrats blamed Republicans for producing one-third of their 199 votes. Republicans accused Democrats of being overly partisan.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some Republicans blamed Paulson, the plan's architect, for not listening to them. &quot;A man born without ears,&quot; Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Much of the talk focused on the percentages of Democrats and Republicans who voted for the plan. While 60% of Democrats voted yes, only 32% of Republicans did so. Two-thirds &quot;decided to put political ideology ahead of the best interests of our great nation,&quot; said House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republicans said it was Democrats' responsibility to pass the measure, since Democrats control the House. &quot;We're not in the majority of the Congress that failed to act today,&quot; Blunt said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They also blamed Pelosi's fiery speech blaming a &quot;right-wing ideology of anything goes.&quot; House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said it &quot;caused a number of members we thought we could get, to go south.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Neither McCain nor Obama were on Capitol Hill in the hours before the vote. That didn't stop the McCain campaign from blasting Obama for not getting more involved. McCain returned to Washington after Friday's debate but didn't go back to Capitol Hill. He lobbied at least 11 House Republicans during his campaign hiatus. Four voted against the package, including two from his home state of Arizona.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Even so, he defended his involvement. At a rally in Columbus before the vote was cast, McCain said he acted while Obama was &quot;monitoring&quot; the situation. &quot;That's not leadership. That's watching from the sidelines,&quot; McCain said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a statement, Obama's campaign countered, &quot;This is a moment of national crisis, and today's inaction in Congress as well as the angry and hyper-partisan statement released by the McCain campaign are exactly why the American people are disgusted with Washington.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama had been in daily contact with Paulson and congressional Democrats during the past two weeks. But he has kept his activities low key, saying that injecting presidential politics complicates the negotiations.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The most ominous warnings came from those who think the nation risks financial Armageddon absent a rescue bill. &quot;Those that voted no will own the Great Depression,&quot; said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a McCain ally.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">'The way forward'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At the end of the day, all Bush and congressional leaders could do was rue the stock market's record 778-point decline and vow to try again. &quot;We'll be working with members of Congress, leaders of Congress, on the way forward,&quot; Bush said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fratto, his spokesman, was blunt. &quot;We're very concerned about the markets,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the House, which isn't scheduled to meet again until noon Thursday, Frank said Democrats were ready to go back to work. This time, he said, the administration should work better with Republicans in Congress.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., one of those McCain didn't sway, said supporters should be able to change enough minds if they change such things as accounting rules and increases in insurance for bank accounts. He said there isn't &quot;a shadow of a doubt&quot; a revised bill will pass the House this week.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Possible elements of a compromise could include an economic stimulus plan and bankruptcy protection for homeowners faced with foreclosure, which could win Democratic votes. A requirement that Treasury insure rather than buy bad loans could win conservative votes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the Senate, where bipartisan support has been stronger than the House, Sens. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., and Judd Gregg, R-N.H., struck a conciliatory tone. Dodd said after a cool-down period and the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana, lawmakers would get back to work. &quot;We don't intend to leave here without the job being done,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Blunt said supporters of a rescue plan have a powerful new weapon: the plummeting stock market. &quot;We're going to have a couple of days to see how the marketplace reacts to all this,&quot; he said. &quot;That may be a good thing.&quot;</span></p>
