  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ALBUQUERQUE -- In this battleground state, Jennifer Chadwell-Feld is at war.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chadwell-Feld, 58, dials voters from a small warehouse, gauging support for Republican presidential nominee John McCain and reminding them a vote Nov. 4 could be crucial in one of the nation's tightest swing states.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Since you support McCain, would you be willing to volunteer for the campaign?&quot; the volunteer says and records the answers, which will be entered into a computer. &quot;Can we get you a yard sign?&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In New Mexico, where President Bush eked out a win in 2004 by fewer than 6,000 votes, the race between McCain and Democrat Barack Obama may depend as much on volunteers as any stump speech or television ad by the candidates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nearly 127,000 New Mexicans have registered to vote in the past year -- a 12% increase -- state election data show. Volunteers are engaged in a grass-roots effort to ensure supporters turn out to vote.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We're just seeing intense mobilization efforts,&quot; says Lonna Atkeson, a political science professor at the University of New Mexico. &quot;We've already had a lot of early voting turnout.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Generating votes</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Energized by the idea that every vote may count, Jesse Cresdin, 21, an Obama volunteer, moves quickly through a neighborhood in Las Vegas, N.M. Obama is the first candidate he can recall opening an office in town, he says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama has 39 campaign offices statewide, according to his campaign. McCain has 24, the state Republican Party says, but that includes GOP county offices.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We're just making sure that everybody ... is registered to vote,&quot; Cresdin, clipboard in hand, tells Alfred Marquez, 31, before handing him an &quot;Obamanos&quot; sticker, a play on Obama's name and the Spanish word vamonos, &quot;let's go.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The get-out-the-vote effort was a major component of the 2004 presidential election, says Donald Green, a political science professor at Yale University. This year, as battle lines harden, campaigns rely more on those mobilization tactics, he says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Volunteers call to ensure a voter supports their candidate. If the voter does, the volunteers follow up with phone calls and personal visits. Both campaigns keep computerized lists of the people they contact. About a week before Election Day, campaigns check in to make sure the voter turns out.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Part of the reason you see resources shifting each election toward the ground game is that the ground is a steady investment, whereas (advertising) is hit-or-miss,&quot; says Green, co-author of the book Get Out the Vote! &quot;Its main advantage is that it generates votes at a fairly reliable pace.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republicans mastered using marketing databases to target likely supporters and also have had members of certain demographics -- outdoorsmen, for instance -- call other members of that group. Democrats have adopted many of the same tactics, Green says. A well-organized get-out-the-vote effort can swing an election 3 percentage points, he says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That slim advantage could be key in New Mexico, which supported Bush in 2004 but Al Gore -- by 366 votes -- in 2000. An Albuquerque Journal poll released Oct. 5 showed Obama with a 5-percentage-point lead.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In 2004, Bush rallied voters in rural portions of the state, says Joe Monahan, who runs joemonahan.com. a political blog. That effort helped Republicans offset gains Democrats made in Albuquerque and other cities. This year, Monahan says, McCain is taking a similar path. &quot;If he's going to win New Mexico, he's going to try to do it the same way George Bush did, a surge in the south,&quot; he says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">'A critical election'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Southern New Mexico is sparsely populated and defined by vast prairies. The region tends to support Republicans, past election results show. The north, the base of the Rocky Mountains, is a Democratic stronghold.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Forty-four percent of residents identified themselves as Hispanic in 2006, and nearly 10% said they are American Indian.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For Melanie Wood, 24, the state's battleground status compelled her to get involved. She suspended her studies and signed up to intern with the Obama campaign, working to register fellow students at the University of New Mexico.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both parties emphasize absentee voting, which began Oct. 7 in New Mexico, and Wood says she helped send out 175,000 vote-by-mail applications. Volunteers follow up with those voters to make sure they turn in those applications.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's definitely something that I felt like I needed to do work for, not just vote in,&quot; Wood says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Roswell, about 170 miles southeast of Albuquerque, Jeanette Schaffer, 44, is equally committed, but to McCain. She walked in to the campaign headquarters on Main Street in late September and has been calling voters ever since. It was the first time she volunteered for a campaign, she says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I'll do whatever they need me to do because I just think this is such a critical election,&quot; Schaffer says between phone calls. &quot;I'm definitely going to make myself available.&quot; <br /></span></p>
