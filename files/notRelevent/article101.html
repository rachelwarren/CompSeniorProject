  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">SAN DIEGO -- Just a week before Election Day, John McCain's advisers are probably looking at the trend line of the Latino vote and wondering: Que paso?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain is poised to have his worst showing ever with Latino voters, a constituency with which he has done extremely well in the past thanks to his personal relationships, war hero status, moderate positions and independent streak. In his 1998 Senate re-election in Arizona, McCain got 65% of the Hispanic vote. In 2004, it was 70%. But this year, on a national level, it's another story.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a July survey by the Pew Hispanic Center, 23% of Latinos support McCain, while 66% back Barack Obama. A third of respondents said the immigration issue would influence their vote. Fifty percent said Obama was the better candidate for immigrants; 12% said that about McCain. According to another survey, many Latinos in the USA say they're being picked on, discriminated against and turned into scapegoats. And they blame the Republican Party. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Be sure to catch the irony: McCain is being punished for the very sins he tried to prevent other Republicans from committing, while Obama is being absolved of sins that he and other Senate Democrats actually did commit.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">An unheeded warning</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Former Senate Republicans such as Rick Santorum and Bill Frist have acknowledged that, during the 2007 immigration reform debate, McCain warned them explicitly that they were badly mishandling the issue and making the GOP brand poisonous to Latinos.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain was dead-on. Republicans flunked immigration reform by clinging to an enforcement-only approach, making culture the issue by declaring English the national language, ignoring the anti-Latino racism in the debate and gutting sanctions for those who hire illegal immigrants. Republicans also tinkered with legal immigration by trying to ditch family reunification as the guiding principle.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yet, Republican demagoguery is only part of the story. Senate Democrats also had a hand in killing immigration reform in 2007 by trying to torpedo GOP support for a bipartisan compromise. House Democrats, under orders from Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., kept the controversial issue off the legislative agenda in 2008. Why? Organized labor. Democrats' slavish adherence to unions required that they derail any proposal that includes guest workers, as any bill with a chance to win Republican support would have to do.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In spring 2007, in a maneuver that enraged Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., Majority Leader Harry Reid used political sleight of hand and spin to make it seem as if a powerless GOP minority had somehow mustered up the power to kill immigration reform.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The power lay with Senate Democrats, including Obama, who supported a series of &quot;poison pill&quot; amendments intended to weaken guest-worker provisions and drive away Republicans. Obama even proposed one such amendment himself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Millions of undocumented immigrants in the USA blame Republicans for denying them green cards, but Democrats deserve most of the blame. The truth might have come out if not for loudmouths on right-wing talk radio who claimed credit for derailing comprehensive reform, which included a path to legalization for the undocumented (what critics called &quot;amnesty&quot;). The chest thumping was good news for Reid, who let the right-wing radio talkers confuse the issue.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And when a hard-hitting Spanish-language ad from the McCain-Palin campaign tried to set the record straight, the Obama-Biden campaign tried to confuse matters even further by calling upon Hispanic lawmakers, including Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, to once again blame Republicans for killing reform. Many Latino members of Congress rent their services like mariachis and always sing the same tune: The Democratic Party is the only one for Latinos.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama-Biden campaign responded with its own Spanish-language ads, which tried to link McCain to radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh and then tried to paint Limbaugh as anti-Latino. The tactic fell apart when some in the news media pointed out that Limbaugh and McCain had butted heads over immigration reform.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both camps are using Spanish-language ads as part of their underground campaigns to reach out to Latino voters. They get to make their pitch without incurring the wrath of English-speaking voters who don't like it when candidates engage in His-pandering.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Still in play</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Because neither Obama nor McCain has had much to say to English-speaking Latinos since they spoke to a series of Latino advocacy groups last summer, it's no surprise that a significant percentage of Latino voters in key battleground states -- 10% to 12% -- are still undecided. That's the finding of a new survey by the Educational Fund of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. The survey of registered Latino voters in Colorado, Florida, Nevada and New Mexico found that they plan to turn out in high numbers and that like most Americans, the economy is their top concern. But beyond that, they remain a mystery.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain might have one last chance at a reprieve. And if he racks up wins in key states, he'll have some old amigos to thank.</span></p>
