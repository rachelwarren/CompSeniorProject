  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cleveland Plain Dealer political reporter Mark Naymik was online Wednesday, Oct. 29 at noon ET to break down the state of the presidential race in Ohio -- the deciding state in the 2004 election -- and to discuss the competitive House races in the state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Battleground Cheat Sheet: Ohio; Also this week: More discussions on key states</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The transcript follows.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________ </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fair Elections: So glad to see Blackwell out of there. Has there been a marked difference in having a Democrat in charge of the voting process in 2008 as opposed to 2004? What changes have you noted to prevent voter suppression efforts in this cycle?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Naymik: Former Ohio SOS Ken Blackwell also served as a honorary co-chair of the Bush 2004 campaign in Ohio, which created a lot of concern, most overblown. (Democrats tried to link him to Diebold voting machine problems.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Blackwell issued several directives that were controversial, including one that required voter registration cards be submitted on heavy paper stock. It was recinded. Okay, that's four years ago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The new SOS, Jennifer Brunner, as you note is a Democrat, but she has not been immune to charges of partisan politics.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She rejected absentee ballots sent by the McCain campaign that were missing a check mark on a box. The GOP sued her and won. The move led many editorial pages to accuse her of partisan politics.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She has also been locked in several legal battles over what to do with mismatches in the new statewide voter file. The GOP said she creating the potential for fraud; she said she's protecting the voters who might unfairly be knocked off the voter file.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The concern over bad voter registration cards submitted by ACORN has also generated a lot of hype that has heightened attention to the SOS office.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Brunner has issued more clear directives on election day observers and other provisional ballot related issues that has lessened some concern.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the end, there is slightly less concern.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lakewood, Ohio: Are Ohio Democrats worried about voter supression effort by the GOP? Will the Republicans resort to their usual suppression efforts? Are they using any new tactics?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Naymik: I get this question a lot. And people worry that the GOP will send party members into the polls to challenge voters in Democratic areas on Election Day. From what I've seen in past elections, such challenges do not really take place. I have not seen GOP volunteers in heavily Democratic areas challenging voters. To be candid, race may play a role in this. Many heavy Democratic areas are in predominately black inner cities. Both parties don't want to inflame potential differences by pitting white challengers against black voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: There is a lot of talk about &quot;working-class voters,&quot; but &quot;working class&quot; seems to be defined by education or income rather than occupation or even work status. For example, Hillary Clinton's supporters were described as &quot;working class,&quot; but also predominantly were older. That means a low-income, non-college-educated retiree might be called &quot;working-class.&quot; Nothing against retirees, but most of them aren't in the workforce, so you can't call them &quot;working.&quot; Has there been any attempt to tease out support by actual workforce status? Do we know how people who actually work full-time are voting in Ohio?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Naymik: Fair question. We have not looked at those demographics. The campaigns are ultimately focused on turnout of voters and we know that older retireers are very regular voters so I don't imagine the campaigns will worry too much about the distinction between working and non-working within that group. You raise a good point on the &quot;working class&quot; vote. Hillary Clinton beat Barack Obama in Ohio by nine percentage points on the strength of &quot;working class&quot; and retiree voters, exit polls show. So it's not a surprise that Obama is trying very hard to speak to the middle-class working voters. I think we will see him make that appeal tonight in his 30 minute commercial.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: How has early voting been going in Cuyahoga County? Long lines, long waits or fairly smoothly?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Naymik: I assume you mean IN-PERSON early voting. In-person voting in Cuyahoga has been picking up in the last few days. Since it began, about 1,000 people a day were voting. On Sunday, thanks to bus loads of church goers, the board processed more than 2,000 early voters. Since the board offices are in downtown Cleveland, it is a safe bet that the bulk of the voters are Democrats. If you live in the suburbs, it is easier to mail in your absentee ballot. (Remember, voters who vote in person are also casting an absentee ballot.) Early voting - both in person and by mail - is up statewide from 2004. About 1 and five voters have voted already in Ohio, the Secretary of State's office says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Philadelphia: While I am optimistic that Obama can pull out a win in Ohio, it still would be a major upset on Election Day. How do you see it? What areas of the state will you be looking to for early returns on Election Night to clue you in on the outcome?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Naymik: An Ohio Newspaper Poll released Sunday shows Obama up by 3 points, 49 percent to 46 percent, which is a statistical dead heat. But since our first of three polls in mid Sept., Obama has gained seven points; McCain has lost two points. The trend favors Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But McCain is campaigning hard in Ohio - he'll be here Thursday for a two-day bus trip. Running mate Sarah Palin is here today and will continue to campaign in the state. (She should run for governor she's been here so much.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The big cities - Cincy, Columbus, and Cleveland -- will go for Obama. Clues to victory will be how well Obama does in rural and ex-urbia - Butler, Deleware, Medina counties - and in swing counties like Lake County. (There's plenty other examples, as well.) Problem is that Ohio - largely thanks to Cuyahoga County's slow count - may not have results in early. The election might be called before we know. If the election comes down to one state, Ohio will be the one we wait on.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dunn Loring, Va.: ACORN has been very active in Ohio and several Obama supporters have acknowledged improperly registering and voting in Ohio, but so far the only votes challenged by Jennifer Brunner has been to Republican absentee ballots. Despite the views of your first two questioners, doesn't this indicate that any voter suppression is likely to be against Republican voters?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Naymik: I urge people on this issues to remember that voter registration fraud (it's real, with plenty of examples in Ohio to support it) does not equal voter fraud. The GOP is concerned that illegal votes will cancel out legal votes, ultimately creating supression of good votes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But we have seen few cases - I can think of one or two reported in Ohio -- where people cast illegal ballots. Why? ACORN registers fake people to collect a paycheck, not help a candidate. A famous case of REGISTRATION fraud from 2004 is Jive Turkey, a name turned in by ACORN.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Turkey never showed up at the polls. I would have liked to see his ID.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: The Democrats picked up one of Ohio's House seats in 2006; how many do you expect them to gain this year? Are these wins the result of demographic shifts, or could they be reversed if the Democratic wave recedes?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Naymik: Ohio Democrats are confident that can pick up at least four , enough to give them control of the House. I don't see more than three. But the Democrats are benefiting from some weak GOP candidates, a lingering anti-Republican mood. We have not seen significant population shifts impact this.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pittsburgh: Now that Joe-the-Plumber has given the McCain/Palin ticket his formal endorsement, have intrepid reporters been checking his bank account for any recent infusions of cash from GOP fat-cats, which might enable him to actually buy his boss's plumbing firm?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Naymik: No. But we are looking at why Democrats in state government used state databases to look into Joe the Plumber's background - drivers license and child support etc. This story is getting a lot of traction in the state. The Columbus Dispatch first broke the story after a tip.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Austin, Texas: I have a sister who lives in Cincinnati. She won't talk politics with me -- says it's too volatile a subject (she voted enthusiastically for Bush in 2000, less enthusiastically in 2004). Anyway, what it the prediction on the House race in the 2nd Congressional District? Has Jean Schmidt made enough enemies to lose?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Naymik: Conventional wisdom from both parties is that she holds on.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Columbia, Md.: This is my first voting experience after becoming a proud U.S. citizen. I have two kids and am taking Nov. 4 off, and yes part of it is so I can vote. Do they allow kids in polling booths, or do I have to find a babysitter? I would appreciate your help.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Naymik: Speaking only to Ohio's rule: A child is allowed in with a parent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: Simple question: Who will win in Ohio?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Naymik: Two days before the 2004 election, I finally thought Kerry might pull it out in Ohio. He did not. The Ohio GOP/McCain operatin is not as big as Obama's this year, but I am not predicting this time what will happen in Ohio.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Portland, Ore.: Is there any lingering effects of the past Republican scandals that Democrats were able to capitalize on in the past election? I'm thinking of the governor's race especially. Any of that carrying over to this election, or is that all old news?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Naymik: Good question. The anti-Republican mood is from the top -- Bush's poor poll numbers. In Ohio, Republicans are benefiting from Democratic scandals, the biggest being the Democratic AG who resigned in spring after a sex scandal. Locally, the FBI is investigating Cuyahoga County's top two Democratic politicians. This has been a huge story here and Republicans are using it in ads against Dems.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Mark, thanks for doing this chat. You guys have been a key &quot;battleground state&quot; forever. I'm just curious if things feel different &quot;on the ground&quot; this year from say, 2004 or 2000. If so, how?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Naymik: Obama has a much more organized campaign than John Kerry in 2004. There is also far fewer outside groups -- like the now defunct America Coming Together -- doing door knocking and other GOTV efforts that seemed to duplicate efforts in Dem areas.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Ohio Democratic Party is far stronger.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As for McCain: his operation is less organized than Bush's. Part is do to the fact that McCain isn't the incumbent. He also doesn't have the resources. The Ohio GOP is still the backbone here and doing its thing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As for ground game, I've written a bit that Obama has the edge.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kansas City, Mo.: What's the outlook this time for matching up voting equipment with voters? There were stories in 2004 about voters waiting hours to vote.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Naymik: Election officials claim they have learned lessons from 2004 and will pay better attention to new registrations/primary activity to help them plan.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Important to remember that some of the problems in 2004 were the result of bad planning by Democratic officials, so I don't see this as a conspiracy in anyway, just bad planning.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">FYI: More than half - about 53 counties -- in Ohio will use touch screen systems. Most of the others on are optical scan machines, which have the ability to handle surges becasue people can just fill in the paper ballot and it can be scanned at the polling location later.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: Voter Challenges: It seems you and Kai Wright are looking at two different 2004 elections in Ohio. From Kai's chat (going on now): &quot;In 2004, for instance, the GOP sent 1,400 challengers to Ohio's Cuyahoga County. Not coincidentally, that's where we saw historically long waits to vote.&quot; You said there was no indication of voter challenges gumming up the works. Who's right?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Naymik: Cuyahoga County has 1,500 precincts so the number is not huge.</span></p>
