  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WASHINGTON -- The campaign to elect a new president and members of Congress is on pace to hit an unprecedented $5.3 billion, the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics said Wednesday. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The money raised and spent by candidates, parties and outside groups on campaigning, advertising, conventions and other political activities in this election has shattered records.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the total, while an eye-popping figure, pales compared with other spending. For example, it's less than the nearly $6 billion the National Retail Federation estimates Americans will shell out for Halloween next week.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The cost of the presidential race alone -- a record $2.4 billion -- is less than the $2.6 billion Coca-Cola spent on advertising in 2006. The old record for White House campaign spending was $1.6 billion, set in 2004.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This is a relatively small investment when you consider all the things that are far less important but on which we spend far more money,&quot; said Sheila Krumholz, the center's executive director. &quot;But in terms of political finance, these numbers are staggering.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">All White House contenders have collected $1.5 billion in contributions since fundraising formally kicked off in January 2007. That's nearly double the haul of presidential candidates four years ago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The jury is out on whether all this spending is effective,&quot; said Kenneth Cooper, a former Federal Election Commission official and a campaign-finance expert. &quot;There's so much money flooding the airwaves that there's a real question as to whether or not it's moved voters.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Other trends:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">*The economy might be in meltdown, but employees in finance, insurance and real estate companies dominate political giving, contributing more than $370 million. Employees at Goldman Sachs and the company's political action committee top the corporate-giving list with $5 million, the center found.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">*Democrats, who have outraised Republicans this election season, are on track to collect nearly $6 out of every $10 raised. Four years ago, the party split was about even.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">*Outside political groups, known as 527s for the section of the tax code under which they operate, play a smaller role. The groups that focus on federal races have reported $424 million in fundraising to the IRS, a 12% decrease from 2004.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This year's heavy spending means voters in hotly contested states are inundated.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Carmen Cabrera, who runs a general store in Asheville, N.C., is overwhelmed. Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain are campaigning hard there for the White House. &quot;Every other commercial is about politics,&quot; she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I'll be glad when it's all over.&quot; <br /></span></p>
