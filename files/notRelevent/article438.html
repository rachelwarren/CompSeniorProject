  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Good morning,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As the economy wheezes, both candidates for president are talking about ways to tackle its revival. John McCain is proposing a 9/11-style commission; Barack Obama proposed closer scrutiny of credit-ratings services. Meanwhile, both candidates are tending to the financial health of their campaign. McCain raised more than $5 million at an event in Florida last night; Obama is set to take in more than $9 million in Beverly Hills.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lots of politics to discuss with 49 days left to the election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What's on your minds?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Raleigh, N.C.: Good morning! Can you tell us anything about Team Obama's efforts to work the 527 angle? Whom is being asked for money? What issues are they going to hit?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Good morning Raleigh,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There are lots of signs that outside groups are finally heating up as the campaign enters this critical stage. These groups had spent more than $100 million by this point four years ago. So far they have spent only $8 million this year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As for your question, both Sen. Obama and Sen. McCain have vowed to tamp down the role of 527's (or 501(c)4s) during this year's campaign. But on both sides, there are signs that those requests are starting to fall on deaf ears.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Specifically on the Democratic side, there is a group called Brave New PAC, that seems to be modeling itself on the Swift Boat group from four years ago. It attacks McCain in a new ad on, of all things, his military service.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here's what Fox News said about it:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;A former Naval Academy midshipman who was imprisoned alongside John McCain is the narrator of a new television ad that bashes the Republican candidate by saying being a prisoner of war is not a good prerequisite for being president The ad, produced by Brave New PAC, a liberal political action committee affiliated with Brave New Films, shows Phillip Butler saying McCain was known as a &quot;very volatile guy&quot; and someone Butler would not like to see &quot;with his finger near the red button.&quot; Leighton Woodhouse, communications director for both Brave New Films and the PAC, said two days of national air time has been purchased on cable news channels CNN and MSNBC. He called it a &quot;moderate buy to get the message out.&quot; Woodhouse said that they will re-evaluate whether to continue running it if &quot;it seems to be resonating.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Springfield, Va.: How soon until Rangel is forced out of his chairman's seat? How will his troubles affect the ability of the Congress to pass a budget this year, or at least a continuing resolution -- or do you forsee another shutdown like we had under Clinton?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Interesting question. I have followed this issue as a reader, more than as a reporter. So I asked Chris Lee, who helped break the Rangel story, to help me with an answer. Here's what his assessment was:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It remains to be seen whether Mr. Rangel will be forced out. He's certainly under pressure to at least temporarily step aside while the ethics committee investigates him. It's not surprising that Republicans have called for him to step aside. But in the last few days the New York Times and the Philadelphia Inquirer did too. And there is some indication that House Democrats are pushing him in that direction as well.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If he were to step aside, it would be a political blow for House Democrats, who took back the House two years ago in part on their promise to end the 'culture of corruption' that they accused Republicans of fostering. But it's not likely to interfere with passage of a budget. There are plenty of other factors that are slowing that down. Pretty soon Congress will recess so that lawmakers can campaign to keep their seats in the fall election, guaranteeing that the appropriations bills will remain unfinished when the fiscal year closes at the end of September. But many analysts believe the Democrats would like to wait until next year to pass most spending bills anyway, since, if Obama wins, they'd have a Democratic president to sign the bills rather than President Bush.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Baltimore: Doesn't holding fundraisers after taking public financing -- as mcCain is -- make a mockery of the McCain-Feingold law?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: I have a bunch of questions about this, Baltimore, so I'll take a stab at an answer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain-Feingold is not really what applies here. What McCain is doing, legally I'm told, is working the loopholes in the presidential public financing system. You are correct that, after accepting $84 million in public funds, McCain was supposed to be done with fundraising, and use that money to pay for his campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the Republican National Committee is allowed to continue to raise money. And McCain has turned his attention to helping them do that.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Los Angeles: Explain the restrictions on the national party committees' expenditures for the presidential campaign, and what the point of public financing is if the Republican National Committee can raise hundreds of millions of dollars and spend it on McCain?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Here's a related question.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The RNC can spend roughly $20 million in direct coordination with the McCain campaign, and that money can be spent on anything, including television ads.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The McCain campaign and the RNC can also coordinate RNC spending on field operations, on efforts to get out the vote, on mail campaigns. That's where a good portion of the RNC's money will go.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The only place they cannot coordinate efforts is on the RNC's so-called independent expenditure efforts.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So, what's the point of the public financing system, in light of all this? Well, the system was created to keeps a presidential candidate from being beholden to big money interests, and to prevent them from having to spend all their time raising money. Based on what's happening this year, you can decide for yourself whether it's still working as it was intended.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Baltimore: From what I've seen so far, McCain seems to be concentrating his money on TV ad buys while Obama seems to be spending a higher percentage on opening offices and hiring organizers -- the &quot;air game&quot; versus the &quot;ground game.&quot; Has anyone collected percentages, or does anyone track these sorts of things historically?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: This was correct, at least as of July. But I suspect the spending numbers will have shifted somewhat -- with Sen. Obama increasing his spending on television. I'm told the McCain campaign has not changed its formula much, but that may be because the RNC is slated to handle much of the ground game.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wilmington, Del.: Barack Obama is rolling in dough. At what point does his rejection in public financing show itself in an advantage in the number of TV commercials, for example? I haven't seen much of anything from independent Republican 527s to offset Obama's advantage. Down the stretch, doesn't his ability to outspend his opponent reverse McCain's gains? Or can the Republican National Committee meet the challenge?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Hi Wilmington. These are some terrific questions, and I don't have any easy answers for you.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">First, there is the question of whether Barack Obama really has a financial edge. Much of that will depend on what he raises in September, particularly online. If he raises $100 million this month, he will probably be on pace to have a decent money advantage. If he raises less than that, it's quite possible he and Sen. McCain (along with the RNC) will have comperable amounts to spend on the campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let's take your premise, though, and assume Sen. Obama will have a sizeable edge. I'm not aware that we've ever seen a case where one candidate has vastly more to spend than the other. It could prove very important to Obama in the final weeks, if he's able to bombard McCain on television and outspend him in the field. On the other hand, Obama had a significant money advantage in key primaries against Sen. Clinton, and it was not able to help him win in Pennsylvania, Ohio, or West Virginia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Columbus, Ohio: Obama's raising $9 million tonight in Hollywood? At $30,000/seat, that's only 300 people, right? Who are the 300 people? And who pays to throw the party? It's gotta cost millions to throw the kind of party that Hollywood billionaires and Barbara Streisand attends. Who foots the bill for that? Didn't the Clintons get in trouble for this kind of thing?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Hi Columbus.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There's nothing illegal about this fundraiser, as far as I can tell. Under FEC rules, you can raise up to $28,500 from each donor, with the money going to the Democratic National Committee. As for who is giving the money, and who organizes the event, those questions can be answered on Oct. 20, when we see disclosure reports for the month of September. I suspect candidates count on no one caring at that point. But I can promise you that we'll be scouring the reports to answer those very questions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Salinas, Calif.: Hi Matthew. Will the McCain campaign have to bench Carly Fiorina (their &quot;business expert&quot;) during this news cycle regarding the current Wall Street collapse and &quot;fat cat&quot; golden parachutes for CEOs when it is easily pointed out that Fiorina was handed her $21 million package after helming Hewlett-Packard into the weeds? Or do they think that no one will notice?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Hi Salinas,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There are a number of Republican sources of mine who have been wondering about that -- and whether her background would become a liability at some point. So far, there's no sign that it has -- it might be a little to much inside baseball for some folks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Time will tell, though...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fairfax County, Va.: I remember a substantive speech Obama gave this spring about financial regulation. It was really disappointing to see how little coverage it got at the time. Does the content of the speech apply to the current crisis (I think it does), and if so, should the campaign or the press be revisiting that footage? It sometimes seems that if a speech isn't covered within 24 hours, it never is heard from again -- which is frustrating, especially when his opponent's idea of immediate action is to create a commission to study the problem.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Upcoming Discussion: The Economy and the Election (washingtonpost.com, 1:30 p.m. ET today)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Hello Fairfax. Good news! My colleague Glenn Kessler will be chatting about this very question this afternoon at 1:30. If the speech has been ignored up until now, at least you will have the chance to revive discussion of it this afternoon!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chicago: Perhaps this is slightly out of your domain, but I'm sensing that a shift is starting to take place regarding Palin's impact on the election. She is starting to get the scrutiny that comes from this kind of campaign and I don't think she'll weather it well. Could McCain have peaked too early?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: We have a number of questions about the vice presidential picks. I think this question of how Gov. Palin will wear over time is one people are watching closely. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this -- will the McCain campaign be able to sustain the enthusiasm that has surrounded her selection?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I'll offer one thought on this. Palin appears to have tapped into an undercurrent among religious conservatives, who lost their reason to be excited about this campaign after Gov. Mike Huckabee dropped out of the race. I don't see any reason to believe that, now that this group is energized, they will not remain energized.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anonymous: Are there any restrictions on what can be shown in independent ads? I understand free speech, but can anyone run a totally substantiated ad saying the most believable lie the weekend before the election, and tilt an election totally on a made up charge? Seriously, if someone finds an alleged ex or a prostitute who claims a candidate was abusive, gay, a foreign agent, etc., and they launch an ad the Sunday or Monday before the Tuesday election, would there be any checks or repercussions?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Okay... this is a really interesting question. And I was stumped. So I just called Michael Toner, a former Federal Election Commission chairman, to see what the rules are.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here's what Toner told me:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;In terms of the content, what the ads can say, there are no real restrictions. An ad can be as negative as they want it to be.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Broadcast stations cannot take a candidate's ads off the air, even if they are demonstrably false.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;But, that is not the case with ads by third party groups. There, a station can take an ad off the air if they don't think it's accurate. That's at the discretion of the broadcast company.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Charlottesville Va:&quot;Could McCain have peaked too early?&quot; I almost spit my coffee on my keyboard. Are you kidding? McCain and Palin are still climbing in the polls. Obama is dropping. &quot;Did Obama peak too early?&quot; is a much better question. But I guess that wouldn't fit the media narrative, would it?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Thanks for this reply, Charlottsville... and please be careful with your coffee!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: Coordination between Candidate and Party: Can you explain that some more? For example, can the coordination produce a TV ad, run it once, and then say &quot;if only a 527 or the party's independent expenditure fund would pay for more air time&quot;?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: I think I follow your question here... basically, coordination involves direct communication. So if the candidate's media team writes an ad and asks an outside group to pay to put it on the air, that would not fly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But, outside groups are very good at reading the signals coming from a campaign. So you might see Sen. Obama start talking about McCain and his close ties to lobbyists. And then, an interest group might create and place a television ad making the same claim. And all that would be allowed, since the two never actually discussed the ad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bethesda, Md.: M Squared, how &quot;honest&quot; is the Obama&nbsp;ad that merely lifts McCain criticisms from liberal commentators like E.J. Dionne? That's like claiming the Cowboys are bad based on the opinion of a Redskins fan!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Howie Kurtz just did an adwatch on this exact question. He thought the practice was, well, suspect. But I'll see if we can dig out a link so you can read his views for yourself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Seattle: Surfing around this morning, I caught something I just have to ask. Did McCain's economic advisor just claim that McCain invented the Blackberry?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Adviser says McCain helped create the BlackBerry (AP, Sept. 16)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Here's the response coming from the McCain campaign on this question, which I can share from my colleague Bob Barnes, who is out on the trail with McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Senior aide Matt McDonald said that the senator &quot;laughed&quot; when he heard the comment. &quot;He would not claim to be the inventor or anything, much less the BlackBerry. This was obviously a boneheaded joke by a staffer,&quot; McDonald said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anonymous: If the Obama campaign is putting more faith on field organization, has anyone analyzed how well this organization is structured and being used? My limited personal observation by playing back my answering machine is thus: If calling someone every day begging for money is how they are using their field operation, they don't seem to be spending their time well on things that win votes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Thanks for this question -- you know, I think it's going to be very hard to tell whether the Obama ground game is successful until Election Day. But I can tell you they have devoted a tremendous amount of money and energy on this aspect of the campaign. As for the fundraising calls you're getting, those are probably the result of a program through which Obama tries to get volunteers to call their neighbors and get them involved in the campaign. I've heard mixed things about that program, including this interesting op-ed piece in The Post on the topic.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here's the link:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/12/AR2008091202658.html</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Salinas, Calif.: Matthew, regarding Obama's &quot;ground game&quot;: I haven't heard any in-depth discussion regarding the impact of the local organizing of new voters nationwide (specifically first time African American and under-25 white voters) who may not have yet shown up on the radar of national polling. With the current polls calling it close, is it possible that there is a vast body of new voters out there who are waiting to come into play in November?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Another interesting ground game question. Thank you Salinas. During the GOP Convention, we met with McCain campaign manager Rick Davis for an on-the-record discussion about the campaign. He said that the goal of the Obama campaign has been to grow the Democratic base, and turn them out. If every Democratic voter came out and voted for Obama, he said, Obama would win. The McCain campaign, by contrast, has focused its attention on persuading moderate Democrats (so-called Reagan Democrats, women who find Gov. Palin appealing, blue collar workers who supported Hillary Clinton, etc.) to cross party lines. That's the formula for a McCain victory.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So understanding that, it kind of makes sense that Obama is focused so much on a formula to getting Democrats to the voting booth, while McCain is pouring energy into advertising that aims to persuade moderates to go with him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: Ads: Wow. So seriously, a candidate can run ads that spew demonstrably bald-faced lies, and no one can do anything about it? Ads for products have to be at least not false; why are campaign ads -- inarguably more important than those for mouthwash and dog food -- given so much slack?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: I guess when politicians write the laws, they give themselves a lot of latitude. :)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Matthew Mosk: Well gang,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Looks like we're out of time. Thanks so much for all the great questions. And don't forget to join my colleague Glenn Kessler at 1:30 to discuss politics and the economy -- the day's hot topic.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Till next time...</span></p>
