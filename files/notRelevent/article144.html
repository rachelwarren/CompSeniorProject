  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: Good Morning Everyone. Glad you could join us today. So here we are, less than two weeks before the election. Seems like only two years ago that the campaign started! I'm looking forward to your questions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fort Worth, Texas: Hi there, Lois. Here's a question that has been bugging me: I've seen polls that show that third-party candidates get up to 10 percent of the vote when they're included in the options. Why no coverage of them? It seems that time has been spent on less-than-ground-shaking articles about the two main candidates, so why no time spent on the others?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: We simply do not have the resources at this late stage of the game, to send reporters to cover fringe candidates that are not going to win. This is an extremely important election, and our readers care about the two main candidates. Also, I think 10% is a stretch.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Poplar Bluff, Mo.: Lois, thanks for the questions. McCain and Palin are spending quite a bit of time in Pennsylvania, and polls show a lead for Obama. Gov. Rendall personally has asked for Obama to come back to campaign. Why is Obama losing ground in the Keystone State?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: Obama is up ten points in Pennsylvania so he's is very good shape there. Clearly, something in McCains internal polling is showing he has opportunity there, so Rendell is being cautious. Democrats always do well in Pennsylvania. Its a long-shot for McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sewickley, Pa.: During the primary season, I frequently noticed Sen. Clinton's suits and would say to myself &quot;oh she's wearing the brown one again -- that's my favorite&quot; or &quot;there's the powder blue one again.&quot; While she always looked put-together, her wardrobe didn't seem excessive. What do you estimate the price tag for her campaign wardrobe was?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: I have no idea, and thats the way she wants it. She has very nice, designer lothes-- St Johns knits, Charles Nolan- but they are largely understated and she pays for them herself. So, you wont see any bills for $150,000 flying around.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rochester, Minn.: A question related to Powell's endorsement of Sen. Obama: Are there any other prominent Republicans who haven't made endorsements and might endorse Obama, or prominent Democrats who haven't made endorsements and might endorse McCain?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: I think we've seen what we're going to see on that front.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Burke, Va.: Ms. Romano, I hope you and your friends don't come down like a ton of bricks on the clothing expenses of Sarah Palin -- as your paper's own fashion critic said, her clothes are not ostentatious. She obviously dresses with great care because she is the highest profile woman in America today, with tens of millions watching and critiquing her every move on television, in debates, in speeches and on &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; Critics would would hammer her for dressing like a hick backwoods hockey mom if she made the slightest fashion faux pas. Now she is being hammered for not dressing like a hockey mom. She is damned if she does and damned if she doesn't.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin did not pay for the clothes herself, and will not keep them after the campaign. The other candidates and their wives wear very expensive clothes (McCain wears $500 loafers and Obama has $1,500 custom-made suits while a Kenyan farmer makes $30 a year), and yet the media doesn't make a big fuss. Mark this down in your notebook: this clothing &quot;scandal&quot; doesn't turn me off to the hockey mom candidate. Her tastefully dressed appearance, plus her poise and grace under fire, makes me support her even more.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: After a $150,000 Makeover, Sarah Palin Has an Image Problem (Post, Oct. 23)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: All good points. But it sure is alot of money and most people cannot fathom how one could even get to that amount. Its was reported this morning that she wore a Valentino jacket at the convention-- one of the most expensive designers on the planet.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Not-Real Virginia: The polls here in Virginia seem to indicate that Obama has a pretty comfortable lead, moreso than in some states with much closer numbers. But we're still in the toss up category. Why are the numbers not more convincing to pollsters?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: The pollsters can tell how decisive the voters are by certain questions. Virginia has long been a red state and and so perhaps the pollsters are seeing that some voters could still be swayed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: Reading the New York Times' breathless front-page coverage of the Republican campaign spending $150,000 for Sarah Palin's wardrobe, I felt like screaming &quot;enough already, guys&quot;! You've done your job and you've done it well -- your man will win and it looks like he will win in a landslide. You can afford to move just a wee bit out of the Obama tank now. It is beginning to seem the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in-the-tank-for-Obama was actually understated. Do you think there will be a point when even the most committed Obama supporters begin to recognize the one-sided nature of mainstream media coverage of this election cycle?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Upcoming Discussion: Project for Excellence in Journalism on Winning the Media in Election 2008 (washingtonpost.com, noon ET today)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: I have a theory that at some time or another, all coverage of politicians and presidents evens out. John McCain enjoyed effusive media coverage for years--starting with his 2000 race. The coverage of Palin, while perhaps over the top for you, is what the media sees as accountability coverage. She has pitched herself as a middle class hockey mom. And not too many of them spend $150,000 on clothes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pittsburgh: What was Sarah Palin wearing the past few years before her $150,000 makeover, anyway? Surely some of her clothes were still-serviceable classics; I know this is true of my wardrobe, and am betting it's probably yours as well. Also, if Palin gives away her new clothes after the campaign, what will she wear afterward? Fleece? On a related note, when Geraldine Ferraro ran for vice president in 1984, did she buy her own new clothes for the campaign, or wear what she already owned, or did the Democratic National Committee buy her a new wardrobe?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: Im sure Geraldine Ferraro bought her own clothes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Boston: How much do you think the McCain's campaign decision to release all negative ads to the media contributed to the impression that he is so much more negative than Obama -- whose negative ads run under the radar as much as possible? Seems smart to let people in the non-swing states view Obama as positive. What's normal from previous campaigns?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: The reason McCain is being labeled as negative is because his ads seem so personal. Granted I haven't seen every Obama&nbsp;ad out there, but his attacks ads are about issues. McCain's effort to repeatedly suggest Obama cohorts with terrorists is over the top, in many people's view.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Indiana: It is my understanding that the $150,000 was for clothes for the whole family -- so it's a generous allowance, but not outrageous.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: That is what has been reported but the lions share went for her clothes. Even if Todd bought 5 suits at $2000 each and a few pair of expensive shoes, you're still only at $11,000 or thereabouts. Outfits for the kids for the convention-- and other $5,000 maybe. Thats still alot of money. Ive been trying to do the math since yesterday and Im having trouble getting to that allowance. Unless she bought a fur coat and her inaugural gown.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Boston: Hi Lois. I keep reading how McCain would have attracted more Independents and moderate Democrats if he had stuck with his opposition to the Bush tax cuts and his &quot;agents of intolerance&quot; take on some of the more extreme evangelicals. Would the net effect of that have been zero with him giving up the usual Republican base, or would they have gone for McCain anyway?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: So hard to say. But I do think he lost alot of traction recently with the attacks and negative ads. People dont want to be called unpatriotic. How did one part of the country become more patriotic than another? Why is one part of Virginia the &quot;real Virginia?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Lois, thanks for the good chat. I felt when McCain pulled out of Michigan, that was the death knell. And I still feel that way. Is there any realistic scenario where he wins this thing, barring some total bombshell?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: The bomshell is his best bet right now.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Assuming Obama wins the Presidency, what schools will his children attend -- D.C. public schools, or will they be sent to a private school?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: Good question and it's always an issue. In all fairness, its fairly difficult for a president to send his children to public schools in 2008. It would cost the taxpayers more to protect them that tuition for a private school.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: Any word on jury deliberations in the Stevens case?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: 'Stressful' deliberations continue in Stevens case (AP, Oct. 23)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: not yet.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dunn Loring, Va.: Robin Givhan briefly mentions that Obama wears $1,500 suits and that Michelle wears designer clothes. Could you tell me where The Post's expose on their clothing expenses are?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: The Obamas pay for their own clothes. The expense are not public record. Hillary Clinton also pays for her own clothes-- no record.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The RNC footed the bill for Palin's clothes and then listed it in an FEC report. When John Edwards charged his haircuts to his campaign, it was widely and critically reported.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Herndon, Va.: I read that up to a third of all votes may be cast early. Do you have any information on how they will be counted and reported on Election Night? That is, could we get a lot of results early in the night, or will the votes cast on Election Day be counted and posted first, then the early votes?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: My understanding is everyone holds back until all polls are closed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: Greetings -- I look forward to the chats you do every other week. As a resident in the Alexandria area I have received two mailings that caught my attention. I don't want to jump to any conclusions and say there is some sort of coordination going on between these two groups, but what follows seems like an awfully big coincidence. On Monday I received in the mail some sort of DVD called &quot;Obsession&quot; about how Radical Islam from the West wants to take over, and then two days later I received in the mail a brochure from the Virginia GOP about Obama being a friend of Bill Ayers. Why would these organizations do this? My understanding from polling showed that the American people were worried about other issues, like the economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: I have been perplexed by the hammering on Bill Ayers. I can only guess that McCain's polls show it engergizes his base and he needs them to come out next Tuesday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Helena, Mont.: Get out your crystal ball and predict -- if Obama wins, do you think he still will draw 100,000 when he goes somewhere and makes a speech as president? I think yes, he will -- people want to hear him talk, whether in the campaign or if he were president. The one thing his campaign has done for me is restore my faith in my fellow citizens that they have an attention span for more than the 30-second ad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: He's not going to have too many large venue opportunities to test your theory. But I would guess that, yes, he will remain a big draw.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: You said vote next Tuesday -- you meant a week from next Tuesday, Nov. 4, right?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: yes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Silver Spring, Md.: Do you think Obama will lose any ground by taking a day off the campaign trail to be with his grandmother? His commercials are still up and the Bidens and Michelle Obama are making appearances he still has a very big presence in battleground states. If necessary, he also could do appearances by satellite from Hawaii. So it really should be a non-issue. I don't think there is any political motivations to the trip, but it also will personalize him for some voters. It's certainly better than taking a day off to give a deposition for an investigation of your own alleged abuse of power.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: Who knows? He'd probably lose more ground if he didn't go because everyone would accuse him of abandoing his grandmother on her deathbed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.: Re: Stevens case. Is the lack of a quick jury decision a bad sign for the senator?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: Not necessarily. Maybe they can't agree.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Champaign, Ill.: In the story by Michael Abramowitz and Juliet Eilperin, they report that McCain aides dismissed the story as not important during a time of financial and foreign crisis. $150,000 on clothes is not important during a financial crisis? What are these yo-yos thinking?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: They are thinking that they unwittingly created a scandal 12 days before the election and they hope it goes away.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: The upcoming New York Times Magazine article seems to suggest dissention in the McCain camp as to why they are losing and ultimately will lose. Is it that bad from the rumblings you are picking up on the trail?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: There will be enough blame to go around and yes, its starting now.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama schools: Considering Obama's children are in a private school now, I'd assume that's not likely to change if he becomes president...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: probably true.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Northern Virginia: We have heard a lot about negative and positive ads from both candidates. Is there any analysis out there to describe how many of these negative ads are issue contrast ads, rather than character attacks?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: not sure but might trying looking onthe website for the Project for Excellance in Journalism. They camparative studies you might find useful.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lexington Park, Md.: Maryland's Secretary of State is expecting an 85 percent turnout for this election; if you were a gambler, would you take the under or over? What if the mark were lowered to, say, 70 percent? Despite all of the hooplah, I suspect we'll stay in the 50 percent to 55 percent range -- a real disappointment!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: This election--primaries etc-- has had highest turnout in history in most states. I suspect that wont change. Its a highly charged race.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Indianapolis: Obama is speaking here in a few minutes. A Democrat in Indiana, less than two weeks before the election. Can you believe it? This is an astounding end to an incredible campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: This has indeed been an astounding race from start to finish-- never a dull moment. Just make sure you all vote-- don't take anything for granted.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thank you all for joing me. See you in two weeks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lois Romano: Just a reminder to join my colleagues here every day at this time. Enjoy your day!</span></p>
