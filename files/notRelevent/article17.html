  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On the last Sunday before the election, the presidential candidates and their running mates kept up a relentless pace by visiting states their respective parties had lost in 2004.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee who is trailing in national polls, was making appearances in two states that voted Democratic in 2004, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, where he will hold his final town hall. On Monday, he will visit five swing states -- starting with a midnight rally in Florida then Virginia, Indiana, New Mexico and Nevada -- along with a stop in Tennessee before flying home to Arizona for Election Day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Now let me give you a little straight talk about the state of the race today,'' Mr. McCain said hoarsely at a morning rally at Strath Haven High School in Wallingford, Pa. ''There's just two days left. We're a couple of points behind in Pennsylvania. The pundits have written us off, just like they've done before.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Then his voice cleared: ''My friends, the Mac is back!'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, spent Sunday speaking at rallies in the largest cities in the hotly contested state of Ohio, with Bruce Springsteen taking the stage Sunday evening in Cleveland to warm up the crowd. On Monday, he will visit three states that voted Republican in 2004, Florida, North Carolina and Virginia, before heading home to Chicago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''We are at the crossroads, and its been a long, long, time coming,'' Mr. Springsteen said, strumming a guitar before breaking into a song, ''The Rising.'' ''I am honored to be on the same stage with Senator Obama. From the beginning, there's been something in Senator Obama that's called upon our better angels.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama entered the stage all smiles.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I've got to tell you the last couple of days I've just been feeling good,'' he said, adding that it was in part due to the presence of his wife, Michelle, and daughters Malia and Sasha on the campaign trail. ''You start to think we might be able to win an election on Nov. 4.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But he warned against complacency, urging his supporters to go to the polls on Election Day: ''We can't give up now, not when there is so much at stake. We got to go out there and win this election.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama spent the morning in Columbus addressing tens of thousands of people on the grounds of the Ohio State House. ''It won't be easy, it won't be quick, but you and I know it's time to come together and change this country,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We can't let this slip away.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gov. Sarah Palin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, was also appearing in Columbus on Sunday during her own four-city Ohio tour. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''The time for choosing is near, and the choice is going to come down to what we believe in, Ohio,'' she said in Canton. ''We believe in the forward movement of freedom, not the constant expansion of government.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Senator Joseph R. Biden. Jr., Mr. Obama's running mate, addressed supporters in Florida, starting in Tallahassee, moving on to Gainesville before a final appearance in Daytona Beach. In his first stop, he said the country's divisive politics must end.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''We cannot stay blue and red, really, we cannot stay divided,'' he said on the campus of Florida State University on Sunday afternoon. ''We can't strengthen the economy if we are pitted one against the other.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''We cannot move past the politics of division unless we reach out to those people in the parking lot,'' he added, referring to a dozen noisy pro-McCain protesters nearby.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, also speaking on ''Face the Nation,'' said that Senator McCain was poised to make a final surge.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Well, what we've seen in the last two weeks is very much a tightening of the race in the states that matter,'' Mr. Graham said. ''We see closing in Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Ohio. We have him [Mr. Obama] under 50, in the margin of error.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> For all of the last-minute campaigning, many Americans have already voted. A record 27 million absentee and early votes were cast in 30 states as of Saturday night, according to The Associated Press. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Off the trail, the Obama campaign tried to make the most of Vice President Cheney's support of Mr. McCain in a speech in Laramie, Wyo., on Saturday night. By Sunday morning, the Obama campaign had produced a television ad highlighting Mr. Cheney's remarks as an ''endorsement.'' The ad ends with two photos of Mr. McCain with President Bush, emphasizing Mr. Obama's refrain of linking the two.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> While Mr. McCain has spent months distancing himself from President Bush and his policies, he did take the unusual step of praising the president during his Wallingford, Pa., appearance on Sunday. The remarks came after he had been introduced by Tom Ridge, the former Pennsylvania governor and Homeland Security secretary.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I think that Tom Ridge -- and President Bush -- deserve some credit for the fact there's not been another attack on the United States of America since 9/11,'' Mr. McCain said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Meanwhile, the Republican Party in Pennsylvania released a new attack ad featuring Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Mr. Obama's controversial former pastor. The McCain campaign said it had not authorized the ad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The 30-second spot, titled ''Judgment,'' juxtaposes images of Mr. Obama and Mr. Wright. A narrator says: ''Barack Obama -- he chose as his pastor a man who blamed the U.S. for the 9/11 attacks. Does that sound like someone who should be president?''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It was unclear how often the ad had been broadcast, and the state group was raising money on its Web site to get more air time.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> For the most part, the candidates hammered home the central messages of their campaigns in rally after rally.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Columbus, Mr. Obama vowed to not raises taxes on any American earning less than $250,000 a year, and reminded voters he was the candidate who would move quickly to get troops out of Iraq.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''It's time to stop spending $10 billion a month in Iraq while the Iraqi government sits on a huge surplus,'' he said. ''As president, I will end this war.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain, meanwhile, continued to play on comments by Senator Biden indicating that Mr. Obama would likely face an international crisis during the first six months of his campaign. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''My friends, I have been tested, Senator Obama hasn't,'' McCain said at an afternoon rally Scranton, Pa., with Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut standing behind him. ''And we know, Senator Obama won't have the right response to that test, because the short time he's been in the Senate we've seen the wrong response from him over and over again.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The night before, Mr. McCain had appeared on ''Saturday Night Live.'' He opened the show doing a mock QVC segment, with Tina Fey as Sarah Palin on his side.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Standing in a suit and tie, Mr. McCain hawked knives for cutting pork for the shopping network; and offered 10 blank commemorative plates celebrating the joint town-hall-style meetings that he had wanted to have with Mr. Obama. His wife, Cindy McCain, displayed shiny gold necklaces named after his signature campaign finance reform bill, McCain-Feingold.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At one point, the fake Sarah Palin went rogue, attempting to sell Palin 2012 T-shirts.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The skit was a wry take on Mr. Obama's half-hour television spot on Wednesday, which cost his campaign more than $3 million. ''Look, would I rather be on three major networks?'' Mr. McCain said. ''Of course. But I'm a true maverick -- a Republican without money.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Keeping with the joking theme, the real Sarah Palin unwittingly took a prank telephone call Saturday from a Canadian comedian posing as President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who told her she would make a good president someday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Maybe in eight years,'' replies a laughing Palin, who spent several minutes on the call bantering with the fake president about hunting and other subjects before being told it was a prank.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The call was made by Marc-Antoine Audette, who with his comedic partner, Sebastien Trudel, is notorious for prank calls to celebrities and heads of state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Meanwhile, the government was investigating whether any laws had been broken in the disclosure that Barack Obama's aunt was living in the country illegally.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Associated Press reported on Friday that Mr. Obama's half-aunt on his father's side, Zeituni Onyango, has been living in Boston public housing even though she was ordered to leave the country in 2004. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Homeland Security Department is not permitted to disclose details about an individual's immigration status, but two sources, one of whom is a federal law enforcement official, told The A.P that Ms. Onyango was in the country illegally. The A.P. said it could not establish whether anyone at a political level in the Bush administration or in the McCain campaign had been involved in the information's release.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama's campaign pledged on Saturday to return her $265 in campaign contributions, which Ms. Onyango, a 56-year-old Kenyan citizen, donated in increments in as small as $5. Only American citizens are allowed to donate to political campaigns. </span></p>
