  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A campaign waged under the specter of war and financial crisis drew to an anxious finish on Monday as Senators Barack Obama and John McCain raced across nine states and asked voters on both sides to discount polls and predictions on the closing day of a two-year pursuit of the presidency.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama surrendered the race to the judgment of the American people as he told a booming crowd here, ''Now, it's all about who wants it more, who believes in it more.'' Mr. McCain sought to motivate Republicans who worried aloud that it could be a bleak election, declaring, ''The Mac is back!''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In the final hours of his second bid for the presidency, Mr. McCain dashed through Republican-leaning states from Florida to Indiana and New Mexico to Nevada. He stopped in Tennessee, hoping to reach voters in adjacent North Carolina and Virginia, and he swung by only one normally Democratic state, Pennsylvania. He planned to return home for a rally in Arizona in the small hours of the night. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama, confident in his standing on Democratic terrain, devoted his final day of campaigning by trying to push Florida, North Carolina and Virginia into his column. He pressed ahead after he awoke to news that his grandmother, the woman chiefly responsible for his upbringing, had died in Hawaii. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The election eve travels of both men, as well as their running mates, offered a viewer's guide of the states whose outcomes will play a large role in settling who will become the nation's 44th president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Their last-minute efforts were amplified by their muscular ground organizations and unprecedented advertising barrages in all forms. The Obama campaign tested its text-messaging program to remind voters, particularly young ones, to go to the polls. The McCain campaign activated its automated phone system to check with any voter who had shown an interest in the Republican ticket. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In their pitches to voters, each candidate struck an optimistic chord, delivering a few gracious words about his opponent and offering a vow to change Washington. Yet neither refrained from reprising the piercing criticisms that have become the soundtrack for the five-month general election fight. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''At the end of this long race, I want to congratulate him on the tough race that he has fought,'' Mr. Obama said of Mr. McCain in a morning speech here at Veterans Memorial Auditorium. ''He can point to a few items where he has broken with President Bush, but when it comes from the central issue of this election, the plain truth is John McCain has stood with George Bush.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain delivered a truncated version of his stump speech at each stop but grew hoarser as the day progressed. His aides said he appeared to be catching the bad cold that had waylaid many others in the petri dish of his campaign plane. By late afternoon in Indiana, he was sucking on throat lozenges to try to finish the marathon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''My friends, you know that I've been fighting for this country since I was 17 years old, and I have the scars to prove it,'' he said at a rally in Indianapolis as he battled to prevent Mr. Obama from taking a state that has not backed a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Four hours later, Mr. McCain dropped out of the sky into the supposed home of space aliens, Roswell, N.M. ''I am pleased to announce that I have received the alien endorsement,'' he told the crowd, to a roar of laughter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As the contest headed to its finish, an air of normalcy surrounded Mr. Obama. There was no rush of friends or advisers on the plane for the final flights. His demeanor, at least from his public appearances, seemed the same as it has for months. His schedule of rallies was no different than at any point in the general election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Only a few close advisers knew that at 8 a.m. he had received word from his sister that his 86-year-old grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, had died. When he arrived at a rally, he spoke briefly about his grandmother, whom he visited last month in Honolulu.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''She has gone home,'' Mr. Obama said, his voice tinged with emotion. ''She died peacefully in her sleep with my sister at her side, so there's great joy instead of tears.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain, as he sprinted through seven states, warned voters at every stop of the differences between the outlooks and policies of the two tickets. He did not dally, spending 30 minutes at each stop, with his argument boiled down to fit the frenzied moment. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Senator Obama's running to punish the successful,'' Mr. McCain said at his opening stop in Tampa, Fla. ''I'm running to make everyone successful.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The mood on the McCain campaign plane was upbeat and punchy throughout the day as Mr. McCain's advisers continued to hammer their belief that the polls were tightening and that Mr. McCain's chances of winning the presidency were difficult but not impossible. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Winning 270 is right in the cards,'' Rick Davis, the campaign manager, insisted around midnight Sunday, as Mr. McCain's plane headed from New Hampshire to Florida.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain drew stirring applause from his crowds -- as well as jeers directed at the Democratic rival -- when he said Mr. Obama wanted to ''spread the wealth around,'' Adding, </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''He's in the far left lane of American politics.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The barnstorming rallies, the dawn-to-dusk television commercials and the armies of volunteers flooding neighborhoods disguised how the United States now elects its president: with millions of ballots already having been cast in early voting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Ohio, voting lines looped in and out of doors, upstairs and around corners at the registrar's office in Columbus, with a record number of voters adding their ballots to those that have been collected for nearly a month. Democrats outnumbered Republicans by more than two to one.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Florida, about 37 percent of registered voters have already cast ballots, state officials said, setting the stage for potentially record-breaking turnout.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Virginia, where more restrictions are placed on early voting, the state has processed 465,962 absentee ballots. And more than 300,000 Virginians voted in person by an absentee ballot. In 2004, a total of 222,059 absentee ballots were cast.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Worried about the outlook in Virginia, where a Democrat has not won the presidential race in more than four decades, Mr. McCain's campaign sued the state's election board on Monday. The campaign asserted that the absentee ballots had not been mailed on time to members of the military serving overseas.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama held his final rally in Virginia, a sign Democrats were waging an all-out push for the state, which is seen as a barometer for the fight with Mr. McCain. In Virginia and around the country, both sides are keeping a close eye on the weather .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I think if it rained mud, it won't make a difference,'' said L. Douglas Wilder, the former governor of Virginia, who was the state's first black chief executive. ''They're coming out. Trust me, they're coming out.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The First Results Are In</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> DIXVILLE NOTCH, N.H. (AP) -- Mr. Obama easily won early Tuesday in Dixville Notch, N.H., where tradition of having the first Election Day ballots tallied lives on. Mr. Obama defeated Mr. McCain 15 to 6. </span></p>
