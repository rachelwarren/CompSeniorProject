  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">NORTH KOREA BARS INSPECTORS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">From Nuclear Complex</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">North Korea heightened pressure on the Bush administration by barring international inspectors from all parts of its Yongbyon nuclear complex, even as administration officials said they believed that they were close to a deal to end a stalemate with the North over its nuclear program.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">IRAQI LAWMAKER KILLED IN BOMBING</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A member of the Iraqi Parliament from the political movement of the anti-American Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr was killed in a roadside bombing in Baghdad. The attack prompted supporters of Mr. Sadr to hold the United States responsible. The American ambassador to Iraq and the commander of the United States troops there condemned the attack as a ''heinous crime.'' PAGE A12 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">CRISIS RECALLS '90S FOR JAPAN</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">America's financial crisis has given Japan a sense of deja vu and brought various comparisons by Japan's press and policy makers to their own country's banking crisis in the 1990s, and its costly government bailouts. The prediction in Japan is that the United States faces an arduous journey to financial recovery. ''There is a lot more pain and turmoil coming,'' said an official with the industry watchdog that oversaw Japan's banking cleanup. PAGE A13</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">CHINA BANS DRUG AFTER DEATHS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Chinese government, already grappling with the scandal over tainted milk, banned the sale and use of one brand of an herbal medicine after three people injected with it died and three others fell seriously ill. The State Food and Drug Administration identified the problem drug as a preparation of Siberian ginseng made by Wandashan Pharmaceutical. It was not immediately clear whether Wandashan marketed its products outside China. PAGE A14</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">HEROIC RESCUE? MAYBE NOT</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Egyptian government says that the 11 European tourists and their 8 Egyptian guides and drivers held captive by bandits for 10 days last month were freed as the result of an ''operation,'' and the state-controlled media in Egypt reported the release as the result of a heroic commando raid. But a former prisoner tells a different story, and an opposition member of Parliament has demanded an investigation. PAGE A8</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WARY RETURN FOR GEORGIAN REFUGEES</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Emotions were mixed all over Georgia, as families streamed back to their homes from refugee camps. Though government officials urged refugees to wait until their villages have been cleared of unexploded ordnance left after a brief war with Russia, it was impossible to stop them. page A6</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Wind for Power</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wind is to South Dakota what forests are to Maine or beaches are to Florida: a natural and valuable inheritance. Native American tribes like the Rosebud Sioux now seek to claim that inheritance by building turbine farms to harness some of the country's strongest and most reliable winds, which can lead to a new economic underpinning for the 29,000 tribal members.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">BUSH TRANSITION PLANS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">President Bush took steps to deal with the aftermath of Election Day, issuing an executive order intended to govern a smooth transition to the next administration. The order creates a council to coordinate the handoff of the presidency to either John McCain or Barack Obama and speed up the nominations of hundreds of officials joining the next administration.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">INQUIRY ON EAVESDROPPING</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, said the committee would investigate claims by two military eavesdroppers that they routinely listened in on private calls home from American military officers, aid workers and journalists stationed in Iraq. ''Any time there is an allegation regarding abuse of the privacy and civil liberties of Americans it is a very serious matter,'' he said. PAGE A16</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">MARS ROVER'S NEXT MISSION</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">NASA's next big mission is ambitious, perhaps too ambitious. The goal is to send a robotic rover the size of a small S.U.V. to Mars. The rover, called the Mars Science Laboratory, would be powered by a nuclear battery and able to roam far and wide, gathering information with a suite of powerful instruments, including a laser to vaporize rocks. But $100 million may stand in the way of its launching next year with NASA's overall tight budget. PAGE A17</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">GEORGE E. PALADE, 95</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His discoveries about the intricate inner workings of cells helped give birth to the field of modern cell biology and earned him a Nobel Prize. Dr. Palade pioneered in using electron microscopy, and his findings later proved useful in understanding diseases and in the protein production that is the basis of the biotechnology industry.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">An actor who became a familiar face in a variety of Asian roles, notably as Jerry Lewis's butler in the Martin Scorsese film ''The King of Comedy,'' a character who did furious battle with an obsessed fan played by Robert De Niro. His niece Judy Gee, who confirmed his death, said that he was probably 93 or 94. PAGE A27</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">To Carry a Pigskin</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In high school, Evan Royster was among the most coveted lacrosse prospects in the country. He shined at summer camps, scored 33 goals his senior year and was named a high school All-American. But for college, he chose football, a decision that has worked out rather well. As the starting tailback for Penn State, he has used his shiftiness and vision to help drive a breakneck offense. PAGE B15</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A SPOTLIGHT ON LIGHT-HEAVYWEIGHTS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chad Dawson, right, is one of the world's best light-heavyweight boxers, a young star with a spotless professional record and career earnings approaching millions of dollars. His bout Saturday night against Antonio Tarver, left, a 39-year-old three-time light-heavyweight champion, is one of the most highly anticipated match-ups in recent years. The attention is the kind usually reserved for heavier -- or lighter -- boxers. PAGE B14</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">AN AGENT'S CONSTELLATION</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A lot of baseball people -- including people who make a living writing or talking about it -- were infuriated last year when word got out during Game 4 of the World Series that Alex Rodriguez had decided to opt out of his contract with the Yankees. They blamed Scott Boras, his agent, for the leak, and accused Boras of showing a lack of respect for the game by stealing attention from its signature event. If Boras has suffered any from the opprobrium, it isn't obvious from this year's playoffs. PAGE B11</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And Applying the Heat</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Steeped in environmentalism at school, in houses of worship, through scouting and even via popular culture, a growing army of ''eco-kids'' are trying to hold their parents accountable at home. They pore over garbage bins in search of errant recyclables. They turn off the lights in empty rooms. They lobby for solar panels. Money, for them, is no object. And their parents can end up feeling the pressure. PAGE A25</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WORKER DIES IN MANHOLE EXPLOSION</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">An explosion in a manhole where Consolidated Edison workers had been splicing cables left one worker dead and another one injured in Brooklyn. George Dillman, 26, died after an explosion rocked the manhole, filled with 120-volt power lines, at the intersection of Euclid and Sutter Avenues in East New York. The cause of the explosion was under investigation. Con Edison officials said it was the first time in more than four years that one of its electrical workers had died on the job.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Faces First Serious Downturn</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Estonia, which for its two post-Communist decades has embraced capitalism with gusto, is slogging through its first serious economic downturn since liberation from the Soviet grip in the early 1990s. Political and business leaders say the challenge will include a transition from an economy based on breathless consumption to one based on the harder work of selling goods and services to the world.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Iceland's financial system collapsed, and analysts said it was probably only a matter of time before the country would have to turn to the International Monetary Fund for help, a move that Iceland has tried desperately to avoid. PAGE B6</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">TRYING TO CLOSE A MERGER</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Apollo Management offered to pay $540 million to help close the $6.5 billion merger between its subsidiary, Hexion Specialty Chemicals, and a rival chemical maker, the Huntsman Corporation. The offer was an effort to prod banks that have committed to financing the deal to live up to their lending agreements, not easy in the current credit markets. PAGE B4</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">PRIUS MAY GET OWN BRAND</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Toyota is considering creating a separate brand for its Prius hybrid car, and may add both larger and smaller Prius models to its lineup. James E. Lentz III, president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., said that if approved, the Prius brand would be similar to Scion, Toyota's brand of lower-priced cars aimed at younger buyers. PAGE B7</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WINTERING WITH HORSES</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The reputation of Aiken, S.C., as a haven for horse lovers got its start in the late 1800s when wealthy Northerners, including the Whitneys, Vanderbilts and Astors, discovered Aiken's agreeable climate and found that its loamy clay soil was perfect footing for their horses' hooves. Now the area is experiencing the rebirth of its ''winter colony'' days. PAGE D3</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a vacation home, sitting and staring out the window can be considered a productive use of time, especially when the view is something to behold. Choosing the right type of window can make the view even better. PAGE D2</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's still unclear how and to what extent the Treasury Department will inject capital and assume ownership in United States banks. But it is clear that the new approach would be more than a tactical shift. page A32</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Policy players have reached a moment of truth: They'd better do something soon. In fact, they'd better announce a coordinated financial rescue plan this weekend -- or the world economy may well experience its worst slump since the Great Depression. page A33</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What had been a disdain for liberal intellectuals slipped into a disdain for the educated class as a whole. The liberals had coastal condescension, so the conservatives developed their own anti-elitism, with mirror-image categories and mirror-image resentments, but with the same corrosive effect. page A33</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Treasury Department may try to rescue the economy by buying ownership stakes in many American banks. But saving America's banks won't save the economy, Casey B. Mulligan, an economist, writes in an Op-Ed article. page A33</span></p>
