  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When stars shave their heads, couch-jump, spend countless minutes in jail, commit a fashion faux pas and/or other random acts of ego-inspired inanity, washingtonpost.com Celebritology blogger Liz Kelly is on the job. Every weekday, Liz shares the buzz, offers perspective and provides crucial links to juicy alternate news sources and, of course, takes your reaction in her daily blog. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Join Liz LIVE every Thursday at 2 p.m. ET to gab about the latest celebrity pairings (and splittings), rising stars (and falling ones), and get the scoop on the latest gossip making waves across the Web. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In her pre-celeb obsessed days (as if!), Liz ran washingtonpost.com's Discussions section, where she enjoyed talking to really interesting people -- sometimes even Post reporters -- on the phone. She still produces Pulitzer-prize winner Gene Weingarten's weekly Chatological Humor discussion and serves as co-proprietress of post.com's &quot;Lost&quot; Central. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Afternoon. Is everyone giddy with pre-debate anticipation? Okay, me too. Seriously, tonight's Palin vs. Biden may be as satisfying as watching an episode of &quot;Intervention.&quot; And could their names be more similar? Palin and Biden. Sounds like a comedy duo. Okay, enough. Jen Chaney and I have cooked up a very interesting and controversial Friday List for you that will be posted tomorrow mid-morning. So make sure to include the blog in your Friday lunchtime rounds. You'll for sure want to get in your .02 cents on our own debate. What else? Brangelina is stateside, which surely must be a harbinger of something. And not only does Britney ex Adnan Ghalib say he doesn't have a Spears sex tape, he's ready to sue over the allegation. Today we will inaugurate a new tradition that I hope will become a regular part of the show. Producer Rocci is a voracious reader of the tabs and each week he'll share a couple of his favorite headlines from this week's batch. So keep an eye out for those below. Without any further ado, let's get started. And remember, first do no harm. It isn't as if we have Gwen Ifill here to keep us in line. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Hey Miz Liz, how'z it going? Just got a couple of things of note that might be worth chewing on: </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Word from the current Enquirer -- and you know they're sometimes right -- is that 'Mad Men' star Jon Hamm is &quot;behaving badly&quot; on the set. An &quot;insider&quot; on the show says he's become impossible because he knows he's big now. He's become aloof, it's reported. And he's quoted as saying things like &quot;I am this show! I am Don Draper (his character)!&quot; But remember, the National Enquirer does like to do negative stories on popular people, to burst the bubble, so to speak. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Letterman is so interested in the Palin/Biden debate tonight that he's doing something the show hardly ever does. He's taping a Friday show to air that night instead of taping two on Thursday (the normal routine) because he knows it's gonna be funny fodder, reports today's New York Post. (His Friday night guests are Tom Brokaw -- when's he not on TV? -- and Tim Robbins.) </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tina Turner's back on tour, started in Kansas City last night. 18,000 tickets sold. Sounds like she did a good one. USA Today says the applause was deafening and she answered back to the crowd, &quot;I'm glad to be here, too!&quot; She's a tad heavier but still looks good and she's still wearing those short, short, leg-accenting skirts. Go Tina!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And Mr. Clean died. The 92-year-old commercial pitch man -- a real one and not animated like he is now -- died of pneumonia at the Motion Picture and Television Fund Hospital in L.A. That's where the old stars go to die. House Peters Jr. also appeared as an actor in Perry Mason, Gunsmoke, Twilight Zone and Lassie episodes. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dorkus: Liz, I am completely heartbroken over the fact that Scarlet Johansson is now married (to a Canadian of all people). Is there anything out there that can ease my suffering?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Well, Dorkus (and I call you that because it is liberating to be able to legitimately say that), I'd advise that perhaps its time to move on to a new object of affection? How about &quot;Transformers&quot; star Megan Fox, who recently told a GQ reporter about her penchant for &quot;cupping&quot; a certain part of boyfriend Brian Austin Green's anatomy in public. Yes, that Brian Austin Green. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dorkus: Dana Milbank in his chat giddily compared the debate tonight to &quot;watching two kids playing with a loaded gun.&quot; Are you as giddy?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Washington Sketch Chat</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: I'd probably characterize it more as two kids playing with a hot potato, but Dana's the wordsmith. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">KiKi's Teeth: Did Bazaar photoshop Kirsten Dunst's choppers on the cover, or has she really had them fixed? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mag Hag</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: While I don't have any specifics on Kirsten's dental history, I have to admit that her teeth do look awfully white and uniform in that cover shot and, further, that the cover shot appears to be designed to debut a re-worked smile. A spokesman for Harper's by the way, denies any photo-retouching was done to Dunst's teeth. I know I'm in the minority, but I think Kiki is a cutie. I hope she doesn't go changing just to fit some cookie-cutter ideal. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sharon Stone: Just when I think she can't get crazier. Botox for her kid's feet? That's definitely worse than lying about having breast cancer, lying about being in Mensa, saying the earthquake in China was payback for the Chinese treatment of Tibet, and whatever other crazy stuff I can't remember that she'd done or said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sharon, feet stink. It's not a crisis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Right. It's like trying to apply a full body cast when a band-aid would do. Poor little Roan. But I'm sure Sharon's intentions were good. Not only would Roan's feet not have been stinky, they would have been the driest feet in two counties. In fact... </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Here's what I was looking for -- it's a posting from today's blog comment thread from a Botox practitioner: -- While Sharon Stone was misguided in wanted to give her young child Botox for severe foot odor, her &quot;basic instinct&quot; was in fact correct. Severe foot odor can be caused by severe foot sweating from hyperhidrosis. This in fact can be treated with Botox injections in the feet and, with a proper nerve block, can be painless as well. Having treated many patients with Botox for this condition, I can assure you that it does in fact work. However, in someone as young as her son, hygiene, frequent sock changes etc. are the best course of action. Posted by: Perry Solomon, MD </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: I think you should do a live chat tonight during the VP debate. I think the participants fall within your purview of commentary. I'm ready to log on and read away!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: OMG, I would so love that. But I'm not sure apoplexy is conducive to typing. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: Not to beat this into oblivion, but I am curious: what makes you so convinced that Angie is everything she appears to be? That is, she is in fact an 'actor' with a lifetime of exposure to all that fame includes, including manipulating the paps. Based on that, it seems that she could easily have a public persona (caring, doting mom) that is inconsistent with her real life (the kids are being raised by the two nannies in Germany as we speak). I'm not saying she is or isn't -- I honestly have no inclination either way -- but you definitely seem to have a definite opinion on her (whereas you have a healthy dose of skepticism for pretty much everyone one else). </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I guess for me, very few actors pass the Good Person test, and they are the ones who (a) consistently, over many years, demonstrate a high level of integrity, and (b) have a ton of friends attesting to their good nature. Again, I'm not trying to stir the pot, I'm just curious, mainly because it's likely that one day one of the kids will publish a memoir and we will be told the truth -- would it be upsetting to you if it were a facade? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: No, not upsetting at all. I just don't think it is. I don't think Angie's raising her kids the same way my sister-in-law is -- shlepping three teens to soccer games, doing laundry and trying to put dinner on the table every night -- but having a nanny (or nannies) doesn't necessarily mean someone's a bad person. And, based on what I've read/seen about Angie's parenting, she passes your tests. And, not for nothing, moms with multiple kids do all kinds of things nowadays, like run for vice president on the Republican ticket. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Holly, WOULD: Liz, could you do this lady a favor with some deep investigative reporting into what's going on at Hef's mansion with the Girls Next Door? Specifically Holly and Bridget? I heard rumors that Holly moved out. Is this true? And does this mean she's no longer West Coast Editor? And what does this mean for the show? I'm a huge fan of the show, it's my guilty pleasure.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: As Sarah Palin would say, I'll try to find some examples and get back to you! Seriously, things seem to be coming a bit unglued in Hef's world. All of his &quot;Girls Next Door&quot; seem to be dating others and Joe Francis (who, we should note, isn't exactly the most reliable of sources) says Hef is having financial problems to boot. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Silver Spring, Md.: ...&quot; Megan Fox, who recently told a GQ reporter about her penchant for &quot;cupping&quot; a certain part of boyfriend Brian Austin Green's anatomy in public. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yes, that Brian Austin Green.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My eyes -- my eyes! Thanks for that -- I will not be able to get that picture out of my mind until TMZ tonite when I am sure a video of Shauna Sand will take it's place.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: You're welcome. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: She, Stone's, gonna need to hold a press conference to get this all straightened out. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Herndon, Va.: Please tell us why Janet Jackson was hospitalized. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thank you.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Your guess is as good as mine at this point, but maybe it had something to do with boyfriend Jermaine Dupri's alleged episode of losing his lunch (or dinner) on Janet's lap over the weekend. That would be enough to send me to the ER, I can tell you. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Richmond, Va.: Greetings! </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I've been enjoying the Sarah Conner Chronicles, and one thing that has struck me in the last two episodes is how sometimes Summer Glau (Cameron) looks amazingly like Mary Tyler Moore. It's the bambi eyes. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Summer Glau</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mary: Mary Tyler Moore </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Instead of separated at birth, gave up at birth? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Enh... I dunno. I' m not really seeing it, but it's hard to tell from just a still photo. But if I was pushed to make a comparison, I'd say Summer looks more like Laura Kightlinger. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Methinks: Please, Liz Kelly, give us your take on the Letterman questioning of Anne Hathaway re: her ex. I understand there's an obvious understanding that when one goes on Letterman that the questioning could be uncomfortable, but I thought he was out of line. He comes across as a crank and a bully.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: I thought Anne held her own particularly well, though. I liked this comment: &quot;I don't want to go into the specifics of it, but you do have to give me credit. As far as relationships crashing and burning go ... come on. I did pretty great. I mean ... scorch that earth. I'm an all or nothing girl.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Scarle,TT: Who is this Scarlett Johanssen? Do you have a picture of her or something, so we know who she might be?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Scarlett Johansson (Google Images)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: It is apparently my lot in life to be surrounded by ScarJo lovers. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Heather Locklear: Entrapment by the papparazi? Or genuine motor vehicle violation? Or both?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: I'm going to guess a little bit of both. The NY Daily News had an item this morning about Locklear turning up at an AA meeting yesterday, which sounds like a good idea. I didn't include it in the Morning Mix because it felt invasive to me. I mention it here because we're just talking and I know you guys can be discreet when it counts. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Newman: The last of his kind, a uniquely American actor, sportsman, humanitarian, and smoldering hunk who loved his wife for half a century. We were lucky to have him as long we did.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Hear hear. I hope you were able to read Stephen Hunter's weekend appreciation. Maybe Rocci can find the link. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Philadelphia, Pa.: Re Angie as a good mom -- she may or may not be, but she clearly has connections with her children that are evident in any of the pictures of them together. They may have nannies, but when she's out in public with any of them there doesn't appear to be a stunned look on the child's face wondering who this stranger is carrying her/him around, and the child isn't leaning rigidly away from her. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: That's the same vibe I get. Could I be wrong? Could you be wrong? Yes. But keep in mind that while it may be easy for a trained actress to fake affection, it ain't so easy for kids. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.: Okay, I can't believe I'm doing this -- but -- Botox has been used as a cure for extra sweatiness. Jennifer Aniston got her armpits botoxed. So, you know, maybe we should give Sharon Stone a little break. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I deserve many years of good karma for that post.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Agreed. I know Botox is a good way to stop hyper-hydrosis for months at a time. No one is arguing with that fact. What got everyone in such a tizzy was the fact that Sharon suggested this procedure for an eight-year-old. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Stephen Hunter: Forget Cool: Paul Newman Knew How to Play It Smart (Post, Sept. 28) </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: I'm watching Season 3 of Lost on DVD. (I rarely watch series while they're airing, 'cause I like to watch 4 eps at a time.) I almost wasn't going to keep watching Lost, but you were so into it... </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anyway, I need to know if it ever gets any better. The show is pretty good at posing interesting questions (how did Locke end up in a wheelchair and how did he get out of it? How did the Others get on the island in the first place? What happened to Michael? Whatinhell is that black smoke monster?) But as far as I can tell, they've rarely ANSWERED any. So unless I get some answers, I really can't keep it up. Since you're the reason I went back to Lost in the first place, I need you to tell me (without spoilers) if, given my need for storyline resolution, I should stick with it. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ta!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Tell you what, let's revisit this question tomorrow when Jen Chaney and I host the monthly &quot;Lost&quot; Book Club discussion. We'll be chatting about Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot; at 2 p.m. ET. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Australia: Hi Liz, one of your overseas fans here. I just wanted to make sure you've seen this: Brian Austin Green (YouTube) Can the new 90210 compete with that? I doubt it. In case the above isn't sufficiently celebrity news-centred, is David (aka Brian Austin Green) still with that Angelina wannabe?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: The scary thing is you sent this before I mentioned Brian above. I have just one response: Cupping. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">LOST answer: From my easy chair LOST never got any better but I know I'm in the minority on this live chat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Yes, pipe down hater. (I kid) </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lost: When does it start up again?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: End of January. And it will be returning to Wednesday evenings. But let's save all this &quot;Lost&quot; talk for tomorrow afternoon. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sharon Stone Song: Baby, do you understand me now Sometimes I feel a little mad Well don't you know that no-one alive Can always be an angel When things go wrong I seem to be bad </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I'm just a soul who's intentions are good Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Right. Sharon's lot in life seems to be jumping the wrong way at every possible juncture. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Words of advice: You are the last one to talk with Sen. Biden before he heads onto the stage to match wits with the Polar Princess. What do you say to him?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Look before you leap. Think before you speak. And a little humility goes a long way. Also, I think he couldn't go wrong with Paris Hilton's sign off on her new &quot;BFF&quot; show: TTYN b*****s! </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: How do your tats compare with Benji Madden's? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tattoos</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Benji has about 98 percent more than I and his are much more... gruesome I guess would be the word. Good work, though, from the looks of 'em. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">River City, Va.: So this was on Milbank's chat, but I thought your audience would appreciate it, too. Palin Bingo</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Ooh, me likey. And post.com's Kim O'Donnel today blogged about debate viewing vittles. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: Liz -- </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I'll admit that I don't know who half the people mentioned in this discussion are, which should give you a sense of my celebrity IQ. Given that, I am surprised by my strong reaction to the strong reactions of &quot;fans&quot; who were surprised, disappointed, and forced to &quot;rethink everything&quot; because Clay Aiken came out. His music isn't really my taste, but it makes me want to buy all of his CDs and give them out for Christmas to my family, the neighbors, the mailman . . . </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Is there any early indication that coming out has hurt his career? I know that there are more important things to worry about these days, but this is really ticking me off. Thoughts? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: None so far. In fact, I think Clay's career topped out long before the announcement. He'll always have a place in the entertainment landscape, but he's hardly A-list material at this point. In fact, People reportedly got the scoop (along with pix of Clay with his newborn child) pretty easy. No one else wanted them. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">North Potomac, Md.: Re today's item regarding the passing of the actor who played &quot;Mr. Clean&quot; -- it'd be nice if The Post or the Associated Press would get the company name correct. It's Procter and Gamble, not Proctor and Gamble.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Noted. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nosy Parker: &quot;...while it may be easy for a trained actress to fake affection, it ain't so easy for kids.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And even less so for companion animals. At least kids can be bribed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Speaking of companion animals, it's all I can do to get Andy to look at me with anything approaching civility. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: That song, &quot;Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,&quot; remembered by Sir Rocci here, from 1965 -- yes, I'm an oldie -- and done by The Animals, before it was Eric Burden and ... Originally written for and recorded by Nina Simone in 1964, and then in the good old disco days it was recorded -- a long version -- by Santa Esmeralda. That was hot. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Los Angeles, Calif.: People, Brangelina do not manipulate, court, engage with or otherwise desire the presence of paparazzi in their lives. They could maybe escape it if they relocated to another planet. Even then some enterprising pap would get a hook up to the Hubble telescope and try to get pictures of them no matter how mundane the activity. Give 'em a break. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Right, Brangelina have become -- either because of or in spite of the care they take to protect their family's privacy -- one of the most sought-after paparazzi targets going. Imagine having that added to the normal stresses of juggling a family and career. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clay Aiken: Saw him in Spamalot over the weekend, actor he is not! And he has a bodyguard when he leaves at night....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Well, I can't fault the guy for wanting a bodyguard. Probably not the worst idea for a guy who inspires such devotion in some and such revulsion in others. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: Why is Fox dating Brian Austin Green? Was Brian Bonsall taken? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: cupping, his initials are B.A.G.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: It's funny cuz it's true. I'm wondering how long Megan will stay with B.A.G. if her career continues to take off. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: I'd watch a sitcom called &quot;Palin and Biden.&quot; Or better yet, an old-school detective show. He could be the crotchety old gumshoe with a knack for bringing in the bad guy, and she can be the feisty young firebrand with a good heart but a lot to learn. McCain could be the chief &quot;with a past&quot; and Obama could be the earnest assistant DA who got burned by private practice and corporate law before finding his calling.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Oooh, that's some good imaginating there, bucko. Me, I'd like to see them cast in a &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; type sitcom. Biden is the urbane, life-weary city dweller and Palin moves in from a very foreign place -- Alaska -- and tries to apply her folksy ways to life in the Big Apple. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Curmudgeon: Andy is such a beautiful cat. Maybe it's that his face is so expressive. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anyhow, in the Morning Mix today, I made mention of the vision that clouded my brain as I awoke this morniing: Sharon Stone channeling Joan Crawford. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">eeeeeeeek! </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">that's all. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">smooches</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: I said NO WIRE HANGERS! </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: Okay, I've got nothing on celebrity talk, but that picture of Andy...he looks so disappointed in you. What did you do?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: I exist. That's all. I exist. Andy is actually here now, curled up to the left of the computer, sitting in the sun doing nothing, as per usual. Every few minutes he tries to sneak a sip of my tea. I don't know why I put up with this feckless freeloading. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Andy pic: Uh, Andy looks like he's gettin' tired of the paparazzi in his face every Thursday. Better back off or you might find yourself faced with a restraining order.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Good point. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For the record...: I misread the word &quot;tats&quot; for, well, you know. I was amused until I read to whom you were to commpare yours. Then I was Confused. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Well, Benji might just rival me on that count, too. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">First dogs (pets)?: Hi Liz, </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Okay, Barney and Mis Beazley are incredibly cute. Who would be the first pets if Obama or McCain got elected? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Would you agree that having a pet makes candidates seem more aproachable and likable?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Not sure how reliable this is, but according to a quick Google search: -- Barack Obama has no pets, though Obama has promised his kids a dog. -- John McCain owns three turtles, three parakeets, a ferret, two dogs, a cat and 13 salt water fish. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">byool, IN: Does these frozen diapers make my (butt) look big?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: No, Jamie Oliver, they suit you to a tee. (See this morning's Mix if you're lost here) </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Baltimore, Md.: Hi Liz. Apparently, I've been reading Celebritology too much. I actually had a dream last night that I was working as LiLo's assistant. Sadly (or thankfully?) I don't recall the details except that her girlfriend was there. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Well, I guess it could have been worse. You could have been Dinah Lohan's assistant. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He comes across as a crank and a bully.: Oh, like that's something new for Letterman.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Good point, but to that I'd say that everyone who agrees to sit down next to Letterman's desk knows he's unpredictably salty and abrasive. It isn't as if anyone is being blindsided here. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: McCain sounds like he's ready for Noah's Ark. Does Palin have matches for all those animals? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gaithersburg, Md/: I heard Minka Kelley is suppossed to be in town for YouthAids gala this Fri. Any chance she'll be out and about in the city?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Well, I suppose anything's possible... </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's pets: Do we know which animals live in which of his 13 houses?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Now, now -- that's seven houses. Don't mischaracterize the man as as some kind of elite, disconnected from the average American. Okay, another point while we're at it: Is anyone else sick of the term &quot;Main St.&quot; being used to describe average Americans vis a vis the financial crisis? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Puckeridge Village, England: Which country is more obsessed with celebrity and celebrity gossip, the U.S. or the U.K.? That question has always interested me since I moved here 20 years ago. Example: when David Beckham shaved his head, EVERY newspaper in the U.K. had a picture of Beckham ON THE FRONT PAGE. I thought that in the U.S. this could never happen. When Madonna celebrated her birthday, it was again national news. Mrs. Beckham recently had a short haircut. That, too, was national news. I graduated college with a writer who has been called by some the greatest living American author. It was a small college, but I learned more about him from the gossip columns in the U.K. than I ever knew about him at the university.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: I'd need a lot more time than what I've got alotted for today's chat to come up with a data-based answer. But, off the cuff, I'd guess we're about evenly matched at this point. Remember, the U.S. is the country of origin of round-the-clock cable news coverage of Anna Nicole Smith's death. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chicago, Ill.: Hey Liz, </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Was anyone besides me surprised that Kim K got voted off DWTS? To think that she went before Cloris tells you what the public thinks of her.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Oh I was totally surprised, too. I can only imagine they're keeping poor Cloris for the boomer portion of the audience which, truth be told, is probably a bigger and more influential segment than anyone who might've been interested in Kim Kardashian. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Live Post Chats during the debate tonight: People whose chats I'd read: Robin Givhan Liz Kelly Gene W Eugene R Ruth Marcus Dana P Dana M Shailagh Anne K Hax Warren Brown </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">... who am I missing?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Tell you what, though, the best possible person will be online at 10:30 p.m. ET to kick off a post-debate chat: The Post's Bob Kaiser, who has an uncanny ability for putting complicated situations into perspective. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hey Puckeridge: Will you at least tell us who the writer was?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: ... </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Grrrr...Main Street!: Yes, I agree with you 100 percent! I think the term &quot;Main Street&quot; is lame and uncreative and, as with every major political catchphrase, overly simplistic. I suppose that is the point but honestly, the way they talk about it all I don't want to be lumped in with either Wall Street or Main Street!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Thank you, thank you. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama has promised his kids a dog: Not just any dog, but one from a shelter or pound. Big difference between that and a pricey bred-to-order pet.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Right. And I bet that dog will have only one dog house. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">True Blood?: Hey Liz! Are you watching that new HBO show &quot;True Blood&quot;? Anna Paquin is doing a pretty good job and the guy who plays Vampire Bill (Stephen Moyer, I think?) is dreamy!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Yes. Mr. Liz and I are totally hooked already. Alan Ball does it again. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: &quot;washingtonpost.com: McCain sounds like he's ready for Noah's Ark. Does Palin have matches for all those animals?&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">No, but she's prepared to shoot and dress 'em all.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: ba-dump-ah! </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Portland, Ore.: &quot;Okay, another point while we're at it: Is anyone else sick of the term &quot;Main Street&quot; being used to describe average Americans vis a vis the financial crisis?&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yes, yes, YES! Matt Lauer has said Main Street about a million times this week. The problem could be that I'm getting my financial info from the Today show. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: It's become overused in a very short amount of time and really comes off as condescending. Next thing you know, they'll be calling us &quot;rubes.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WDC: Aw crap. Why'd you have to mention McCain's turtles? How can I possibly vote against a guy who appreciates the inherent profundity and wisdom of a turtle?? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(Did you ever watch Jeeves and Wooster? There's a fantastic moment where Stephen Fry as Jeeves says, in his deadpan way, &quot;I have often enjoyed the quiet companionship of a goldfish.&quot; Favorite line of the whole series.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Well, let's not be hasty. Just because the man has turtles, doesn't mean he appreciates all that wisdom. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: I also wonder if the U.S. is quicker to celebritize than the U.K. I mean, Kardashians? Does that happen across the pond??</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Oh yes. You only need to read the Daily Mail online to get their country-specific B, C and D-level star-gossip. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liz Kelly: Okay, guys, that's it for today. I need to get started on my baked Alaska so it'll be ready in time for tonight's debate. Don't forget to check out the blog tomorrow for a fabulous Friday List that promises to hatch much backing and forthing and hemming and hawing. And, for you Lost-o-philes, Jen and I will be chatting at 2 p.m. ET tomorrow about this month's book club selection, &quot;Slaughterhouse 5.&quot; That's all. </span></p>
