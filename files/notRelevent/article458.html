  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> After Overnight Fire</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Channel Tunnel that links Britain and the Continent was closed after an overnight blaze that reached temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees. The fire, which broke out on Thursday on a France-bound freight train, may have started on one of the trucks it was carrying, safety officials said. PAGE A8</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> U.S. AIRSTRIKE IN PAKISTAN KILLS 12</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The intensified American campaign against suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban militants in Pakistan's tribal areas continued. Two missiles fired from remotely piloted American aircraft killed 12 people in an attack on a compound in North Waziristan, according to a local journalist and television reports. The attack struck the home of a local tribesman, Yousaf Khan Wazir, who was among the dead, the journalist said. PAGE A9 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 31 KILLED IN ATTACK NEAR BAGHDAD</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At least 31 people were killed and 60 were wounded in a car bomb attack in the center of the predominately Shiite town of Dujail, north of Baghdad, according to Iraqi police officers in Dujail and in the provincial capital, Tikrit. PAGE A9</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CHINA'S MIGHT USED IN DEAL</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As part of an incentive package to persuade Costa Rica to shift its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the People's Republic of China last year, China used the muscle of its enormous foreign exchange reserves, agreeing to buy $300 million in Costa Rican bonds.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The executive board of the Asian Development Bank unanimously approved a $40 million loan to Georgia at the lowest possible interest rate, the latest sign of Asian dissatisfaction with Russian military action in Georgia. PAGE A10</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> IN FRANCE, POPE SPEAKS ABOUT FAITH</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In his first visit to France as pope, Benedict XVI touched on central themes of his papacy -- the tensions between faith and reason and church and state, as well as his efforts to reach out to Muslims and Jews -- and urged an increasingly irreligious Europe to look back to its intellectual roots in Christian monastic culture.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CHINA EXAMINES INFANT FORMULA</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> China's Health Ministry announced a nationwide inquiry into the safety of all infant formulas, as a team of investigators from six government agencies descended on the milk powder factory that produced formula now linked to one baby's death and kidney problems in at least 50 more.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As the storm surge from Hurricane Ike began battering the island of Galveston and officials warned that ''certain death'' awaited anyone who failed to evacuate, a reckless and stubborn bunch ignored the warnings. ''We never punked out before. Why start now?'' said the owner of the Poop Deck, a biker bar just stumbling distance from the waterfront. PAGE A15 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SUBPOENA FOR TODD PALIN APPROVED</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Alaska lawmakers voted to issue a subpoena to Todd Palin, the husband of Gov. Sarah Palin, in an escalation of the inquiry into whether Ms. Palin improperly tried to get her former brother-in-law fired from his job as a state trooper. The subpoena was one of 14 approved by the State Senate Judiciary Committee, setting the stage for a potential legal clash between the Legislature and the Palin administration. PAGE A12 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> PLAN TO EXPAND F.B.I. TOOLS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Justice Department made public a plan to expand the tools the Federal Bureau of Investigation can use to investigate suspicions of terrorism inside the United States, even without any direct evidence of wrongdoing. It would, for instance, allow an F.B.I. agent to pursue an anonymous tip about possible terrorism by conducting an undercover interview or watching someone in a public place. Such investigative steps are now prohibited unless there is more specific evidence of wrongdoing. PAGE A11 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ALAIN JACQUET, 69</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A French artist known for his playful modernizations of old master paintings, he was associated with Pop Art and the minimovement known as Mec Art (for mechanical art), making use of mechanical processes and advertising cliches in photoscreened works like his ''Dejeuner sur l'Herbe'' series.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> HELEN GALLAND, 83</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> One of the few women of her time to run a fashion-oriented retailer, she began her career as a sales assistant at Lord &amp; Taylor and presided over the Bonwit Teller chain from 1980 to 1983. She is credited with having restored some of the store's luster at a time when the company had undergone a decline in its image. PAGE B5 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Are Veiled in Dispute With Library</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Thousands of famous images by the theater photographer Leo Friedman -- young lovers holding hands on a street of tenements in ''West Side Story,'' Rex Harrison looking over a shabby Julie Andrews in ''My Fair Lady,'' Robert Preston conducting his make-believe trombones in ''The Music Man'' -- are in limbo, caught in a dispute between the photographer and the New York Public Library's performing arts collection at Lincoln Center, where the pictures were sent in 1971.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> WALL STREET GROWS SHAKIER</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Early last year, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Senator Charles E. Schumer sounded the alarm that New York City was in danger of losing its status as the world's pre-eminent financial hub to London. Now that Lehman Brothers is on the verge of following Bear Stearns onto the casualty list of major investment firms, officials and economists are worrying even more, saying that the city's days as the clear leader of global finance may be ending.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In U.S.C.'s Starting Quarterback</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When Mark Sanchez took batting practice as a teenager, his father would quiz him on the periodic table. And when he would drop back to pass a football, he would also have to know who the 13th president was. (Answer: Millard Fillmore.) If Sanchez did not understand then the demands his father placed on him, he does now. He is the starting quarterback for U.S.C.'s top-ranked Trojans. PAGE D3 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE CAN'T-MISS PROSPECT WHO DID</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The player who was supposed to redefine the linebacker position in the N.F.L. now plays fantasy football. The player who created so much hysteria at Ohio State that people waited outside his shower for autographs now solicits clients for his personal training studio. And the player who was stigmatized by Sports Illustrated, which called him the consummate dumb jock of the 1990s, is back in college pursuing his degree. It is indeed strange how things turned out for Andy Katzenmoyer. PAGE D1 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE LESSONS OF A METS COLLAPSE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Last year, a heady streak that saw the Mets win seven of nine games set the team up for one of the greatest falls in baseball history. This year's team, with its comparatively slim lead, will prosper where last year's team stumbled precisely because of the 2007 swoon. They were humbled and shocked. And this is what gives this Mets something they may have lacked last season: collective mettle. William C. Rhoden, Sports of the Times. PAGE D1 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Who Will Lose Homes</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The government intervention in Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and a growing number of banks puts federal agencies in the powerful, and awkward, position of deciding which borrowers will receive help and which will lose their homes. And while the Bush administration is leaving it to the next president to decide how the mortgage finance companies will operate further out, the actions taken by their conservators will have an immediate influence on the cost of stabilizing the nation's housing market. PAGE C1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE LATEST SIGN OF A SLOWDOWN</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> News on the economy was mixed, with the price index for finished goods falling 0.9 percent in August and consumer spending on retail and food decreasing 0.3 percent, according to the Census Bureau. ''It's a ray of hope on the inflationary front, but dark clouds on the horizon for consumers,'' the chief economist at Merk Mutual Funds said. PAGE C4 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> BRITISH TOUR OPERATOR SHUTS DOWN</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Britain's already struggling travel industry suffered a series of setbacks when a large tour operator collapsed, British Airways offered thousands of managers a buyout and Richard Branson of Virgin Atlantic said he would fight ''tooth and nail'' to prevent a combination of British Airways with American Airlines.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> STRONG RETURNS FOR HARVARD</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The endowment of Harvard University, among the most closely watched in the country, said it had earned 8.6 percent in its fiscal year ending June 30. That return brought the value of the foundation to $36.9 billion. Harvard said it had outperformed its internal benchmark and that its returns put it in the fifth percentile of the 165 large institutional funds measured by the Trust Universe Comparison Services.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ALITALIA RESCUE PLAN NEAR COLLAPSE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The future of Alitalia, the financially troubled Italian airline, hung in the balance as its unions and an Italian investor group suspended talks over a bailout of the flagship carrier, with the unions citing ''insurmountable difficulties.'' With Alitalia losing more than a million euros, or $1.4 million, a day, the rescue plan from the investor group, known as CAI, is the only option on the table. PAGE C2 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> DEUTSCHE BANK STAKE IN POSTBANK</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Deutsche Post agreed to sell about 30 percent of Postbank to Deutsche Bank in a deal worth 2.8 billion euros. Deutsche Bank, which is heavily dependent on volatile investment banking fees, will be able to sell its real estate and investment services through Postbank's retail network. The transaction, worth $3.9 billion, marks a further unwinding of what was once a mammoth German state monopoly that delivered letters, connected telephone calls and provided basic banking services.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A CENTURY LATER, A LITERARY REPUTATION ON THE RISE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When the novelist Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis died 100 years ago this month, his passing went little noticed outside his native Brazil. But in recent years he has been transformed from a fringe figure in the English-speaking world to a literary favorite and trend setter, promoted by much more acclaimed writers and by critics as an unjustly neglected genius. Susan Sontag, an early and ardent admirer, once called him ''the greatest writer ever produced in Latin America,'' surpassing even Borges. PAGE B9 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A TRAILBLAZER HEADS TO DALLAS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In his position as executive director of the Miller Theater at Columbia University, George Steel has turned the place into a hotbed of adventurous programming, and made the Miller an exemplar of audience outreach and dynamic commitment to contemporary music. Mr. Steel's admirers were baffled when the news came that he was leaving the Miller Theater to become the general director of the Dallas Opera. The Dallas Opera? Talk about conventional programming. But in a recent interview he sounded like someone who intended to shake things up in Dallas, Anthony Tommasini writes. PAGE B11 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SONGS ARE JUST PART OF THE PACKAGE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A few songs into his set at B. B. King Blues Club &amp; Grill, Wayne Brady, best known as a comedian and television host, decided that he needed to do something, he said, ''to address the people that are saying, 'Do something funny.' '' Up to that point no such request had been made, but that mattered little. Maybe it was an acknowledgment of the obvious: while Mr. Brady is an able vocalist, his singing works best as part of a broader package, where less is at stake, Jon Caramanica writes.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Chuck Knoll won more Super Bowls with the Steelers; Bill Belichick has as many (and counting?) with the Patriots. But Bill Walsh of the 49ers is the subject of ''The Genius,'' with a subtitle that credits him with reinventing football. In his review, Gregory Cowles calls it ''a sports biography that is thorough, diligent, generous and honest.'' Need more? PAGE 20</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> TRAVEL</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Purists (or survivalists) may scoff at the idea, but ''glamping'' -- the new term for upscale, or glamorous, camping -- could be ideal for those who want an outdoor experience without the outdoor fuss. ''We call it nature on a silver plate,'' one resort manager said. PAGE 4</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It was known as the ''Dakota Fanning rape movie'' at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007, got boos at a press screening and eviscerating reviews (Manohla Dargis called it ''overinflated rubbish''). But the film, actually titled ''Hounddog'' and with a radically different cut, will make it into 22 theaters across the country on Sept. 19. PAGE 15</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> GAIL COLLINS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Though only on the Republican ticket a few weeks, Gov. Sarah Palin is already a totally different person. Did you see her being interviewed by Charlie Gibson, trying to slither away from saying anything controversial about foreign policy, rewriting her own history whenever it suited her? page A19</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The best way to tell if an athlete has had adequate rest after a concussion is to administer neuropsychological tests and compare the results with those from tests given before the injury. But, too often, injured athletes have not had the baseline tests, writes Gerald Tramontano in an Op-Ed essay. page A19</span></p>
