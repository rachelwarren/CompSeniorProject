  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Living in LoCo is Erica Garman's blog devoted to all things interesting in Loudoun County. You can find it at http://www.loudounextra.com. This column of highlights from the blog appears in this space every Sunday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The worldwide financial crisis is hitting close to home, as more Loudoun County businesses close or consider closing because of fewer customers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ron Richards, co-owner of an Image Sun Tanning Center in Ashburn, told me Thursday that his business and a number of other shops and restaurants in the Broadlands Marketplace are losing money every day and are in danger of shutting down unless the property owner, Van Metre, reduces rents and increases promotion of the strip mall.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We don't want to step on any toes,&quot; Richards said. &quot;But we're in danger of falling apart. They have to do something to work with us.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Richards said that he has applied for several small-business loans to make it through the slowdown but that banks are not lending.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Most of the businesses at Broadlands Marketplace signed 10-year contracts when the strip mall opened 3 1/2 years ago. Rents are rumored to range from $5,000 to $12,000 a month.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lessees were promised that an office building would be built across from the mall, which would bring in business, Richards said. &quot;Now, Van Metre tells us that project is not happening any time soon,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mitchell Baron, who owns a dental practice next to Image Sun, echoed Richards's concerns. &quot;It's 4:45 p.m. on a Thursday,&quot; he told me on the phone, &quot;and there are only three cars in the parking lot.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ty Hausch with Van Metre Properties, who is a resident of Broadlands, said that the rents at Broadlands Marketplace are less than those at similar shopping centers in Brambleton and Lansdowne.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Van Metre has already spent over $100,000 in advertising, direct mail, events and signage to market this shopping plaza, and we are still educating consumers about the businesses here,&quot; he said, adding that the office building project across the street is on hold because of the market conditions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hausch said he plans to meet with the tenants Wednesday to address their concerns and go over the shopping plaza's marketing plan.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So, are the business owners' concerns an indicator that more Loudoun shops and services will close for good?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Several weeks ago, the upscale Cafe Panache closed in Broadlands, and Kirkpatrick's Irish Pub in Ashburn Village just shut down. Last week, it was announced that the beer-brewing operation at Old Dominion Brewing Co. in Ashburn will be moving next year to Dover, Del. In a statement Tuesday, Coastal Brewing said that it will continue to brew Dominion beer at a consolidated center in Delaware and that the company is offering positions there for the 15 or so employees who work in Ashburn.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">Political Signs Cause a Stir </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This dispatch comes from Val Cavalheri, Living in LoCo's South Riding correspondent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As the presidential candidates firm up their stands in the last days of the campaign, a South Riding couple are taking a stand by displaying political signs in their yard.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A few weeks ago, Krista and Chris Woods put up two John McCain signs on their front lawn. Krista Woods said they had seen political signs in yards during last year's election and thought nothing of it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What followed surprised them both.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">First was the letter they received Oct. 6 from their homeowners association telling them they had five days to take down the signs. South Riding Proprietary prohibits signs posted on lots and common areas but allows them to be displayed in the windows of residents' homes. Accepting the homeowners association's decision, the Woodses thought they would keep the signs up for the rest of the week, which was within the five-day period.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Two days later, they found another letter in their mailbox. &quot;The signs are offensive,&quot; it said, &quot;and must be taken down immediately.&quot; The letter also said the couple would be fined $35 per day per sign. It was signed &quot;Neighborhood Watch Patroller.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">South Riding has a Neighborhood Watch program, but officials with that committee and with the homeowners association denied approving the letter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In an e-mail to Chris Woods, Elaine Stoner, the covenants director for South Riding, wrote that she understood the couple's &quot;disbelief&quot; about the note. But Stoner renewed her request that the Woodses comply with homeowners association rules by removing the signs, saying she was &quot;receiving angry e-mails daily about them.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With only a few days left before the deadline to remove the signs, Chris Woods decided to illuminate them with a floodlight. That evening, Krista Woods said, she was outside when a &quot;car barrels out, almost running us over. The window rolls down and a woman asks me if I knew that the signs were against South Riding rules. When I told her, 'Yes,' she yelled that I was a 'stupid idiot.' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Woodses, who are moving to Ashburn, did some research and concluded that they could extend the sign removal process to as much as 30 days by appealing the homeowners association's decision. So they decided not to take down the signs until after the election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The dirty looks have continued, but the couple have received some support.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Woodses' nanny, Motalane Tseptse, a huge fan of Barack Obama's, recently had a party at her employers' home. Knowing that many Obama supporters would be attending, Krista Woods asked whether Tseptse wanted her to take down the signs for the evening. &quot;No,&quot; Tseptse said, &quot;I'm proud of what you're doing.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Woodses' next-door neighbors, Lisa and Chris Romano, agreed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's their property. They should be able to put up signs,&quot; Lisa Romano said, adding, &quot;We still love them, even though they are voting for the wrong candidate.&quot;<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">Going Green in Cascades </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I thought I'd highlight a community that is striving to make its neck of the woods a &quot;greener&quot; place to live. I spoke a few days ago with Cascades general manager Martha Kaczmarsky, who shared with me some of the ways that residents are trying to reduce the community's carbon footprint.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A handful of residents, Kaczmarsky said, formed the Cascades Green Team in March. The group's goal is to educate the area's approximately 6,000 households about ways to save energy and protect the environment.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Green Team meets at 7:30 p.m. on the third Thursday of every month at the Lowes Island Community Center to swap ideas and brainstorm. Through the homeowners association's newsletter, the group shares conservation tips with neighbors.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Green Team was instrumental in getting residents the larger 46-gallon recycling bins with wheels and lids, which make hauling plastic, glass, aluminum and newspaper a little easier, Kaczmarsky said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This month, the group organized a Green Expo, at which public and private vendors were invited to share information about their energy-efficient services and products. Some of the organizations in attendance were Home Depot, Loudoun Water, Con-Serve Industries, the Pedal Shop and Standard Solar.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In addition to exhibit booth information, the event featured giveaways of reusable shopping bags and compact fluorescent light bulbs. Attendees also got a chance to see firsthand the homeowners association-approved rain barrel, the community's new recycling bins and an in-home kitchen composter demonstration.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Next on the Green Team's agenda is a community-wide cleanup from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Nov. 2.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the future, the group wants to help certify Cascades as a wildlife habitat through the National Wildlife Federation, and there are plans to organize community-wide activities in recognition of nationwide observances such as Bike-to-Work Day, Arbor Day and, of course, Earth Day.</span></p>
