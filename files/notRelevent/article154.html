  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: Good morning everyone.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Less than 13 days left now. It's looking good for Obama -- the polls have turned decidedly in his direction since I last chatted. But who knows what could happen in the time left. McCain has now settled on a new accusation: Obama is a socialist. He's hammering it hard, using Joe the Plumber as his main foil. Obama takes a day off this week to be with his grandmother.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let's get to it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Allison Park, Pa.: What's the cumulative effect of Palin's &quot;Real America&quot; comment and new family travel expense allegations? Her popularity ratings have swung a good deal in her very short time as a national ticket candidate. Thanks in advance for taking questions this morning.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: A Sarah Palin question to start us off.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin's star seems to have faded quickly, especially among the Republican establishment, but also with voters. Polls show her more of a drag than a help now on the ticket. Her &quot;Real America&quot; comment and the family travel allegations won't help.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But perhaps the biggest blunder is the news this morning that the Republican National Committee spent $150,000 on clothes for her in the days after she was picked to be the nominee. That's sure to undercut the campaign's argument that they are campaigning for the little guy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Remember the $400 haircut?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Helena, Mont.: How much of an impact has the economic downturn had on the Republican big donors being able to fund 527s or donate to Republican Party? It's easier for a lot of people to donate $25 or $50 a month even in bad economic times than it is for a few to donate $28,000 or so.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: Actually, it's been surprising to me that the fundraising on both sides has been as strong as it has been given the economic troubles.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clearly, Obama has broken every record (and not, by the way, only because of little donations. He's had plenty of $10 million fundraisers with really big donors). But McCain and the RNC have broken records too. I was at a fundraiser the other day in New York with McCain (as the &quot;pool&quot; reporter covering it) and it pulled in $10 million in one night.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So while lots of people are losing lots of money in the stock market, it seems that there's still a lot of money out there for political campaigns</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Seattle: Of the four candidates, Sarah Palin alone has refused to release any medical records and this has received very little press attention. Given the lack of press focus, do you think future candidates may decide that there is no real reason to release their records?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: Interesting question. As one of the reporters who spent three hours reviewing Sen. McCain's medical records earlier this year, I believe all the candidates should provide as much detail as possible on their health. I do not know why her records have not been released. I suspect that there will continue to be pressure from the press on future candidates -- at least, I hope so.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anonymous: I don't care much about Palin's clothes purchases, but she appears to have made no effort to reach out to voters except for conservatives who already agree with her. Energizing the base is important, but so is reaching out to moderates who aren't firmly in the Democratic camp (especially as the GOP is still a minority party). It does make me wonder -- have there been other vice presidential candidates picked to energize a party's base versus reaching out to others?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: It's interesting. My sense from talking to the campaign is that they thought Palin would be helpful in reaching out to women, Clinton Democrats and &quot;reform&quot; minded voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As it turns out of course, it looks like that didn't turn out to be true at all. Polls suggest, as you point out, that Palin mainly energizes the base -- and that's certainly anecdotally true at the rallies she holds across the country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin again: About the clothing expenditures -- is the RNC allowed to spend money on that? I thought the campaigns weren't allowed to coordinate?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: I think there's a bunch of wiggle room here. There are some things that the campaign can coordinate with the RNC, within limits. Some ads, for example, can be jointly paid for and developed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I think the laws and advisory opinions that govern this stuff are likely to be somewhat vague. The campaign's comment last night -- that they had always said they would donate the clothes to charity -- struck me as a legalistic response that might indicate there's some rule that allows them to do that as long as the candidate doesn't keep the clothes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Stay tuned.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Albany, N.Y.: I have read that it is illegal to use campaign contributions to buy candidates clothes, because these are considered personal items, essentially on the theory that the candidate would have to wear clothes even if they weren't a candidate. Is there anything to this?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: See above. We're looking into this.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sacramento, Calif.: THanks for taking my question. What is McCains most likely electoral path to victory? I was playing pundant with CNN's calculator, and it seems all Obama needs to do is win everything Kerry won and then get Iowa, Colorado and New Mexico. Conversly even, if McCain wins Florida and Ohio, he still must beat Obbama in one of those three states, and I have a hard time seeing that happen with the polls how they are and the lack of &quot;values&quot; voters in those states who might get cold feet.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: The electoral map is looking more and more grim for McCain every day. The campaign has always said that they could win with two of the following: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio. Ohio is close -- a dead heat. It looks like McCain campaign folks feel like their best shot at the second is Pennsylvania, even though the polls show him far behind.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But that assumes that he holds the other Bush states -- Virginia, Florida, Indiana, etc. Those look shaky too right now</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: Fundraising:&quot;Actually, it's been surprising to me that the fundraising on both sides has been as strong as it has been given the economic troubles.&quot; Well, it appears that your view is not held by an analysis of the situation. Politico has a huge article on how the stock market and John McCain's own campaign have, in fact, affected contributions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: No cavalry coming for McCain (Politico, Oct. 22)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: I believe the Politico piece makes a different point -- that the immediate stock market downturn makes it less likely that a single, wealthy donor or donors bankrolls an independent effort on McCain's behalf. I would wonder whether there is more to it than that -- McCain has condemned such efforts and has not been popular with some of the conservatives who might be the most likely candidates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But I stick by my broader assertion that during the past year or so, as the economy has steadily gotten worse, the amount of money going into both of these campaigns is staggering.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Claverack, N.Y.: I'm a deep-blue Democrat who nearly hit the ceiling when I heard what Joe Biden had said in private to contributors about how Sen. Obama was going to be &quot;tested.&quot; Was he out of his mind?! I expected I'd see Sen. Biden on every nightly news show trying to get himself out of that, but nothing. Does the Obama camp just not see this as a big deal, or are they terrified of Joe saying something even worse?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: Welcome to Joe Biden Land, where gaffes are something that are expected. To be fair, though, it's unclear that Biden was really saying anything more than the common assumption that a new president -- any new president -- is likely to be tested as the world adjusts to a post-Bush world. Still, Biden has clearly given an opening to McCain to shift the conversation back to foreign affairs, where he still has an advantage.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: Early Voting: With all of this early voting going on, how will that impact exit polls, which I think are what the networks use to call states on Election Night, no?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: From Jon Cohen, our pollster:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Exit pollsters complement Election Day interviews with phone surveys in a number of states where early voting is common (there is also a national version). High early voting, though, certainly adds to the challenges, particularly in the states where there is little precedent for what may happen this year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.: If Palin really wanted to reach out to the undecideds, she should have purchased clothes at Macy's, Foley's, or Dillard's. But I know how it works -- the Republican National Committee hired a personal shopper and gave them the sizes, colors and other preferences of the client. I'm showing my age, but I remember all of the bad publicity from Nancy Reagan's demands for free clothes from designers. Sorry RNC, you're not absolved for saying &quot;but we're donating the clothes to charity afterward.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: What about Target? That's where I buy my shirts. (A reporter's salary, you know!)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Georgia: How do you honestly think the Georgia race will go? The polls give McCain a seven percentage point lead, yet the Chambliss-Martin race is tied (within the margin of error). Registrations are up, and early voters are primarily African American. Can my state go blue? Is Chambliss scared? I certainly hope so!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: I'm no expert, but I would say McCain wins Georgia. (I know. I'm going out on a limb there.) For the real story on the Chambliss-Martin race, head over to The Fix, and my colleague, Chris Cilizza.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bloomington, Ind.: Hello Michael. Next Wednesday, Oct. 29, Obama will deliver what could be the most watched campaign commercial in history. Has there been any talk about the format or setting? It certainly will be interesting to see if this time is spent talking directly to the voters one-on-one, or if Obama uses it to present his vision for the country's future in an inspirational tone.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: I have not heard any details about this. But it will certainly be interesting to see how he uses it. I know that for myself, watching another 30-second ad sometimes gets tiring. So I assume he's trying to figure out how to get people to pay attention for 30 minutes</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Jefferson City, Mo.: Okay, there's polling data to indicate Palin's a drag on the ticket outside of the true believers, but everybody seems to forget that McCain mostly had lost the hard-right evangelical wing of the party from the get-go. Like it or not, without them, he didn't stand a chance. Palin at least brought them on board. Of course, his campaign didn't think about the repercussions of that, but you go to war with the candidate you have, not the candidate you wished you had. Or something like that.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: Agreed. Totally. Palin helped McCain with the base. And it's an interesting question to wonder whether the base would have become energized in the end anyway. But it seems clear that Palin was not the draw that they thought she might be with independents and &quot;reformers&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: In a blog post yesterday you said that the McCain campaign has been sending you ads on Betamax tape, implying that the campaign was out-of-touch and using outdated technology. In the comments section, many people suggested that you must have been mistaken, and that the format must have been BetaSP, which is different than Betamax and is still a common format in broadcast television news. Have you checked that? I work in television news and I think that they probably are correct. If so, you should issue a correction to your blog post.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: The Trail: Republicans' Betamax Media Strategy (washingtonpost.com, Oct. 20)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: Actually, the comments were correct. It's not Betamax. It's BetacamSP.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But it still doesn't fit in my VHS machine.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: If the McCain folks are worried about the polls, will they throw the Rev. Wright issue out in front as a last resort? Wouldn't showing the Rev. Wright seemingly shouting rhetoric play into the Republican hands that Obama has &quot;anti-American&quot; views and can't be trusted? What other October Suprises do you see from either camp?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: It seems unlikely to me that the McCain campaign will use the Wright issue in these last days, despite the comments by its campaign manager that they will &quot;rethink&quot; everything.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My guess is that a decision to use Wright now would be seen as a desperate move, and part of the narrative that seems to have been established that McCain is the more negative campaigner right now.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There's always the possibility that another group, not connected to the campaign, could run with that. But so far, there's no indication that's about to happen. We'll see.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Early Voting in Virginia: Can you or someone out there shed some light on early voting in Virginia? I understand that it's an option, but where does one find info about it? I went to the Board of Elections Website and they only refer to absentee voting -- which I do not qualify for. I'd love to go and vote early, but I can't seem to find out where and how to do it. Help!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: I believe -- and will stand corrected if someone out there knows differently -- that absentee voting is the only form of early voting that exists in Virginia. And the absentee voting in Virginia is restricted, unlike some states, which allow everyone to take that option.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here, from the State Board of Elections, is who is eligible to vote absentee:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">1. Any person who, in the regular and orderly course of his business, profession, or occupation or while on personal business or vacation, will be absent from the county or city in which he is entitled to vote;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">2. Any person who is a member of a uniformed service of the United States, on active duty, or a member of the merchant marine of the United States, or who temporarily resides outside of the United States, or the spouse or dependent residing with any person listed in, and who will be absent on the day of the election from the county or city in which he is entitled to vote;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">3. Any student attending a school or institution of learning, or his spouse, who will be absent on the day of election from the county or city in which he is entitled to vote;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">4. Any person who is unable to go in person to the polls on the day of election because of a physical disability or physical illness;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">5. Any person who is confined while awaiting trial or for having been convicted of a misdemeanor, provided that the trial or release date is scheduled on or after the third day preceding the election. Any person who is awaiting trial and is a resident of the county or city where he is confined shall, on his request, be taken to the polls to vote on election day if his trial date is postponed and he did not have an opportunity to vote absentee;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">6. Any person who is a member of an electoral board, registrar, officer of election, or custodian of voting equipment;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">7. Any duly registered person who is unable to go in person to the polls on the day of the election because he is primarily and personally responsible for the care of an ill or disabled family member who is confined at home;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">8. Any duly registered person who is unable to go in person to the polls on the day of the election because of an obligation occasioned by his religion.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">9. Any person who, in the regular and orderly course of his business, profession, or occupation, will be at his place of work and commuting to and from his home to his place of work for eleven or more hours of the thirteen that the polls are open.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Al-Qaeda Endorsement: Any word from the McCain camp on getting this one?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: On Al-Qaeda Web Sites, Joy Over U.S. Crisis, Support for McCain (Post, Oct. 22)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: As we speak, I am listening to a McCain conference call in which they blast this story. They say it does not reflect anything more than a single blogger, and they read out statements of praise for Obama from officials in Hamas, Iran and Libya. Stay tuned for more reaction.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael D. Shear: Ok. It's about that time. Thanks for all the good questions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My next day is two weeks from today -- the day after the election. I guess we'll have plenty to talk about.</span></p>
