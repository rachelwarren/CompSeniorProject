  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There is no way, of course, that Senator Barack Obama would ever nominate three controversial figures from his past to serve on the United States Supreme Court: the convicted felon Antoin Rezko; the former Weather Underground radical Bill Ayers; or Mr. Obama's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Yet the names and faces of the three men appear in a new television advertisement -- running in Michigan and Ohio this week and nationally on Fox News on Monday, at a total cost of $500,000 -- arguing that Mr. Obama's judgment about his associates shows that he cannot be trusted to pick justices for the Supreme Court.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At a time when job losses, home foreclosures and the war in Iraq are paramount in voters' minds, the politics of the Supreme Court seem, at first blush, abstract and unlikely to emerge as a concern before the election. Yet both presidential campaigns are gearing up for the possibility that court-related issues will become an X factor in some swing states, in what political analysts see as intensifying unpredictability. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Judges are what you refer to as a 'last 30 days' issue, and it's hard to know how it might play,'' said Evan Tracey, the head of CMAG, a company that monitors political advertising. ''Now is the time when you start hearing messages that connect with the single-issue core voters -- guns, abortion, civil rights. And it's all about judges.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> President Bush is delivering a speech on Monday in Cincinnati about his judicial philosophy and his court nominations, remarks likely to draw at least an implicit contrast between Mr. Obama and the Republican candidate, Senator John McCain. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Obama advisers say they plan to push back forcefully and warn that Mr. McCain, who has praised Mr. Bush's picks for the court, would continue selecting conservative judges.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Both campaigns are also watching to see if the future of the Roe v. Wade decision, as well as issues like gay marriage and school prayer, become galvanizing forces for swing voters in battlegrounds like Ohio and Pennsylvania. Advisers on both sides say they doubt social issues will match the economy's problems in this election, and Obama advisers say they are being especially vigilant about not allowing anything to overshadow that issue.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Indeed, Mr. Obama already has some experience with blowback from the right and the left over Supreme Court issues. Critics accused him of slipperiness in June for praising the court's decision in a Second Amendment case overturning the District of Columbia's ban on personal gun ownership, and for his attack on another ruling that outlawed the death penalty for people convicted of child rape.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> For Mr. McCain's part, conservatives remember with antipathy that he was part of the so-called Gang of 14, Republican and Democratic senators who forged a compromise that allowed for confirmation votes on some of Mr. Bush's judicial appointments.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Still, many conservatives are confident that Mr. McCain would appoint people who, as he has pledged, fit the mold of the two most recent additions to the court, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. (Mr. Obama voted against both men; he has praised Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David H. Souter as ''sensible.'') The next president is expected to have at least one nomination for the Supreme Court and as many as three in his four-year term.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''McCain is a social conservative, and he's given every indication that his appointees would be conservative, especially since that's the traditional way to repay the Republican base for helping elect you,'' said Michael Dorf, a professor at Cornell Law School and a former clerk for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. ''Obama's whole message, meanwhile, is about uniting people and listening to the other side. And he is close to a number of core centrist Democratic thinkers about the court, so it's likely that he would pick people who are fairly centrist.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Many conservatives disagree. They point to remarks that Mr. Obama made on CNN where, after saying he did not believe ''in a bunch of judicial law-making,'' he went on to describe in relatively explicit terms for a presidential candidate what sort of perspective he would want his nominees to have.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''What I do want is a judge who is sympathetic enough to those who are on the outside, those who are vulnerable, those who are powerless, those who can't have access to political power and as a consequence can't protect themselves from being -- from being dealt with sometimes unfairly, that the courts become a refuge for justice,'' said Mr. Obama, who taught constitutional law for years at the University of Chicago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Several conservative observers of the court said they interpreted those remarks as code for Mr. Obama's intention to select ''liberal activist judges.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''That comment was pretty remarkable to a lot of us,'' said Neomi Rao, a teacher at George Mason University Law School who is a former associate counsel in the Bush White House and a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas. ''When I hear about a judge who rules on the basis of empathy, I think of an activist judge.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Obama advisers say that he believes most cases are decided based on precedents but that a handful of decisions can reflect judges' own life experiences, like a recent equal-pay case where a conservative bloc of justices ruled against a female factory supervisor saying she should have filed her suit years earlier.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Some campaign analysts point out that presidential candidates have long struggled to make an issue out of their opponent's record on judicial appointments. Senator John Kerry, for instance, often said in 2004 that if voters needed a reason to oppose Mr. Bush, ''I have three words for you: the Supreme Court.'' Few analysts say it made much difference in the outcome of the election, and Mr. Roberts and Mr. Alito have joined the court since.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Still, now is the moment in a presidential race when court issues can come to the fore. The new advertisement focusing on Mr. Obama's ties to Mr. Wright and others comes as Mr. Obama is struggling to win over white working-class voters in parts of Michigan, Ohio and western Pennsylvania (where the advertisement will also be seen) who voted for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primaries.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''It's important to point out that voters don't get to pick justices; we pick a president who hopefully has the right discernment of character to evaluate people for life tenure on the court,'' said Wendy Long, chief counsel for the Judicial Confirmation Network, a conservative-leaning group that is running the new commercial. ''Based on the evidence of people like Reverend Wright, Obama has deficiency in that area.''</span></p>
