  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">____________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: Is it really possible that I -- of all Post reporters -- get to do this morning's chat? Seriously, a lifelong Philadelphia Phillies phan like myself. Wow. I apologize in advance for all my baseball/Phillies references in this chat. I can't help myself. But, there's something perfect about a baseball season, sort of like a political campaign. You throw yourself into it and it becomes the way you mark time. And, if your like me, the two begin to blend together. When did Rick Renzi get indicted? Feb. 22, while I was on a golf trip with my brother Matt and my hometown friends. The next day, we went to Clearwater to watch the Phillies practice. Our new relief pitcher, Brad Lidge, stepped onto the mound to throw and I proclaimed our entire season rested on his shoulders. On the next pitch he got hurt, and it started to pour down rain. Practice cancelled. On my 38th birthday my friends thew a party at a bar we now call &quot;PK's Rec Room&quot;, and a GOP staffer told me that there was a bubbling scandal with Obama's small-dollar contributions. Oh, and Brad Lidge blew a save in the all-star game that night, his only blown save of the year, meaning the National League would be the away team in the World Series. On the night of Sept. 18, Carl Hulse of the NY Times and I were supposed to go to the Nationals-Mets game, so I could cheer on the Nats as my Phillies chased down the Mets. Instead, Bernanke and Paulson came to the Hill to tell Congress the world had changed. And last week, while on the campaign trail covering House and Senate races, I sat by myself in a suburban Detroit hotel room screaming and yelling at the TV like some mad man. It's a wonder I didn't get kicked out of the hotel. Folks, on to the politics, but first, let me just say: We did it. And thanks to Brody and Lauren for letting me watch all the games in their condo on nights I was here in DC. I couldn't possibly watch it all by myself. -- pk</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fairfax, Va. -- Connolly vs. Fimian: Do you have any polling numbers for the Connolly vs. Fimian race? That one is rather nasty, with allegations on both sides.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: You know, I haven't even paid any attention to this race, I'm sorry. I think it was one that was supposed to be a blockbuster back in the winter when Rep. Tom Davis announced he was retiring. But the environment in northern Virginia is just so pro-Obama, it's impossible for a first-time Republican to win. The Rothenberg Political Report has already placed this race in the &quot;Democrat favored&quot; category. You know, Tom Davis is a big baseball fan. I wonder what he thinks about the Phillies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Philadelphia: Yea Phillies! Paul, isn't it time to call Arizona a swing or battleground state? If McCain and the press are saying that about Pennsylvania (which nearly every poll has at plus-nine for Obama) shouldn't they say it about Arizona, where we've seen McCain go from up 20 percentage points to up four?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: See, this person knows how to play to my preferences to get me to answer his/her question. I don't know what to think of Arizona. Yes, it's been a swing state in the past. But I just don't think it's going to be that close. I mean, if it is, that means Obama wins around 400 electoral votes. I just don't think that's going to happen. People are acting silly. This is sort of like the Bush-Cheney campaign in '00, when they thought they could win New Jersey. Obama's folks should just focus and finish on the states that get them the White House and not worry about those other places.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paterson, N.J.: Congrats on the Phillies. You obviously should take full credit for the victory. My question is whether the intense campaign season and extended congressional session divided too much of your attention and hindered your full enjoyment of what hopefully (and probably) will be the last Philadelphia major sports championship for at least another quarter century?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: Ben, is that you? Or one of your coworkers? Is Pascrell making you all work hard so he gets 75% this year?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It was a tough fall, covering the usual congressional end-game and then the $700 billion bailout and now all the races. I watched one play of the division-clinching win against the Nats -- the double-play to end the game -- because it was the Saturday of the marathon negotiations that led to the first bailout &quot;deal&quot;. But hey, I got to watch all the key moments of the playoffs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Montreal: Paul, are there any good historical parallels for the arc of Joe Lieberman's recent career? Vice-presidential nominee on the Democratic ticket in 20OO, lost his own primary but got re-elected in a Democratic state in 2006, pretty much part of the Republican ticket in 2008. Talk about picking the wrong team at the wrong time!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: I can't think of any parallel like Lieberman. This guy was a good Democrat just 8 years ago, and I mean &quot;good&quot; in the sense that he was a party loyalist. Sure, he was a big moral values guy, but the Dems liked having him around because it helped with the Clinton scandal issues. He was a moral compass for them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I mean, Jim Jeffords switching parties and giving the Dems control of the Senate in 2001 was pretty wild and crazy, but, let's face it, Jeffords was never a key figure with Republicans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">No, I can't think of anything like what Lieberman has done. I guess the only parallel would be to have placed a really big bet on the Rays winning the world series after Pedro Feliz drove in what amounted to the winning run of last night's game.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chapel Hill, N.C.: I hope you will comment on the new ad being run by Sen. Elizabeth Dole in her race against Kay Hagan. In this ad, Sen. Dole insinuates that Kay Hagan is &quot;godless&quot; because she accepted money from an atheist group. Further, the ad closes with &quot;she took Godless money -- what did she promise in return?&quot; I am incredibly angry at the new low that Elizabeth Dole has brought to this election, and the embarrassment she has brought to our state. Kay Hagan has been a Presbyterian elder and Sunday School teacher. Where does this stop?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: I'm going to watch the ad today, I'm sorry I haven't watched it yet. I saw it emailed to me yesterday but I figured the &quot;godless&quot; accusation was so far out there, it wouldn't resonate. However, Mason-Dixon has a poll out this morning showing Dole edging ahead of Hagan. That would be a real blow to the Democrats, who believed a week ago that this was a race they had in the bag. Instead, this could be turning into Tester-Burns, the race in '06 in which Burns closed really strong and ended up losing only by a couple thousand votes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Salinas, Calif.: So Paul, do you think that the Pennsylvania voters McCain desperately has been trying to reach will appreciate the irony that &quot;Joe the Plumber&quot; will be more likely to breach Obama's $250,000 tax threshold now that he's signed with a Nashville PR firm for a national speaking tour?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: About 1/3 of all Pennsylvania voters are in the southeast corner of the state, around Philadelphia, and they spent the past week arguing over Bud Selig's decisions about when to start or delay baseball games. (Bud, thanks for starting the game Saturday night after 10 pm, because I was there to watch in person!)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Seriously, it's hard to over-state how much the Philly area focused on the Phillies and not presidential politics the past two weeks. I doubt my family knows who Joe the Plumber is.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cheesesteak: You know what? I'm not worried about next Tuesday or about next Wednesday. I'm worried about the following weeks when I keep trying to hit &quot;refresh&quot; on the Politico and Washington Post Web sites, when I keep looking for the same high from Milbank's antics, but instead find myself wandering alone at 3 a.m. through the broken shards of outdated polls. Then, finding rock bottom, I turn to Hazelden ... wait, no, Betty Ford! Yes, the Betty Ford Clinic in a swing state. That should do the trick.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: Hah, that's a funny reaction. Because this campaign has been sooooo long, so never-ending. I mean, think about it, Obama announced in mid-February 2007 in Springfield, Ill. In that time two World Series champions have been crowned, the Democrats have seized the House seats of Denny Hastert and two Deep South Republicans. Hillary Clinton's gaffe in a debate on driver's licenses for immigrants in Philadelphia seems like a few years ago. It's amazing how long this has gone on.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You'll get through this, don't worry. There's a whole transition to go through, confirmation hearings, all sorts of stuff. Plus, as soon as the election's over, there's the whole what-happens-to-Lieberman stories to get you through the night.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rolla, Mo.: Last night's 30 minute ad is another example of how well Obama has run his campaign. Whether you agree with his positions or not, whether you plan to vote for him or not, it's hard to argue that his campaign hasn't been managed masterfully. I don't know how this translates to running the White House, but it's in stark contrast to the campaign on the other side.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: David Plouffe -- Obama's campaign manager, a huge Phillies fan and, most importantly, a University of Delaware Fightin' Blue Hen -- thanks you for that question. But honestly, maybe I was just too intensely focused on the World Series, but my friends and I turned that thing on and after 10 minutes I was bored. I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't very compelling. Again, I was very distracted so take my views with a proverbial grain of salt. But personally, I think he shoulda just re-aired the Iowa caucus speech. Nah, I'm kidding.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hey!: Is this a sports chat or a political chat?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: Sorry, sorry, but I did pre-emptively apologize.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Look, every once in a while over on &quot;Freedom Rock&quot; -- my colleague J. Freedom duLac's music chats -- he just declares it to be an all-Springsteen chat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Well, today is close to an all-Philadelphia chat. I cant' help myself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By the way, I can't believe that Pennsylvania seems to not even be a focal point of the final days of this campaign. After so much focus went into it in '00 and '04, it just seems odd.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lieberman? That's nothing, really: Paul, John Connally forever will be the most dramatic party-switching story in modern American politics, with the late-life transformation of George Wallace a close second. Jewish Americans are an important constituency in the Democratic Party, and many right-wing Jews like Lieberman have spent a great deal of time as Democrats before eventually becoming de facto Republicans (Ed Koch readily comes to mind).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: Yeah, the Texas governor is a pretty big one, come to think of it. Going from being at Kennedy's side in Dealey Plaza to running for the GOP nomination. Ok, I'll buy that. As for Lieberman and conservative Jewish voters, we'll see what happens. But the Democratic plan right now seems to be to strip Lieberman of his committee chairmanship but not to outright expel him (that would involve stripping him of every committee assignment; instead, he'll lose the chairmanship but get to stay on all his committees). I don't know if that's enough to push him over the edge and walk across the aisle to caucus with Republicans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ashbury Park, N.J.: Paul, it has been a while since you've gotten a juicy Boss question, so I thought I'd toss you a bone. I've been thinking about which song I'd choose to epitomize each candidate's campaign. (As of late I'm thinking &quot;Reason to Believe&quot; or &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; for McCain and &quot;Prove It All Night&quot; for Obama.) What would your picks be? Thanks and hope you get a break after Election Day!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: A Springsteen question! Honestly, the best song for McCain right now is The Rising. Unfortunately, it's the Democrats that are using it. But &quot;The Rising&quot; is about dedicated servants running into a towering inferno unsure of what's about to happen but still dedicated to the cause. As for Obama, it kinda feels like he's just sitting on his lead right now, so it's more of a lullaby-type song, something like &quot;Waiting on a Sunny Day&quot; or &quot;Hungry Heart&quot;.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, Va.: First things first, congratulations all Phillies fans on the World Series win last night. I'm a Yankees fan, but I was rooting for you guys. I think the city of Philly and the surrounding suburbs deserve it -- great team, fun to watch. Secondly Paul, I am an independent in Virginia who a few months ago decided to vote for Obama. I still will, but last night's &quot;political message&quot; -- while very nicely done -- made me take notice at one point because there is a serious discrepancy between what Obama has been saying about his tax plan and what he said last night.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Last night he said everyone under $200,000 will get a tax cut; however, on the stump and in debates and on his Web site he has been saying that everyone under $250,000 will get one. This is a glaring difference, and while $50,000 may not be a big deal for some people, for others it definitely is. Has anyone reported on this yet? Again, I'm still going to vote for him, but I am worried (and other independent family members are as well) that he already is backtracking from his campaign promises.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: Amen to your first point. As for your substance question, I'm not sure of the answer, but he most certainly has always said $250,000 in every format I've seen.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The important thing to remember in all this is, it's all gonna be worked out up here on Capitol Hill anyway. That's a very nice tax propsal President Obama (or President McCain), but now it's time for Chairman Charlie Rangel and Chairman Max Baucus to give their own input to that plan. So, in the end, you've got to remember that the Democrats in Congress will have a bigger say on this tax plan than Obama lets on right now. And, with deficits soaring the way they are, it's not at all clear that Obama will be able to deliver on the tax cut proposals he talks about on the stump.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Princeton, N.J.: I'm 70. I saw my first Phillies in, I believe, 1948. It was a doubleheader against the Reds. We lost the first game, and when my father saw the warm up of their pitcher for the secong game, he said &quot;let's skip it.&quot; It was Ewell Blackwell's rookie season. Okay: Suppose Obama gets 370, we get 60 in the Senate and 270 in the House. Won't the prescence of so many really comservative Democrats make it hard for a lot of very liberal programs from getting through?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: And that, ladies and gentleman, is what it's like to be a Phillies fan, your 1st father-son experience at the ballpark being a double-header loss. Man, that's terrible. From the way you've asked your question, I'm assuming you're a Democrat. I guess the Phillies win has gone to your head and you're now super optimistic on everything. Because, look, it's a long way to 370 electoral votes and 60 Senate seats. A long way. Democrats need to focus and finish, do the basics, get out all the votes. Dole could be mounting a come back in NC, Coleman seems to be turning the needle in Minnesota.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York: Speaking of the bailout, this has gone from trickle-down to I know not what, now that the banks are not even going to loan the money out to businesses and other banks. Any chance the entire thing gets repealed?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: I don't think there's any ability to &quot;repeal&quot; the law once the money goes out the door of the Treasury. But the 2nd batch of cash, the last $350 billion, needs congressional approval. So, yes, that's the chit Congress has left to play here. If they don't like the way things are going, they can refuse to allocate that money to Paulson or his successor at Treasury.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Valdosta, Ga.: Paul -- congratulations to the Phillies. I have seen no poll about Jack Kingston here in Georgia. Do you know anything about the race? His opponent is a former military man -- is there any chance we can send Rep. Kingston back to his family? Recall that he didn't want to work a four days a week, only three. Some of us in his district would like him to not have the job!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: I can't tell you anything about the polling down there, but I know that it's not a race on anyone's radar right now. So, i assume both parties believe it's safely in Kingston's hands.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You know, after Democrats won Mississippi 1 in the special election, Rep. Chris Van Hollen called me at my desk and told me something interesting: The environment was so bad for Republicans, that Democrats could put any seat in play that they wanted to. It was bravado, sure, but I really wonder what would have happened if Van Hollen blind folded himself and threw a dart at a map. Let's just say the dart hit the district of Rep. John Sullivan in Oklahoma, a conservati who regularly wins with 60% or more, whose district gave Bush 65% in 2004. If Van Hollen and the DCCC just decided on a whim to pump $2 million into a race against Sullivan, could they have knocked him off? Made it close? I don't know, but it's intersting to think about.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anonymous: If Ted Kennedy decides to retire, who is likely to take his seat ?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: Ah, the Kennedy succession game. Four years ago at this time, with John Kerry possibly headed for the White House, everyone in Boston was focused on the World Series win of the Red Sox -- except for about 5 people who were angling for the chance to get Kerry's Senate seat. Marty Meehan, the congressman who's now a university president in the U-Mass system, is still sitting on about $5 million in his campaign account. He wanted the Kerry seat and will want Ted Kennedy's seat whenever it comes open. So too does Rep. Ed Markey and a few other members of the state's delegation. Now that he's a committee chairman, Barney Frank is not as likely to go for the seat if Kennedy were to retire because of his health.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Two things to remember. As of now, Kennedy is trying to send signals that he's getting better. And, don't forget, but for a brief interval after Jack's White House victory, this seat has basically been in the Kennedy family since 1952. I think former Rep. Joe Kennedy, son of Bobby and nephew of the senator, may be able to stake a family claim there.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington: I think I read that $200,000 is for individuals and $250,000 for families. I have heard him refer to both figures -- check his Web site for clarification though.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: http://origin.barackobama.com/taxes/</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There's the link to the tax plan.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">York, Pa.: This has been the worst political chat I've read. If I wanted to talk about sports I would wait for one of the sports chat to come on. When will the discussion about politics actually happen? I hope that there is another chat on today that actually focuses on politics.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: As a matter of fact ... Noon: Western States in the General Election; 1 p.m.: Washington Sketch with Dana Milbank; 2 p.m. Tucker Carlson and Ana Marie Cox; Purple State Citizen Journalist Videos; 3 p.m.: Larry Sabato.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: Our readers, gotta love them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lexington, Mass.: I can't believe you found the Obama film boring. I am a 55-year-old father of two -- my wife works with people who are mentally retarded and I am a headhunter -- and we barely get by! I found the stories of other folks who are struggling like we are to be quite moving. Maybe you political writers don't have the same kind of economic worries most Americans have right now.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: Again, I said I was kind of distracted. I don't know what I was looking for, maybe what I just felt like hearing was one of those soaring rhetoric speeches. So much about life is expectations. And I just wasn't expecting that. The stories of those people were moving and captured the feel of this country at this time, I'm sure. I'm just saying that, it wasn't what I was expecting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And as for newspaper reporters, we have worries, don't worry. Our industry has been in one long depression now for this entire decade.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anonymous: Has Howard Dean been reported missing yet ?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: Great question. Dean really hasn't been seen much at all, not since the convention. There are still a lot of Dean diehards out there who believe his 50-state strategy laid the groundwork for Obama's campaign. If nothing else, his '04 campaign's tapping into the Internet certainly provided a roadmap for all Democrats for fundraising and other cyber-strategies. The Dems are far ahead of the Republicans on that score, for certain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Iowa: Any chance that Becky Greenwald will pull out a win over Tom Latham in Iowa's 4th Congressional District? Iowa never has sent a woman to Congress. The Des Moines Register endorsed her this week.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: Looking at my latest Rothenberg Political Report, that race is not on the map right now. Just means that the Dems aren't actively campaigning there with the DCCC's money. That really is funny how Iowa hasn't ever sent a woman to Congress. Anyone else remember when Hillary Clinton got in trouble for bashing Iowa for that about a year ago? Then she pivoted and said something about how she'd expect that of Mississippi -- prompting Trent Lott to get all upset. Man, that feels like it was three years ago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">South Bend, Ind.: Paul, conservatives out here really have honed in Obama's support for the Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA) and its potential impact on abortion restrictions. My understanding, though, is that FOCA basically has been languishing in committee for almost 20 years. Should the Democrats win big on Election Day, do you expect they actually will spend political capital on passing FOCA?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: I don't expect abortion issues to come to the forefront at all in the 111th Congress. Seems that the Democrats basically just want to stop the march toward repealing Roe v. Wade.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I don't think they have any interest in actually taking up expansive abortion language, if for no other reason than it will tear their own party apart. (Guys like Bob Casey are now winning Senate seats for them.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Looking past Tuesday...: Is there any chance that we could see true election reform in this country? I am suspicious of different states having such widely varying times for &quot;early&quot; voting ... wouldn't it be better to continue allowing absentee voting, but also set aside one three-day weekend (Friday through Sunday) for folks to vote, then have one day for counting (Monday) and not have such disparate systems?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: You know, I love this idea. Something about this early voting and easy-to-do absentee voting just makes me feel odd. I like the idea of having at least two days of the polls being open, and I like the idea of it ending on a Saturday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">All that said, I just don't think there's a chance of anything like that happening. Reform, of any stripe, never happens when one party controls all the levers of power. And we're on the verge of that. True reform only happens when there's divided government, because both parties come together on something (think McCain-Feingold in '02, when Dems controlled the Senate).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.: I was at Game Four and there were numerous &quot;Joe The Pitcher&quot; references. Pennsylvania is going red -- last night was just the first step.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: Hahaha. Pennsylvania's getting more and more blue, except tomorrow when the Phillies start off the parade outside my brother Jim's office at 20th and Market. That's a Red October in Philadelphia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Kane: OK folks, time to get going. I took a few extra questions there because, well, some of you were complaining about the Phillies stuff. Again, I apologize. But, it's an awesome feeling. Having been able to be at game 3, watching that slow roller down the 3rd base line at 1:47 a.m. for the Phillies win, just an awesome feeling. And this stuff gets in people's minds during the presidential campaign. It's a stress reliever. I'm sure David Plouffe's only moments of levity for the past year were the few hours he got to watch the Phillies in Obama HQ.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now, back to politics. Just a few days till we know the results. Amazing times ahead people. Will Obama win in a landslide? A McCain comeback? Will the Dems get 60? Will Alaskans vote for a convicted felon to return to the Senate even though he's facing jail time?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We're just days away from the results. Amazing. Almost as amazing as a Phillies World Series. Almost. --pk</span></p>
