  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the state where President Bush has his lowest popularity ratings in the nation, the incumbent Republican senator is reaching across the aisle and groping for the coattails of Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Gordon Smith, a two-term moderate in a state with a history of embracing centrist Republicans such as Mark Hatfield, has put the Democratic candidate for president in not one, not two, but three of his television ads.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">How many mention John McCain?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Zero,&quot; said Brooks Kochvar, manager of a Republican campaign that cannot accurately be described as running away from its party label. This is more of a sprint. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Yeah, he's registered Republican,&quot; a timber man says in one Smith ad, &quot;but . . .&quot; But he worked with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), says another spot. Yet another invokes Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), whose name still appears on fading bumper stickers in liberal Portland. &quot;If you need any more telling indication of where the race is, or where the Republican Party is, what else can you say?&quot; said Tim Hibbits, a Portland pollster whose surveys are among the many showing Smith falling behind Democratic challenger Jeff Merkley.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;He's in a hell of a mess,&quot; Hibbits said. &quot;This is a state that tends to lean Democratic to begin with. Bush basically has destroyed the Republican brand here.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On a national electoral map remade by the economic crisis, Oregon offers Democrats one of the trickier challenges in the quest for the 60 seats that would make their majority filibuster-proof.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Enthusiasm for Obama clearly has hastened Oregon's shift from swing state into the Democratic column. This year, registration drives brought 167,000 more Democrats onto rolls, against a rise of 7,000 for Republicans. Democrats now have a 43 percent to 32 percent registration advantage.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;That's indicative of the shift that's going on underneath the surface of our politics here,&quot; said William Lunch, a political scientist at Oregon State University, noting steady Democratic election gains since 2002.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Before last week, the Obama campaign had offered scant help to Merkley, who said, &quot;He has so much money, he's doing his own thing here.&quot; But on Friday afternoon, Obama began showing up on Oregon television, addressing the camera directly to say &quot;With Jeff Merkley in the U.S. Senate, we can get our country back on track.&quot; The spot was the first Obama has done for another candidate since endorsing Bill Foster in a House special election in Illinois last February.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Oregon, the need for attention &quot;down the ballot&quot; was acute. The May 20 mail-in primary gave Obama a thumping victory over Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton but held ominous implications for Merkley: On the Democratic side, more than 90,000 ballots came back with no choice ticked in the Senate race.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;When you vote, don't stop at the top,&quot; a new TV spot counsels first-time voters, one of a flurry of new ads pointing out that Merkley is the Democrat in the race. &quot;Give Obama the team he needs.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The spots reflect the concerns of some Oregon Democrats that Smith's contortions are proving effective. If the telegenic heir to a frozen-food fortune succeeds in melding his message to Obama's through their common appeal for bipartisan cooperation, ticket-splitters could make up the gap in new registrations.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It isn't about politics,&quot; Smith said, straight-faced, at a press conference last week. &quot;It's about presenting what honestly exists.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Smith, looking the part of a country club Republican in a blue blazer and bright yellow sweater vest, addressed reporters from a lectern labeled &quot;Democrats for Smith.&quot; Two of the 22 registered Democrats flanking him sported Obama pins.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The problems that confront us, no party can solve on its own,&quot; the candidate said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Smith's claim of partnership with Obama appears thin. The Republican added his name to the list of co-sponsors on a bill the Illinois Democrat wrote requiring more fuel-efficient cars. Critics point out that Smith cast earlier votes against the same requirement.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;His record is so out of sync with Oregon,&quot; Merkley said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But Smith does have lunch weekly and appears frequently in town halls with Oregon's senior senator, Ron Wyden, the state's most popular politician and a Democrat. &quot;It's a question of finding common ground, and Senator Smith, my friend, my partner, always meets me halfway,&quot; Wyden says in archival footage the Smith campaign has turned into another television ad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A Portland television station reported receiving calls from viewers wondering whether Wyden had endorsed both candidates. But he made it clear he backs only Merkley.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The obvious intent of the ad is to confuse voters,&quot; said Wyden's chief of staff, Josh Kardon, who publicly asked Smith to remove Wyden's image. Smith demurred.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It is far from the most controversial commercial in a race that, but for Smith's embrace of the rival party, would be remembered for its nastiness.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The most notorious spot showed Merkley sloppily eating a hot dog while answering a question from the Republican operative who was filming him about the Russian invasion of Georgia. The words &quot;Need a moment?&quot; appear on-screen.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The spot, made by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, aired so relentlessly that Smith eventually condemned it. His own ads paint Merkley as hard on seniors and soft on rapists.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;There has been so much icky stuff,&quot; said Marny Gleboff, a retired librarian in Washington County, a Portland suburb that analysts call pivotal in voting that began last week, when Oregonians received their mail-in ballots. &quot;Why doesn't he just quit being a Republican?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think it stinks,&quot; said Judy, a retired utility worker and registered Democrat who said she twice before voted for Smith and who would give only her first name. &quot;I think Smith has just shot himself in the foot, cut his own throat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think if he just laid in the woods and paid attention to his own business, he might be okay.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Merkley has also faced bumps along the path to Nov. 4. The son of a lumber mill worker in rural Oregon, he did stints as a presidential national security fellow at the Pentagon and running Habitat for Humanity in Portland. In Salem, the self-described &quot;policy guy&quot; presided over a new Democratic majority in the state House during its most productive sessions in years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But he challenged Smith only after more prominent Oregon Democrats declined to run and was nearly beaten by Portland activist Steve Novick in a primary Smith tried to influence by advertising against Merkley.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the general election, most of the $27 million the two sides have spent on advertising has come from outside groups. One Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spot accuses Smith's frozen-food business of hiring illegal immigrants.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;He voted with George Bush 90 percent of the time,&quot; said Merkley, irked by Smith's effort to slipstream Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But some voters say that if Smith survives, it will be thanks to an Oregon tradition Hatfield embodied.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We cannot get away from the fact that Oregon is benefiting from a conservative Mormon senator and a liberal Jewish senator,&quot; said Deborah Burton, head nurse at a Portland hospital, referring to Smith and Wyden, respectively. The registered Democrat said she was at Smith's side last week because of his abiding support on a long list of issues.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I can't speak for the rest,&quot; she said, &quot;but health care is nonstop where it needs to be.&quot;</span></p>
