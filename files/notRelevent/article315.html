  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This two-minute advertisement by Senator Barack Obama's media team features him speaking directly into the camera.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE SCRIPT Mr. Obama says: ''For eight years, we've been told that the way to a stronger economy was to give huge tax breaks to corporations and the wealthiest Americans, and somehow prosperity would trickle down. Well, now we know the truth. It didn't work. Instead of prosperity trickling down, pain has trickled up. Working-family incomes have fallen by $2,000 a year. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We're losing jobs. Deficits are exploding. Our economy's in turmoil. I know that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis. But not by driving down the very same path. And that's what this election's all about. On taxes, John McCain and I have very different ideas. Instead of giving hundreds of billions in new tax breaks to big corporations and oil companies, I'll cut taxes for small and startup businesses that are the backbone of our economy. Instead of more tax breaks for corporations that outsource American jobs, I'll give them to companies who create jobs here. Instead of extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest, I'll focus on you. My plan offers three times as much tax relief to the middle class as Senator McCain's. If you make less than a quarter- million a year, you won't see your taxes raised one penny under my plan. And seniors making less than 50,000, who are struggling with the rising costs of food and drugs on fixed incomes, won't pay income taxes at all. The tax code we have today is over 10,000 pages long. Almost every bit of it was shaped by some lobbyist taking care of some special interest. Well, it's time we had a president who puts you first. I hope you'll log on to BarackObama.com and read my full plan. It will help jump-start our economy, create millions of jobs and bring back our Main Streets all across America. The old trickle-down theory has failed us. We can't afford four more years like the last eight. I'm Barack Obama, and I approved this message because I know that with a new direction and new policies focused on jobs and the middle class, we can lift our economy and our country.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ON THE SCREEN Mr. Obama delivers a two-minute monologue on fiscal issues, outlining what he says are the key differences between his economic proposals and those of Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ACCURACY The advertisement correctly points out that the incomes of working American families have fallen during the Bush administration. The commercial accuses the McCain campaign of ''giving hundreds of billions in new tax breaks to big corporations and oil companies'' and ''extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest.'' While it is true that Mr. McCain has proposed lowering the corporate income tax rate, that reduction applies across the board and is not aimed specifically at oil companies. Mr. Obama has proposed eliminating capital gains taxes on startup and small businesses. The spot's assertion that the Obama plan ''offers three times as much tax relief to the middle class as Senator McCain's'' is backed up by data from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Mr. Obama also points out that American households earning less $250,000 a year will not be subject to an income tax increase. Although that is true for a vast majority of families in that income bracket, some could still see their taxes go up.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SCORECARD This spot is part of the Obama campaign's attempt to reframe the economic narrative by rebuking a main critique from the McCain campaign: that Mr. Obama is a tax-and-spend liberal. The Obama campaign stretches some facts, but it does a compelling job of tying Mr. McCain to President Bush's economic policies. MICHAEL FALCONE </span></p>
