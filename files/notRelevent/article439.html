  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Is Killed in a Bombing in Iraq</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Fouad Ali Hussein al-Douri, a Sunni Arab leader of a citizen patrol group in Baghdad and a proponent of reconciliation and moderation in his neighborhood, was killed in a bombing over the weekend. It was the latest attack aimed at members of the so-called Awakening Councils, and a double blow, because of his efforts to promote reconciliation. PAGE A6</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CHINA FIRES LEADERS AFTER DEATHS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> China's state news agency announced that the governor and vice governor of Shanxi province lost their jobs after at least 254 villagers died last week when their homes were engulfed by a cascade of muddy iron ore waste from the reservoir of an unlicensed mine. Provincial officials in Shanxi may have also have hurt their credibility in Beijing last week by repeatedly and publicly underestimating the deaths caused by the mud flow. PAGE A10 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CONQUERING A PEAK, AND A DIVIDE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A group of Italian priests wanted Kenyans from different backgrounds to overcome an obstacle together, to show that cooperation was possible in their country, which has been torn by violence. And so a group of Kambas and Kikuyus, among others, set out to ascend Africa's second-highest peak, Mount Kenya. Though climbing the mountain required no special equipment, that did not mean it was easy. ''There better not be another war,'' one climber said. ''Because I ain't doing this again.''

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CRISIS HAMPERS THAILAND'S TOURISM</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Somchai Wongsawat, Thailand's acting prime minister, lifted the country's state of emergency that began this month after a clash erupted between rival groups of protesters. He also warned that the continuing political crisis was frightening away tourists and tarnishing the country's image as the ''Land of Smiles,'' as tourism groups had noted sharp declines in the number of visitors and hotel occupancy.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A CALL FOR AID TO AFGHANISTAN</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> One of the most experienced Western envoys in Afghanistan, Francesc Vendrell, said that conditions in the country had deteriorated to their worst point since 2001. He urged a concerted American and foreign response, even before a new American administration took office, because Afghanistan's problems could result in ''a very cold winter'' that threatened to become ''a very hot winter for all of us.''

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 2 DIE IN PARIS TOUR BOAT SINKING</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Two people died in Paris after a small tourist boat sank Saturday night in the Seine near the Cathedral of Notre Dame. The police were investigating whether the boat hit a bridge or a larger tourist dinner boat. PAGE A11</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> To Stay on the Farm</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As with so many similar tales, the start was benign: in the early 1970s, bighead carp and silver carp were imported from China and eastern Siberia to eat the algae clotting fish farms in the South. But then came the floods in the late '80s and early '90s that helped them to escape their controlled environment. And now fears that they will make their way to the Great Lakes haunts the dreams of environmentalists, business owners and government officials. This Land, by Dan Barry. PAGE A12</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> O.J. SIMPSON BACK ON TRIAL</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> If you are the kind of person whose TV viewing has seemed strangely hollow since O.J. Simpson's murder trial ended in 1995, take heart. His new trial, on charges related to what prosecutors contend was a hotel room robbery and kidnapping, begins Monday. And the fact that he was acquitted in the previous case is not necessarily considered an advantage in this one. PAGE A12</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE THIRD-TERM PROBLEM</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Fuel provided by Gov. Sarah Palin has Senator John McCain running neck and neck with Senator Barack Obama in the presidential election, according to most national polls. But how well Mr. McCain handles his relationship with President Bush may matter more. Since ratification in 1951 of the constitutional amendment barring any candidate from winning more than two presidential elections, five nominees have sought to extend their party's control of the White House for a third straight term. Four of them failed. The Caucus, by John Harwood. PAGE A21</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE BATTLE FOR WOMEN</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Male voters might be forgiven for feeling like the afterthoughts in the presidential campaign; evidence abounds of how hard the two camps are battling over women. For openers, consider that after the news programs, ''Oprah'' is the chief recipient of campaign advertisements this year, with Senator John McCain buying more commercial spots on the show in the last month than Senator Barack Obama.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> DAVID FOSTER WALLACE, 46</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> His prodigiously observant, exuberantly plotted, grammatically and etymologically challenging, philosophically probing and culturally hyper-contemporary novels, stories and essays made him an heir to modern virtuosos like Thomas Pynchon and Don DeLillo and a clear influence on younger tour-de-force stylists like Dave Eggers and Jonathan Safran Foer.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> That Actually Turns a Profit</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At a time when public transportation systems around the country are struggling with soaring fuel costs and pinched budgets, the bus system in Rochester is running a surplus and has done something that few others would contemplate: it lowered its single-ride fare. It did so in part by eliminating some low-trafficked routes, avoiding debt and aggressively raising revenue from other sources. PAGE A25 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> RIVERSIDE AFFIRMS NEW PASTOR</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A sharply divided congregation voted to affirm the Rev. Dr. Brad R. Braxton, a Baptist minister and former Rhodes Scholar, as the sixth senior pastor of Riverside Church. Dr. Braxton, 39, follows the long and sometimes fractious tenure of the Rev. Dr. James A. Forbes, the first black senior pastor of the church, who drew criticism from congregants complaining that he neglected Riverside's long tradition of liberal Protestant activism while pouring his energies into increasing black membership.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> MODERN EXPLORERS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In 2003, the federal government sold Governors Island to the state and the city for $1, a price some compared favorably to the one Dutch settlers got it for in 1637: two ax heads, a string of beads and some iron nails. Since then, officials from two agencies have been trying to raise the island's profile, and a growing number of people have been discovering a 172-acre spot 800 yards off the tip of Manhattan.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At Himself for Yankee Woes</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Manager Joe Girardi is more comfortable blaming himself than he is in openly dissecting how and why the Yankees fizzled in this year of the usual high expectations. He would rather say that he takes responsibility for the season, because that is easier than trying to explain why the high-profile offense was feeble, why the rookie pitchers Phil Hughes and Ian Kennedy flopped and why second baseman Robinson Cano and outfielder Melky Cabrera regressed. In fact, the uninspiring season has created questions about Girardi's performance. PAGE D7</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> RUNNER-UP, ANYBODY?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Of course there is still plenty of football left, and on any given day, any team, etc., etc. Oh, and something about one game at a time. But at least for now, before conference play fully kicks in and the potential for upsets, letdowns and surprises looms every week, No. 1 Southern California, having eviscerated the former No. 5 Ohio State, 35-3, has sent an ominous message to the rest of the college football world -- let the race for No. 2 begin.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> HOW A SERIES OF MISTAKES</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Took a Toll on United Shares</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The swift, sharp and short-lived collapse of United Airlines shares last Monday, when investors wiped out $1 billion of the market value of United's parent company within minutes of an erroneous news flash, was followed by a week of finger-pointing. New-media analysts say there is plenty of blame to go around. ''This is what happens when everything goes on autopilot and there are no human controls in place or those controls fail,'' said one new-media executive. PAGE C1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> TEXTBOOK DOWNLOADS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As an option to textbook prices that can easily reach triple figures, some authors and publishers have created Internet versions that allow free or reduced price access to texts. CourseSmart, for example, allows students to subscribe to a textbook and read it online, with the option of highlighting and printing out portions of it. The price is generally half what a book costs. PAGE C3</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> BIRD DELIVERS THE DIRT</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> American political campaigns may be known for their dirt, but when is the last time one of them had a virtual bird dropping a load of excrement on a candidate? Last Monday, the ruling Conservative Party of Canada introduced a Web site, notaleader.ca, that did just that to Stephane Dion, the head of the opposition Liberal Party. And that was just one of the site's odd features. PAGE C3</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> BIGGER, BLURRIER PICTURES</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Many hotel chains, like their guests, are replacing their old picture tube TVs with new L.C.D. or plasma flat screens. But most have not spent the money needed to add high-definition service, resulting in stretched images with lower resolution that provide a picture that looks worse than it would have on a standard picture tube set.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A LEVI'S LOGO</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Harking back to the days when a TV program might be named for a single sponsor (like ''Colgate Comedy Hour''), the Levi's 501 button-fly line of jeans is joining with Logo, a network aimed at gay and lesbian viewers, for a campaign called ''Logo Unbuttoned.'' The title echoes the phrase ''Live Unbuttoned,'' the theme of a worldwide campaign for Levi's 501. PAGE C5</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When Mealtime Is Upon Them</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When finicky eaters can defeat even the most resolute parent, or force one into making just anything, healthy variety can fall by the wayside. A few simple strategies help ease children into new food choices and take the edge off stubbornness at mealtime. Page H2 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> AN OLD REMEDY RE-EMERGES</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When a child exhibited signs of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the doctor recommended an old solution: fish oil. Some doctors who practice integrative medicine have been prescribing this treatment. But with a lack of research, and controversy about abandoning established medications for a home remedy, the approach has been slow to take off. Page H2 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> EXERCISES IN SELF-POSSESSION</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Poor impulse control might be one way to describe the behavior of your average toddler. It can be hard to keep up with brains that show new changes almost daily. But scientists believe that certain cognitive exercises can help accelerate the path to self-possession and control, what researchers are calling executive function. They also believe the skills are more closely related to school success than I.Q. is. Page H4 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> GEE, DISCIPLINE'S HARD</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A survey of 2,100 parents showed that 1 in 3 believed they could not effectively discipline their children. But what is effective discipline? The confusion may come from the belief that it is primarily the meting out of punishment and consequences, but both can reinforce bad behavior. Instead, positive reinforcement when children are being good can be more effective. Page H5 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Is Charged With a Herculean Task</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The days of Learjets and luxury hotel visits are over for the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, which was nearly run into the ground financially. Its new secretary, G. Wayne Clough, has to do more than abstain from such extravagances. He has to whip the institution's multiple museums, galleries and research centers into a tightly run machine.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A GUITAR WITH ROCK-STAR STATUS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Fender Jazzmaster was largely ignored by the people it was meant to appeal to. But it was embraced by plenty of others, including Elvis Costello, and Johnny Marr of the Smiths. A recent gig at the Knitting Factory to celebrate the instrument's 50th birthday featured the college-radio guitar heroes like Tom Verlaine of Television and J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr. Page E5 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Seven years after terrorist attacks destroyed the World Trade Center towers, it is clear that many workers who responded to the crisis are suffering lingering effects from breathing in toxic dust and fumes. What is less clear is how well the nation will treat those whose health problems are still emerging or yet to be seen. Page A24</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> GAMBLING WITH MEDICAID</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Rhode Island is seeking a federal waiver to change much of its Medicaid program from an open-ended entitlement with no limit on spending to a capped budget with fixed expenditure limits. Prudent leaders would be wise to watch what happens before following this path. Page A24</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Is 2008 just a strange year, or is something big happening? Are we seeing one of America's periodic political and cultural awakenings, one of our occasional, almost-convulsive democratic reactions to what is felt to be too great a distance between the people and their ''establishments''?
