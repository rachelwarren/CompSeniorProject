  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">STERLING HEIGHTS, Mich. -- Hundreds of times in the past three weeks, cable television viewers here have been the exclusive audience for two of the roughest advertisements of the political season.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">One links Senator Barack Obama to the former mayor of Detroit, Kwame M. Kilpatrick, an African-American whose political career unraveled in scandal. The other features Mr. Obama's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A Wright Jr., also black, and his now infamous sermon marked by the words ''God damn America.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The advertisements, from a political action committee that is not connected to Senator John McCain's presidential campaign, are running only here, in Macomb County, heavily populated by white, unionized auto workers, once considered ''Reagan Democrats,'' whose votes could largely determine which candidate wins Michigan, a state vital to both sides.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The advertisements point up the unusual nature of this year's more potentially pernicious political attacks: They are not coming with the loud, nationally recognized cannon blast of the type launched by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth against Senator John Kerry in 2004, but, rather, as more stealthy, narrowly aimed rifle shots from smaller groups armed with incendiary material. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. McCain has at times been a target of over-the-top attacks from outside groups, such as a recent advertisement from the liberal group Brave New Pac, based in California, that suggested his time in a Vietnamese prison ill-affected his ability to be president; the Internet was filled with various unsubstantiated and discredited rumors about his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, immediately after he named her last month.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the more explosive charges from outside groups against Mr. Obama have often drawn closer scrutiny this year for their volume and the cultural and racial sensitivities they tend to touch, and, occasionally, seek to exploit.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Mr. Obama's case, the messages have frequently sought to paint him as foreign, like the chain e-mail messages sent for months to Jewish areas of Florida, suburban Philadelphia and other swing states that portray Mr. Obama as Muslim (he is Christian). This week, a hate group calling itself the League of American Patriots distributed fliers to as many as 50 homes in Roxbury, a mostly white town in northern New Jersey, portraying Mr. Obama as Osama Bin Laden and including language that was derisive of black people.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, said the fliers, initially reported by The Star-Ledger in Newark, were the first overtly racist printed tracts of their kind this election season.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The advertisements running here against Mr. Obama come from a group called Freedom's Defense Fund, a political action committee based in Washington that was formed four years ago and raises money from conservatives around the country. The advertisements have stood out because of the group's connections -- including to its paid consultant, Jerome S. Corsi, the author of the highly negative, largely discredited political biography of Mr. Obama, ''Obama Nation'' -- and what local critics say are their racial overtones.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">''That's all they are -- race oriented,'' said Ed Bruley, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Macomb. ''I think some people will be affected by it, others will see it for what it is.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It is a view shared by Democratic leaders, including Gov. Jennifer Granholm, who, in a recent interview with MSNBC, said of the advertising campaign, ''The fact that it is being run in a predominantly white suburb tells you that there is an explicit effort to try to divide people by race.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Todd Zirkle, the executive director of Freedom's Defense Fund, said race had ''zero'' to do with the spots. ''That's the standard retort when you want to say 'Don't listen to these people,' '' Mr. Zirkle said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He said the group's intention was to show Mr. Obama's affiliations -- although Mr. Obama and Mr. Kilpatrick were never known to be close.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He said coming spots would highlight Mr. Obama's ties to two white men, the developer Antoin Rezko, a former financial backer of Mr. Obama's who has been convicted of fraud, and to the Weather Underground founder William Ayers, with whom Mr. Obama worked on an education commission in Illinois and whose past Mr. Obama has repudiated.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Zirkle said a fifth spot would highlight Mr. Obama's supposed support for the Kenyan prime minister, the opposition leader Raila Odinga. Mr. Zirkle did not share that script, but Mr. Corsi's book asserts, without substantiation, that Mr. Obama has been a close supporter of the African leader. Mr. Obama remained neutral in the Kenyan elections.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Officials with Freedom's Defense Fund, which gives Mr. Corsi's book to its donors, said they paid Mr. Corsi only to help write fund-raising appeals. Federal returns show he was paid $15,000 as a fund-raising consultant. But the details of his book provide a thread that runs through several of the anti-Obama groups.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">One of them is the National Campaign Fund, a group directed by Floyd Brown, who produced the Willie Horton attack ads against Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts in the 1988 race. An advertisement Mr. Brown hopes to run against Mr. Obama this fall -- and now on his group's Web site -- cites Mr. Corsi's book in trying to paint Mr. Obama as a Muslim.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Brown said in an interview that he had spoken with Mr. Corsi, whom he said he has known ''for years,'' but Mr. Corsi is not listed as a formal consultant. Federal filings show that Mr. Brown's group has spent more than $60,000 for a direct mail campaign, the content of which he would not share.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Disputed claims that Mr. Corsi has made about Mr. Obama's abortion stance have dovetailed with those of a group that recently ran a commercial in Dayton, Ohio, accusing Mr. Obama of supporting ''infanticide'' (he does not).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The group, the Black Republican PAC, has several connections to the Freedom Defense Fund. They share the same treasurer, Scott B. MacKenzie, who had also worked on Ronald Reagan's presidential campaigns in 1980 and 1984, as well as those of Jack Kemp and Patrick J. Buchanan. Mr. MacKenzie's office is located in the direct mail firm working with both groups, BMW Direct, whose chief operating officer, Michael Centanni, is also the chairman of the defense fund.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Centanni said he has no connection to Mr. McCain's campaign. He said Freedom's Defense Fund, with relatively scant resources to spread nationally, decided it could have the most impact by focusing its presidential efforts here for tens of thousands.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">''We feel Obama can't win the presidency without Michigan and he can't win Michigan without Macomb,'' he said. ''We're relatively small, but we're trying to be effective and relevant.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bill Burton, a spokesman for Mr. Obama, said, ''Considering that these ads have only run on television a couple of times, this group is getting a wealth of attention it would otherwise never get just by this article appearing in The New York Times.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Macomb is where the Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg helped define the term ''Reagan Democrat'' in the mid-1980s, conducting a series of polls to conclude that white, unionized workers came to believe Democrats had abandoned them for, in part, the poor and African-Americans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Greenberg returned this year with his Democratic advocacy group, Democracy Corps, to find that racial attitudes among white workers had grown less hostile, though concerns had not disappeared.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Union officials have worked to dispel those concerns. Waiting in a car outside a Dollar Store here, a retired auto worker named Angie Christel, 78, who is white, said the union had dismissed for her the notion that Mr. Obama was Muslim. ''I thought he was Muslim until I got the letter in the mail,'' Ms. Christel said, ''and he was raised by all white people.''</span></p>
