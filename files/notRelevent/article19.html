  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There are no awards for the season's slimiest political messages (Swift Boat statuettes?), but two deserve consideration in the character assassination category. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In the first, Republicans in Pennsylvania flooded 75,000 Jewish voters with an e-mail alarum from a retired Jewish judge equating a vote for Barack Obama with the ''tragic mistake'' of Jews who ignored the warning signs of the Holocaust. Quick apologies and retractions were offered once this surfaced in the press, but too late for the unspeakable to be spiked. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In the second, the campaign of Senator Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina, who is in a very tight race, broadcast her desperation by attacking her opponent, State Senator Kay Hagan, for accepting ''godless money'' at a ''secret'' fund-raiser whose hosts included a leader of a secularist group. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At the end, the TV screen fills with a shadowy photo of Ms. Hagan, an elder at her Christian church, as a female voice fairly shrieks: ''There is no God!'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Then there is the fringe madness of ''Letter from 2012 in Obama's America'' -- an apocalyptic fiction making the rounds from the conservative Christian group Focus on the Family Action. It foresees an Obama incumbency marked by terrorist attacks on American cities, rampant crime as guns are confiscated, a nuclear attack on Israel and the Boy Scouts' disbanding to avoid court-empowered gay leaders. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It seems just another straight-line for Jon Stewart until the nation remembers that the group's leader is James Dobson. He is one of the most prominent leaders on the evangelical right, with an audience measured in the scores of millions. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Democrats have their share of slimy ads, like one targeted at the elderly that falsely claims John McCain would cut Social Security benefits in half. We're not excusing that ad or any other policy distortions. But frankly, it's not even an also-ran compared with what the McCain campaign and its allies have been up to. </span></p>
