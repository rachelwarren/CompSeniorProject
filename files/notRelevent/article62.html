  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It must be more than a bit discouraging for Republicans to see some of their medium-size names jumping ship and embracing Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It started in the pundit world, with the likes of David Brooks, Kathleen Parker and David Frum ripping Sarah Palin as unqualified, and Christopher Buckley actually taking the leap to endorse Obama. Then we had the Colin Powell bombshell on &quot;Meet the Press.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now there's been a steady trickle of GOPers -- William Weld, Ken Adelman, Charles Fried, Scott McClellan, Mac Mathias, John Chafee, Susan Eisenhower -- saying they cannot bring themselves to support John McCain and are going with his Democratic rival. Some are moderates, but others are certified Reaganauts. They have seen a quality in Obama that has prompted them to back the man whom their party's nominee is attacking daily as a risky, untested near-socialist who pals around with terrorists. (The right-leaning Economist just backed him as well.) </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I take this with several grains of salt. It's not like the rise of the Reagan Democrats; the numbers are, for now, too small. And there may be a bit of bandwagon-jumping here. It's not exactly a profile in courage to embrace the leading candidate a week before Election Day. If Obama was so inspiring, why didn't these folks make their move a couple of months ago, when the race was tied?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But it's not nothing. It indicates that Obama's candidacy, with its talk of post-partisanship and its inherently historic nature, has a certain cross-party appeal. Of course, an Obama administration, if there is one, could bitterly disappoint conservatives. Or he could tack to the center and disappoint his liberal base. That's the thing about winning an election--then you've got to deliver.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The defectors get no respect from Noah Pollak in Commentary:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It might be more accurate to call the Obamacons something like 'Obamatunists.' It makes life much easier in Washington to have been counted as a supporter of the incumbent administration, especially when a side benefit of having switched sides is to be lavished with media attention and hailed as a great visionary. I doubt more than one or two of these characters would have announced for Obama if his and McCain's polling numbers were reversed. Would Colin Powell have done so? Unthinkable.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Jonah Goldberg says these folks are destined to be disappointed:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The Obamacons have reached sufficient voice and number to be more than the 'statistical noise' you get every election year. That said, I would still say that while the phenomenon isn't entirely phony, I have a very hard time saying the same thing about the arguments the Obamacons use. I think the idea that there would be much that is recognizably conservative in an Obama presidency is absurd.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Andrew Sullivan hits back at the Pollak posting:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Oh, please. Some of us anti-Bush conservatives took a stand five years ago and were not exactly hailed a great visionaries by anyone. And many of the criticism we made in 2003 -- fiscal recklessness, massive spending, dreadful war management, legalizing torture -- have subsequently been vindicated even by many now supporting McCain. There are many, good conservative reasons to back Obama this time. . . . Maybe if the partisan right had addressed the conservative critique of Bush-Cheney substantively five years ago, the conservative movement would not now be in a state of near-collapse.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Another conservative who's off the reservation is George Will, who says Tuesday will bring the &quot;probable repudiation of the Republican Party&quot;:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Some polls show that Palin has become an even heavier weight in John McCain's saddle than his association with George W. Bush. Did McCain, who seems to think that Palin's never having attended a 'Georgetown cocktail party' is sufficient qualification for the vice presidency, lift an eyebrow when she said that vice presidents 'are in charge of the United States Senate'? . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Palin may be an inveterate simplifier; McCain has a history of reducing controversies to cartoons. A Republican financial expert recalls attending a dinner with McCain for the purpose of discussing with him domestic and international financial complexities that clearly did not fascinate the senator. As the dinner ended, McCain's question for his briefer was: 'So, who is the villain? &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So, who's gonna win? Still an open question, says Karl Rove:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The last national poll that showed Mr. McCain ahead came out Sept. 25 and the 232 polls since then have all shown Mr. Obama leading. Only one time in the past 14 presidential elections has a candidate won the popular vote and the Electoral College after trailing in the Gallup Poll the week before the election: Ronald Reagan in 1980.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;But the question that matters is the margin. If Mr. McCain is down by 3%, his task is doable, if difficult. If he's down by 9%, his task is essentially impossible. In truth, however, no one knows for sure what kind of polling deficit is insurmountable or even which poll is correct.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Is McCain -- What is the technical term? &quot; Crazy&quot; -- to think he can win?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The McCain campaign is somewhere between self-delusion and truth,&quot; says Slate's John Dickerson.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The landscape looks pretty bleak. A flood of public polls show that McCain is down in several important, traditionally Republican states. The news organizations and analysts that have reported and sifted the numbers guess that, at the moment, Obama would garner upward of 310 electoral votes by winning not only all the states John Kerry won but also Ohio, Virginia, and several other states that went for Bush in 2004.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;In McCain's most optimistic scenario, he loses a few Republican states like New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado, and Iowa. He just has to hope that he doesn't lose too many of them. (Losing a biggie like Florida or Ohio would be curtains.) He could make up for a small loss of GOP states with a victory in Pennsylvania or New Hampshire.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;How do McCain aides get around this dire picture without the aid of strong drink? Let's just say that McCain's campaign now relies on hope more than Obama's does. They hope that the Obama organization isn't as impressive as signs suggest it is. They hope that the greater enthusiasm apparent among Democrats turns out to be less than advertised on Election Day. They hope that the public polls that show a big Obama lead are poorly designed, overstating participation by young voters and African-Americans. They hope undecided voters will all break to McCain in the end.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Latest tracks: WP, Obama 52-44; Gallup, 51-44; Fox, 47-44.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And this is becoming a familiar theme, from the New York Times:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;All told, 59 percent of voters surveyed said Ms. Palin was not prepared for the job, up nine percentage points since the beginning of the month. Nearly a third of voters polled said the vice-presidential selection would be a major factor influencing their vote for president, and those voters broadly favor Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;And in a possible indication that the choice of Ms. Palin has hurt Mr. McCain's image, voters said they had much more confidence in Mr. Obama to pick qualified people for his administration than they did in Mr. McCain.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The NYT/CBS margin: 51-40, Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">More reviews coming in on the infomercial (seen by 33 million folks, by the way). The New Republic's Eve Fairbanks notes, as I did, that O impersonated an MSM person:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Obama, who's presented himself as so many things this campaign cycle -- activist hero, writer, celebrity -- transformed himself into yet another character: the journalistic chronicler.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;In between the standard-fare bits, Obama channeled a Katie Couric vibe, gently relating other people's stories exactly like a soft-news anchor does. Most man-on-the-street campaign ads let their men on the street speak entirely for themselves; instead, Obama narrated some of the details he'd learned about various worried people he'd met on the trail himself: 'Ten years ago she bought a house outside the city' (Rebecca Johnston) . . . 'Every morning, she's up before the sun' (Juliana Sanchez) . . . and so on. The stories -- and the details of their lives that Obama lingered over -- were small, even mundane, unlike the pathos-filled heroics of the Everyman figures John Edwards or Hillary used to talk about.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But a definite thumbs-down from National Review's Mark Steyn:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The show itself was slick only in a drearily generic way. The waving wheat and music made it seem like a standard campaign commercial, only longer -- 'It's Morning, Noon And Night In America,' which is a big enough problem thanks to the media's Obama cultists without the candidate himself piling on. As for the King Barack Meets [Insert Name Of Downtrodden Subject Here] stuff, aside from the fact that I don't recognize the hellhole this country apparently is, there's something faintly ridiculous in doing it in the middle of the Phillies winning the World Series . . . And then The Daily Show kibbitzing stepped all over the infomercial even more.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Since the chattering class is chattering about whether David Axelrod will leave Chicago for a big White House job, former Bush/McCain adviser Mark McKinnon counsels that he Just Say No:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's almost impossible to resist the temptation and seductive power of taking part in a new administration. But let me offer you the same advice Paul Begala offered me eight years ago: Don't do it. If you do, you will likely regret it. You will sacrifice the life you know for one that will leave you exhausted, frustrated, and potentially penniless (after you pay all your legal bills). And you'll find it maddening and depressing to discover just how difficult it is to make something happen when you're dealing with the federal bureaucracy. Ain't like the campaign world you're used to, where you can wake up with an idea and get it done by the 6:00 p.m. news.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Most importantly, you will lose the special and unique quality of the relationship you once had with your friend and former client because, once you become part of the White House staff, you ultimately will be treated like staff. It's just part of the hierarchical nature of the White House. Everyone is staff. No one is a pal.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now there's talk that Rahm Emanuel might be Obama's chief of staff. Though I can't imagine, since he's already been a top White House official, why he'd want to give up his House seat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sign of things to come: Sarah Palin calendars.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amazing: four days out, and the chatter is still about Palin. Roger Simon still can't fathom the choice:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Who chose to put this 'whack job' on the ticket? Wasn't it John McCain? And wasn't it his first presidential-level decision? And if you are a 72-year-old presidential candidate, wouldn't you expect that your running mate's fitness for high office would come under a little extra scrutiny? And, therefore, wouldn't you make your selection with care? (To say nothing about caring about the future of the nation?) McCain didn't seem to care that much. McCain admitted recently on national TV that he 'didn't know her well at all' before he chose Palin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;But why not? Why didn't he get to know her better before he made his choice? It's not like he was rushed. McCain wrapped up the Republican nomination in early March. He didn't announce his choice for a running mate until late August. Wasn't that enough time for McCain to get to know Palin? Wasn't that enough time for his crackerjack 'vetters' to investigate Palin's strengths and weaknesses, check through records and published accounts, talk to a few people, and learn that she was not only a diva but a whack job diva? . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Is she really a diva and a whack job? Could be. There are quite a few in politics. (And a few in journalism, too, though in journalism they are called 'columnists.')&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ba-da-bump.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Is Palin admitting she has 2012 ambitions? Ed Morrissey says an ABC interview has been widely misinterpreted:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot; 'ELIZABETH VARGAS: If it doesn't go your way on Tuesday . . . 2012?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">'GOV SARAH PALIN: I'm just . . . thinkin' that it's gonna go our way on Tuesday, November 4. I truly believe that the wisdom of . . . of the people will be revealed on that day. As they enter that voting booth, they will understand the stark contrast between the two tickets . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">'VARGAS: But the point being that you haven't been so bruised by some of the double standard, the sexism on the campaign trail, to say, 'I've had it. I'm going back to Alaska.'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">'PALIN: Absolutely not. I think that, if I were to give up and wave a white flag of surrender against some of the political shots that we've taken, that . . . that would . . . bring this whole . . . I'm not doin' this for naught.'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Eh. They're trying to spin that last bit as though the VP run is just a vehicle but it reads more to me like, 'I won't give my critics the satisfaction of seeing me slink home with my tail between my legs.' It's a statement of defiance, in other words, not ambition.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And here's someone willing to say a nice word about the Alaska governor. Elaine Lafferty, the former editor of Ms., vouches for Palin:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's difficult not to froth when one reads, as I did again and again this week, doubts about Sarah Palin's 'intelligence,' coming especially from women such as PBS's Bonnie Erbe, who, as near as I recall, has not herself heretofore been burdened with the Susan Sontag of Journalism moniker. As Fred Barnes -- God help me, I'm agreeing with Fred Barnes -- suggests in the Weekly Standard, these high toned and authoritative dismissals come from people who have never met or spoken with Sarah Palin. Those who know her, love her or hate her, offer no such criticism. They know what I know, and I learned it from spending just a little time traveling on the cramped campaign plane this week: Sarah Palin is very smart. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Palin is more than a 'quick study'; I'd heard rumors around the campaign of her photographic memory and, frankly, I watched it in action. She sees. She processes. She questions, and only then, she acts. What is often called her 'confidence' is actually a rarity in national politics: I saw a woman who knows exactly who she is.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What a bold stance! From a journalist! And she -- oh wait. Lafferty is now a consultant to the McCain-Palin campaign.</span></p>
