  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Behind the fancy speeches, grand promises and TV special lies the truth: With crises at home and abroad, Barack Obama lacks the experience America needs. And it shows. His response to our economic crisis is to spend and tax our economy deeper into recession. The fact is, Barack Obama's not ready -- yet.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ANALYSIS </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The most telling word in this John McCain&nbsp;ad is the last one: &quot;yet.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By charging that Barack Obama is not experienced enough to lead the country -- yet -- the McCain camp is making an appeal to those who would like to see Obama in the White House one day but have qualms about his thin national r&Atilde;&copy;sum&Atilde;&copy;. The implicit suggestion is that the Navy veteran is the safe choice while the former community organizer from Chicago should be given time to become a more seasoned leader.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The commercial reprises the theme of McCain's Paris Hilton ad this summer -- which mocked Obama as a celebrity -- by showing rapid images of the senator from Illinois speaking to huge crowds, in one instance before the Greek columns erected for his Democratic convention speech. This gives way to grim images of a boarded-up house, unsold cars and a depressed-looking woman with her daughter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The spot is also an attempt to blunt what it calls the &quot;TV special,&quot; the unusual 30-minute Obama infomercial that aired last night.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The accusation that Obama would tax the country into a deep recession is misleading, as were previous McCain ads, because Obama proposes to increase taxes only on those earning more than $250,000, while cutting rates for 95 percent of taxpayers. Obama is pushing major spending programs, such as one to extend health insurance, but insists that his budget pays for them. The commercial uses pictures instead to help depict Obama as a tax-and-spend liberal, a standard Republican charge that has become McCain's closing argument.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What's not clear is whether the novel argument that Obama might be ready someday, but not now, will prove persuasive with wavering voters.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His choice? [Footage of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin winking]</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On November 4th, You Get to Make Yours</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ANALYSIS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This Barack Obama&nbsp;ad is a complete departure from a two-month strategy of largely ignoring John McCain's running mate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By showing the briefest snippet of Sarah Palin winking, the commercial tries to convey that she is too frivolous to be vice president or a potential president -- all without a spoken word from a narrator. In an apparent effort to avoid a backlash over criticizing a female candidate, the ad frames the choice of the rookie Alaska governor entirely as a matter of McCain's judgment.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Since Aug. 29, when the senator from Arizona unveiled Palin as his choice, Obama (and running mate Joseph R. Biden Jr.) has carefully described her as a competent politician in an effort to avoid having the Democratic nominee run against the No. 2 candidate, who happens to be a woman. This ad is surprising because Obama is ahead in the polls in this final week and has no urgent need to make Palin the issue.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But with some polls showing that a majority of Americans regard her as unqualified to be vice president, the commercial deftly uses McCain's own words to tie his past admissions of uncertainty on the economy -- the overriding issue in this campaign -- to the choice of the increasingly controversial Palin. She is used as a visual punch line to discredit the man who chose her.</span></p>
