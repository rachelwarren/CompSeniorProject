  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A look at the claims made by Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama at the third and final presidential debate Wednesday:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tax cuts</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The claim: Obama said his tax plan offers three times the tax relief as McCain's plan does for the middle class.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The facts: The non-partisan Tax Policy Center shows that is the case for the first year of Obama's plan, but not over the long haul, and only for a narrow slice of the &quot;middle class&quot; -- those making between $37,595 and $66,354. The group says Obama's plan would save those families $1,042 in the first year, compared with McCain's $319. In later years, the difference is not nearly as great. In 2012, the last year of the next president's term, the difference is smaller: a $2,197 tax cut under Obama's plan, compared with $1,441 under McCain's. And for people earning more but who still consider themselves middle class -- those earning up to $112,000 -- Obama's plan would cut their tax bill by $1,264 in 2009, McCain's plan by $994. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Iraq</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The claim: McCain said Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden had proposed dividing Iraq into three countries. He called it a &quot;cockamamie idea.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The facts: In 2006, Biden, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, proposed partitioning Iraq into three regions -- Kurdish, Shiite Arab and Sunni Arab -- with a central government in Baghdad. He said it would &quot;maintain a united Iraq by decentralizing it, giving each ethno-religious group ... room to run its own affairs, while leaving the central government in charge of common interests.&quot; He did not propose that it become three separate countries.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Negative advertising</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The claim: Obama said McCain's television advertisements have been &quot;100% negative.&quot; McCain denied it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The facts: Obama's claim apparently was based on an analysis released Oct. 8 by the Wisconsin Advertising Project at the University of Wisconsin. The report said, &quot;During the week of Sept. 28-Oct. 4, nearly 100% of the McCain campaign's advertisements were negative. During the same period, 34% of the Obama campaign's ads were negative.&quot; The report also said that, overall, 73% of McCain's ads and 61% of Obama's have been negative. The study used information obtained from TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group, which analyzes data on the airing of every presidential ad in the top 186 TV markets in the country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's health care plan</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The claim: In discussing his $5,000-per-family tax credit for health care, McCain said the average cost of a health care plan is $5,800.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The facts: The average cost of a family plan purchased by employers this year hit a new high, $12,106, according to an annual survey of nearly 2,000 employers by the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation, a research group based in Menlo Park, Calif. Individual coverage premiums averaged $4,479.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's health care plan</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The claim: McCain said that under Obama's health care plan, a small business could be fined for not offering coverage to its employees.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The facts: The key to this charge is what defines a &quot;small&quot; business, and the Obama campaign has not said. Obama has said he would exempt small businesses from having to contribute to their employees' health coverage or pay into a national fund. He has not, however, said what size company he has in mind for the exemption. In August, Obama adviser Jason Furman said companies with 10 or fewer employees would likely be exempted, but he did not limit it to that size. Obama has not said how he would enforce his requirement that parents get coverage for their children. <br /></span></p>
