  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Friday, Senator Barack Obama's campaign began broadcasting two commercials here, in a sign of its renewed hopes that Georgia could be truly competitive in this election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It was a swift turnaround. The campaign initially had Georgia on its wish list, but just two months ago, it went off the air here and moved out some of its paid staff members. Senator John McCain's campaign, meanwhile, treated Georgia as an automatic win. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But then came the reports from early polling stations: people were waiting more than four hours in some places to cast their ballots, and 35 percent of them were black. By the time early voting closed on Friday, more than 1.7 million of Georgia's 5.6 million registered voters had cast their ballots, and many of them were in left-leaning urban counties in and around Atlanta, where support for Mr. Obama is at a fever pitch.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I feel like this is the year out of every other year in history that Georgia could go for a Democrat,'' said Triniece Britt, a client relations manager at a mortgage company and an Obama supporter, who was waiting in a four-hour line to vote on Friday ''People are hungry for something different. People want change so bad that they'll wait as long it takes.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Polls still show Mr. McCain leading. But what remains to be seen is the demographics of the turnout on Election Day. Analysts are not certain if it will be overwhelmingly white, or if it will more closely mirror the demographics of the electorate, which is 29 percent black, keeping black turnout high.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''If it's anything close to 30 percent in the end, that would give Obama a big chance,'' said Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Long lines at early polling stations have also raised concerns that the voting system is not equipped to handle an expected surge on Tuesday. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Matt Towery, a Republican political consultant and pollster, said he would not be surprised if the margin of victory in Georgia came down to 10,000 or 20,000 votes -- well within battleground range. Just six years ago, he noted, the state was controlled by Democrats, but lately the party's base has not turned out.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Because Barack Obama is running, he has brought that Democratic voting base back out,'' Mr. Towery said. ''If Georgia votes at full strength, then it's a highly competitive state.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He added, ''You cannot be the fastest-growing state in the nation for African-American population and be drifting to become a massively Republican red state.''</span></p>
