  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Senators Barack Obama and John McCain each cite the mess at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as a consequence of the corrosive coziness of lobbyists and politicians that they promise to end. But each man and his party also have ties to the fallen giants that will complicate the next president's job of reshaping the mortgage finance companies that have been essential to the economy. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Republican nominee, Mr. McCain of Arizona, has numerous close relationships with and contributions from current and former company lobbyists. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama, his Democratic rival from Illinois, is second among members of Congress in donations from the firms' employees and political action committees.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Beyond the antilobbyist message, Mr. Obama also indicts the Bush administration and the Republicans who controlled Congress for a dozen years until 2007, including Mr. McCain. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He blames them for lax regulation that freed the companies to go deep into debt to buy the mortgages that crushed them as the housing crisis persisted. Yet his fellow Democrats in Congress have been well known as enablers of the two companies for years, protecting the firms' dueling responsibilities to support affordable housing as well as to maximize shareholder profits.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> For all their outrage now, neither Mr. Obama, with less than four years in the Senate, and Mr. McCain, after a quarter-century in the House and Senate, has a record of directly challenging the companies. Mr. Obama did warn publicly of a coming housing crisis in March 2007, five months before it erupted and the government first took action. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Several former company executives, as well as current and former Senate Republican staff members, said Mr. McCain seemed to avoid matters related to the financial industry after the last major financial crisis -- the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s. He was one of the ''Keating Five'' senators investigated by the Senate, accused of interceding with federal regulators for the operator of a failing thrift. Mr. McCain received a rebuke. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> More than Mr. Obama, Mr. McCain's circle of advisers and contributors includes current and former lobbyists or directors for the companies, although since July he has called for a ban on any lobbying by the two firms. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Among the companies' past advocates are Mr. McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, a longtime lobbyist; Mr. McCain's confidant and adviser Charlie Black, whose firm worked for Freddie Mac for several years ending in 2005, and the deputy campaign finance chairman, Wayne L. Berman, a vice president for Ogilvy Worldwide and a former Fannie Mae lobbyist.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Davis previously was head of the Homeownership Alliance, a coalition of banks and housing industry interests led by Fannie and Freddie to stave off regulations. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The group was formed to counter another organization, FM Watch, an alliance of financial institutions and lobbying associations that wanted to even the playing field against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, by challenging the implicit government guarantee that allowed the two firms to borrow funds at lower interest rates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Six members of the Republican lobbying firm Fierce Isakowitz &amp; Blalock, all Fannie Mae lobbyists, have given Mr. McCain $13,250, records show. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The New York investor Geoffrey T. Boisi, a member of Freddie Mac's board, contributed more than $70,000 to Mr. McCain and Republican Party committees working for his election. Both he and Richard F. Hohlt, a Fannie Mae lobbyist, are among the McCain ''bundlers'' who have raised $100,000 to $250,000 from others, according to the campaign Web site.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Both candidates' vetters for their vice presidential picks have links to Fannie. The former chairman, James Johnson, initially led Mr. Obama's search committee, but stepped aside after a controversy over favorable loan terms he received from another firm. Mr. McCain's vetter, Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr., was a past Fannie lobbyist.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama's contributors include the Freddie Mac senior vice president Robert Y. Tsien and the directors William M. Lewis Jr., a banker at Lazard, and the Chicago businesswoman Brenda J. Gaines. He does not accept contributions from lobbyists, but Mr. Obama has been a favorite of Fannie Mae employees and their political action committee, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He was second only to the Senate Banking Committee chairman, Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat, in contributions from the two firms' employees and PACs since 1998, the analysis found, even though Mr. Obama has been in the Senate only since 2005. While the two firms have long been careful to hire from and contribute to both parties, generally Fannie Mae has favored Democrats and Freddie Mac the Republicans. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The center said he received $122,850, of which $101,150 was from Fannie Mae. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Until now, the companies were among the capital's lobbying powerhouses -- hiring former members of Congress, administration officials and top staff members as in-house lobbyists, contracting with outside lobbying firms, and sprinkling development projects and charitable contributions among Congressional districts. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> With the Treasury's action over the weekend putting Fannie and Freddie in government conservatorships, the issue of what went wrong and how to fix them has intruded into the presidential campaign. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain wants to see the companies carved up and privatized, as commercial lenders have long sought. Phil Gramm, Mr. McCain's friend and longtime adviser, also took that position when he was the Senate Banking Committee chairman in the late 1990s to 2003. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama's comments signal a preference for the sort of public-private hybrid that Fannie and Freddie were, but with tighter controls. The firms, until now, were shareholder-owned and highly profitable, but chartered by the government and backed by an implicit government guarantee that is now explicit.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Both senators issued statements supporting Treasury's seizure. And both increased the populist rhetoric in their competition to be seen as an agent of change. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain attributed the companies' troubles to ''cronyism, special interest lobbyists and executives making millions of dollars a year while things were going downhill.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama, in Ohio on Tuesday, said he would oppose any golden parachutes for the companies' ousted executives. ''Any action with respect to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac needs to put taxpayers first and can't under any circumstances bail out shareholders or senior management of those companies,'' he said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He sent a letter late Monday to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and James B. Lockhart, the companies' conservator, seeking clarification that the bailout would not provide ''a windfall'' to ousted executives. </span></p>
