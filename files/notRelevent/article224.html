  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Need advice about what to do with your investments during this turbulent time? In that case, you should probably avoid Paul Farhi's weekly chat about TV, radio, advertising and all things popular culture, where it's always a bull market.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This week: Rating the presidential candidate impersonators. Join Farhi was online Tuesday, Oct. 14, at 1 p.m. ET to discuss this and much more of whatever's on the political and pop culture landscape.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A transcript follows.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Farhi is a reporter in The Post's Style section, writing about media and popular culture. He's been watching TV and listening to the radio since &quot;The Monkees&quot; were in first run and Adam West was a star. Born in Brooklyn and raised in Los Angeles, Farhi had brief stints in the movie business (as an usher at the Picwood Theater), and in the auto industry (rental car lot guy) before devoting himself full-time to word processing. His car has 15 radio pre-sets and his cable system has 500 channels. He vows to use all of them for good instead of evil. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Greetings, all, and welcome back....Last week's very, shall we say, &quot;eclectic&quot; chat, got me to thinking about our other, extremely visible candidate impersonations--Fred Armisen as Obama and Darrell Hammond as McCain. I'll reserve my own judgement here while soliciting yours. Getting the job done or no? As you may recall, there was a bit of a flap about Armisen, who is of Caucasian and Asian descent, playing a candidate who is of black and white parentage. But I'm not talking about that--I'm talking about the quality(ies) of the impressions themselves. Any thoughts out there?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Meanwhile, I am also pleased to report that we here in the Mainstream Media are giving equal time to happy-face floor trader photos (at least we did yesterday, on a 900-plus point gain in the stock market) as we have been giving to sad-face floor trader photos. That's what we journalists like to call balance!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Of course, if the economic news goes to heck again, look for more sad-face stuff.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let's go to the phones...</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McPherson: Paul: I listen to WTOP a lot and hear ads from Chris Core pushing everything from windows to body scans. Who is Chris Core? I'm sure he has creditability with some, but he's pushing so many different products that I tune out when his commercials run. Love the chats!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Chris Core is a longtime local radio talk-show host who has, presumably, built up some credibility and a loyal following in his 30-plus years as a local radio talk-show host. Of course, he built up that credibility and presumed loyal following on a station OTHER than WTOP (WMAL, to be exact). But who's quibbling?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ballston Dude: Why do reporters walk toward the camera when they start a segment?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They even walk out of a corner to the camera.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I think because it shows &quot;dynamism,&quot; the idea that the news is &quot;always on the move&quot; and so are the reporters who bring it to you. It also probably shows that the story the reporter is reporting is &quot;static&quot;--i.e., boring--and the reporter has to become &quot;dynamic&quot; to create the illusion that something is happening. Even if it isn't.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hey, it's TV.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Radio Ratings Device Flawed, Stations Say ( Post, Oct. 1)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">People Meters: Funny, isn't it? Every time a more precise methodology is employed, those being measured protest because they can't defend thirty (seventy?) years of lying to their advertisers about the size of their audiences.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I've been selling advertising for fifteen years, across all kinds of electronic and print media, and the only thing advertisers care about is being told the truth about delivery so they can plan their campaigns.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Radio sales reps in particular have been exaggerating their numbers for years, because radio has always been the most difficult to measure vs. print circulation or even cable subscribers. Gonna be a tough budget season for some folks at Clear Channel...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: The diary method for collecting radio ratings has always seemed like the most slipshod, throw-a-dart means of measuring an audience ever (for those unfamiliar: Radio ratings have been collected for decades by recruiting sample audiences, handing them diaries, and telling them to write down what they listened to over the course of a week). I mean, how many buttons did you press in the car on the way to work today? And you're going to remember what you listened to several days later? No way. And radio stations and advertisers know it. But: the diary method was the only game in town. Arbitron is a monopoly, and there wasn't a better way to do it. Now there is--the people meter, which electronically/automatically records all your button-popping ways. Arbitron DOES need to ensure that it's sample is fair, but there's no doubt that it's theoretically a better way to end the fiction that radio audiences were being fairly measured.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">SNL Impersonations: Darrell Hammond is the very definition of versatile. He has nailed Clinton, Gore, Cheney and now McCain. His performance on Thursday night's special was spot-on, particularly the vacant roaming of the stage while Obama spoke (and his referring to Obama as &quot;pee pants over there&quot; -- oh my...).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Thought that was hilarious, too. Has Armisen (or really the SNL writers) gotten a similar comedic take on Obama? I can't think of a &quot;defining&quot; joke about him yet...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Why do reporters walk toward the camera when they start a segment? &quot;: Remember Eric Idle in The Rutles? The truck kept speeding up as he was trying to walk towards the camera...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: No, don't remember that because I've never seen The Rutles, which is one of those movies that you (meaning &quot;I&quot;) want to see but have not. Incidentally--and I'm almost ashamed to admit this--I saw &quot;Casablanca&quot; from start to finish for the first time a few weeks ago. I've seen scenes from it for years and years, of course, so I feel like I &quot;know&quot; it. But I'd never seen the whole thing beginning to end.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pretty good movie. You really ought to check it out.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Armisen: Without having spent much (okay, any) time watching him, I'd guess that Armisen is exactly half-right to portray Obama. On the other hand, he's around 65 percent right to portray Tiger Woods.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: No need for him to play Tiger. Tim Meadows did a wonderful job on him several years ago (&quot;As I was walking down the last fairway at the Master, I was thinking 'Ka-ching, ka-ching'!&quot;). Just bring Tim back (SNL does that from time to time, you know--ex-cast member Chris Parnell was on as Tom Brokaw last week).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Harrisburg, PA: What up, P-Far?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At your last chat, a poster said something like all cop shows are right-wing. I guess they haven't seen &quot;Law and Order&quot; lately; and though &quot;The Wire&quot; isn't really a 'cop show' (even though it kinda sorta is), David Simon is as big a left-winger as John Milius is for the right (maybe if Walter got involved in &quot;American Carol&quot;, it would actually be decent. More violent, but decent).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Well, I don't think all cop shows are right wing. Because &quot;right wing&quot; equals arresting people and solving crimes? Don't think so. This is kind of conservative propaganda--the idea that conservatives &quot;own&quot; law and order issues, patriotism, defense, etc. Liberals can hold their own on those issues, too.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Are the People Meters minute-by-minute?: I'd love to see the breakdowns on a minute-by-minute basis...you know, when the driver hits all the buttons during the five-minute commercial breaks. You could take a station from 60 to Zero if you timed it right.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I'm not sure about this, but I believe the meter does show minute-by-minute behavior. And I would bet that radio is far more subject to channel surfing than TV. When you don't like a song, or hear a commercial, you (meaning &quot;I&quot;) tend to skeddaddle a lot faster than when you're jumping around with the TV remote. In any case, I channel surf a lot slower with TV than I do with radio.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: The Rutles: I Must Be In Love ( YouTube)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A Defining Obama Joke: I'd say they haven't, but to be fair he is very hard to pin down. Armesen has gotten a lot better at capturing his speaking cadence, but that's about it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My suggestion to them -- Sen. Obama has a habit of prefacing his remarks by saying something along the lines of &quot;As I have said repeatedly...&quot;, no matter the topic at hand. The writers could have some fun with that, perhaps..</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Not bad. Incidentally, a person related to me by childbirth suggests that the defining phrase for Obama is &quot;Well, look...&quot; with &quot;look&quot; rendered in a very clipped manner. Try it. You might impress your friends (or not).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">SNL impersonations: Armisen's Obama is good with the delivery, but the writing needs to be sharper. Sudeikis' Biden was nearly spot-on; and Hammond really does nail McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I have to second your take on Hartmann's Stockdale; a truly gifted performer, but it was just too easy (Dennis Miller once said a pretty smart thing about Stockdale- how he was an all-around good man who committed the one unpardonable sin- being bad on TV)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Yes, the one thing--the only thing--that anyone remembers/knows about Stockdale was his weird intro at the veep debate in '92, perhaps because of Hartman's parody. Stockdale had a long and distinguished military career, but no one remembers that.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And Sudeiki's Biden, I thought, was less of an impersonation as an impression. Slightly, but crucially different: He really didn't try to mimic Biden's tone or mannerisms, but he did capture his energy and rhetoric very well. And the writing was very sharp.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I've never seen The Rutles&quot;: In the interest of fairness, you should have disclosed this fact to us readers YEARS ago. I am out of here, pal.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I feel so...used.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: How...how...can I ever make it up to you? I'm sorry, I swear. Oh, God, I'm sorry...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Silver Spring, Md.:&quot;And you're going to remember what you listened to several days later? No way.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I was an Arbitron listener a few years back, and I was expressly told to keep the diary on a daily basis so I would remember.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That's why they call it a diary, eh?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Well, &quot;expressly told&quot; isn't &quot;I did as instructed.&quot; I mean, YOU may have, but what about all the other folks in the sample? And even if you did, there's no way you could have remembered exactly what you listened to even a few hours later. Sorry, diaries are lame.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Silver Spring, Md.: The FOX Football robot hitting baseballs on Sunday got a bit annoying. He did it after every commercial break during both FOX games. I get it baseball is also on FOX, but way too much batting robot. I think they should have him doing the dances like the ones on the mortgage pop-up ads. By the way if we are in such a financial crisis why are those people still doing their gigs?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: The aforementioned relative-by-childbirth and I were analyzing the robot's swing. Pretty nice, we agreed, but he was throwing the ball up in a weird way, and his legs were positioned a bit oddly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And, yes, this IS what guys talk about while watching the game.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Debate Drinking Game: I'd rather drink a shot for every &quot;Well, look&quot; than for every &quot;my friends.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Of course, watching these debates is bad for my liver anyway.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I have a theory about drinking games: They don't really exist. Or like &quot;key parties&quot; in the 1970s, they barely existed, but their existence has taken on exaggerated proportions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Silver Spring, Md.:&quot;SNL does that from time to time, you know -- ex-cast member Chris Parnell was on as Tom Brokaw last week.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yes, and there was that Tina Fey chick too.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Ah. Of course. Or as Mike Meyers would say as Wayne: &quot;Chahh!&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Annandale, Va.: The problem with Armisen's Obama impression is that while he may look like Obama, he sounds like Jimmy Carter. He really needs to work on the voice. Plus, he does the same quick, choppy sentence delivery over and over. He should work on finding more Obama quirks to exaggerate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Interesting. Never thought of the Carter parallel, but I will now.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cleveland Park, Washington, D.C.: Of course, SNL didn't always care about creating a credible physical representation. Remember Chevy Chase doing Gerald Ford (and Chase didn't even try to do a vocal impression either) or Dan Ackroyd (with moustache) doing Jimmy Carter?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's like a editorial cartoon where they have to label the characters because the artist can't draw decent likenesses. As long as the joke is good, it's okay.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Yes! That's almost the definition of a successful impression--you don't even care if the actor/actress looks and sounds like the person being imitated if the joke is good enough. Sudeikis' Biden qualifies here as well.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">SNL Alums: And let's not forget &quot;William Murray&quot;, who asked a great question about his forever doomed Cubs on Thursday night's special.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Chahhh II.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">SNL -- Biden/Palin: Jason Sudeikis got Biden's bellow down. But Fey is almost TOO good as Palin; it almost humanizes her. Best SNL veep impression: Michael J. Fox as a befuddled Dan Quayle</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Wow, don't remember Fox-as-Quayle, although the casting is near perfect.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">SNL casting: I think it was mentioned in Tom Shales's book that SNL just doesn't really do right by black actors (and no, it wasn't Eddie Murphy who said it); Garret Morris had a tough time of it, Murphy is in the same boat as Norm McDonald when it comes to Lorne's rolodex, and while Chris Rock used SNL as a springboard, Damon Wayans had to make his own show in order to get seen (getting fired mid-sketch didn't help his situation). I guess Stewie Griffin was right in wondering if Ellen Cleghorn will ever get a good vehicle.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Morris was VERY bitter in Shales book, &quot;Live from New York,&quot; (highly recommended). But I think the general point is accurate: For whatever reason, SNL has not had a lot of great black performers. Murphy broke out, of course, but Rock had to rebuild himself via stand-up after appearing on the show. The list of others is pretty short...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bethesda, Md.:&quot;I have a theory about drinking games: They don't really exist.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Really?! I assume you must have gone to college. My small, East Coast college had a few drinking games that nearly everyone played, and I had friends at large, midwestern universities that had different sets of games, but the ultimate purpose was, of course, the same.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Or are you just referring to things like debate-specific games? (Actually, I'm pretty sure we played those in college too...)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Well, college, sure... I guess what I mean is, the concept has been generalized into a cliche. Anytime anyone uses a phrase repeatedly, someone has to say, &quot;That's going to be in the drinking game.&quot; For the sake of everyone's liver, I hope that there are far fewer drinking games in reality than there are in the cliches.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">SNL Presidential Impressions: We must give a shout out to Dana Carvey for his yeoman work in the '92 campaign, doing a terrific President George HW Bush and spot-on Ross Perot, as well as a good Jerry Brown in the primary season.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Also, current senatorial candidate Al Franken did a very funny Paul Tsongas that season. Good times!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Carvey, of course, became legendary for his GHWB. Wonder if Armisen will have a similar long-running annuity for his Obama is Obama wins on Nov. 4.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I HOPE you've at least seen Spinal Tap. Any chance you saw &quot;Bad News,&quot; a fake band documentary by those guys who did &quot;The Young Ones&quot; on MTV?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi:&quot;Spinal Tap&quot;? You're asking me if I've seen &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Upper Peninusla, Mich.: Hi Paul, Not that you asked, but here's the top ten SNL impersonations of presidents and Candidates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">10-Amy Poehler: Dennis Kucinich 9- Phil Hartman: Ronald Reagan 8- Dana Carvey: H Ross Perot 7- Dan Akroyd: Richard Nixon 6- Amy Poehler: Hillary Clinton 5- Darrell Hammond: Bill Clinton 4- Tina Fey: Sarah Palin (yeah, VP Candidate, so what?) 3- Will Ferrell: George Bush (this one) 2- Chevey Chase: Gerald Ford 1- Dana Carvey: George &quot;Poppy&quot; Bush</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Interestingly, no one has ever memorably done Ted Kennedy, Walter Mondale (perhaps too boring), Gerry Ferraro, and other recent major candidates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And, a good list, with one major omission: Darrell Hammond as Al Gore (&quot;Under mah plan...&quot; &quot;Lock box...&quot;)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">St John's, Newfoundland: Waitaminute!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Biden&quot; was &quot;Floyd&quot; (from 30 Rock)? Man, I did NOT get that at all. Is that a good sign?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I haven't watched SNL in YEARS (it is on at 1 a.m. here), but just watched 30 Rock on DVD. (Great show, btw).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: It's on at 1 a.m.? Newfoundland is, like, so foreign....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">SNL and black performers: The problem may come from a lack of black writers -- or, at least, writers who can figure out how best to work with the black cast members' talents. This was a theme in &quot;Studio 60&quot; (okay, so it wasn't Sorkin's best, but I kind of liked it!), where D.L. Hughley's character struggled with it, and used his clout as a longtime star of the fake show to bring on some new writers to work mostly with him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Quite possibly true, but...But performers on SNL write their own material, too. Of course, they don't get to greenlight their own material...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Right Wing Shows: As I think about the question, it seems to me that the most right-wing show would be &quot;The Sopranos&quot;: they operate in unregulated markets of their own making, they mete out swift justice, and the only government officials you see are corrupt.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Of course, that last one might just be a Jersey thing...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Ohmigosh--&quot;The Sopranos&quot; as right-wing icon. Never thought of it that way.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cleveland Park, Washington, D.C.: re: SNL impressions</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Norm MacDonald and Dan Ackroyd both did very good Bob Dole impressions. And Al Franken's Pat Robertson impression wasn't bad either.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Yes. Loved MacDonald's take on Dole for the &quot;Real World&quot; spoof: &quot;That's Bob Dole's peanut butter. You know it, I know it, and the American people know it.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There are some white comics not happy with SNL.: Just ask Jay Mohr. He's very bitter about his experience there.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: If you read Shales' book, you'll find that there are MANY comedians who were unhappy with their time on the show (Mohr, Harry Shearer, Janeane Garofalo, etc.). It's a very competitive environment, with an obvious--and perhaps justified--star system. Some people are bound to be disappointed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washinton, D.C.: My wife once received an Arbitron radio diary. After looking at it, she handed it to me and told me to do what I wanted with it. I did, and I listened for two weeks to the only D.C. radio station owned by someone that I had personally met. Since I was involved once in the distant past with the business side of an educational FM station in another city, I had an idea about who should benefit from my wife's diary.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Interesting. I wonder if this kind of thing goes on a lot. On a more boring level, people tend to write down their favorite station(s), rather than the ones they actually listened to. This makes the ratings somewhat self-perpetuating--if your station is/was popular/well known, it will tend to do well in the ratings for the simple reason that it's easy to remember it and write it down.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;No one has done...Ted Kennedy&quot;: Au contraire, mon ami. The late great Phil Hartman did a fabulous Sen. Kennedy in a skit about the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hall controversy. In quizzing Justice Thomas about his (alleged) come-ons to Ms. Hill, Hartman's Kennedy asked, &quot;Well, did you, uhh, eveh think about getting her drunk?&quot; Skit also featured Dana Carvey as Strom Thurmond talking about the virtues of &quot;soft porn&quot;....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I stand corrected! That was a great skit, written and performed just a day or so after the actual hearing. As I recall, that one had Al Franken as Sen. Paul Simon (he really looked like him) and the aforementioned Ellen Cleghorne (I think) as Anita Hill. Genius.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Newfoundland Time: Newfoundland is 1 1/2 hours ahead of Eastern time, so when SNL goes live at 11:30 p.m. Eastern, it's 12:30 a.m. Atlantic time (which is what the rest of the Canadian Maritimes are under). Newfoundland being Newfoundland, their time zone is one half hour ahead of the Atlantic time zone. Ergo, 1:00 a.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: These chats are so educational!...And why am I thinking of George Carlin's famous opening to his newscast bit: &quot;It's 5 o'clock in New York!....It's 4 o'clock in Chicago...In Baltimore, it's 4:19....Time for the 6 o'clock news.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Richmond, Va.: Some of the women SNL performers said the same thing: all they got was &quot;wife of funny guy&quot; roles and the resonse from L was for them to write their own characters. God bless Gilda Radner... what a genius.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Right. I think that criticism has waxed and waned over the years of the show. Hard to make the same case in the past few years, however, as we discussed last week...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Richmond, Va.: My fiance had actually NOT seen Spinal Tap! I am not making this up! I Netflixed it immediately and saved the marriage.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I think every American (and even most of Newfoundland) should be required to see &quot;Spinal Tap.&quot; Also, &quot;Office Space&quot; and &quot;Anchorman.&quot; &quot;Casablanca,&quot; too, but you can take as long as you want....</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Live from Maui: What is the deal with CNN's &quot;Debate Night in America&quot; shtick? It's almost as dumb as their Ballot Bowl gimmick (um, an election is already a contest!), and may be worse because they appear to have stolen the title from NBC's dumb Football Night in America, which in turn was, uh, borrowed from Canadian TV's venerable Hockey Night in Canada. Can't CNN come up with something more creative?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Why have any &quot;titles&quot; for these things in the first place? If we don't know that there's a debate coming, just tell us. As is, it's not even about the event itself; it's about the network's *coverage* of the event. What's wrong with just saying, &quot;Tomorrow night, we'll be covering the third presidential debate&quot;?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fairfax, Va.: Some have said that Obama is all the time too serious and that there's nothing to make fun of. You agree? Think he'll loosen up?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: He IS very serious but I refuse to accept the idea that there's nothing to make fun of. It's our right--no, our sacred obligation--as Americans to make fun of these people. Have at it, folks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">SNL comics: So who is more responsible for the quality of the show? The writers or the performers? Because there's usually only one or two good skits a night. And those two good ones are usually hilarious, but the rest suck. You used to be able to rely on the fake news to give you a chuckle, but that's been terrible since Tina Fey left.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: I disagree. The writing has improved since Fey's departure. And both elements are important. Sometimes a great performance can overcome weak writing, and great writing can cover a so-so performance. But when you get both, you're golden.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Waldorf, Md.: Every American should also be legally required to watch &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail.&quot; If one of the candidates made this a campaign plank, they would have my vote.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: The more daring requirement would be to watch &quot;Life of Brian.&quot; But I will settle for &quot;Holy Grail.&quot; Alternative credit given for seeing &quot;Spamalot.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dynamism: Yep, static shots are boring and tend to lose the audience quicker. That's why a lot of interviews are done outside while walking (a &quot;walk and talk&quot;). And that's why when they show shots of folks to illustrate a story they're almost always walking. I worked for cable news for several years and every day heard &quot;I need a walking shot of Bush!&quot; being yelled out.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Ah. Thank you. See, it's in the TV News Playbook!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Key Parties in the '70s: Twentysomething reader here, not clear what this means. Is it people getting together to sing show tunes? I'm confused...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Ah, sorry. Key parties, at least according to legend, were those in which a bunch of swinger couples got together and everyone pitched their car keys into a basket. People picked the car keys out one by one and went home with the person (of the opposite sex, I assume) whose keys the person had picked. For a glimpse of how hideous this was, check out Ang Lee's very good &quot;Ice Storm.&quot; (It will make your skin crawl...)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama: He is very serious, but he has shown indications of having a sense of humor. Remember his comment when that photo came out of him riding a bike, complete with helmet? Said his family told him he looked like Steve Urkle -- and I sensed he, not a campaign staffer, came up with it..,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: More of that, please! We all need a laugh right about now.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Farhi: Folks, thanks for another lively, eclectic (I love saying &quot;eclectic&quot;) exchange of news and views. I couldn't get to every thing this time, but that's why God invented next week. I'll be back at it again then; hope you'll be, too. Same time, same computer. In the meantime, regards to all...Paul.</span></p>
