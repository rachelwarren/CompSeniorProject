  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here's a sad monument to the sleaziness of this presidential campaign: Almost one-third of voters ''know'' that Barack Obama is a Muslim or believe that he could be. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In short, the political campaign to transform Mr. Obama into a Muslim is succeeding. The real loser as that happens isn't just Mr. Obama, but our entire political process. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A Pew Research Center survey released a few days ago found that only half of Americans correctly know that Mr. Obama is a Christian. Meanwhile, 13 percent of registered voters say that he is a Muslim, compared with 12 percent in June and 10 percent in March. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> More ominously, a rising share -- now 16 percent -- say they aren't sure about his religion because they've heard ''different things'' about it. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When I've traveled around the country, particularly to my childhood home in rural Oregon, I've been struck by the number of people who ask something like: That Obama -- is he really a Christian? Isn't he a Muslim or something? Didn't he take his oath of office on the Koran?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In conservative Christian circles and on Christian radio stations, there are even widespread theories that Mr. Obama just may be the Antichrist. Seriously.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> John Green, of the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, says that about 10 percent of Americans believe we may be in the Book of Revelation's ''end times'' and are on the lookout for the Antichrist. A constant barrage of e-mail and broadcasts suggest that Mr. Obama just may be it. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The online Red State Shop sells T-shirts, mugs and stickers exploiting the idea. Some shirts and stickers portray a large ''O'' with horns, above a caption: ''The Anti-Christ.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> To his credit, Mr. McCain himself has never raised doubts about Mr. Obama's religion. But a McCain&nbsp;commercial last month mimicked the words and imagery of the best-selling Christian ''Left Behind'' book series in ways that would have set off alarm bells among evangelicals nervous about the Antichrist.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain himself is not popular with evangelicals. But they will vote for him if they think the other guy may be on Satan's side. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In fact, of course, Mr. Obama took his oath on the Bible, not -- as the rumors have it -- on the Koran. He is far more active in church than John McCain is. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> (Just imagine for a moment if it were the black candidate in this election, rather than the white candidate, who was born in Central America, was an indifferent churchgoer, had graduated near the bottom of his university class, had dumped his first wife, had regularly displayed an explosive and profane temper, and had referred to the Pakistani-Iraqi border ...)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> What is happening, I think, is this: religious prejudice is becoming a proxy for racial prejudice. In public at least, it's not acceptable to express reservations about a candidate's skin color, so discomfort about race is sublimated into concerns about whether Mr. Obama is sufficiently Christian. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The result is this campaign to ''otherize'' Mr. Obama. Nobody needs to point out that he is black, but there's a persistent effort to exaggerate other differences, to de-Americanize him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Raising doubts about a candidate based on the religion of his grandfather is toxic and profoundly un-American, cracking the melting pot we emerged from. Someday people will look back at the innuendoes about Mr. Obama with the same disgust with which we regard the smears of Al Smith as a Catholic candidate in 1928. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I'm writing in part out of a sense of personal responsibility. Those who suggest that Mr. Obama is a Muslim -- as if that in itself were wrong -- regularly cite my own columns, especially an interview last year in which I asked him about Islam and his boyhood in Indonesia. In that interview, Mr. Obama praised the Arabic call to prayer as ''one of the prettiest sounds on earth at sunset,'' and he repeated the opening of it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> This should surprise no one: the call to prayer blasts from mosque loudspeakers five times a day, and Mr. Obama would have had to have been deaf not to learn the words as a child. But critics, like Jerome Corsi, whose book denouncing Mr. Obama, ''The Obama Nation,'' is No. 2 on the New York Times best-seller list, quote from that column to argue that Mr. Obama has mysterious ties to Islam. I feel a particular obligation not to let my own writing be twisted so as to inflame bigotry and xenophobia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Journalists need to do more than call the play-by-play this election cycle. We also need to blow the whistle on such egregious fouls calculated to undermine the political process and magnify the ugliest prejudices that our nation has done so much to overcome. </span></p>
