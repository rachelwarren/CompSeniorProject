  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Senator John McCain is giving up on his efforts to win the state of Michigan, his campaign said Thursday, in the latest sign that the faltering economy has reshaped the presidential race and cost Mr. McCain support in crucial states.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Ceding Michigan is a major blow to the McCain campaign, which had spent heavily on television commercials there and where Mr. McCain had campaigned repeatedly in the hopes that he could appeal to enough blue-collar voters, so-called Reagan Democrats and independent voters, to bring the state back into the Republican column in November. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But as the rippling financial crisis shook up the presidential election, and Mr. McCain's somewhat unsteady response to it appeared to cost him support in a number of recent polls of battleground states, his campaign decided to pull out of Michigan and redirect its resources to other swing states where they felt Mr. McCain had a better chance.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The McCain campaign has spent nearly $8 million on ads in Michigan, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, a company that monitors political advertising, and now it has no more plans to advertise there, campaign officials said. And Mr. McCain canceled a visit he had planned to make to Michigan next week.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain had long made it clear that the state was central to his presidential hopes, returning there to campaign again and again and bluntly telling a crowd at a factory in Belleville this July that ''the state of Michigan, as it has in many elections in the past, will determine who the next president of the United States is.'' His campaign announced its retreat on a day that the news of his ceding the state was almost sure to be drowned out by the buzz created by the much-anticipated vice-presidential debate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The McCain campaign's withdrawal will free the Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama, to redirect some of his resources from Michigan to several states that President Bush won in 2004 but where recent polls show Mr. Obama gaining ground, including Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The McCain campaign still projected optimism in a conference call with reporters, as senior campaign officials argued that they were confident that the electoral map presented them with numerous paths to victory in November.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mike DuHaime, the McCain campaign's political director, said the campaign would send some of its Michigan workers and resources to other states that voted for Democrats in 2004 but that they hope to win in November. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He mentioned Pennsylvania, a state rich in electoral votes where Mr. Obama fared poorly in the Democratic primary; Wisconsin, which the Democrats have won narrowly in the last two presidential elections; and Maine, which divides its electoral votes. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And although the McCain campaign's decision to accept public financing means that it faces spending limits that the Obama campaign does not face, there were indications that the campaign continues to be in strong shape on the money front. The campaign announced that the Republican National Committee, which can augment the $84 million in public money that the campaign had to spend on itself, raised nearly $66 million in September -- well above what Republicans had initially said they hoped to raise.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Greg Strimple, a senior McCain campaign adviser, held open the possibility that the R.N.C. might continue to run some advertisements in Michigan to keep the state in play. ''If we see a swing back in our favor, we will re-engage,'' he said in the conference call.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The McCain campaign made the announcement as Mr. Obama campaigned in Michigan. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Obama campaign reacted cautiously. ''We'll believe it when we see it,'' said David Plouffe, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, who noted that the McCain campaign could still return to the state, or that independent expenditure groups might step in to try to fill the vacuum. ''We're not going to take their word for it. We're going to fight for every vote.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But Mr. Plouffe said that if the McCain campaign really does withdraw from the state, it will make it more important for Mr. McCain to win all the states that President Bush carried in 2004, including some where they have seen an erosion of support in some recent polls. ''It just makes their path more narrow,'' he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain's struggles in Michigan were clear at the campaign stop at a factory in Belleville in July, where he found himself peppered with questions about his support for free trade by workers who believe it has cost the state jobs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> His campaign officials made it clear that they intend to open an aggressive new campaign highlighting what they described as Mr. Obama's liberal record.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Here in Denver, Mr. McCain was asked at a town-hall-style meeting when he intended to take the gloves off. ''How about Tuesday night?'' Mr. McCain responded, in a nod to his next scheduled debate with Mr. Obama.</span></p>
