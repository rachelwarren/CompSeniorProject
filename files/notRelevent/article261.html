  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> WITH TRADITIONAL STIGMAS WANING,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Adoptions Increase in South Korea</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> With a traditional emphasis on family bloodlines, South Koreans have long been reluctant to adopt. As a result, since the 1950s tens of thousands of South Korean children have been adopted by foreigners, mostly Americans. But the government is pushing aggressively to increase domestic adoptions in South Korea and last year, for the first time, more babies there were adopted by South Koreans than by foreigners. The country has set a goal of eliminating foreign adoptions altogether by 2012. PAGE A6 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> BRIEFING IN PAKISTAN ON TERRORISM</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In an extraordinary step in Pakistan, the military gave a classified briefing to Parliament about its efforts to combat terrorism. Although many parliamentarians said the briefing was focused too narrowly on military operations rather than the strategic issues facing the country, the ruling party's members hailed it as historic, and some analysts saw it as a first step in evolving a grand national strategy against terrorism.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> NEW BLAST ON TARGETED IRAQI STREET</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A suicide bomber blew herself up in the provincial capital of Diyala Province, killing 10 people on a street that has already been attacked by suicide bombers at least 16 times in the last five years. The street, lined by a number of government buildings, has become known as the ''street of suicide bombers and car bombers'' because there have been so many explosions there. PAGE A13 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> KOSOVO'S INDEPENDENCE SCRUTINIZED</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Serbia won its bid in a sharply polarized vote in the United Nations General Assembly to have the International Court of Justice review the manner in which Kosovo declared its independence last February. Addressing the General Assembly before the vote, the Serbian foreign minister, Vuk Jeremic, said the court review would ''serve to reduce tensions in the region and facilitate our efforts at reconciliation.''

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A CALL FOR TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates called on America's allies in southeastern Europe, a group of countries that includes Italy, Turkey, Ukraine, Romania and Macedonia, to expand their troop commitments to Afghanistan, where NATO is struggling to combat an emboldened Taliban.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CHINA SETS MELAMINE LIMITS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In an effort to rebuild consumer confidence, China's Health Ministry said that it had established limits for the allowable trace amounts of melamine in dairy products that officials said would make the items safe. This announcement follows revelations last month that at least three babies had died and 53,000 children had been sickened by drinking contaminated milk products. PAGE A10 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A Town Gets a Tribute</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The photographs Everett Kuntz took as a teenager in Ridgeway, Iowa, in the late 1930s were unprinted for 60 years until Mr. Kuntz, dying with cancer, remembered them. They have since been published by the University of Iowa Press, and in Ridgeway the pictures have given the town something to smile about. PAGE A14</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CHICAGO HALTS EVICTIONS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Law enforcement officers in Chicago will no longer evict residents from foreclosed properties, Sheriff Thomas Dart of Cook County said. The sheriff said he took the measure because an increasing number of the residents in foreclosed properties were renters who may have been dutifully paying their rent and may have no knowledge that the owner was behind on the mortgage. A new Chicago law gives renters 90 days from thetime a foreclosure sale is confirmed before they can be evicted. PAGE A14</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A HAVEN ACROSS A STATE LINE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> An Iowa resident crossed into Nebraska on Tuesday to abandon a 14-year-old girl in a hospital under a Nebraska law that allows parents or guardians to leave a child in state custody. Nebraska officials said it was the first time a child from out of state has been dropped off under the that law, posing legal and policy questions, including what to do with the girl.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> GUIDELINES FOR STOPPING INFECTIONS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Hoping to improve infection control in hospitals, the nation's top epidemiological societies joined with the American Hospital Association and the Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals, to issue a compendium of guidelines. The recommended practices, like vigorous hand-washing before the insertion of catheters, do not vary in significant ways from the guidelines issued and revised over the last two decades by a government advisory panel.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> STEVENS PROSECUTION IS DEALT BLOW</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The judge presiding at the corruption trial of Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska dealt a sharp blow to the prosecution by excluding some evidence because he said Justice Department prosecutors used documents they knew contained lies. The judge declined to declare a mistrial or dismiss any of the seven felony counts as had been urged by Mr. Stevens's lawyers, but he delivered a severe scolding to the prosecution.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> DR. ERNEST BEUTLER, 80</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In the 1980s, he and his colleagues at the Scripps Research Institute developed and tested a drug which was found to be effective in treating a potentially fatal disease of the blood and bone marrow. PAGE A29 </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But Not Part of, Playoff Picture</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At the Yankees minor league training complex in Tampa, Fla., the signs pay tribute to the team's record 26 World Series titles. But just a short drive away, the team that is getting ready to play in the American League Championship Series against the Boston Red Sox is the Tampa Bay Rays, who, along with the Red Sox and Mets, might just be the Yankees' biggest rivals.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> GENDER GAP IN EXERCISE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Girls who are not white, come from immigrant backgrounds or live in urban areas are less likely to be physically active than boys, while children in suburban areas have achieved a level of relative gender parity in athletics, according to a national survey of more than 2,000 school-age children to be released Thursday by the Women's Sports Foundation.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE LONG HISTORY </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Behind a Change of Heart</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> After an expensive and unsuccessful campaign for mayor almost 20 years ago, Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics magnate, single-handedly engineered and underwrote a referendum that enshrined him as the father of term limits for city officials. But after coffee and cookies with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg at Gracie Mansion on Wednesday, Mr. Lauder said he would not oppose a City Council bill to extend the limits to three terms for next year's election. PAGE A30</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SHARPTON AND OTHERS GUILTY</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Rev. Al Sharpton and seven others were found guilty of disorderly conduct, a charge that stemmed from their blocking of several bridges and tunnels around the city in May during a protest of the acquittal of three detectives charged in the shooting death of Sean Bell. The judge, Larry R. Stephen of Manhattan Criminal Court, said he was ''sympathetic to the underlying causes which gave rise to the protests and demonstrations,'' but added, ''The evidence is overwhelming.''

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> BLOGGING AGAINST THE TIDE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Richard Ivory is black and Republican and a New Yorker, a combination that presents challenges even under normal circumstances. He started a blog, HipHopRepublican.com, four years ago to voice criticism of what he perceived to be the political pigeonholing of blacks. But he acknowledges that this year, despite being a devout Republican, he feels history tugging at his loyalties. PAGE A31</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ICELAND COULD BE FIRST</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Country to Go Bust</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> After a decade-long binge in which its major banks, and some of its citizens, expanded beyond their means, Iceland may be the first country to face the prospect of ''national bankruptcy'' since the credit crisis began. Many people are talking about an epochal change, but no one is quite sure what that would mean. PAGE B1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE FACE OF THE BAILOUT</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The man with the shaved head and intense eyes who has been traveling with the Treasury secretary to Capitol Hill to testify about the unfolding financial crisis is -- to the surprise of many -- a 35-year-old former Goldman Sachs investment banker, Neel Kashkari, whom Mr. Paulson has tapped to oversee the $700 billion bailout effort.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> UPBEAT AMID THE DOWNTURN</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Small-business owners might take solace in the upbeat attitude of Christopher Hazlett, founder and president of a software design firm in Hoboken, N.J. He is introducing a software program called Event Clipboard on Friday in the midst of the financial system's breakdown. Is he nervous? ''Most of all, I feel exuberant,'' he said. PAGE B5</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> AN ALMOST PERFECT IDEA</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The concept is irresistible: a single, sleek pad that can replace the assorted black power bricks that are required to recharge your mobile gadgets. But you have to retrofit each existing appliance with special connections at a price of $35 each for it to work. David Pogue, State of the Art. PAGE B1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> STRAIGHTENING OUT VISTA</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Much has been made about the issues with Microsoft's Vista operating system -- including a series of TV commercials by Apple poking fun at it. But there are some ways to make your Vista experience more livable, and perhaps even more lovable. PAGE B10</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> If you're Wayne Coyne, the singer, guitarist and guiding force of the Flaming Lips, a house isn't enough. You need a compound where you can put up visitors, rehearse without neighbors complaining, and shoot the movie you're co-directing and starring in. PAGE D1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> DEALING WITH ASBESTOS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Building owners have spent millions of dollars to remove contaminated insulation, but it still isn't unusual to find asbestos in homes. What to do about it? The first rule is, don't disturb it. The second step depends on where you find it. PAGE D2</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A Director Says Goodbye</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Tina Ramirez, above, the artistic director of Ballet Hispanico, is stepping down from her position after almost 40 years, but she doesn't want to call it retirement: ''I've been in the theater my whole life, how can you retire?'' The engagement is Ms. Ramirez's last as the leader of a company she helped to turn into one of the most prominent Hispanic-American dance organizations in the country. PAGE C1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> NETWORKS COPYCAT FROM ABROAD</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Jobs are not the only things being outsourced. ''Life on Mars,'' which premieres on ABC, is adapted from a British series. So is CBS's ''Eleventh Hour,'' in the same vein as the ''CSI'' shows, but by contrast it lacks pizzazz. ''Kath &amp; Kim,'' which begins on NBC, is a copy of a popular Australian sitcom, but suffers from identity problems, Alessandra Stanley writes. PAGE C1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> FOX NEWS HOST RENEWS CONTRACT</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Sean Hannity, a cornerstone of Fox News Channel's prime-time schedule, has agreed to appear on the network through the next presidential election in 2012. With the contract renewal Mr. Hannity is expected to become an even more prominent part of Fox's opinion programming, especially since it remains unclear how much longer Bill O'Reilly, Fox News Channel's host of the 8 p.m. hour, will remain now that his contract has expired.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SECOND START FOR SERIES AND LIFE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Debra Messing, casting about for a new challenge after ''Will &amp; Grace'' ended in 2006, took on the role of Molly in ''The Starter Wife,'' a six-part mini-series in May and June. Her character, who tries to remake herself as a writer and a single mother after her husband leaves her along with her (fake) friends, struck such a chord with both audiences and critics that the series is back and not as a mini.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In covering fashion shows, looking at naked people becomes part of this often surreal job. But perhaps, what is strangest about this particular form of employment is that being around rooms filled with unclad women and men is anything but stimulating. PAGE E1</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> No matter who wins the presidential election, the United States is on its way out of Iraq. Senator Barack Obama offers the most specific and speediest withdrawal plan, but even Senator John McCain will not be able to keep a large number of combat troops there for long.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In an Op-Ed article, Robert B.
