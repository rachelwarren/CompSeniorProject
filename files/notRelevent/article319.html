  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Like many others, I have little pity for the executives who run these companies facing potential bailout by the government. But I have even less sympathy for the homeowners who have driven us to this point. Let me be clear: If you have a personal mortgage crisis because you have lost your job or have a sudden financial loss, you have my sympathy. But if you are one of those who have agreed to a mortgage that was beyond your means from the very beginning, shame on you (&quot;The question now: Will it work?,&quot; Cover story, News, Monday).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I remember the first time I met with a mortgage counselor. Based upon my gross income, I would be approved for a mortgage of up to $300,000. This does not mean that I could afford a $300,000 mortgage, merely that I would be approved for one. Sure, blame the salesperson for making people aware of this, blame the economists for building such a faulty sales model, but ultimately, I blame the people too star-struck and too driven by greed to realize they couldn't afford the mortgage. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I have heard of luxury homes where people live with no furniture, but their homes are among the best-looking in the area. I have seen people spend money they do not have to upgrade landscaping, painting or lighting. This behavior is among the root causes for the bailout.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Twenty or even 10 years ago, we would bemoan the number of foreclosures and bankruptcies as indications of economic woe. But in reality, aren't we really facing a crisis of personal responsibility and accountability? Along with bailing out the people (not banks, people) who made this disastrous decision, shouldn't we also be trying to change the way we sell mortgages to prospective clients?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Or would such a dose of reality cause another financial crisis?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dipping into our pockets</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Three cheers for the U.S. government trying to bail out our financial system. Easy for the lawmakers to do; they aren't spending their money (&quot;Thankful for the government providing help,&quot; Letters, Monday).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I don't profess to have an alternative, but please let's not act as if these politicians will dig into their pockets to come up with this money. They'll be digging into yours and mine.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Education can help reduce incarcerations</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We're No. 1. Usually, that is something to be proud of, but in this case, the U.S. leads the world in prisoner incarcerations. While several experts argued the merits of having access to education while incarcerated, we should take a step back and look at what is happening in our schools (&quot;Incarcerated getting educated,&quot; News, Thursday).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Investing our dollars in the nation's education system has proved to reduce the number of incarcerations. Perhaps these young men and women could have avoided imprisonment altogether if they had a decent public education. Investing $4,800 per child in preschool can reduce teenage arrests by 40%.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">States and local jurisdictions want to be tough on crime. And that's fine. State leaders would be much further ahead, however, if they worried less about how many prison beds they have and concentrated on improving the schools and teachers they provide. To be tough on crime, be strong on education.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">USA TODAY's editorial &quot;McCain leads Obama in race to distort each other's records&quot; has finally put me over the edge, and I am no longer that interested in politics in general and this election in particular (Editorial, Sept. 23).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">People are fond of saying voters will pick the best candidate and are not stupid. Well, they probably won't and they are. The editorial's last sentence about the nominees proves it: &quot;When they do (take the low road), they're essentially saying that they can't win on merit.&quot; And why can't they win on merit? Too many ignorant people are voting on the basis of the lies they hear in 30-second commercials and will believe anything if it is repeated enough.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sentiments I have heard over the past six months: A majority of Americans favor drilling offshore and in Alaska to bring down gas prices right away. We can't have an adult conversation about our energy future. Is the United States ready for a black president?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The fact that the last question is even asked is depressing. Add the financial mess, and it's easy to feel that a democracy can't solve our problems. In November, I hope we get the government we need; I fear we will get only the one we deserve.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Blame game continues</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democrats blame John McCain for injecting presidential politics into the negotiations for a bailout plan to save Wall Street and Main Street from economic disaster, while ignoring that their finger-pointing is also injecting presidential politics into the mix.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's becoming clear that neither party is willing to accept responsibility for failures leading up to this debacle, nor able to provide the leadership to forge a sensible solution. America desperately needs political reform, too.</span></p>
