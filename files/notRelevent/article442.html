  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The election season has been very good to a woman who seems to be benefiting from her status as an outsider in terms of gender and history. That would be Katie Couric, the anchor of the CBS Evening News. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Sure, Gov. Sarah Palin makes headlines while Ms. Couric just reads them. And Ms. Couric has yet to prove that all of the lucre and attention lavished on her debut an anchor almost exactly two years ago was a smart business bet. Early efforts at innovation fell flat in the ratings, and a subsequent return to the evening news template left the impression that Ms. Couric was starring in her own hostage video. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''It's clear that in the beginning, it was hard for viewers to accept a woman in the anchor role and at the same time, we tried to re-imagine the newscast, which was probably too much all at the same time,'' she said over the phone from her office in Manhattan. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But once she left the anchor desk, she was everywhere at the conventions -- soliciting people in a video on Digg about what questions to ask as a reporter for a nightly Webcast (cbsnews.com), seeking out the kind of conversations that made ''Today'' such a monster in the ratings. There was no convention bump in the ratings for Ms. Couric, and CBS and she remain a long way from precious bragging rights. But the odd anchor out has been in the middle of things for the last few weeks. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''It felt liberating to get beyond the limitations of the 22-minute newscast,'' Ms. Couric said about the convention coverage on the Web. ''Every night we had an hour, or an hour and change, to really flesh out some of the stories that were under way.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It could be argued that with fundamental assumptions about race, gender and politics up for grabs in an election that might pivot on things besides policy, having a woman in the anchor chair with a history of roaming across all kinds of subject matter might be a pretty good asset.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> While I was at the Democratic convention in Denver, I noticed -- and thought nothing of -- the former presidential candidate Michael Dukakis making his way toward security. That was until Ms. Couric buttonholed him. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''This obviously brings back some memories and some disappointments,'' she said, blinking into the sun, adding, ''How do you think you screwed it up?''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A remarkably revealing conversation ensued with Mr. Dukakis concluding, ''Look, I owe the American people an apology. If I had beaten the old man, you would never have heard of the kid and then we wouldn't be in this mess.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> That conversation won't change the political landscape, but it demonstrated what has been apparent for the last two decades to anybody with a television: Ms. Couric is a highly skilled interviewer, and people tend to tell her stuff. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''All of these media worlds are colliding and I am enjoying putting the puzzle together in a way that plays to some of our strengths as a news organization without all the time pressures and restrictions on broadcast real estate,'' she said. ''It was just much more conducive to the things I think I can do well.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> During our chat, I made a side bet with Ms. Couric that I could get through this column without using the p-word (you know, the one that rhymes with ''jerky''), and I plan on collecting. But Ms. Couric's online work and expanded broadcast efforts should remind viewers just how she ended up as America's broadcast sweetheart. She's naturally funny, she can be impertinent and, um, quirky. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In the run-up to the primary, she grilled 10 candidates on issues of character, including asking John Edwards about infidelity, a piece of tape that had a nice afterlife. In Jordan, she asked Barack Obama why he would not give due credit to the surge. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At the Republican convention in her role anchoring election coverage, she got Steve Schmidt, the seldom seen overlord of the McCain campaign, to come on camera and throw some grenades. And her interview with Cindy McCain in which the Republican candidate's wife displayed confusion about her husband's position on abortion kicked up a lot of notice. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Rick Kaplan, executive producer of ''CBS Evening News,'' said that a recent vote of confidence from Les Moonves, chief executive of CBS, and a natural settling-in period has made third place bearable if not actually comfortable. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''What sometimes gets lost in all the noise is that she is a superb journalist,'' he said. ''She will outwork you and outinterview you and that is going to show up handsomely for her. We are in the second act of a three-act movie.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> That act won't include a debate. The Commission on Presidential Debates went with three broadcast Brahmins -- Tom Brokaw, Jim Lehrer and Ms. Couric's colleague Bob Schieffer -- a significant disappointment for an anchor looking for traction and who missed out on the primary debates for a variety of reasons.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But even as she ended up on the sidelines of the debate game, Ms. Couric also became a character in the news last week when the McCain campaign used a piece of videotape of her saying, ''one of the great lessons of that campaign is the continued and accepted role of sexism in American life'' in an attack ad on Mr. Obama. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Never mind that she was actually talking about reaction to the Clinton campaign and that the use of the bit was deeply cynical and misleading; it etches the fact that this campaign has moved into Ms. Couric's wheelhouse.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''This is a great story for everyone, clearly,'' she said. ''But with the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and the emergence of Governor Palin, it is also worthwhile to have a female perspective on the news as well.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''You'd like the gender issues to fall away, just as you hope that at some point the race thing will fade,'' she said. ''The road to gender equality really starts when the novelty wears off. And I think my presence anchoring a nightly newscast is much less jarring than it might have been initially.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It is telling that when the McCain campaign was looking for a soft place to land Governor Palin's first interview, they turned to Charles Gibson at ABC, not Ms. Couric. It would have been fun to watch given the implied subtext: ''Hey, Governor, I invented spunky; I've had a colonoscopy on live network television, so let's get started on yours.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The last time I wrote about Ms. Couric, I got in a bit of a jam for suggesting that if the best man for the anchor job was a woman, it wasn't the same job anymore. The implied sexism of the statement was lost on me, but not on readers and Ms. Couric herself. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> So let me amend it here: Ms. Couric may never bring to mind Uncle Walt, but at a time when mainstream media is adopting the tools of the insurgency, the Olympian remove of network news is no longer an option. And as long as the job of anchoring network news keeps changing, no one, including me, should make a lot of assumptions about what kind of person should be sitting in that chair.</span></p>
