  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The McCain campaign released financial documents on Friday indicating that Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska had assets over $1 million, consisting largely of an ample retirement portfolio, real estate and her husband's commercial fishing business. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Ms. Palin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, kept her tax rate low by putting all of her investments in tax-deferred accounts. In addition, she did not report as income the $17,000 that she received in per diem payments from the state while she remained at her home in Wasilla. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Tax returns for 2007 and 2006 show that Ms. Palin and her husband, Todd, had diverse sources of income. In addition to her salary as governor, there were capital gains from the sale of a snowmobile and income from Mr. Palin's winnings in the annual Iron Dog snow-machine race. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> One of the most disputed aspects of Ms. Palin's tax returns, which were prepared by H&amp;R Block, is the tax treatment of the per diem payments. The McCain campaign has said that these payments are not taxable income, a position that has been questioned by tax experts. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''We have letters from tax experts on this,'' said a spokesman for the McCain campaign, Brian Jones. ''The State of Alaska conferred with the Internal Revenue Service, and this is the decision that they came to.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The tax treatment of the payments has drawn considerable interest from tax lawyers, who have written on this subject on various blogs, challenging the campaign's interpretation of tax law. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''What jumps out to me in these tax returns,'' said Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed group, ''is that the $17,000 in per diems is not there and it should have been.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The McCain campaign has been under pressure to release Ms. Palin's tax returns after the Obama campaign released 10 years of returns for Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic vice-presidential nominee. In addition, Mr. Biden has been required routinely to file financial disclosure statements with the federal government because he is a sitting senator. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The documents issued Friday are the first glimpse into Ms. Palin's personal finances and consisted of the federal public financial disclosure report and two years of tax returns. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Palins reported taxable income in 2007 of $166,080, consisting largely of Ms. Palin's salary as governor. The couple paid $24,738 in taxes on this income, at a tax rate of around 15 percent. But in 2006, the couple reported taxable income of $127,869, which consisted mainly of Mr. Palin's income from BP Exploration Alaska and an income of less than $5,000 for Ms. Palin from the State of Alaska before she was elected governor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> That year, the couple paid $11,944 in taxes, a tax rate of just under 10 percent. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Yet for a couple with modest incomes, the Palins have amassed a sizable portfolio that consists mainly of retirement investments and real estate. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The family home in Wasilla, which has been valued for tax purposes at $550,000, was listed on the federal financial disclosure form, which requires that all values be given in ranges, between $500,000 and $1 million. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The remaining real estate, valued at between $150,000 and $365,000, consisted of a fishing leasehold on the Nushagak River and partial interest in two other parcels of land. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Palins kept their taxes low by putting all their investable assets into tax-deferred accounts, including 401(k)'s, I.R.A.'s and defined-contribution plans from Wasilla, the State of Alaska and BP Alaska. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The disclosure form listed the portfolio's value as from $300,000 to $850,000. The assets in these retirement accounts included a sophisticated range of investments, including mutual funds invested in Latin America, small-cap stocks, shares in Spanish, Belgian and Australian indexes and a midcap growth fund. Among the firms represented in the portfolio are Morgan Stanley, Putnam, T. Rowe Price and Alliance Bernstein, all well-known financial institutions. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Palin's commercial fishing business enabled the couple to deduct a small portion of their home's expenses, and his snowmachine racing business was marginally profitable. In 2006, it had a taxable income of around $2,500. In 2007, when Mr. Palin had $17,000 in prize winnings, he claimed business expenses that resulted in a loss of $9,639. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Palins reported charitable deductions of $2,500 in 2007, and $4,250 in 2006. The only charity identified in the tax returns was the Salvation Army, which received a small amount of goods from the couple. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The McCain campaign declined to identify the other charitable recipients, except to say that the money went to ''churches in the local community,'' according to Mr. Jones, the campaign spokesman. He declined to say whether the Wasilla Assembly of God, where Ms. Palin was a member until 2002 and is still identified on the church's Web site as a ''friend,'' received a donation. </span></p>
