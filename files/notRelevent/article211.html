  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John Lee, the vice chairman of the Republican Party here in Clackamas County, winced more than once Thursday night while watching Senator Gordon H. Smith debate his Democratic challenger, Jeff Merkley.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> While Mr. Lee is no fan of Mr. Merkley, it was Mr. Smith, a Republican from rural eastern Oregon, who sometimes made his stomach turn. First there were Mr. Smith's kind words for Senator Barack Obama, then for another Democrat, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. What about Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee? One quick compliment, yes, but Mr. Smith clearly was not reaching for coattails.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''It upsets me,'' Mr. Lee said after watching the debate with a small group of local Republican leaders in a coffee shop here. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At a time when many Republicans are distancing themselves from their party, Mr. Smith is a study in the extreme. He is not just saying nice things about Democrats; he has run television commercials suggesting that he, Mr. Obama and Senators John Kerry and Edward M. Kennedy, both of Massachusetts, are of like minds on a variety of issues, including alternative energy and hate crimes. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Everybody's an independent in an election year, but he's not merely emphasizing his independence,'' Stuart Rothenberg, a political analyst who tracks Congressional races, said of Mr. Smith. ''He's trying to link himself with Obama in front of voters.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Smith, seeking his third term, has emphasized his sharp criticism of the Iraq war in recent years, his support for environmental issues, like increasing mileage standards for cars, and his efforts to pass measures extending hate crimes protection to gay men and lesbians. He frequently notes that he is rated one of the most moderate Republicans in the Senate by nonpartisan Congressional publications. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But even as Mr. Smith compliments Democrats and criticizes the Bush administration, momentum and math seem to be working against him. He is the only Republican senator representing a West Coast state outside of Alaska, and although he cruised to re-election in 2002, some local polls show him in a dead heat with Mr. Merkley, the low-profile speaker of the Oregon House. Mr. Merkley is benefiting from a growing shift in the state to the Democratic Party, as well as voters' deep distaste for President Bush and the Iraq war and their passion for Mr. Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''The momentum with Merkley is because he's got a 'D' by his name,'' said Tim Hibbitts, a longtime pollster in Oregon. ''He's not winning because of his personality. He's winning because in this particular state in this particular year, the Republican brand has gone to hell.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At the end of last year, Oregon had about 756,000 registered Democrats and 686,000 Republicans. There are now about 894,000 Democrats and 677,000 Republicans, with much of the increase in Democrats driven by voters wanting to support Mr. Obama in the presidential primary in May.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In 2002, Mr. Smith won every county in Oregon except one, Multnomah, which includes liberal Portland and its close suburbs. This year, with Democratic registration growing in Multnomah, political experts say Mr. Smith must win by even bigger margins in suburban and rural counties than he did six years ago. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Clackamas is one of those counties, but it is also one of several where voter registration has shifted in favor of the Democrats in the last year. Last December, the county had about 3,000 more Republicans than Democrats; it now has about 11,000 more Democrats than Republicans. The number of unaffiliated voters has largely remained flat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''I was going door to door the other day and someone asked, 'Why don't you put ''Republican'' on these fliers?' '' said Bill Kennemer, a longtime Clackamas County commissioner who is running for the State House as a Republican. ''I said, 'Because I don't want to lose.' ''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Smith has portrayed Mr. Merkley in television commercials as concerned only about the interests of Portland, an appeal to resentments among rural Oregonians that liberals and environmentalists in the city have shackled the state with excessive government, including restrictions on timber harvesting and land-use planning.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''What Pendleton wheat farmers need is Portland longshoremen,'' Mr. Smith said in the debate Thursday. ''I bridge that gap. Jeff Merkley deepens it.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Merkley said in an interview that ''the great irony here is that Smith calls himself bipartisan'' but that ''he wants to drive a wedge between rural and urban Oregon.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Merkley, a former director of Habitat for Humanity in Portland, receives low marks from agricultural and business groups, and high ones from unions and environmentalists. He has promised to visit every county in the state every year as senator. He frequently mentions that his father worked in a lumber mill in the small Oregon town where he grew up. In campaign advertisements, he wears thick flannel shirts. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> With Mr. Merkley as House speaker, the Legislature passed some of the nation's strongest incentives for creating alternative energy, and it established Oregon's first ''rainy day'' savings reserve. The state has not suffered from the budget deficits affecting its coastal neighbors, Washington and California. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has spent heavily on the race, and a consultant to Mr. Smith's campaign said the Republicans had been outspent on television advertising by about $13 million to $7 million. The Democrats accuse Mr. Smith of supporting the Iraq war in most of his votes and of moderating his positions on environmental issues, like whether to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, only when an election nears. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The bitterness of the campaign was a subject of the debate on Thursday and in another on Monday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Thursday's debate, one voter e-mailed a question asking each candidate to say three nice things about his opponent's record. Mr. Merkley praised the senator's work on mental health issues and other areas, while Mr. Smith said nice things only about Mr. Merkley's family.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''His voting record,'' Mr. Smith said, ''that's a little harder to do.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Although Mr. Smith has praised Democrats, few prominent ones have endorsed him. Mr. Obama has endorsed Mr. Merkley, as has Oregon's other senator, Ron Wyden, a Democrat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Smith's overtures to Democrats risk alienating conservative voters. Mr. Lee, the Republican leader in Clackamas County, said that Mr. Smith had ''ticked off a lot of Republicans'' and that he would vote for him only because he was the ''lesser of two evils.'' Mr. Hibbitts, the pollster, said surveys showed ''softness'' in the Republican support for Mr. Smith.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Adding another wrinkle, a third-party candidate, David Brownlow of the conservative Constitution Party, has registered in the high single digits in some recent polls. Political experts say that if the race is close and Mr. Brownlow has an impact, he is likely to hurt Mr. Smith the most.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''They're talking about health care and education and cutting taxes like this is just any other year,'' Mr. Brownlow said. ''Isn't anybody reading the paper? There's a financial meltdown out there. It's a whole new game.''</span></p>
