  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Confronting an increasingly bleak electoral map, top aides to Senator John McCain said Thursday that they were searching for a ''narrow-victory scenario'' and would focus in the final weeks on a dwindling number of states, using mailings, telephone calls and television advertisements to try to tear away support from Senator Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama's advisers said they would use the remaining 19 days of the campaign to focus mainly on capturing states that President Bush won in 2004; he is going to Missouri, North Carolina and Virginia, over the next three days and spending two days in Florida next week. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In a sign of the differing fortunes of the candidates, advisers to Mr. Obama said he was escalating his effort in West Virginia, which Mr. Bush won by 13 points in 2004, with a surge in advertising spending and a campaign swing there in the coming days by Mr. Obama or his running mate, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''West Virginia is real,'' said Mr. Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe. ''We have been watching it for a long time.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> By contrast, Mr. McCain is spending the next three days campaigning in states that Mr. Bush won in 2004 and that earlier this year Republicans had considered relatively safe: he will visit Florida on Friday, followed by North Carolina, Virginia and Ohio. Republicans said their hopes of capturing any state the Democrats won in 2004 appeared to be dwindling, though they said they held out hope for Pennsylvania, where Mr. McCain campaigned on Thursday but where he has recently slipped far behind Mr. Obama in some polls.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The emerging strategies were described by top aides to the candidates as the long campaign turned to the final chapter, following the last presidential debate Wednesday night. By every indication, Mr. Obama entered this post-debate period in a significantly stronger position than Mr. McCain, with broader support in polls, more options for an Electoral College victory and voters increasingly fixated on the economic crisis, to the decided advantage of Mr. Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. McCain's advisers said that in his speeches, television advertisements and mailings, he would seize on a remark Mr. Obama made in an encounter with an Ohio voter, Joe Wurzelbacher, who had pressed him to explain his support for a tax increase for upper-income filers. Mr. Obama responded by saying he wanted to ''spread the wealth.'' Mr. McCain repeatedly invoked that encounter with the man, whom he called ''Joe the Plumber,'' during the debate on Wednesday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Spread the wealth around: We will focus acutely on that,'' said Steve Schmidt, Mr. McCain's chief strategist. ''Spread the wealth around is a big mistake.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> With a sense of anxiety rising among Republicans, many were urging the McCain campaign to abandon its effort to win back the four Democratic states where Mr. McCain is still competing but is behind in polls --Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- and instead put all its resources into holding on to the states Mr. Bush won in 2004. In one sign of this, the Republican National Committee, which operates independently of the McCain campaign, pulled its advertisements out of Wisconsin, a state where polls show Mr. Obama pulling away.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But Mr. McCain's advisers made clear that their candidate would continue to campaign aggressively in those states, even as they acknowledged that their options were limited.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''The scenario for winning for us is a narrow-victory scenario,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''The fact that we're in the race at all -- within striking distance with a 5 percent right track -- is a miracle. Because the environment is so bad and the head wind is so strong.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Plouffe said he viewed Colorado and Virginia as the two states that Mr. Obama had the best chance of pulling from the Republican column.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama outspent Mr. McCain on television by four-to-one nationally last week, displaying a financial advantage that Mr. McCain's advisers described as smothering.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Still, the Republican National Committee and Mr. McCain by all appearances have retained a significant amount of money to pay for a late surge of television advertisements, get-out-the-vote calls and mailings. On Thursday, an independent unit of the party began an $18 million advertising campaign that will run until Election Day and started with a commercial questioning Mr. Obama's qualifications to lead. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Called ''The Chair'' and running in eight states -- including Indiana, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia -- the spot shows the president's desk in the Oval Office as an announcer says of the current financial crisis, ''This crisis would be Obama's first crisis -- in this chair.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The effort also includes what Republicans said would be an ambitious automated telephone get-out-the-vote operation, with calls already going out in 10 states. Some appeals invoke Mr. Obama's passing dealings in Chicago with William Ayers, a member of the Weather Underground radical group in the 1960s.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Colorado, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania and several other states, the party was running a robotic call in which a man says he is calling because ''you need to know that Barack Obama has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, whose organization bombed the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, a judge's home and killed Americans.'' (It does not say that Mr. Obama, in fact, worked with Mr. Ayers, now a professor of education, on two nonprofit boards.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama is preparing to announce his September fund-raising figures in the next three days, with several top contributors saying the tally is estimated at more than $100 million. The campaign is already so heavily invested in television advertising that it is having serious problems finding open spots to place more commercials. The fund-raising has so exceeded its projections, aides said, that the campaign decided to take the rare step of buying time on network television, including a half-hour informercial in prime time across several networks later this month.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> For Mr. Obama, complacency has become a critical worry. E-mail alerts and text messages will be sent in the coming days to re-energize supporters. With that in mind, he intensified on Thursday his criticism of Mr. McCain, amplifying the arguments that he had made in the debate instead of simply ignoring his rival.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''We don't take anything for granted,'' said Mr. Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod. ''We've been up and down and sideways over these past two years. We have to be ready for anything. We're not going to let up for one week.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama admonished his supporters on Thursday not to grow overconfident about his recent surge in crucial electoral battlegrounds and national polls, making public a worry he has privately been raising for more than a week with his circle of advisers. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''For those of you who are feeling giddy or cocky or think this is all set, I just have two words for you: New Hampshire,'' he told top contributors at a fund-raising breakfast in Manhattan. ''I've been in these positions before, when we were favored and the press starts getting carried away and we end up getting spanked.''</span></p>
