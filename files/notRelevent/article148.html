  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Where's Miles Davis? Who kidnapped Elvis?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Up there on the riser in the Virginia arena, there is this careful guy reading from a teleprompter and keeping his tone not exactly monotone but not exactly soaring, and he is repeating more or less the same lines that he read the night before and the same lines he will read the day after.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Once, the artist formerly known as Barack Obama, the slim, smooth-faced fellow with the close-cropped hair and the trumpet of a voice would riff on 14 varieties of hope and propel crowds higher and higher until he sent them spinning out into the night ready to change the world. Teleprompters were for the earthbound. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Now this candidate, with noticeably more gray flecking his hair, is talking about ''the changes and reforms we need.'' He goes on about ''a new era of responsibility and accountability on Wall Street and in Washington.'' He hankers for ''common-sense regulations to prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Bottom-up growth,'' he promises brightly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> What happened to the ''fierce urgency of now''? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It is tempting, in contrasting the Obama of a year ago with the presidential candidate of today, to conclude that Miles Davis has turned himself into Barry Manilow. That is not quite the case; he still draws crowds -- 100,000 in St. Louis on Saturday -- that would warm a rocker's heart. And his words can still soar, as when he and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton formed a campaign duet Monday in Florida. But this Mr. Obama is a consciously, carefully, intentionally more grounded one, and a touch duller for the metamorphosis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The slow muting of Mr. Obama's rhetorical dial, particularly noticeable as world markets gyrate and unemployment spikes, speaks to a candidate who has run a rigorously disciplined campaign. His goal a year ago was to soar while rivals still cast their eyes down; now he must convince voters that he can walk just a step or two ahead of them, and so help navigate treacherous ground.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Hope is about paying the mortgage. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''He is intent on making a very pointed and precise case,'' said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's chief strategist. ''We are offering a solid leader with a sober vision.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At his most effective, this 47-year-old Democrat forces everyone -- his Republican rival, his aides, the voters -- to adapt to his tempo. So Mr. McCain entered each debate frowning, scoffing and tossing pugnacious roundhouses; Mr. Obama, playing with a grin, slipped to this side and to that, reframing questions, fighting on his terms.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Obama of the campaign trail is at once more prosaic and perhaps more proficient. Early this year, when his appearances were more happening than rally, one could count on a constant: Someone would scream, ''I love you, Obama!'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And Mr. Obama would, almost without looking up, answer quickly, ''I love you back.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Then the McCain campaign began running commercials portraying Mr. Obama as a separated-at-birth celebrity brother of Paris Hilton.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Shouts of ''I love you'' went unrequited this past weekend.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama is of two minds about the artifice of politics. Last spring he often resisted the impulse to pretend he was just folks; he held tight to his gerunds. And, slender fellow though he is, he refused to gorge on the artery-clogging sausage and sweets found on the campaign trail.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But to listen in Roanoke last weekend was to hear him backstroking in the regional accent pool. ''We went to this din-ah,'' he told the crowd, sounding a bit like a fellow who wandered down from the Appalachian Mountains. ''Y'know, I lahk some sweet potato pie.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And a little later: ''I don't think it's right,'' said the Harvard-trained lawyer. ''In fact, it ain't right.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> No indeedy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama rarely pushes down hard on the base pedal on race. History suffuses his campaign; there is no need to make explicit what is so evident. Black crowds, from Fayetteville, N.C., to North Philadelphia, recognize precisely the historical narrative playing out before their eyes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As Mr. Obama roams the whiter hinterlands of Missouri, Virginia, Ohio and North Carolina, he as often travels with a white companion -- particularly those popular among the white working class -- Governors Ted Strickland of Ohio and Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, and Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Jim Webb of Virginia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He is just like you, they tell audiences. He grew up middle class. He is a father and a husband. Their talks can be quite frank. From time to time, though, words strain at the bounds of what the eye can see. So Mr. Webb, a red-haired, proudly Scots-Irish pol with a John Wayne cadence, introduced Mr. Obama in Roanoke and began: He's one of you. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Webb offered a complicated formula that involved putting to the side Mr. Obama's Kenyan father, then tracing the lineage of Mr. Obama's white mother, who was born in Kansas to parents whose grandparents came from Kentucky and whose ancestors somewhere in their wanderings from Ireland and Scotland presumably settled for a spell in southwestern Virginia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Webb finished with a broad smile. He has divined the backwoods white bonafides of an urbane, mixed-race Chicagoan. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''They say he's not like you.'' He shook his head, sternly. ''Barack Obama is just like you.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The crowd puzzled for a second, then clapped at his effort.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> On Tuesday in Lakewood, Fla., Mr. Obama held a ''jobs summit'' with Google's chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, and Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve. The crowd tensed, pulsed, here he comes, that man who makes so many hearts leap.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Yes, we can! Yes, we can!''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> No he can't, not today. The candidate wags his head and asked, politely, for silence. ''No cheerleading. We have some serious business to do.''</span></p>
