  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 2 U.S. HELICOPTERS CRASH: POLAND ENDS IRAQ MISSION</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Two American Black Hawk helicopters crashed in northern Baghdad, killing one Iraqi soldier and wounding two Iraqi soldiers and two American soldiers. Earlier Saturday, Poland's military mission in Iraq was ceremonially brought to a close, and the country's remaining 900 soldiers are expected to be home by the end of October. PAGE 14 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> LEADER REPORTEDLY SEEN</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, who is believed by South Korean and United States officials to have suffered a stroke, recently made his first public appearance in more than a month, the North's state-run news agency reported. Mr. Kim watched a soccer game held to mark the 62nd anniversary of the founding of Kim Il Sung University, the North's premier institution of higher education, the agency said. PAGE 13 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 15 TURKISH SOLDIERS KILLED</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Fifteen Turkish soldiers were killed and at least 20 were wounded in an attack Friday night by Kurdish separatist rebels in the mountainous border area in eastern Turkey, Turkish officials said. Twenty-three Kurdish fighters of the Kurdistan Workers' Party were also killed. The attack was the most serious in a year, and the Turkish authorities will be under pressure to respond.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Turns Into Concern</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> For years the gleeful competition between homegrown Wachovia and the larger Bank of America left Charlotte, N.C., a clear winner. But last week, as Wachovia, which employs 20,000 people in Charlotte, became the latest financial institution to succumb to the credit crisis, that long spirit of competition between the two banks swiftly turned to concern.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A GRIM RECOVERY TASK</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Three weeks after Hurricane Ike hit Texas, at least 34 people from the Bolivar Peninsula, where the storm did the worst damage, are missing and some are presumed dead. Volunteers and state rescue workers have been combing miles of debris on the peninsula and in the marshes on the east side of Galveston Bay, using dogs trained to find human bodies. The bodies of two people from the Bolivar Peninsula have been recovered so far. PAGE 16 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> WYOMING'S FLUSH TIMES</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> No, things are not tough all over. Things are not tough in Wyoming, for example, where the gas industry has almost single-handedly set the state in stark contrast to the rest of the nation. While other states are laying off workers and cutting programs, Wyoming has enjoyed billions of dollars in surpluses, and field workers and those in the industries that support them have deep pockets.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A Russian cartoonist despised by Hitler and beloved by Stalin for 70 years and 70,000 drawings wielded his talent as a keen sword to advance the goals of his country. PAGE 32</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> An Uneasy Sensation</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Darien, Conn., is said to have the nation's highest percentage of residents working in financial industries. And while there is still some sense of the old normal, ''there's the nagging fear we're like Wile E. Coyote having zoomed over the cliff, blithely walking on air as long as he manages not to look down and ponder the void below,'' Peter Applebome writes in Our Towns. PAGE 34</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> HELP FOR DETAINEES</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> An online video game created by an international human rights organization retells the story of the death of a Guinean tailor held in a New Jersey jail for overstaying his visa. It is part of an effort to get public support for efforts to strengthen oversight, due process and medical help in immigration detention. PAGE 35</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Since 1994, quarterbacks in the N.F.L. have worn a speaker in their helmets allowing them to hear communication from a coach. Since then, scoring has exploded, completion percentages have increased and defenses have complained. This year, defenses get that same advantage, which one coach says ''obviously levels the playing field.'' PAGE 1</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> STARTING OUT FUNNY,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But Taking a Detour</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ''Deafness is comic, as blindness is tragic,'' the narrator says in David Lodge's new book ''Deaf Sentence.'' But while Lodge propels the story with ''consistently witty'' writing, Stephen Amidon says in his review, eventually ''the farce Lodge promised early on has given way to bittersweet domestic drama.'' PAGE 11</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> IRAQ'S GOOD NEWS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In ''Tell Me How This Ends,'' Linda Robinson argues that Gen. David Petraeus and the ''surge'' policy in Iraq have produced positive results that even Democrats would be hard-pressed to deny. James Traub calls the book ''a first-rate piece of work, probing and conscientious.'' PAGE 19</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> La Dolce Vita</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A bloody history of conflict and civil war left Eritrea, once the jewel in Italy's African crown, hermetically sealed to the outside world, a nation locked in a time capsule. The result is a surreal, out-of-body tourist experience, where you feel dislocated from just about everywhere else, but euphoric and inspired by what is in front of you. PAGE 3</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Taking Another Shot</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When an original member uploaded a 1998 clip from Straight No Chaser, an undergraduate a cappella group from Indiana University long since graduated and disbanded, to YouTube, he did it for the members' own amusement. But after Craig Kallman, the chairman and chief executive of Atlantic Records, saw it, he approached the group with a record deal. PAGE 1</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> ONCE MORE TO THE WELL</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> American moviegoers have given the cold shoulder to films about Iraq and the war on terror (unless you count the stoner comedy ''Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay.'') But what if you gathered two of the world's biggest movie stars, one of its most celebrated directors, an Oscar-winning screenwriter and a novel? The result is ''Body of Lies,'' which opens Friday.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Purrs Instead of Barks</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The popular image associates cats (maybe lots of them) with ''cat ladies''-- and, this time of year, witches, provided the cats are black. But it seems that a growing number of men are embracing their feline side and posting photographs and videos of their little buddies on YouTube and on Web sites like menandcats.com.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE ONE YOU'RE WITH</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> One might think that polyamory -- maintaining multiple steady relationships, with the consent of all involved -- would offer the promise of boundless sex. And maybe it does, for some. But what it definitely calls for is lots of talking: to one another, for starters, and to others, to explain how you live. PAGE 9</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Sorry, Can't Have It</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Suppose you try to log on to your Gmail account and find yourself locked out, the innocent victim of security measures that automatically suspend access if someone tries unsuccessfully to log on repeatedly to an account. You would probably want to talk to somebody about it. Well, tough. That's not an option. PAGE 4</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> NOT-SO-SMART MONEY</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The so-called smart money seems to avoiding three big investment categories: index funds, dividend-paying companies and small caps. On paper, that seems to make perfect sense in these times. If you do a little homework, however, you will notice that some of these ideas haven't panned out. At least not yet. Fundamentally, by Paul J. Lim. PAGE 6</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Without That Dull Feel</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Commuters looking for a two-wheel ride for fuel economy have a variety of options that don't have to be dull, including the Vespa GTS 250. Its advertisements say it's the fastest Vespa ever, it gets about 60 miles to a gallon of gas and people turn their heads and smile when you whoosh by. It looks and feels cool.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> These days, politicians of any note can pretty much count on drawing some degree of ridicule from the Lenos, Lettermans and Stewarts of the world -- as Sarah Palin is no doubt learning.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A recent survey has suggested that Barack Obama's support would be about six percentage points higher if he were white. But this is not because of dyed-in-the-wool racists. On the contrary, the evidence is that Senator Obama is suffering from what scholars have dubbed ''racism without racists.''

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Times reported last month that John McCain's campaign manager was paid nearly $2 million over five years by an advocacy group set up by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to avoid stricter government regulation. In response, McCain's chief strategist said that The Times is ''completely, totally, 150 percent in the tank'' for Barack Obama. The Public Editor looks at the record.
