  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Daily Updates: WED </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten's humor column, Below the Beltway, appears every Sunday in The Washington Post magazine. It is syndicated nationally by the Washington Post Writers Group.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At one time or another, Below the Beltway has managed to offend persons of both sexes as well as individuals belonging to every religious, ethnic, regional, political and socioeconomic group. If you know of a group we have missed, please write in and the situation will be promptly rectified. &quot;Rectified&quot; is a funny word.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Tuesdays at noon, Weingarten is online to take your questions and abuse. He will chat about anything. Although this chat is updated regularly throughout the week, it is not and never will be a &quot;blog,&quot; even though many persons keep making that mistake. One reason for the confusion is the Underpants Paradox: Blogs, like underpants, contain &quot;threads,&quot; whereas this chat contains no &quot;threads&quot; but, like underpants, does sometimes get funky and inexcusable.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This Week's Poll: 37 and Younger| 38 and Older </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Important, secret note to readers: The management of The Washington Post apparently does not know this chat exists, or it would have been shut down long ago. Please do not tell them. Thank you.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Weingarten is also the author of &quot;The Hypochondriac's Guide to Life. And Death&quot; and co-author of &quot;I'm with Stupid,&quot; with feminist scholar Gina Barreca.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Good afternoon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I seldom see first-run movies in real time, meaning I almost never get the opportunity to review them here in any helpful way. But on Saturday, I saw &quot;W.&quot;, and have some exciting news. The bad news is that &quot;W.&quot; is a poor movie -- simplistic and heavy-handed, as Oliver Stone movies tend to be -- but the good news is that it delivers a must-see performance. After an adulthood of searching, I have finally found a worthy successor to Shelley Duvall in &quot;The Shining&quot; for the Worst Single Acting Job in Film History.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Remember Shelley as Wendy Torrance? Googly-eyed, bobbleheaded, open-mouthed, a one-dimensional, manic, yowling Munch-ian absurdity? I have said that no one could create a worse role, but someone has. It's Thandie Newton as Condoleezza Rice, a lookalike role she plays, for some reason, with an unintelligible, unmodulated simper. It's hard to figure whether the portrayal was intended to be funny, or critical, or surreal, or what. In my theater it drew some nervous, bewildered laughter, but mostly slack-jawed disbelief. The reviews I have seen so far are somewhat unkind to Ms. Newton, and to Mr. Stone for misusing her. These reviews were not nearly unkind enough.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(Please note that I make a distinction between the worst acting PERFORMANCE of all time and the worst ACTOR of all time. The worst actor of all time, at least in the age of cinema, was Peter Lupus, who started in low-budget gladiator films but graduated to the ensemble role of the muscleman Willy Armitage in TV's original &quot;Mission: Impossible.&quot; Peter's acting deficits were so great that over the run of the show they had him say fewer and fewer lines until he was reduced entirely to grunts and muscle flexor. On the two or three occasions when he had to attempt to adopt an Eastern European accent to fit into some undercover role, the results wound up moistening more than a few 60s-era living room beanbag chairs.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anyway, that's my review. Thandie Newton as Condoleezza Rice: Must-see cinema.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">--</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Today's poll ( 37 and Younger| 38 and Older) was created by me, based upon my own insufferable certitude about word pronunciation. I make none of the mistakes listed in the poll. Several posters have already denounced me for elitism, a charge I would like to address preemptively. My elitism was driven into me at a young age by my mother, who was icily intolerant of mispronunciation. She had a reason. In the late 1930s, the New York City school system was trying to limit the number of first-generation Jewish women it hired, while still adhering to the letter of the fair-hiring laws. They did this with a northern version of a poll tax or literacy test: They insisted that all new teachers speak with completely unaccented English, a daunting task for some young women who, like my mother, grew up in Russian, Polish, or Yiddish-speaking households.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">To this day, my ma remains the only person I've ever know who pronounced the word &quot;ed-you-kay-shun.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(Manteuffel says &quot;Your mother actually did what they wanted: She took the 'Jew' out of education.&quot;)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Several readers are asking why I did not include the &quot;nucular&quot; option in the poll. Simple: It would have provoked political, not linguistic, outrage, and the results would have been suspect. Also, for those who aksed, I didn't go there because I believe there is an ethnic component to that mispronunciation. Same reason I didn't do &quot;all right already,&quot; an abomination never uttered by a gentile.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So, take the poll. I find it curious that the young'uns on the average make more mistakes than we oldies, and also that, for some reason, the yoot is MUCH more likely to say &quot;man-aise.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">---</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I may have posted this many months ago. It seems familiar, but if so it remains intriguing: Pick your right foot off the floor and make clockwise circles with it. While doing this, draw the number 6 in the air with your right hand. Your foot will change direction, or at the least become hopelessly confused.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">----</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Two CLODS today, on the same topic. The first is this dramatic reading by Chris Schneider of an actual Wasilla town meeting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And this is Saturday's Daily Show sendup of Wasilla.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">----</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We had a terrible comics week, and I will award no prizes, though there are some things worth noting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">First, last week's Doonesbury sequence ( Tues| Thurs), in which we learn Obama hit eight of 10 three-pointers in two pickup games of &quot;Horse&quot; with our troops is neat because of an inside joke: Obama actually did confirm this personally to Trudeau, just as he does to Rick Redfern in the strip. Of course, Trudeau's reach is a little greater than that of a blogger.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Second, I direct you all to Frazz on Monday, which is a fine strip, possible worthy of CPOW, except for an egregious error. &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; may well be unconventionally rhymed, but it is hardly &quot;free verse.&quot; Check this out:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">LET us go then, you and I,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When the evening is spread out against the sky</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Like a patient etherised upon a table;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The muttering retreats</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Streets that follow like a tedious argument</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Of insidious intent</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">To lead you to an overwhelming question ...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Oh, do not ask, &quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let us go and make our visit.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the room the women come and go</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Boo to Wednesday's Beetle Bailey for ruining a joke. It would have hurt them to say &quot;poop'&quot;?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And finally, I liked today's Mother Goose and Grimm.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Okay, let's go.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: Hooray for today's poll! I love passing judgement on the way other people use language. Especially when they try to make some lame &quot;languages evolve&quot; argument to defend themselves.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here's another one for you: a very high-powered Washington insider who has been to more plenary sessions than I have hairs on my head, and STILL pronounces it &quot;plenerary&quot;.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">washingtonpost.com: Me, I like passing judgment on people who misspell judgment.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I like passing judgment on people who criticize others for errors in judgement when, in fact, the issue is a permitted variant.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ellicott City, Md: There is one you don't have in your poll, that grates on me to no end, Specifically pronounced as Pacifically.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Yes, very bad. Others have mentioned this.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Oooh, a confession.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In researching common mispronunciations, I did find a word I mispronounce all the time. Apparently, a herb, as in oregano, is not an erb. It is a herb.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chevy Chase, DC: Gene, knowing what a dog lover you are, I had to submit this story to you. This past Saturday, I brought my 4 year old collie/retriever mix to the groomer for a bath. The groomer was about 2.5 miles down Connecticut from my house. After dropping her off, I returned home to find a voice mail on my phone telling me that they had had an &quot;incident&quot; in which my dog had jumped out of her crate, over the counter, and ran out the front door of the store. So there she was, running around Cleveland Park, with half the staff of the store chasing after her in their cars. Upon receiving this call, I immediately started to gather up her favorite treats to head out to look for her and envisioned a long night of searching and putting &quot;Missing Dog&quot; fliers up. Just as I was about to leave the house, I heard a faint barking outside. I knew that bark. I went to our back porch, and sure enough, there was my dog, standing in the neighbor's yard, barking at the house because she couldn't get over the fence. In less than an hour, my dog had traversed more than 2 miles through heavy traffic on Connecticut Ave. to make her way directly home. Do I officially have the smartest dog ever?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: The second smartest.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Old Dogs&quot; contains a similar story, but in reverse. Stanley the Jack Russell terrier found his way from his home to his vet. Why? Because he had liked what had happened there the day before, when his semen was extracted for a mating.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Exact same&quot;: My dad used to get on me for saying this--saying it was incorrect grammar and unnecessarily repetitive. I still say it, and feel like a tool every time I do.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: It is terrible. Pat the Perfect disagrees with me, one of the few areas where she is imperfect.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New York, N.Y.: Last week in the times, there was an article about the history of the use of Hebrew on campaign buttons to pick up the Jewish vote. A particularly good one from 2000 had pictures of Gore and Bush. Under Gore's picture was the Hebrew transliteration of &quot;Gore.&quot; Under W's picture was &quot;Gore-Nischt.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A yiddish pun! I want this! Other than ebay, where can I find it?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Ebay.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And yes, it's brilliant. &quot;Gore-nischt,&quot; to my memory, basically means &quot;Nuttin'&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Prufrock: My husband of 24 years used to recite Prufrock to me while dating. thanks, it brought back a fond memory.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I also have it memorized.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arlington, Va.: I assume you saw the abomination that was Godfather III. How does Thandie Newton's work in &quot;W&quot; compare to the horribleness that was Sofia Coppola in G-III? She was thrust into the role at the last minute because Winona Rider was too tired to fulfill her commitment (huh?) and performed like a deer with a high watt spotlight trained in her eyes at all time.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I was so happy for her when she found directing and had success on that side of the camera. However, I will have to see &quot;W&quot; just to see if Ms. Newton has replaced Ms. Coppola as worst performance by a serious actor in a serious film. I consider it a high bar to reach.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: It's a smaller role, so the comparison will be tarnished.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's impossible to do any role worse than Thandie did this.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Spit question: Asking you a health question is much easier than trying to find a doctor to ask, so... what does it mean when your saliva tastes metallic and your tongue is a bit numb, or thick feeling? This began a few weeks ago. I'm not on any medications and I feel fine, but it's unpleasant. Do I need to go to a doc or a dentist? Or just get used to it?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Sounds like the onset of a cold or a minor nasal infection.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You forgot...: Moot/Mute -- this is like nails on a chalkboard to me!!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Conversate/Converse</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Who the heck says conversate?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It Drives Me Nuts: (not the steering wheel on the pirate's pants)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">People who say their area of expertise is their &quot;fort-ay&quot;. It ain't.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I fixed that some years ago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gaithersburg, Md.:&quot;Little Dog Lost&quot; -- Do you like this strip? I don't think much of it -- is it just me?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I'm not ready to make a pronouncement. It is a character-driven strip, meaning you really need to know these guys before you can decide if you like 'em. I like how old and grouchy the tortoise is, and I like that there is an opportunistic vulture.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I haven't seen enough make-me-laugh gags yet. But I'm still watching.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Annandale VA: In this week's poll, there should be some way to determine what part of the country the respondant is from --</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some of the mispronunciations could be merely the result of accent. For instance, both verbiage and foliage are both easily elided to remove the i syllable.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some of the correct pronunciations are so uncommonly heard that they sound pretentious, or as we might say , stuck-up.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Sorry, but &quot;folage&quot; and &quot;verbage&quot; are simply illiteracies. They are not regionalisms. They are utterances of people who think those are the right words.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Surviving Oba, MA: To the conservative/Republican person last week who expressed angst and loathing at the thought of a President B.O., I can tell her how I'm approaching this apparent Democrat ascendancy: It won't last.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By my math, I give the Dems six years in power -- eight tops. By that time, our entitlement system will be crashing in on itself, because none of the liberals will want to &quot;cut&quot; Medicare and Social Security, even though they're paying out benefits that everyone knows we can't afford. The dollar will crash, interest rates (and mortgage rates) will rise, and Republicans will be called upon to fix the mess. It will pretty much be a repeat of what we're dealing with now, only cleaning up government rather than the private sector.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So the poster should just bide her time and take the long view -- it's what I'm doing...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: On Sept. 11, 2001, I turned to a coworker and said that I was really hoping that in three years I would vote for George W. Bush out of gratitude.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Your views have been noted.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pronunciationville: I consider myself very well spoken but I can't figure out some of your pronunciation options.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What exactly is the difference between prerogative and perogative when spoken? Are you really articulating that r? If so, how? Is it like Pree-rogative? That sounds really wrong to me.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Who says Febooary? I say Feb-you-ary. I know I'm not pronouncing the r but really does anyone say &quot;boo&quot; like a ghost?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I predict that the ones that bother people the most will not correspond to the ones that they themselves are most likely to say.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Li-berry would get to me the most. I mean, really. Yes. I'm a bit of an elitist.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: You're not enough of an elitist if you do not hear the difference between prerogative and perogative. And no, it is not &quot;pree&quot; but yes, both r's should be clearly pronounced.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am informed that more people say &quot;asteriks&quot; than say &quot;asterik.&quot; Both pronunciations are wrong.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pat the Perfect, ME: In America at least, the primary accepted pronunciation is urb for herb. But an oregano-eating animal is A (not an) herbivore.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Who told you otherwise?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: It is?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A couple of websites swore it was Herb. Like Herb Tarlek.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Long Beach, Calif.: They all looked like little kids doing impressions of famous people, aside from Brolin, Dreyfus and Cromwell, who was fabulous because he didn't even try to look like/imitate H.W.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: To me, it's distasteful mostly because it's stupid.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">think, IN: Gene</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Is there such thing as an email affair? I think I'm getting involved in one where each of the two parties are sharing intimate - though not overtly sexual - sides of ourselves to seek validation from someone who is not our spouse. In real life we are over 1500 miles apart and haven't seen each other in 20+ years. Thought you might be a good person to ask with all of the virtual panties thrown your way. It feels good and safe now, just wondered what might be down the road.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Everytime I express the opinion that there is nothing wrong with this sort of thing I get inundated by posts by indignant individuals who claim marriage permits no intimacy of thought whatsoever outside the bond.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So I won't say it this time.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: How DO you say February? I have struggled with this all my life. It is my month of birth and it never seems to sound right no matter how I say it. I tried saying FebUary to fit in with my friends when I was younger, but that never seemed quite right as there was always that pesky R there. I say Feb-roo-ary now, which I suspect is closer to correct, but still doesn't feel right and often makes me feel pretentious, especially when others around me are pronounciating (just kidding) it differently. Usually I just try to say it very quickly, so that the middle sound is indistinguishable, so that my listening audience hears the important parts, the Feb and the ary. Please help me with this. I would define myself as an elitist when it comes to these matters, and while I try not to correct others because I want to still have friends, I hold myself to the highest standards. Thanks for bringing up this subject, Gene. It's a special one for me.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: February.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The dictionary also lists Febyouerry. Which I contemn.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Herb: Who says &quot;erb&quot; is wrong? The two dictionaries I just checked listed both, with &quot;erb&quot; first. Merriam-Webster's says in the US it's usually &quot;erb&quot; and in Britain usually &quot;herb.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Okay, I guess we have hestablished that. Good. So I'm never wrong, after all.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Washington, D.C.: Sometimes, I see a movie preview clip that is so awful, it guarantees that I will never see the movie. That's the case with 'W.' There was a scene about a Cabinet meeting -- I think they're discussing faulty intelligence on the war -- and Bush goes into his, 'Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice - you won't get fooled again' line. It's one that he only used in public once, and he stumbled over it so badly that it seemed clear that it wasn't one that he frequently used. But that clip seemed to suggest that he used it all the time, and stumbled over it just as badly in the same spot each time. I don't think so.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: The movie is immaturely filled with just exactly those moments, jammed in willy-nilly. Slam dunk is in there. So is misunderestimate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's a movie with a 97 IQ.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It has one great moment -- an extended scene -- very near the end.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As I see it, your assertion at the end of last week's chat was this. Obama has certain views that he's sharing with most of the country. Then he has secret views that he's only sharing with a select part of the country. This part includes gay people and smart people. And they're all agreeing to keep the rest of the country in the dark, because they can't be trusted to make a decision based on all the facts.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I didn't say that. I said there are things he believes that he cannot say. This has been true ever since people began running for office. To pretend that this is some great failing is to be very naive about politics.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am a reporter at a small weekly. Somehow, the tedious task of typing wedding announcements has fallen to me.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I just finished one, where the bride wore &quot;a white taffeta strapless mermaid style gown with a sweetheart neckline.&quot; It was also &quot;adorned with beaded lace embellishments featuring a ruched bodice that draped asymmetrically at the waist and a beaded motif accented the side front and back.&quot; I won't get into what her veil and bouquet looked like, or what the others in the wedding party wore.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I'm 23 and female, but I just don't get it. Why, Gene, do we have to print this?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: You have to print it because you work for fearful, unimaginative people who dare not take responsibility for change. So things are done as they always have been.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Also, it is essential to beat out of you any desire for creativity or edge. Resist it; this job will pass.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Okay, prepare for a shock to your system:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The reason people say &quot;mayo&quot; is that the only correct pronunciation is &quot;mayo-naise&quot; and you and your elision-drunk friends are all mispronouncing it.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And don't argue that it's the matter of a liberal dictionary bending to to the whims of the rabble--some of these words have always had those pronunciation variants, and some of the ones you list as &quot;misuse&quot; are the primary variant.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And don't say it's about hewing to a word's spelling, because I bet you look down on people who pronounce the &quot;t&quot; in &quot;often.&quot;</span></p>

There is a reason we don't all walk around talking about &quot;al-oo-min-ee-um&quot; soda cans or saying &quot;thee&quot; or speaking in German. The notion that there are rules to enforce is only a matter of cleaning things up, to streamline communication. The people who insist upon rules of grammar and pronunciation are not elitist, though they wish they were. To be an elite you have to have a reason to claim a something is better than another and argue it validly. You have to know why you like things. Opera is better than NASCAR because it relies on emotion and aesthetics and nuance, whereas NASCAR does not. The same cannot be said for feeling &quot;mirror&quot; is better than &quot;meer&quot; because &quot;it's the correct pronunciation.&quot; They're entrenched reactionaries. They're snobs, but they don't know why. Language changes, and there is nothing you can do to stop it. Not even if you're French, who have an academy just for deciding the correct things about languages. The rules of language came after people decided something worked and we developed a linguistic taxonomy for them, not the other way around.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I agree with all of this. But what is depressing is that so many things evolve due to ignorance.</span></p>

In many ways, we do have a loving relationship, but in the last three years, our sex life has been pushed way back on the list of priorities. I feel like I have tried initiate way more than he ever does, and have talked about getting couples' counseling. Still, I feel tremendous guilt about the sexual encounters I have had with other men, and I think if I do tell him he will leave me. I understand why he would. These were not emotional relationships with other men, and I remain very much in love with my husband, I want our marriage to work. We have no kids yet, but have been thinking about it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So, the only friends I have spoken to about this say that I have to tell him, and I imagine you and the rest of the chatters would agree.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If it matters, it has been three different men that I have been with for short-lived trysts. I fully believe that I would never do this again, but I cannot expect anyone else to believe me. Is there any way to salvage this relationship?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I am not even going to try to answer this. I just don't know how I feel about it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I will put it out to the group.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Memory expert: I've always wanted to talk to a person like this. Here's the reason: I was 7 when President Kennedy was assassinated, and the reason that I remember the days of that week so clearly is that my father died a few days beforehand. In my very clear, distinct memory, their funerals were held on the same day. Because children often weren't taken to funerals in those days, my brothers and I stayed at home -- watched over by an aunt. Again, very clearly, I remember watching the president's funeral procession with my aunt while all the others were gone.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That memory has stayed with me my entire life, and I talked about it with my mother recently. &quot;That's interesting,&quot; my mother said, &quot;because it's not what happened.&quot; Evidently, their funerals were held two days apart. So how do I account for this? The realization that my memory was so wrong was shocking, and I can't account for it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I don't know why you're interviewing him, but if it's on a similar track, I'm looking forward to the story.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: This doesn't surprise me. You are conflating two enormous events in your life that happened nearly simultaneously.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: Gene Weingarten: I agree with all of this. But what is depressing is that so many things evolve due to ignorance. : Me again.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But ignorance is fine. Language is an ad hoc system of communication. New words pop up all the time. Meanings change. Sometimes they flip. And you, for the most part, will still be able to know what someone is talking about.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Why don't we celebrate this? Flexibility? Inventiveness? Creativity? You may call it ignorance and mistakes, but I know the rules. I was an English major, I work as an editor. I correct mistakes because I'm paid to. But spoken language is wonderful and beautiful when it is fast and jarring and inventive and combative.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I know I should get off on being right. I usually do, but not about this. For me, it is a sosoome, or however you spell it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Sosumi.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Maybe that word gets in the dic in about 20 years. I think I might have coined it.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re Somewhere: You need to speak to a therapist first, to figure out whether you should even stay in your marriage. You can't be sure you won't cheat again, and then if you have told him about the first three times and sworn not to do it again, your marriage will be toast. If you decide to stay and work on it, you work with your therapist to figure out whether to tell him. I would be devastated if my husband had cheated, even for the reasons you describe, and I am a great believer in honesty. I'm just not sure that you talk to him first about it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Okay.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">re: affairs: I think you have to ask whether telling him does anything other than make him feel bad and lessen the burden of your guilt. If that's the only reason to tell him, don't. I do think you should start going to counseling to find out what is really causing you to have affairs instead of trying to fix whatever is going on in your marriage. And, yeah, something is wrong with your marriage. It's either fixable or it isn't. Counseling will help you figure out which is the case.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alexandria, VA: For the cheating wife: yes, it is possible for a marriage to recover from infidelity and become stronger than ever, but it's hard. (It took several years in my case)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I would find a good marriage couselor, and meet with him/her alone to decide the best way to share the truth.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You can't get away with not telling the truth at this point - this is not some minor slip. At some level you know full well that if you don't get help, you are going to do it again and again, until you get caught. Better to try and tackle the problems directly than subject your husband to that.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And whatever you do, DON&quot;T have kids. Whatever strains are already in the marriage, kids make worse. Too many people think otherwise.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cheatin' Somewhere: Don't tell your husband. Just don't.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You should feel like a zit on a turd for cheating on him. And that guilt is what you get to live with for cheating on him. Don't foist this information on him to alleviate your guilt a bit by coming clean. His trust in you (and likely women in general) will be shattered. His view of you, his marriage and your sex life will be forever tarnished. Live with your guilt and keep it to yourself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And finally, why don't you think you will do it again? It seems that something is missing in your relationship and that you simply require that something. I would definitely try and fix that something prior to having kids because most serial cheaters do get caught and the only thing worse than dumping your guilt on this man and basically forcing him to dump your cheating behind is to be caught cheating by this man and basically forcing him to dump your cheating behind when there is now a kid involved.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I had three short affairs over many years for much the same reasons you describe--saying it was just physical and I had no intention to leave my husband.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The fourth one, though it started the same way, ended up being the catalyst for my leaving my husband. I spent 8 years with that man in what was in many ways an unfulfilling relationship to justify my awful behavior. I felt horribly guilty and it took me years to forgive myself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am now happy in a second marriage, and I guess that bumpy road is what it took me to get here, but I am not proud of what I did to my first husband in my self-delusion.</span></p>

New York Yiddish is EXACTLY like German with a very, very thick Viennese accent. There are some exceptions, notably in very common words. But really, it's astounding.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Love the chats. Not to confuse you with Michael Dirda, but if you're interested in issues of pronunciation and word meaning, you should check out &quot;The Mother Tongue,&quot; by Bill Bryson. It's basically an exploration of what English is, and how it came to be, in Bryson's own inimitable way. I love reading it, because I learn at least one new fact on every page. As I recall, there is a great chapter on how word meaning shifts over time, due to usage -- all of which suggests your concern over &quot;infer vs. imply&quot; (which I share) is completely futile.</span></p>

What I do feel I was right about, earlier than anyone else, was calling the unmitigated disaster of the Palin choice. Within two hours of the leak of her name, while others were mulling her &quot;compelling personal narrative,&quot; The Gene Pool asked &quot;Sarah Palin -- Complete Disaster or Monstrous Gaffe?&quot; A couple days later, as the Sarah boomlet swelled, The Gene Pool asked &quot;Sarah Problem Here?&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">UPDATED 10.22.08</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: We start today with this great email from Katharine Liu --</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Two years ago, I was a grad student at The Shakespeare Institute, and we put on a student production of &quot;Othello&quot;. The word &quot;student&quot; is important here: most of us were academics, not actors, and the show was an extracurricular activity on the level of pick-up soccer. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Someone must have thought the venue made it important, because today I found a professor's review in the highly respected &quot;Shakespeare Bulletin.&quot; What makes this review special is that, despite a few lines about the other characters, this guy essentially based an ENTIRE scholarly article on the fact that Kelly, the hot 20-something actress who played Desdemona, was clearly wearing a THONG beneath her costume. The view of the thong began with Desdemona's entrance, continued when she addressed her father, and apparently crescendoed when she turned away from the audience. This all took no more than 30 seconds of a two-hour play. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What's hilarious is how the reviewer tries to place his ordinary horndoggery under the auspices of scholarly interest. He speculates that &quot;The Thong&quot; represents a deliberate attempt to complicate Desdemona's &quot;performed sensuality/virtuosity&quot;, or to pose &quot;problematic, perhaps unanswerable&quot; questions about 21st century productions of &quot;Othello&quot;, or to demand &quot;a level of audience negotiation between sheer distraction and informed, if problematic, directorial concept.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Only at the end of the article does he admit that, after interviewing both the director and the actress, he found out that the visible thong represented nothing more than an accidental wardrobe-transparency malfunction. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I am grateful to Henry Chen for this, which he aptly labels &quot;a personification of willful stupidity.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">BBFL: I thought you might be interested to know that I presently have only one nipple. There was a &quot;nipple incident&quot; during my breast reduction surgery last Monday. The left one turned out great. The right one is good, except for the fact the nipple is not technically attached to my body.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You know what makes me the happiest, Gene? When I am at the computer, or at a table eating dinner, it is now completely possible to spill food on the napkin that polite society has deemed the lap the appropriate place for those things. I can't tell you how many shirts have food spillage where my &quot;fun bags&quot; used to be. I can look down and see my feet. I can go jogging (when fully reattached and recovered, obviously) and not have to wear Oprah's Yentl Bra. It uses the philosophy that keeping the breasts as close to the body as possible will prevent the effects of time in joggers. It binds</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A few last words. You know the line in the movie &quot;Knocked Up&quot; where Seth Rogan says that having a breast reduction is like slapping god in the face? I could go on and on with an expletive-laden response, but I will say this -- you (men) try carrying 20 pounds around your necks all day, every day and night for 40 years on the off chance you might get sex. Gene, please tell me men wouldn't actually do that. They may be horny, but I think laziness trumps horniness in this situation. Even if the answer is yes, I haven't had sex in 10 years, so it's about time I chopped them off like I should have done 15 years ago. They sure weren't doing me any good.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And the writer of the movie, I believe it was Judd Apatow, should seriously rethink his version of funny. I happened to recently get cash to enable me to have the surgery, but every week you can see examples of women who suffer from this very affliction right before they say, &quot;MOVE THAT BUS!&quot; I swear one woman was about to give herself a concusssion and broken kneecaps in one jump.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I will advise you of the nipple situation next Monday or Tuesday. I have pictures (for purely scientific purposes, let me assure you) if you would like to see them. I'll take that as a no.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I am speechless. About all of it, but especially the temporarily missing right nipple. In a later e-mail, this woman informs us that the doctor has told her it will take another couple of weeks before the nipple will be reattached.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Speechless. Thank you for sharing and please keep us abreast of further developments. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">_______________________</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sister's question: So last night I get a call from my sister with the following question. How wide is your typical poo? Carrot, banana or zucchini in width? This is something she and her husband had been discussing and felt only really comfortable asking me. Well I agreed with my sister (bananna) but that could be biological so could you open this question to all of your readers? That would give a better cross section of the population</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: This reminds me of the medical tomes I read when researching my hypochondria book; some include a poop diameter index, and I recall that &quot;pencil thin&quot; is a variety of stool one wishes not to have. Persistent pencil diameter stool can be a sign of colon cancer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I think, though, that the dimensions and topology of poop varies with many different factors. I personally have experienced the banana, the summer squash, the Twizzler and even, rarely, the pomegranate. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Deputies found numerous bottles and boxes of alcohol at the house. A 17-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy were suffering side effects from consuming alcohol and were taken to local hospitals as a precaution.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I thought the side effects were the next day...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: Good point. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Onst, AR: Gene,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My sister in law sent me this story regarding a good friend of hers. Might provide a good InstaPoll question about what the chatters would do in the same situation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;As part of her job, she frequently travels within the region to give presentations to various groups. Recently, she was asked to drive to a city about an hour and a half from home to give a 45 minute presentation on a Saturday. After the presentation, she would be done for the day so she brought along her husband and son, thinking they could have lunch together and maybe see a movie--make a day of it. And, as a bonus, she could drive the company car and not have to pay for gas.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She dropped husband and son off at a nearby mall and went to the hotel where she would be giving her presentation. She told them she would meet them back at the same entrance in an hour or so.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The presentation went smoothly and as she was gathering her things she realized she should probably make a stop in the ladies room before she left for the mall. While in the restroom, she somehow managed to drop the car key in the toilet. This is the key to the company car, mind you.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She's sitting there, contemplating her options. She realizes almost immediately that the only option is reaching in for it. After all, it's the key to the company car, she's stranded an hour and a half from home, not to mention her husband and son stuck at the mall waiting for her, and her cell phone is locked inside the company car because she never brings it in during presentations. So even though it's icky-, she takes a deep breath, stands up and...the toilet is an automatic flusher and the key is gone.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gene Weingarten: I was wondering where this was going. Good end, as it were.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Her dilemma, however, was a no-brainer; in my Hypochondria book, my dentist recounted a patient who had to face a more difficult decision. He had accidentally swallowed his bridgework. His choice was to pay a couple thousand dollars for new bridgework, or to wait until he passed it naturally, to clean it up as best he could, and then pop it back in his mouth.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Frugality prevailed. </span></p>
