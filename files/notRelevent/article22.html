  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WASHINGTON -- In a year when most candidates are sneering at the influence of special interests in Washington, Republican Sydney Hay is making what may be the toughest pitch in politics: lobbyist for Congress.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Running to represent northeast Arizona in the House, Hay has faced a barrage of negative advertising over her 18-year-old Arizona lobbying firm, Southwest Policy Group. But being a lobbyist, she insists, shouldn't be an impediment to elected office.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Without someone like me, taxpayers have no voice,&quot; said Hay, who lobbies for an Arizona mining association, a school-choice group and three other interests, state lobbying reports show. &quot;I advocated for the jobs that mattered in this district.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While candidates across the USA, including the presidential nominees, battle for the mantle of reform in this year's election, an analysis by USA TODAY and the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics indentified 15 current and former lobbyists who are running for Congress. Nine are challengers; six are current members.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Of the 15, nine are in competitive races, including three incumbents, according to the non-partisan Cook Political Report, which rates the races.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Many of the candidates said the skills they learn as lobbyists -- convincing others, finding compromise -- will make them strong lawmakers. In almost every case, though, their past work has also provided a political opportunity for their opponents.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Kansas, Republican Sen. Pat Roberts aired television ads noting that his opponent, Democrat Jim Slattery, worked as a lobbyist for the Washington firm Wiley Rein.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;For the last 14 years he's been a Washington lobbyist,&quot; the narrator in one Roberts ad says as Slattery's face is shown next to a mounting pile of $100 bills.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Slattery, a former member of the House, released a list of his clients from 1995 to this year, which included Kansas City Southern Railway, Motorola, Spirit Airlines, the wheat gluten industry and 28 others.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Congress approved a lobbying bill last year that required more frequent reporting of lobbyist expenditures and also forced senators to wait two years after retirement, instead of one, to begin lobbying. House members still may lobby after one year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The new rules follow the Jack Abramoff scandal, in which a former lobbyist was convicted of plying public officials with gifts in return for political favors.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Watchdog groups have focused on members of Congress who become lobbyists. There are 158 lobbyists who served in Congress -- 73 Democrats and 85 Republicans -- according to Congressional Quarterly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Less attention is paid to people moving the other direction.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Brian Bilbray is an example of both. He became a federal lobbyist after losing his House seat in 2000. The California Republican won a special House election in 2006, despite being criticized by opponents for his years as a lobbyist.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a tight race for re-election, Bilbray again faces criticism. &quot;Brian Bilbray is a lifetime politician, and when he wasn't, he was a lobbyist,&quot; Bilbray's Democratic opponent, Nick Leibham, told the North County Times.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bilbray's campaign manager, Kurt Bardella, declined to comment.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lobbyists have been maligned in past election seasons, but the rhetoric increased this year as Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain run on themes of changing Washington. &quot;I imagine this year it's a tougher sell, or it's an easy mark for an opponent,&quot; David Kimball, a political scientist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said of candidates. &quot;The public perception of lobbyists has never been that great. They rank somewhere around used-car salesmen.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Other lobbyist challengers include Democratic Idaho Senate candidate Larry LaRocco, Alabama House Republican hopeful Wayne Parker and Republican New Jersey Senate candidate Dick Zimmer. LaRocco and Zimmer served in Congress.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In addition to Bilbray, incumbents running for re-election who were lobbyists include Reps. Jason Altmire, D-Pa.; Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo.; Dan Lungren, R-Calif.; and Doris Matsui, D-Calif.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We definitely view it as a strength,&quot; said Jean McNeil, a spokeswoman for LaRocco, who does not mention his lobbying on his website biography. She cited LaRocco's experience in banking and financial services.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Ohio, Republican state Sen. Steve Stivers is running against Democrat Mary Jo Kilroy in a seat left vacant by retiring Republican Rep. Deborah Pryce. Stivers served as a lobbyist for Banc One Ohio in Columbus for seven years, a line on his resume that Democrats frequently raise.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Most people see this as just politics,&quot; Stivers said, adding that he needs to tell &quot;the rest of my story.&quot; <br /></span></p>
