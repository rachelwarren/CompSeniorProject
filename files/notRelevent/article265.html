  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The President,&quot; Norman Mailer wrote in 1963, &quot;has commissions and commissars and bureaus and agents and computer machines to calculate the amount of schooling needed to keep America healthy, safe, vigorous. ... To keep America up.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">No one in Mailer's time imagined the president himself operating one of those &quot;computer machines.&quot; But times have changed, as Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, tells us in a controversial TV ad. &quot;He admits he still doesn't know how to use a computer,&quot; an announcer tsk-tsks about Republican nominee John McCain, adding that the Arizona senator &quot;can't send an e-mail.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Can't send an e-mail! Savor the scorn! Clearly, the 47-year-old Obama, whose campaign is the most tech-savvy yet, is playing generational politics and using McCain's words against him. Asked in January by Politico's Mike Allen whether he uses a Mac or PC, McCain shrugged: &quot;I am an illiterate that has to rely on my wife for all of the assistance that I can get.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I've never felt the particular need to e-mail,&quot; the 72-year-old McCain elaborated in July. But the Vietnam War fighter pilot seems eager to learn new tricks: &quot;I am learning to get online myself.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Does it matter?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With 73% of Americans surfing the Web, Obama's&nbsp;ad assumes they will view as hopelessly out of touch, and accordingly vote against, a septuagenarian who has no such skills. But do voters really expect the nation's chief executive to be computer-savvy? Does it matter if he is?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As a practical matter, no. The number of &quot;commissions and commissars and bureaus and agents and computer machines&quot; surrounding the Oval Office has only increased since the publication of The Presidential Papers by Mailer. Where FDR relied on &quot;six anonymous assistants,&quot; the modern presidency boasts 125 offices and 5,000 employees. Tom Wolfe once described ordering aides around as the politician's ultimate power: &quot;As soon as you see people jump when you raise your finger ... well, there's a great feeling of wholeness about that, apparently.&quot; Who would raise that finger to type -- hunt and peck like a regular schnook -- when he has 5,000 people to do it for him? Jump!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Two centuries of iconography, from Matthew Brady's Lincoln to George W. Bush's landing on the Lincoln, have trained Americans to conceive of POTUS -- the Greek god-like acronym for president of the United States used by the Secret Service and hipster reporters -- in idealized corporate terms: &quot;Mad Men&quot; minus the boozing and womanizing (JFK aside), pinstriped industrial titans less likely to bang out their own correspondence than to bellow out: &quot;Ms. Crabtree, take a letter!&quot; The &quot;burdens&quot; of the presidency -- the aggregate of global troubles visible in those black-and-white shots of Kennedy and Johnson, despairing silhouettes framed against Rose Garden snows -- are presumed to be too heavy for &quot;The Leader of the Free World&quot; to trifle with anything beyond briefings and maps, all preparatory to his real business: decision-making. Do we really want POTUS lingering about ESPN.com box scores, or posting snappy retorts at the Daily Kos?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Symbolically, though, our egalitarian era might demand a president as adept online as he is on The Hotline. By mocking McCain's computer illiteracy, Obama risks cries of &quot;ageism&quot; -- even running mate Joe Biden (age 65) denounced the TV spot as &quot;terrible&quot; -- on the bet that Americans want their leaders to be like themselves, steeped in similar experiences, tethered (wirelessly) to reality.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The McCain camp's understanding of this desire explains Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's frequent reminder that she placed her predecessor's state jet up for auction on eBay: Not only is she fiscally sensible, she's an eBay user -- she's ... with it! (Left unaddressed is whether Palin herself or an aide -- jump! -- actually clicked the mouse.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Historically, Democrats prefer exceptionalism in their leaders, Republicans populism. JFK, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry and Obama, though all products of the old-fashioned political &quot;machines&quot; in their states, have presented themselves as cutting-edge types, solicitous of new technologies. Even the down-home LBJ, surveying his Texas-sized mistakes in Vietnam, navigated three TV sets at once.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The regular guys</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By contrast, Republican leaders Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bush 41 and W. -- all thoughtful men frequently underestimated by their opponents -- have willfully cultivated anti-intellectual, Luddite personas. At times, of course, artifice give way to reality: Nixon's mechanical abilities were so deficient he reportedly had difficulty opening the boxes of cuff links he presented to Oval Office visitors (and thus could be forgiven for forgetting that his voice-activated taping machines were running even at moments when he later wished they hadn't been).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ultimately, the numbers could be on McCain's side, even if the zeroes and ones are not. Census figures show that 64% of American voters cast ballots but that 72% of senior citizens do -- and only a quarter of them use the Internet. Just imagine McCain's next TV ad, keyed to elderly populations and attacking Obama's digital-age fluency: &quot;He fools around with computers -- and annoys people with e-mails!&quot; Savor the scorn!</span></p>
