  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">HERE is a look back at some of the highlights, lowlights and sidelights at the 98th annual conference of the Association of National Advertisers, which 1,200 people attended here last Thursday through Sunday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">HURRICANE, TORNADO, TSUNAMI Concerns about the financial crisis permeated the conference, from the speeches to the conversations at dinner to the talk at the hotel bar.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">''I'm very glad that it's Saturday,'' said Claire Bennett, senior vice president for marketing at American Express, as she began her presentation at a general session. ''There's not going to be much news about the stock market.'' </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When Jez Frampton, chief executive at Interbrand, an Omnicom Group agency, described how his new Best Global Brands study estimated the total value of leading brands at $1.2 trillion, he added, ''That's just about enough to bail out the American banking system.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As Jonah Bloom, editor of the trade publication Advertising Age, started his remarks at a dinner, he looked out at the full ballroom and said, ''I take it you all registered before the economy went south.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">One reason attendance was so high despite the uncertain business climate was that the conference hotel required two nights' deposit and a 30-day notification of cancellation for a full refund. That fine print, said several people who had considered not coming, led them to keep their plans to attend.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The scope of the economic crisis seemed immense enough that attendees needed several ways to describe it. Joseph V. Tripodi, chief marketing and commercial officer at the Coca-Cola Company, likened the situation to ''a Cat 5,'' as in a Category 5 hurricane.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nick Utton, chief marketing officer at E*Trade Financial, upped the ante weatherwise, calling it ''a hurricane, a tsunami and a tornado, all combined.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">NOVEMBER TO REMEMBER The coming presidential election was discussed almost as much as the economy. For instance, Mr. Tripodi began his remarks by declaring: ''I'm not Joe the plumber. I'm Joe the marketer.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Saturday, Joe Trippi, a Democratic consultant debated Tony Blankley, former press secretary for Newt Gingrich, the Republican and former House speaker. Afterward, attendees used instant polling devices to tell how they planned to vote next month.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Seventy percent said they would vote for Senator Barack Obama and 26 percent said they would vote for Senator John McCain. (''Other'' and not voting accounted for the rest.) By comparison, at a dinner at the 94th annual conference in October 2004, 49 percent of those voting said they would support President Bush and 46 percent said they would support the Democratic nominee, Senator John Kerry.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Those who voted for Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama were then asked who they believed would win the election, regardless of whom they supported. The margin for Mr. Obama was even larger, 86 percent to 14 percent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Those outcomes may not have been completely surprising. One attendee was seen carrying a purse with an Obama button. Another attendee wore an Obama football jersey at the hotel pool.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The campaign effort for Mr. Obama also won a vote requested by Mr. Bloom of Advertising Age to decide which of six finalists would be named his publication's marketer of the year. Mr. Obama drew 36.1 percent of that vote. Apple, the 2007 winner, ranked No. 2 with 27.3 percent, and the online retailer Zappos came in third with 14.1 percent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The McCain campaign finished last at 4.5 percent, behind No. 4 Nike (9.4 percent) and No. 5 Coors beer (8.7 percent).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">BROUGHT TO YOU BY For the first time in several years, the number of companies sponsoring the conference -- paying fees that help the association defray the cost of the meeting -- fell compared with the previous year. There were 44, down from 51 in 2007 (and 2006).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Still, their pitches were hard to avoid. The hotel room keys were embossed with ads for DirecTV. Attendees had to walk past a corridor lined with tables of sponsors' wares to enter and leave the general sessions. The large attendance meant hallway gridlock the first couple of days of the conference, much to the delight of sponsors like Google, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and the Magazine Publishers of America.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In another sign of the economic climate, attendees swarmed the shelves that were stocked by the magazine association with free copies of almost 100 publications. Mr. Obama had a strong showing there, too, turning up on the covers of magazines like Creativity, Ladies' Home Journal, Men's Health and Time.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The most popular table may have been the one staffed by a graphologist who analyzed the signatures and handwriting of attendees, courtesy of a company called SAS Customer Intelligence. One attendee was pleased to learn that he was ''wise beyond his years,'' although at age 39 it seemed less of a compliment than if his age had started with a 2.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">JARGON WATCH Each year the conference exposes students of language to the buzzwords and buzzphrases (if that is a word) in vogue among marketers. Among those heard during the speeches this time: ''forward predict'' (as if there could be ''backward predict''), ''stakeholder engagement,'' ''maximizing the shelf sets,'' ''single-point accountability,'' ''enablement experience,'' ''tailored solutions'' and ''relevant touch points'' (as if there could be irrelevant ones).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Also, several buzzwords were used as nouns and verbs, among them ''benchmark,'' ''bonus'' and ''silo.''</span></p>
