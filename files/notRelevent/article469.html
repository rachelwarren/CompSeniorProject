  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It's sometimes hard to remember those early lofty campaign spots for Senator John McCain that put him on a par with Winston Churchill. Nowadays the gathering storm has turned into a gathers-no-moss effort to paint Senator Barack Obama as an ill-mannered sexist who favors sex education for kindergarten children and sends packs of Democratic wolves to gnaw on Gov. Sarah Palin's reputation. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mr. Obama's pitch has devolved just as drastically. He went from gauzy testimonials to his patriotism and Midwestern values to painting Mr. McCain as a lame-brained George W. Bush clone in ads that rework Sam Cooke's ''Wonderful World'' to belittle his rival. (''I'm not up on the economy/Don't know much about industry.'') </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The campaigns spent months and many millions of dollars to produce scores of television spots and Web ads that jumble together in a kaleidoscope of cropped sound bites and long, accusatory freeze frames. The political discourse is so overrun with negative ads and charges of guilt by association that voters can be forgiven for confusing which candidate is supposedly akin to Britney Spears and which one seems too close to President Bush, or who smeared whom with lipstick slurs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And all that 30-second clatter and confusion is what makes the Living Room Candidate so useful at this particular moment in the presidential campaign. The Web site (livingroomcandidate.org), which was created in 2000 by the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens, returns every presidential election cycle with an ever larger collection of political ads dating from 1952 to the present. The 2008 edition, which is scheduled to go online on Friday, allows voters to scan the latest ads, local, national and Web-only, while dipping into the dim electoral past.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It catalogs ads by years, and also by issue (''change'' is big this time around). It also offers instant reality checks: there is a link to Factcheck.org, a nonpartisan watchdog site, which checked the facts on one of the latest McCain attack ads, called ''Fact Check,'' which uses, and apparently misuses, Factcheck.org quotations. (''The ad strives to convey the message that FactCheck.org said 'completely false' attacks on Gov. Sarah Palin had come from Senator Barack Obama,'' Factcheck.org demurred. ''We said no such thing. We have yet to dispute any claim from the Obama campaign about Palin.'')</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Viewers can study those ads for themselves; they can also examine Mr. Obama's attack ad tailored for Ohio, which accuses Mr. McCain of having ''helped pave the way'' for the foreign-owned shipping company DHL to drive out an American company, as well as the anti-Obama spots by a conservative organization that accuse the Illinois senator of having ties to William Ayers, a former '60s radical who helped found the Weather Underground. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Negative ads that melt all degrees of separation seem like an innovation that began with the Willie Hortonization of Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. But that tactic reaches back to 1952, when an ad for Adlai Stevenson warned that Dwight D. Eisenhower would be in the foreign-policy thrall of Senator Robert A. Taft, an isolationist Republican from Ohio: the point is made by two cartoon hearts speared together and a mocking jingle that suggests that ''Ike'' is forever entwined with ''Bob.''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> There are some lost arts, however, notably political jingles. Popular music is mostly used sarcastically nowadays, but there was a time when it was used to pep up voters. Even in the cool, stylish age of ''Mad Men,'' John F. Kennedy ran a 1960 ad with music that sounded like the theme of a wacky early-'60s sitcom: ''Do you want a man for president who's seasoned through and through/But not so doggoned seasoned that he won't try something new?''</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Living Room Candidate might seem obsolete in the age of YouTube and campaign sites that post every speech and advertising message. But it's more valuable now than ever, serving as both clearinghouse and curator. It provides voters with historical context and full disclosure: it distinguishes ads that are created by the candidate's official team from proxy attacks paid for by nonprofit but highly partisan political organizations -- a technique now known by the 2004 term ''Swiftboating.'' In this cycle, however, the campaigns have proved less squeamish than ever before and are perfectly happy to level the silliest charges in their own names. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> This election's model is updated for the iTunes epoch as well. There are playlists, favorite ads by commentators who add their expertise or personal opinions to the mix. John Dickerson, a political correspondent for Slate, states that ''our presidential ads today are less tough and less fair,'' and includes on his playlist a 1964 ad by Barry Goldwater that cross-cuts American schoolchildren reciting the Pledge of Allegiance before the classroom flag with the Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev saying, ''We will bury you,'' in a 1956 speech to Westerners. (Though even then, Mr. Khrushchev complained that his threat was taken out of context.) </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In an election in which warring blogs, talk radio and 24-hour cable news opinionators blur the news, the Living Room Candidate is a state-of-the-art site that provides an old-fashioned, impartial and lingering look at the most partisan and quicksilver weapon in politics.</span></p>
