  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When the topic is abortion, Palin is the radical</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As the McCain campaign grows increasingly desperate, it has openly embraced the strategy of smearing Barack Obama, with Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin leading the charge in front of increasingly thuggish crowds. Their utter shamelessness in all this is appalling, and says as much about their moral character as about how few substantive ideas they have to offer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">First there was Palin's recycled nonsense about Obama &quot;palling around with terrorists,&quot; and now she is claiming that he is a radical on abortion. The true radical on this issue is, of course, Palin herself, who believes abortion should be illegal even in the case of rape.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In her view, the government should have the right to dictate to a rape victim that she will carry her rapist's fetus to term. That is an extremist, profoundly anti-freedom position and is far more radical than any position Obama holds on any issue. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The true moderates on abortion are the ones who (unlike Palin) support forms of sex education that will actually reduce, rather than increase, abortions, and who recognize the complexities of the moral and legal issues, as reflected in the moderate, compromise position of Roe v. Wade.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Not politics, but a defense of faith</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: &quot;Don't play politics with prayer,&quot; Oct. 10 commentary (criticizing a recent flap over a Virginia State Police decision to require nondenominational prayers):</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As a minister, Nelson Harris's passion should be to lead people to faith in Jesus Christ.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This has nothing to do with politics or a partisan agenda. This is an attack on our religious freedom in this country. As a nation we can not reject Jesus Christ and expect God to bless us. It will not happen.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's own ego has caused him to 'cave'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am a 1964 U.S. Naval Academy graduate and was a Navy pilot. I flew combat support missions in Vietnam. Politically, I have been a lifelong Republican. Given this background, one might expect me to be a John McCain supporter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In truth, I strongly oppose McCain for president. Why? McCain has long stressed strength of character, including integrity, honesty and competence. He reportedly suffered at the hands of his Vietnamese captors. Supposedly, it was strength of character that permitted him to survive without &quot;caving.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Where now is his character? McCain has demonstrated the willingness, even eagerness to lie, deceive and smear his political opponent in order to win the election. I surmise that lust for the presidency has caused McCain's moral collapse.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ironically, his ego and self-absorption have caused him to compromise his integrity and truthfulness. He has &quot;caved,&quot; something his wartime captors were unable to cause.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Competence? The singular act of choosing the supremely unqualified Sarah Palin as his running mate is a consummate example of McCain's incompetence. It also suggests a disdain for the intelligence of voters and callous disregard for the welfare of our country.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Media aren't looking for dirt on the Dems</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I find it hard to believe that the news media can find all sorts of garbage about McCain/Palin but Obama/Biden are perfect. Could it be that the media are trying to influence the election? What happened to reporting the news and not making the news?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: &quot;McCain offers a clear choice to Western Virginia,&quot; Oct. 9 commentary by Jerry Kilgore:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I question John McCain's &quot;independent streak&quot; and Southwest Virginia's desire to have no interference from government.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Our financial crisis hurts Southwest Virginia, too, and President Bush says it's the fault of poor regulation. Now we'll pay $700 billion to recover.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clean coal is a dream. The cost ($1,800-plus/kw hour) is more than extracting and refining oil. Estimates put its commercial viability and widely adopted use at 2020 or 2025.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Coal mining in Southwest Virginia is not a big deal. Miners know coal is on the way out. United Mine Workers President Cecil Roberts enthusiastically endorses Barack Obama. West Virginia voters support energy independence through wind and solar power, according to Opinion Research Corp.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Second Amendment is the law of the land. No president can change it. Obama is on record that he supports the Second Amendment and will not take away guns. He is also on record saying he supports the Supreme Court decision to knock down the D.C. gun ban. Gun enthusiasts seem to have only one issue. They sound like Gov. Sarah Palin: &quot;sound and fury, signifying nothing.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Respect for McCain died with attacks</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I liked, respected and admired Sen. John McCain. I respected his ability to tell it like it is. I admired his courage and knew in my heart that I would never have survived that cell in Hanoi.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I was impressed with the things he was able to accomplish in a bipartisan way. And in the scrambled spectacle that was the early days of campaigning, McCain stood out as one of that motley bunch you could imagine being president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That was then. This is now. My stomach turns when I watch those fired-up rallies where the visceral hate for Sen. Barack Obama is fanned until someone in the rabid crowd screams, &quot;Kill him.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Just when you hope you may have seen the worst of those despicable 30-second diatribes of fetid rhetoric that pass for campaign commercials, up pops another one to soil the TV screen. Sadly, McCain has become a sorry caricature of his own worst self -- a frustrated, angry, unstable, desperate old man.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What is truly terrifying in all this, however, is to contemplate, if you dare, that which is but a heartbeat away.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Racist vitriol is so 1960s</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's hard to believe that, in 2008, regular people are standing up in front of TV cameras at John McCain rallies shouting racial epithets and threatening the life of Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I'm sure none of those people would consider themselves racist. It's just that they couldn't stand to live in an America where someone who doesn't have lily white skin like theirs might be president -- which is sort of the same thing, isn't it? Welcome back to the 1960s.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If anyone reading this has the least hesitation about voting for Obama simply because his skin is a different tone from theirs, I encourage them to stay home on Nov. 4. If race, skin color, the name his parents gave him or false statements about his religious preference are what are going to guide your hand in the election booth, please, stay home.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If you do have doubts, but you can do some serious soul-searching between now and Nov. 4 and you can come to the conclusion that it's the person and his or her experience, policies and plans that matters, then by all means, please vote -- for Obama.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cut the price, and increase circulation</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You all are getting ready to get a lesson in Reaganomics versus Obamomics. When you raise the price of the paper from 50 cents to 75 cents, I will not buy one every day as I currently do. Other people will not either.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Circulation will fall. Ad revenue and circulation revenue will fall. Profits will fall. More cost-cutting measures will be needed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But, suppose you cut the price of the paper to 25 cents. More people would buy the paper. (I imagine a whole lot more would buy it if not for the marked liberal bias.) Ad revenue goes up. Things are better. It worked for both Reagan and Bush. You could look it up if you don't believe me.</span></p>
