  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama sought to score a post-debate advantage Saturday by traveling to two Republican-leaning states and accusing GOP rival John McCain of being out of touch with middle-class Americans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We talked about the economy for 40 minutes, and not once did Sen ator McCain talk about the struggles middle-class families are having,&quot; Obama told more than 26,000 people who stood out in the rain with him on the campus of the University of Mary Washington. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While Obama was out campaigning, McCain stayed in the Washington, D.C., area monitoring by phone the congressional negotiations on a deal to stabilize U.S. financial markets.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama did this monitoring while on the campaign trial, with aides saying he spoke by phone to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., as negotiators inched toward a deal.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Unlike Sen ator McCain, it didn't take a crisis on Wall Street for me to realize that people are hurting,&quot; Obama said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain harshly criticized Obama's debate performance Saturday in a speech to the U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It wasn't such a good night for my opponent,&quot; McCain said, saying, among other things, that Obama was trying to use the looming market meltdown for political gain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It was clear that Senator Obama still sees the financial crisis in America as a national problem to be exploited first and solved later,&quot; McCain said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama returned to Washington on Saturday night for a Congressional Black Caucus dinner before taking off again to day for campaign stops in Michigan, a crucial battleground state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Earlier Saturday, Obama debuted his post-debate attack on McCain with a campaign swing through North Carolina, another traditionally Republican state, like Virginia, where Obama hopes to make inroads.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Illinois senator repeatedly took McCain to task for not talking about any plans to help the middle class in the midst of the country's financial and fiscal crisis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Through 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but he didn't have anything to say about you,&quot; Obama told the cheering 20,000-plus crowd at the J.&nbsp;Douglas Galyon Depot in downtown Greensboro. &quot;He didn't even say the words 'middle class.' He didn't even say the words 'working people.'\&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama campaign tried to back up that point in its newest ad, a spot released Saturday that also notes that McCain didn't mention the middle class during the debate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;McCain doesn't get it,&quot; the announcer says. &quot;Barack Obama does.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's campaign suggested Saturday that the Arizona senator had referred to the middle class in the debate when he argued that Obama had voted in favor of higher taxes on families making $42,000 a year and proposed hundreds of billions in spending that would burden families and businesses. Obama disputed both of those assertions and said that 95 percent of American taxpayers would not pay more in taxes under his plan.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If he was honest, Barack Obama knows he was unable to debate the merits of supporting higher taxes on the middle class, and bloated government spending during a looming economic crisis - it simply proved indefensible last night,&quot; McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds said in a statement.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Appearing with Obama on Saturday, running mate Joe Biden called McCain's judgment wrong on every important issue .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;At this moment in history, we need more than a brave soldier. We need a wise leader, and that man is Barack Obama,&quot; said Biden, a Delaware senator.</span></p>
