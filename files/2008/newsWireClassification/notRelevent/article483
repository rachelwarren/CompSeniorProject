  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The nation's yearlong housing and financial markets crisis entered a new and unprecedented stage this weekend as the Treasury Department prepared to take control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to ensure that Americans can continue to have easy access to cheap mortgage credit.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Attempts by Freddie Mac, the more troubled of the two mortgage-finance giants, to raise money in private markets have faltered in recent weeks since the Treasury pushed through legislation enabling it to provide the mortgage agencies with a financial backstop. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Freddie's wavering fortunes, combined with escalating default rates on home loans, have forced up the cost of mortgages and held back the struggling housing market.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a dramatic attempt to break the downward spiral in the credit and housing markets, the Treasury has informed Fannie and Freddie that it will take control of the agencies and provide regular cash infusions as necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of the mortgage markets, according to government and Wall Street sources who have been briefed on the plan.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Treasury's move, which exposes taxpayers to an estimated $25 billion to $100 billion in costs, is expected as soon as Sunday. The structure and extent of the intervention was not clear, one official said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain and his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, effectively confirmed the imminent bailout during a rally Saturday in Colorado Springs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Associated Press said he cited the problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as yet another example of the nation's economic problems: &quot;Today, we're looking at a federal bailout of our home-loan agencies.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mrs. Palin, at the same rally, suggested a McCain administration would scale back the two companies. &quot;They've gotten too big and too expensive to the taxpayers. The McCain-Palin administration will make them smaller and smarter and more effective for homeowners who need help.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama, campaigning Saturday in Terre Haute, Ind., said he had been briefed on the plan Friday night by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama said the plan must put taxpayers first and not reward investors and speculators &quot;who relied on the government to reap massive profits,&quot; according to the AP. But he said he would withhold judgment until he sees details of the program.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Altogether, the two mortgage giants own or guarantee more than half of U.S. mortgages, and their importance increased greatly this year after the private market for mortgages imploded. Fannie and Freddie currently fund around three-quarters of all mortgages in the country, making them indispensable to the economy in the eyes of Mr. Paulson.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Treasury's action is expected to wipe out most of the value of Fannie and Freddie common stock, a government official said. The status of the companies' other obligations was not clear.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As a condition of taking what the Treasury hopes will be temporary control of the agencies, the government will insist on the departure of Fannie Mae Chief Executive Daniel Mudd and Freddie Mac Chief Executive Richard Syron, both highly paid executives who have been unable to turn the companies around as they sank deeper into the mortgage morass this year. The Treasury also will oust the companies' boards of directors and senior management.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sung Won Sohn, economics professor at California State University, said the government has to shore up Fannie and Freddie not only to prop up the housing and mortgage markets, but to protect the nation's increasingly fragile banks and other institutions that are heavily invested in mortgages and real estate. Several U.S. banks have gone under this year in California and other areas experiencing serious housing busts.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Some sort of government assistance is desperately needed. It is not just Fannie and Freddie the government has to worry about. Almost every financial institution, including commercial banks, own significant amounts of mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the two,&quot; Mr. Sohn said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fannie and Freddie's obligations also are widely held worldwide by foreign central banks and investors. The Bank of China and the Bank of Japan have some of the biggest holdings. But recent auctions of Freddie's debt have shown that foreigners have grown more reluctant to lend the mortgage agencies money on the lenient terms of the past.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The temporary takeover of the agencies, which was authorized by Congress this summer, is the best way to try to nurse them and the mortgage market back to health, Mr. Sohn said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Full nationalization of the firms with their $5.2 trillion in debts would be unwise, he said, because among other things, it would nearly double U.S. debt obligations and put pressure on the government's own impeccable credit ratings. &quot;Some worry Uncle Sam could be downgraded,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. last week cited the growing problems of Fannie, Freddie and other U.S. financial institutions as a remote &quot;risk&quot; to the country's AAA ratings. It estimated that the cost of propping up the financial system in a &quot;deep and prolonged recession&quot; could be as much as a quarter of U.S. economic output, or about $3 trillion.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The probability of a portion of this potential cost being realized has risen,&quot; said S&amp;P credit analyst Nikola Swann. &quot;Most notably, falling house prices and rising mortgage delinquencies have raised the odds that the government will have to provide direct assistance&quot; to the Federal Housing Administration as well as Fannie and Freddie, she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While Fannie Mae is thought to be in better condition than Freddie Mac, with fewer subprime loans on its books, it has been hit increasingly by defaults on prime mortgages in areas of Florida, California and Nevada, where home prices have fallen by as much as 50 percent and people are choosing to walk away from their homes and mortgage obligations. Recent estimates show that nearly one in 10 U.S. mortgages is behind payment or in foreclosure.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Even though Fannie Mae has had less trouble than Freddie Mac raising funds in the equity and debt markets, Joshua Rosner, managing director at Graham Fisher &amp; Co., a Wall Street firm, said the government cannot just take control of one firm without putting the other at an instant disadvantage in the funding markets. That is why the Treasury is preparing to take over both, he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Rosner said that Fannie Mae's losses are likely to grow because it purchased many poorly underwritten loans from Countrywide, formerly the top mortgage lender, which went down in flames last year and was purchased by Bank of America. He estimated that nearly a third of the mortgages Fannie bought last year were made by Countrywide, and they are experiencing high default rates.</span></p>
