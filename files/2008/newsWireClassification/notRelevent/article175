  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nearly 60 million viewers watched the third and final -- and most contentious -- debate between presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Which, yes, means the faceoff you most wanted to see this election year was the one between vice presidential candidates Joseph Biden and Sarah Palin. It clocked more than 73 million viewers, and was the second-most-watched debate in U.S. history, presidential or vice presidential.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wednesday's final debate, from Hofstra University, did not amass the 66 million viewers who watched the second debate. But that town-hall-style event was held just a week after the highly anticipated and much-watched veep faceoff and in the early electrifying days of the Wall Street meltdown.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The least-watched Republican vs. Democrat debate of this election was the first, which logged 55 million viewers. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wednesday's debate, in which the two candidates for the first time sat spitting distance from each other, might have drawn a bigger crowd had it not run up against Fox's broadcast of a championship-deciding Game 5 between Los Angeles and Philadelphia -- those teams' cities being the country's second- and fourth-largest TV markets.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Though CBS News's Bob Schieffer moderated, CBS's coverage attracted the fewest viewers among the major broadcasters, 9.2 million. ABC logged 10.6 million; NBC led with 11.3 million.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fox News Channel enjoyed its biggest debate crowd of this cycle, 9.1 million viewers. Another 8.9 million went with CNN and 3.7 million chose MSNBC.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The overall tally also includes Univision, CNBC, BBC America, MUN2, Telemundo and PBS. PBS estimates are not included in Nielsen's stats, but the public television network provides its own audience estimate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* * *</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Major League Baseball has agreed to postpone the first pitch of Game 6 of the World Series (should the game be needed) by about 15 minutes to enable Fox to join CBS and NBC in running Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama 's 30-minute message to voters Oct. 29.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That leaves only ABC among the major broadcast networks still undecided as to whether it will let Obama's campaign buy the 8 p.m. half-hour slot on its prime-time schedule.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Fox will accommodate Senator Obama's desire to communicate with voters in this long-form format,&quot; the network said in a statement. &quot;If requested, the network would be willing to make similar time available to Senator McCain's campaign.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fox is contractually obligated to carry the game if this year's World Series comes to that.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's campaign is ponying up just shy of $1 million each to NBC and CBS for the half-hour buy. The camp likely would pay a similar amount to Fox. That's considerably less than NBC and CBS would otherwise get for the 10 or 11 ad &quot;units&quot; they run during that half-hour. But Obama is not getting a price break; the campaign will be charged what's called the &quot;lowest unit cost&quot; in compliance with federal law.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ABC and Obama's camp are still in talks about whether the network will make available the time slot, which would enable the candidate to create a so-called &quot;roadblock&quot; on the broadcast networks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With those networks these days accounting for only about half the audience watching TV at any given time, it's a less dramatic programming stunt than it would have been a decade or so ago, but pretty dramatic nonetheless.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ABC has scheduled an episode of its struggling dramedy series &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot; at 8 that night. The show is one of last year's freshman series hurt by the writers' strike; ABC is trying to relaunch it this fall, but so far without much luck. ABC execs may believe there is opportunity for &quot;Daisies&quot; to get more sampling if the network does not join in the Obama buy, particularly now that Game 6 would not start until 8:35 p.m. -- more than halfway through the &quot;Daisies&quot; broadcast.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* * *</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain, so pugnacious in his encounters with his Democratic rival, folded like a tent when confronted last night by late-night host David Letterman, whom McCain stood up last month.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I screwed up,&quot; McCain said of his last-minute decision to cancel his appearance on CBS's &quot;Late Show&quot; last month, forcing Letterman to scramble to find a replacement guest.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Letterman, who's been laying into McCain every night since then, started in immediately last night when the candidate walked onstage at the Ed Sullivan Theater.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Can you stay?&quot; he asked, dripping cynicism.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Depends on how bad it gets,&quot; McCain answered.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The candidate admitted he &quot;screwed up&quot; but bravely tried to suggest he'd done Letterman a favor by backing out of his previous date.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Look at all the conversations I gave you . . . including having Mr. Olbermann on.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(MSNBC on-air talent Keith Olbermann, who had filled in after McCain told Letterman he had to rush back to Washington to save the melting-down economy, though he in fact went to be interviewed by Katie Couric, was shown standing in readiness backstage at yesterday's taping should McCain bail a second time.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I haven't had so much fun since my last interrogation,&quot; said McCain, a Vietnam War POW.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With regard to the current economic situation, which McCain stood up Letterman to return to Washington to fix, the candidate said Americans are &quot;the victims of a drive-by shooting by Washington and Wall Street.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Really?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Now's not the time to raise anybody's taxes -- except yours, and I guarantee when I'm president I'll do it,&quot; McCain told Letterman.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After that, the interview got a lot more heated:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Letterman pressed McCain for details about his debate remark that he knows how to get Osama bin Laden.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;In 19 days. I'll be elected . . . look --&quot; McCain tried to joke.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Bin Laden. Let's just start there,&quot; Letterman persisted.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;First of all, obviously, you don't want to say exactly, but the point --&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;But you have a plan,&quot; Letterman said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I know what we need to do, okay?&quot; McCain responded. &quot;. . . I think I know, because of my many years being involved in these issues, how to develop a plan. One of the areas, of course, is human intelligence, which we're very badly lacking. And I am confident that we can get him.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain also said Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was &quot;absolutely&quot; his &quot;first choice&quot; for vice president, while adding, &quot;I didn't know her well at all -- I knew her by reputation.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But is Palin &quot;the woman to lead us through the next 9/11 attack,&quot; Letterman wondered.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Absolutely,&quot; McCain said. &quot;She has inspired Americans. That's the thing we need.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After discussing Barack Obama's relationship with former Weather Underground member William Ayers, Letterman brought up McCain's relationship with G. Gordon Liddy, convicted in the Watergate scandal.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I met him, you know, I mean,&quot; McCain said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Didn't you attend a fundraiser at his house?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Gordon Liddy's?&quot; McCain asked.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They cut to commercial.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Coming back, McCain said, &quot;I know Gordon Liddy. He paid his debt, he went to prison, he paid his debt. . . . I'm not in any way embarrassed to know Gordon Liddy.&quot;</span></p>
