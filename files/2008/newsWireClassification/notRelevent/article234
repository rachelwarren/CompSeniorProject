  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Get tougher on crimes committed against civilians</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The article about Ryan Jason Sink, charged with assaulting a 16-year-old girl at Valley View, is a telling example of how the criminal justice system is tilted against our most vulnerable citizens (&quot;Man jailed following assault at mall,&quot; Sept. 30 news story).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The article indicated he had been charged with raping an unarmed woman at gunpoint in a garage in Roanoke in 2006. He successfully plea bargained and was convicted of sexual battery. The resulting sentence was a whopping six months in prison. This put him right back out on the street, and now he is accused of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old at Valley View.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If Sink had used a gun to assault an armed and trained Roanoke police officer in 2006, do you think we would have been worried about seeing him at Valley View in 2008? Do you think he would have been able to plead down? Do you think he would have been given the minimum sentence? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I'm not advocating a reduction in penalties for assaulting a police officer, but when are we going to provide our women and children the same protection as a cop?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Either choice leads to socialism</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's amazing anyone could be undecided about this election. We have two options and neither one is good.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Those who want the fast track to socialism and mediocrity can vote for Barack Obama and his minions; those who want the slow boat can vote for John McCain and his.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We are a mediocre nation on a downward slide. And when things go awry, it's always the private sector or capitalism to blame, never the largess or morass of bureaucracy of the feds.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ronald Reagan was right: Government is the problem. The federal government is involved in every aspect of our lives and Obama wants even more. The continual giveaways of tax money as stimulus and transfer of wealth from one class to another is crippling this country and stifling productivity.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As we continue down this road, we'll be nothing more than your typical, nondescript socialist European country without the will to do or stop anything. The country is so split in ideology that neither candidate can nor will bring us together.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Partisan, yes; undecided, no. You really can't be, since there are such two distinct choices: fast track or slow track.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain isn't just one of the guys</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It is said that people voted for President Bush because he was the kind of guy they'd like to have a beer with. Well, good luck. Aside from the fact that Bush no longer drinks, the man is an aristocrat. His pals aren't beer drinkers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sure, he says &quot;ain't&quot; a lot. But he is from a long line of very wealthy people. Bush, like the Bushes before him, went to Yale. Unlike Barack Obama at Harvard, he did not qualify for a scholarship.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now John McCain is selling himself as another regular guy, a populist. His father and his grandfather were admirals, the aristocrats of the U.S. Navy -- gentlemen who probably never popped a pop top.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Maybe you aren't bothered by McCain's record of protecting his wealthy pals. Maybe -- even as our economy burns like napalm over the jungle -- it doesn't bother you that McCain was opposed to regulating Wall Street.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Vote for him because you prefer his skin color, or his war record, or you think old people are smarter than young people. But -- if you make under $5 million a year -- please don't vote for McCain because you think he'd like to have a beer with you.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Blame lawmakers for flap over fees</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Molly Meador's article &quot;Lack of fee money creates shortfall for electives&quot; (Sept. 24 The Edge section) mentions all the players in the recent controversy over charging unlawful school fees save the most influential one -- the Virginia General Assembly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">No one -- least of all public education advocates -- wants to see teachers fret over inadequate supplies or pick up the tab themselves. But the blame for any shortfall in resources falls squarely at the feet of the General Assembly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Virginia is the fifth wealthiest state in the nation, but only 33rd when it comes to investing in education at the state level. It's clear that lean times are ahead and that the stumbling economy is outside anyone's control, but the state's decisions on the revenue side have also helped bring us into the red.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roanoke County Public Schools were right to stop charging illegal fees. And they were right to provide waivers of other fees to make sure no child is forced to miss an activity or choose an elective based on what she can afford.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It is up to the rest of us to make sure the state provides the resources teachers need to provide high quality instruction.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Finding a scapegoat who's too convenient</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arthur Nunn tells us we should blame Congress for the current banking meltdown, and he points to several reasons as proof (&quot;Place blame squarely on Congress,&quot; Sept. 25 commentary).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He first cites the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. Then-President Carter (how convenient for Republicans) apparently saw fit to enact a law to help the poor. He did this by lowering some requirements for them to qualify for a mortgage.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nunn apparently makes a connection between a law passed decades ago that had worked well through four presidents' administrations and the failures of the current administration.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nunn also neglects to mention that 80 percent of the current subprime loans were through lending institutions that had no affiliation with the Community Reinvestment Act. Next, Republicans will be telling us that House Bill S. 190 or Senate Bill HR 1461 could have averted this mess. Not likely. But they need to blame somebody.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Warner's talent was for raising taxes</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The main thrust of the Mark Warner campaign message is the untruth that he had to rescue the state government from a fiscal crisis caused by his predecessor. However, responsible news media in the state quickly acknowledged soon after Warner had used the fiscal crisis he conjured up to gain office, and had conned legislators to later pass a tax increase, that the fiscal crisis was largely a fiction.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Worse, however, was placing the crown of executive talent on his own head for having solved the crisis. It takes no executive ability to reconcile a budget disparity (real or perceived) by raising taxes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Real executive skill, leadership and respect for the Virginia taxpayer would have been exhibited by working with the various spending entities to cut their budgets to conform to the money available (as he saw it).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Warner is one of those politicians of the Kennedy ilk. Boyish good looks, above-average oratorical skills, large personal fortune and a desire, perhaps, to achieve a place in history largely at the expense of the public purse. Jim Gilmore deserves to be elected to the United States Senate.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Goode's ad doesn't reflect well on him</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: &quot;Candidates clash over TV ad's content&quot; (Sept. 30 news story):</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What does Virgil Goode's most recent television ad say about his character? If he is willing to distort Tom Perriello's image in such a way as to conjure up fears of a Muslim, Hispanic or Taliban candidate, how can we trust what he says about Perriello's positions or his own record?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">One example: Perriello attended college in New York; he is not a New York lawyer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At this time in our country when cooperation, understanding and honesty are paramount to our well-being and security, can we afford to have someone as divisive as Goode representing the 5th District?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Take some time to read Perriello's record at perrielloforcongress.com. Examine his work in this country and Africa to bring people together and solve problems. Contrast that with Goode's poor judgment about this ad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You also might want to ask Goode why he suddenly backed out of a debate with Perriello that had been scheduled for six months.</span></p>
