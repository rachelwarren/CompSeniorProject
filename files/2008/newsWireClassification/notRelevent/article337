  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> WASHINGTON - Pay a lobbying firm $15,000 a month for several years to do no lobbying. Pay a former campaign aide to John McCain $30,000 a month for five years after the senator's failed bid in 2000 for the presidency.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At any other time, it would be business as usual in Washington. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Not today. The money came from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two failed housing giants that are a huge part of the financial crisis imperiling the economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And the recipient of most of the funds is Rick Davis, the current campaign manager for McCain, the Republican presidential nominee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;The payments are for 'access insurance' with the Republican Party and with someone very close to McCain,&quot; James Thurber, director of American University's Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies, said yesterday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain has tied Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama to Fannie and Freddie's troubles and has called on Jim Johnson and Franklin Raines - both Obama supporters and former Fannie Mae executives - to return large golden-parachute payments they received from the corporations after leaving.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain's campaign released a new television ad that says Raines is among those advising Obama on housing policy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama's campaign released a statement from Raines, who says he is not an Obama adviser.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama criticizes McCain: Obama said yesterday in Florida that McCain may criticize Wall Street executives now but failed to speak out against their huge salaries a year ago and still backs policies that favor the wealthy over working families.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;He's suddenly a hard-charging populist, and that's all well and good,&quot; Obama told a crowd of about 11,000 people.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;But I sure wish he was talking the same way over a year ago, when I introduced a bill that would've helped stop the multimillion-dollar bonus packages that CEOs grab on their way out the door.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama's bill was not approved.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Illinois senator also said he &quot;blew the whistle&quot; on big severance packages for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives after the government took control of the mortgage giants this month.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Palin's warning: Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin said yesterday that the United States could be headed for another Great Depression if Congress doesn't act on the financial crisis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Palin made the comment in an interview with CBS Evening News anchor Katie Couric while visiting New York City to meet foreign leaders for the first time in her political career. The leaders are in the city for the United Nations General Assembly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Asked whether there's a risk of another Great Depression if Congress doesn't approve a proposed $700 billion bailout package, Palin said, &quot;Unfortunately, that is the road that America may find itself on.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Palin said the answer to the financial crisis doesn't necessarily have to be the bailout plan that the Bush administration has proposed, but that it should be some form of bipartisan action to reform Wall Street.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Biden in Cincinnati: Democratic vice presidential nominee Joseph R. Biden Jr. yesterday questioned McCain's judgment to be commander in chief. He argued that the Republican would keep digging the United States into a hole of isolation and insecurity.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Nothing is more important than judgment,&quot; Biden said. &quot;But time and again, on the most critical national-security issues of our time, John McCain's judgment was wrong.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Biden listed several examples of what he described as McCain's wrong judgment, such as his contention that the U.S. would be greeted as liberators in Iraq and that the Persian Gulf nation is the central front in the war on terrorism.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Biden argued that the next president should focus the full U.S. might on al-Qaida in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</span></p>
