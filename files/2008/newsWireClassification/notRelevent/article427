  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Barack Obama brought his newly aggressive campaign against Republican opponent John McCain to an open-air rally here, castigating the senator from Arizona as a latecomer to the cause of change and imploring about 8,000 Granite State citizens to ignore the GOP's barrage of negative attacks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The McCain-Palin ticket, they don't want to debate the Obama-Biden ticket on the issues, because they're running on eight more years,&quot; Obama said under a sunny sky at Veterans Memorial Park. &quot;They will try to distort my record, and they will try to undermine your trust in what the Democrats want to do. . . . But the times are too serious for those strategies to work this time.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After a long period of focusing his attention on more intimate events in high school gyms and work sites that communicated the feel of a candidate meeting face-to-face with voters, Obama returned to large crowds with the Manchester rally. The McCain campaign had long criticized such big events as a form of &quot;celebrity&quot; worship but has itself adopted the format since the addition of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to the Republican ticket.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Saturday's event was toned down as Hurricane Ike ravaged Texas. An appearance by running mate Joseph R. Biden Jr. was scrapped. A scheduled appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; was canceled.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama opened his rally here with an appeal for help for the Red Cross and hurricane victims in Texas. &quot;During difficult times, during moments of tragedy, the American people come together,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But unlike his response during Hurricane Gustav, Obama did not declare a temporary cease-fire -- an acknowledgment of the shifting dynamics of the presidential campaign since the end of the Democratic convention. Instead, Obama quickly pivoted from sympathy for the victims of Ike to a more aggressive speech focused squarely on the struggling economy, saying that &quot;there are a lot of quiet storms going on all across America&quot; in the form of job losses, spiraling health-care and college costs, and schools that are &quot;underfunded and uninspired.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;People are concerned not just for their immediate well-being, but they're concerned about what happened to that promise, what happened to that dream? Are we going to be the first generation that passes on a country that is a little less prosperous, a little less unified and a little meaner than the last generation?&quot; he said, intoning the phrase that has become his theme since the Democratic convention. &quot;We are here to say enough is enough.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain, who was off the campaign trail Saturday, issued a statement about Hurricane Ike expressing concern that &quot;there may have been a substantial loss of life.&quot; He added: &quot;We do know that the economic impact from this storm will be severe. . . . But our priority now must be to help the relief effort in any way we can, and to pray for the safety of those in the storm's path.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Meanwhile, his campaign, under fire for the negative tone it has employed over the last week, tried to shift that criticism to Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It says a lot about Barack Obama's judgment that while his campaign canceled his appearance on 'Saturday Night Live' and his running mate stayed home, Obama went ahead and delivered a series of scathing personal attacks,&quot; said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds, calling the speech &quot;a new low.&quot; McCain was off the campaign trail on Saturday but also planned to stump in New Hampshire on Sunday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama campaign did not let up.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We will take no lectures from John McCain, who is cynically running the sleaziest and least honorable campaign in modern presidential campaign history,&quot; said Obama spokesman Bill Burton.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As the senator from Illinois spoke, the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee officially highlighted a campaign commercial castigating McCain as a tool of Washington lobbyists. &quot;His campaign manager lobbies for corporations outsourcing American jobs,&quot; the ad states, flashing an image of McCain with top aide Rick Davis. &quot;The campaign chairman he picked last year . . . a bank lobbyist,&quot; it continues, with an image of McCain and former Texas senator Phil Gramm. &quot;If seven of McCain's top advisers are lobbyists, who do you think will run his White House?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod insisted that Palin has energized conservative Republicans mainly in Republican states that were going to vote for McCain regardless of whom he selected.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;There's not going to be a person in America who by the end of these next weeks will not understand who represents change and who represents more of the same,&quot; Axelrod boasted.</span></p>
