  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Oct. 23--RADFORD -- You can learn a lot from a logo.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sam Brownback's presidential campaign probably didn't have a lot of surplus cash. Fred Thompson has worked in movies. Rudy Giuliani has a pretty high opinion of himself. Jim Gilmore apparently liked Wesley Clark's 2004 logo because he pretty much copied it in 2008.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It wasn't an exact copy. Gilmore gave himself one more star than the four-star general. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And one other thing: At least in this election cycle, successful candidates have successful logos.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When Radford University professor John O'Connor led his intermediate design class through a discussion and evaluation of presidential logos on Tuesday, two weeks before the election, he repeatedly urged them to keep politics out of it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We're not electing the president in here today,&quot; O'Connor said. &quot;We're just deciding who has the best logo.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The evaluations seemed politics-free, but they weren't always friendly as the logos flashed on a screen at the front of the class.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fred Thompson's logo: &quot;Anybody think that looks like a license plate?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mike Huckabee: &quot;Looks like he's running for sheriff.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dennis Kucinich: &quot;This looks like a coupon you'd put in the Sunday paper or something.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tom Vilsack's logo -- with a giant extra &quot;V&quot; -- reminded the students of a movie poster.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So did Giuliani's bold white &quot;RUDY&quot; on a field of blue.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The eagle on Mitt Romney's logo put them in mind of the U.S. Postal Service.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The students rated the logos of each 2008 presidential candidate on their use of type, graphics, color and composition. Each student rated each category on a scale of 1 to 5.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barack Obama and John McCain were at the top of the heap -- with nearly identical scores. Hillary Clinton was the second-highest ranking Democrat. Gilmore was the No. 2 Republican.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Craig Brians, associate professor of political science at Virginia Tech, said he's not surprised Obama and McCain would have the best logos. They have the money to hire the best designers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This is not a cause,&quot; Brians said. &quot;This is an effect.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Logos spread across yard signs and bumper stickers and popping up briefly at the end of videos and televisions commercials won't have anywhere near the impact as the commercials themselves, Brians said. What the news media say will have even more impact.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">O'Connor agreed, to a point.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A well-done logo gives the image of a well-run, well-funded campaign. A poorly-done logo can send the opposite message. And the message a campaign logo carries is important, he said, in part because it is on all those things that represent and identify a candidate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's basically your signature,&quot; O'Connor said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A great logo might not save a campaign, but a bad logo certainly won't help.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We're looking at it purely from a visual communication point of view,&quot; O'Connor said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When O'Connor's students ranked the Obama/Biden logo and the McCain/Palin logo, the Democrats came out ahead -- but just barely.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The dominant Obama/Biden element is a stylized &quot;O.&quot; It evokes a sunrise over a flowed field while suggesting the U.S. flag with its red-and-white stripes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Benjamin Rush, a senior, liked it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I really thought it was really clever that they had the sunrise with the field,&quot; Rush said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But he's still voting for McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Junior Charron Leeper had a completely different take.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;McCain really leaped out,&quot; she said. The McCain/Palin logo exuded strength, confidence and boldness in her opinion. &quot;It seemed like he really knew what he wanted.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Leeper wants Obama in the White House.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She planned to mail her absentee ballot after class.</span></p>
