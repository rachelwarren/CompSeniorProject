  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Osama's good laugh</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Somewhere out there, probably deep in a cave along the Afghan-Pakistani border, Osama bin Laden is laughing. He is having a great belly laugh and rubbing his hands together. Pirate chieftains in Somalia, Indonesia and elsewhere are also laughing and rubbing their hands together. What do they have to laugh and be happy about?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">American disunity. They must be enjoying every minute of seeing people lined up, left and right, screaming garbage at each other. They realize they don't need to attack us now; we're tearing ourselves apart from within. This is looking more and more like their ultimate dream: America's economy is falling apart, joblessness is soaring, more Americans are getting sick from poor health care, our education system is a mess, we keep allowing illegal aliens and drugs into our country, we keep talking democracy to other countries while we slam them if they don't elect people we like, and our infrastructure is falling apart. Yet what are they seeing on TV, the Internet and radio?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">People complaining about how short-tempered and old John McCain is and how inexperienced Barack Obama is, not to mention his religious beliefs. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They've got to be sitting back there in their hideouts enjoying every minute of this. They are seeing what looks like the seeds of America falling completely apart -- and that the American people don't even recognize it. Nope, Americans would rather shout and scream ridiculous accusations at the presidential and vice presidential candidates and ignore the issues that are tearing the country apart.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What once made America strong -- our unity, despite all our differences -- is gone. We've played right into international terrorism and piracy's hands. And they didn't even have to lift a finger.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I sit in civics class three days a week and I wonder, what will happen once our president is elected? I listen to everything my family says. Different comments come from my mom and my dad's side of the family, and from the kids at school.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But then I think, if I could vote, who would I vote for? I listen to all the commercials, ads on the radio, I read the paper, watch debates, and I think long and hard about it. But my question is: How can kids make up their own minds with all of these comments being made? Is that how it is for adults?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Are they having their minds made up for them by other people? I hope when they go to vote, they think about all the facts and decide for themselves and are not influenced by others. My life, my best friend's life and their lives are decided by them. Think about what's right for the kids, what's right for your fellow citizens and think about what's right for you. Think.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The better of two choices</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When this presidential campaign between McCain and Obama began, I believed we had two good candidates, either of whom I could vote for. McCain is a strong man, and smart enough. Obama is a smart man, and strong enough.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As a conservative, I lean strongly to McCain, especially with the near certainty of a heavily Democratic Congress. At the same time, eight years of Republican rejection of ideas and data in favor of a disastrous embrace of rigid ideology should earn them, as a friend put it well, &quot;time in the penalty box.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">During the campaign I have been both impressed and dismayed by both candidates, and I remain convinced that either could be a good president. For me, the deciding factor so far has been McCain's decision to choose Sarah Palin as his running mate. I disliked but understood his decision to make nice with ideologues in the GOP. But when he chose as his prospective VP, with all that implies, a person who is essentially clueless about the economic and national security issues facing our nation, he demonstrated a capacity for reckless decisions that scares me. That will probably outweigh my profound admiration for his personal and political courage and my preference for his conservative approach to policy issues.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barack Obama's emotional maturity and first-rate intellect will, probably, outweigh for me his thin resume and the danger of liberal, single-party government. It's a tough choice between the two candidates, and one to be thankful for. Democracy is not for sissies.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Reckless judgment</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barack Obama says he was only eight years old when Bill Ayers and the Weathermen wreaked havoc in our country. He's right; he was just a young pup. But what the country wants to know is why, in his 40s, after a fine education at Columbia and Harvard, and after knowing the background of this radical leftist, member of Students for Democratic Society, New Left and Weather Underground, a domestic terrorist group, did Obama meet with, associate with and even attend a &quot;coffee&quot; that Ayers hosted before Obama's Senate campaign?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We can excuse Obama for his youth and not knowing about Ayers and the pain he and the Weathermen inflicted around the country. But I can't forgive him for poor decisionmaking as a well-educated adult.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Of course, his changing positions on the Cuban trade embargo, Rev. Wright, marijuana decriminalization, taking money from unions, campaign funding (refusing public financing after saying he would if the GOP did), immigration and drilling for oil, have made my decision easier. It's clear to me that his change is not the type of change we need in this country. These issues individually and collectively show me why Obama isn't ready for the presidency.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We are lucky this year that both of these fine presidential candidates will continue to serve us after the election, one in the Capitol and one in the White House. One candidate's strength is in health and economic reforms most affected by the Senate, while the other is uniquely prepared to be commander in chief. By putting each candidate in the place that suits his strength, we will have the best of both worlds.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Election eve appeal</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As we approach Election Day, I can only hope that all of us use our reasoning powers and common sense rather than our preconceived notions, ignorance, seldom-reviewed principles, misconceptions or blindly accepted interpretations beamed to us by others. As Socrates is alleged to have said, &quot;Question everything.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Voting with the loyalties of the past will most likely result in more of the same or worse. I'm not sure I or my family can deal with more of the same, and I know the worse will be more challenging.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If the reason we are voting can be reduced to a phrase on a bumper sticker, we probably haven't looked into the issue with sufficient rigor. No serious topic is that simple. If we think that it is, we are the problem. We must do the work of citizens who have the right to vote. We must do our homework.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Failure to do so has very severe consequences, and they will be partially our fault.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The principles that most of us have used to make our decisions have been betrayed by both parties. The most intense issues of the current campaigns, the slanderous attacks, the inconsequential diversions, are likely to find themselves on the trash pile by Nov. 5.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Please, let us use the intelligence, reasoning powers and common sense we've been given.</span></p>
