  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">One Virginia presidential race poll released Wednesday shows Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain in a close race. Another shows Obama comfortably ahead.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A Mason-Dixon Polling and Research Inc. survey of 625 likely voters Monday and Tuesday showed 47 percent backed Obama, 45 percent favored McCain and 8 percent were undecided. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The results are within the poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The poll, sponsored by NBC News and several Virginia newspapers, shows that the economy was the overwhelming concern of Virginians.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fifty-seven percent of the respondents ranked it as the nation's most urgent issue, and 48 percent said they most trust Obama to handle it, compared to 41 who said McCain would do a better job.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">National security and terrorism ranked a distant second with only 11 percent citing it as the No. 1 concern. Fifty-five percent rated McCain better on the issue to 39 percent who trusted Obama more.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's stronghold was Washington, D.C.'s Virginia suburbs, where he was the choice of 61 percent. McCain was strongest in the Shenandoah Valley and Piedmont region, where he was the choice of 57 percent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Hampton Roads, home to the world's largest Navy base at Norfolk, 48 percent favored Obama compared to 43 percent who preferred the former Navy pilot McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A CNN/Time magazine poll showed Obama the choice of 54 percent of the 647 likely voters surveyed and McCain the choice of 44 percent. Two percent supported neither man or voiced no opinion.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The 10-point margin is unchanged from a poll one week earlier, but Obama and McCain gained one point apiece from voters who had been undecided or who supported other candidates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The results are outside the margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The survey was based on telephone interviews conducted by Opinion Research Corp. from Sunday through Tuesday.</span></p>
