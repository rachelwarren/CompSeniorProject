  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Sarah Palin warned yesterday that Barack Obama is trying to exploit retirees' fears about what the Republican presidential ticket would do to Medicare and Social Security.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In stops yesterday in Florida before her appearance last night in the Richmond area, the Republican vice-presidential candidate urged older voters - a key Florida voting bloc - not to fall for &quot;the oldest and cheapest kind of politics around.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Barack Obama goes around promising a new kind of politics, but then he comes here to Florida and tries to exploit the fears and worries about Social Security and Medicare to our retirees,&quot; Palin said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Palin promised that Republican presidential candidate John McCain would &quot;keep faith&quot; with older Americans and protect Social Security and that, &quot;we will not cut a single Medicare benefit.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Palin reminded Floridians that three days remained before Election Day. &quot;Florida, we need you. We're asking for your vote,&quot; Palin said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Obama campaign wasted little time in responding, releasing a list of published past remarks by McCain, some dating years, in support for President Bush's privatization plan to allow workers to invest their Social Security taxes in the stock market.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Democrats have questioned that support in light of the stock market collapse. Republicans have noted that the collapse would not have had an impact on seniors now collecting Social Security.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;The fact is that John McCain's support for George Bush's scheme to gamble the retirement of our workers in the stock market is a bridge to nowhere for millions of Americans who count on a secure retirement,&quot; said Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> However, Factcheck.org, a nonpartisan project of the University of Pennsylvania Public Policy Center, says there is no basis for Obama to accuse McCain of planning huge Medicare benefit and eligibility cuts - something he has been doing in a TV ad and in speeches.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Factcheck.org says, &quot;McCain does propose substantial 'savings' through cutting fraud, increased use of information technology and better handling of expensive chronic disease.&quot; Obama proposes some of the same cost-saving measures.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> An estimated 5,500 people attended Palin's New Port Richey event, where she was accompanied by Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. Palin later appeared in Polk City, making similar remarks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Palin's appearances in Virginia and Florida yesterday reflect the states' importance in the election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Palin's performance as a candidate has been criticized by some in the media, and even by some within her own party. Still, there also has been speculation that she may be already angling for a run for the White House of her own in 2012, if she and McCain lose on Tuesday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Betty McMillen, 74, of Port Richey, was among the Palin enthusiasts who arrived before dawn for yesterday's event.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;With a little more experience and some training, she'll make a great president in four years,&quot; McMillen said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Four years? Does McMillen think the Republican ticket is not going to win Tuesday?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;No, not that,&quot; her friend, Maria Massey, 57, of Hudson, interrupted. What McMillen meant, said Massey, was that McCain, now 72, likely won't choose to serve more than four years in the White House.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But later, McMillen pulled a reporter aside to explain that, in fact, she'd prefer Palin over McCain and hopes that the Alaska governor becomes the party's presidential candidate in four years, regardless of what happens Tuesday.</span></p>
