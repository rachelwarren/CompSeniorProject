  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Back in the Ozarks, mind is still at beach</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I have been back home in the Ozarks of Missouri for a week now, but I am still sharing pictures of my visit to this year's Neptune Festival with my friends and family.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Born and raised in Norfolk, I was happy to return home to &quot;my&quot; beach and to enjoy the art and music, the professional sand castles and the water with my friends and family . </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Neptune Festival did not disappoint! And even Mother Nature got in on the act by permitting weather that cleared and offered a gentle breeze mixed in with the mostly overcast skies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What can I say? The city of Virginia Beach was on top of this one - trash was cleared promptly and the whole area looked great. The Neptune Festival staff and volunteers were present and watched over the happenings with great skill and pride. I was so impressed by the whole weekend and the magnitude of work it took to pull it off. They made it seem effortless.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I look forward to many more festivals to come!</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Someone stole my Obama sign. No, it wasn't kids because I live on a street where you can't walk or stop your car unless you want to chance being in the ditch which lines our street. So someone had to pull in my driveway to rip out the sign which was 20 feet off the road. Are people in Virginia Beach so afraid of the results of the election to do that?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Someone stole my McCain sign</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A message to the person who took my McCain sign from my yard!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dear Sir or Madam:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">How dare you trample on my rights as an American citizen to support the candidate of my choice? I am proud to support Mr. McCain in his bid for the presidency of the United States.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I would not even think of coming on your property and removing a sign that demonstrates whom you support. And I am sure your candidate of choice would not approve of this behavior from you. You not only disrespect me but you disrespect the candidate you support and the country you live in.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I have put up a new sign for McCain in my yard and will continue to replace the signs even if you continue to steal them. I will continue to voice my opinion on whom I think would be the best choice for president. You cannot silence me or others like me. That is our right by being a citizen of the United States of America.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It was so good to see the article on page 16 of Thursday's (Sept. 25) Beacon. It concerned the report by Barry Frankenfield about the $52 million already set up in the budget over the next 20 years to acquire space for parks, bike trails and open spaces.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I wish that Will Sessoms had saved his money on the ad on page 7 of the same edition where he proclaimed that &quot;council is saying we don't have the funds to continue buying open spaces.&quot; I think that Mr. Sessoms doesn't know what is going on.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We must have a constitutional amendment removing the ex post facto provision regarding office holders and bureaucrats.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It should permit ex post facto prosecutions of office holders who violate the public trust, as in the monetary system meltdown.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Unfortunately, such an amendment would have to be grandfathered so social engineer William Jefferson Clinton, Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.), chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, and Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), House Financial Services Committee chairman , would be immune from prosecution.</span></p>
