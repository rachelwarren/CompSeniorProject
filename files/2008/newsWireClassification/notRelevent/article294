  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With the presidential race heating up in Virginia, coal is becoming a major issue in the fight between Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's campaign unveiled a new television ad Wednesday touting the Democrat's support for so-called &quot;clean coal&quot; technologies, pushing back at Republican charges that Obama and running mate Joe Biden would hurt an industry that is critical to the economy of far Southwest Virginia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">U.S. Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Abingdon, also talked up the Democratic ticket's support for coal Wednesday and accused Republican John McCain's camp of airing &quot;misleading&quot; ads on the issue. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The emphasis on coal further underscores how hard the two candidates are fighting for Virginia's 13 electoral votes. McCain's campaign announced Wednesday that it has opened 12 new field offices in the state, including one in Blacksburg. Obama has more than 40 field offices throughout the state. Most polls indicate the race is close in Virginia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama, who already has made two campaign trips to far Southwest Virginia, is making another appeal to the region in an ad airing in Virginia and other targeted states. The 30-second spot features a coal miner and notes Obama's support for funding for carbon capture and storage technologies that could make coal burning cleaner.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama also has called for public-private partnerships to build five &quot;first of a kind&quot; coal-fired power plants that would have carbon capture and storage capability. And he has co-sponsored legislation in the U.S. Senate to create incentives for converting coal to liquid fuel.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Senator Obama is the stronger friend of coal and the one most likely to ensure coal's long-term future,&quot; said Boucher, who was an early supporter of Obama's campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Boucher cited Obama's support for a 2005 energy bill providing $1.8 billion in tax credits for clean coal technology and said McCain &quot;voted against that vital coal measure.&quot; McCain has said he voted against the bill because it awarded generous tax breaks to oil companies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's campaign last week began airing a radio ad that seized on comments Biden made during a hurried exchange with a voter in Ohio. During the encounter, which was captured on video, Biden was asked why he and Obama support clean coal.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Biden's immediate response was: &quot;We're not supporting clean coal.&quot; He went on to say that China will &quot;burn 300 years worth of bad coal&quot; without clean coal technology.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;No coal plants here in America,&quot; Biden told the voter. &quot;Build them if they're going to build them over there, make them clean, because they're killing you.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain surrogates, including former Gov. and U.S. Sen. George Allen and former state Attorney General Jerry Kilgore, have said that Biden's comments display a hostile attitude toward the coal industry. Del. Chris Saxman, R-Staunton, a Virginia co-chairman of McCain's campaign, also questioned the Democratic ticket's commitment during a conference call Wednesday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I don't see how they can say with a straight face that they're going to be in support of clean coal technology and clean coal resources in America, especially in Virginia,&quot; Saxman said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Boucher cautioned against making too much of &quot;some chitchat that takes place in a rope line.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He said Biden &quot;was talking about how dirty Chinese coal plants are and how the only way we're ever going to get those cleaned up ... is if we develop here in the United States clean coal technologies and then sell them for use in China.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Boucher said Biden affirmed his support for coal during a visit last month to the United Mine Workers of America picnic in Castlewood.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It was a very successful appearance during which he spent a long time talking about the need for the use of clean coal technology,&quot; Boucher said. &quot;He talked about his heritage, where he grew up in a coal-mining community in Scranton, Pa. ... I think he touched a very responsive chord.&quot;</span></p>
