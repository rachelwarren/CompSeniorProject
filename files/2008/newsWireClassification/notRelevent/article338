  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After campaigning Tuesday morning with Sen. John McCain in York, Arlen Specter stopped in Lancaster to air his thoughts on the energy crunch, Russian aggression and bipartisan one-upmanship in the nation's capitol.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Congress, Pennsylvania's senior senator said emphatically, ought to be in session when the nation is facing sky-high fuel bills and people are opting to take stay-at-home vacations rather than pay inflated gas prices.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The Congress has been gridlocked and dysfunctional,&quot; he said, citing heavy bickering between parties that has been &quot;detrimental to the country.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It would be very salutary for the American people to see Congress at work,&quot; Specter said. There's no guarantee Congress will make great gains during an August session, he added, &quot;but if we're not at work, nothing is certain to happen.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Specter also voiced dissatisfaction with the shift in federal power in recent years, noting that President Bush has broken constitutional and international laws as he consolidates control in the White House.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Since 9/11, we have seen the greatest expansion of executive authority in the history of this country,&quot; Specter said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bush is likely to veto the Free Flow of Information Act, a shield bill for reporters co-sponsored by Specter, Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) and Charles Shumer (D-N.Y.), Specter said. But he said, &quot;This is a season where vetoes are being overridden. I think we have the votes to override that.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Let him veto it. I think we ought to push it.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Specter also wants to push for solutions to the oil crisis that has hamstrung the U.S. economy. Unfortunately, he said, there's no quick fix.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Anybody who says there is a short-term answer to the problem is not realistic,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Specter said he favors eliminating an anti-trust exemption given to OPEC nations, which have lowered the supply of oil despite increased demand.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's a commercial function, and we can take it away,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He also supports limited offshore drilling but said the government should offer tax credits to encourage development of alternative fuel sources, from clean coal to hydropower, solar energy and wind power.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Everything has to be handled with appropriate concern for the environment,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That includes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge without disturbing caribou breeding grounds, he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He concedes, however, that offshore and Alaskan oil reserves are not a long-term solution to the crisis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It would be a sign, if we do it thoughtfully, that we're making an effort,&quot; Specter said. &quot;But we're not going to be able to drill our way out of the oil crisis.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Turning to more immediate events, Specter said the U.S. response to the conflict between Russia and Georgia must be a firm hand - but not a warlike posture.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think the President could be a little stronger in his denunciation of (Russia's) actions,&quot; Specter said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We're not going to go to war over this. But we ought to condemn it in the strongest terms possible.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The U.S. should do its part to bring international pressures to bear on Russia to withdraw from Georgia, he said, but &quot;to get U.N. peacekeepers there, you'd have to start with a peace to keep.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As for the presidential campaign, Specter said the race for the Oval Office &quot;could be won by either man.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Specter said he has a great deal of respect for Republican candidate McCain, his colleague in the Senate for more than two decades, as well as his Democratic challenger, Barack Obama, whose office in Washington, D.C., is just down the hall from his own.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Obama is a very talented guy,&quot; Specter said. &quot;And he's been a phenomenon as a campaigner.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Specter, nattily dressed in a blue blazer, red, white and blue tie and flag lapel pin, remained upbeat during the hourlong interview Tuesday afternoon with reporters and editors from the Intelligencer Journal - even when the conversation turned to his health.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Specter was diagnosed in 2005 with an advanced form of Hodgkin's lymphoma and completed a second round of chemotherapy treatments in July. He said he has been keeping busy and his spirits are high.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The grueling cancer treatments were &quot;tough, but tolerable,&quot; he said. &quot;I worked all through it ... and maintained my voting record.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ruefully running his hand over his now-bald head, the 78-year-old senator said he considered parlaying the look into sex-symbol status, but the notion was vetoed by his wife, Joan. Still, he said, &quot;I feel good. I'm at the top of my game.&quot;</span></p>
