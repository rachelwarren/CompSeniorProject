  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">States need help</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wall Street's crisis is walloping state finances across the country. The most urgent problems are in states -- like California -- that rely on short-term financing to help pay their bills until tax revenues start coming in later on in the fiscal year. This is about the safest debt on the market. Still, over the past few weeks, states have been shut out of the credit markets like everybody else. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Last week, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California warned that his state could be forced to seek $7 billion in emergency federal loans if the lending markets don't recover their senses quickly. ... Washington must step up.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This year's measure ... But despite the changes, the same hard-core opposition remains -- not because opponents are worried about the welfare of children, but because they are opposed to anything they see as a limitation on abortion ...</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wachovia's suitors</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the convoluted story of how a deal with Citigroup to buy Wachovia was scuttled after Wells Fargo stepped up with a better offer, only one thing seems really clear: The Wells Fargo offer is the better deal for taxpayers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Citigroup's initial offer depended on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. guaranteeing hundreds of billions of dollars in potentially bad loans held by Wachovia. The offer by Wells Fargo required no guarantees or other federal assistance.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe McCain, brother of Republican presidential nominee John McCain, called the Arlington and Alexandria portions of Northern Virginia &quot;communist country&quot; at a rally in Leesburg on Saturday. He apologized as the crowd laughed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now, we could say, &quot;there the Republicans go again, smearing the Democrats for political points,&quot; but we prefer to take the comment as it was intended -- as a joke. This is not Joseph McCarthy's 1950s America where fears of communist infiltration into the country were prevalent and suspicion abounded.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Do facts matter?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The current financial bailout crisis has propelled Barack Obama back into a substantial lead over John McCain -- which is astonishing in view of which man and which party has had the most to do with bringing on this crisis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It raises the question: Do facts matter? Or are Obama's rhetoric and the media's spin enough to make facts irrelevant?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fact Number One: It was liberal Democrats, led by Sen. Christopher Dodd and Rep. Barney Frank, who for years -- including the present year -- denied that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taking big risks that could lead to a financial crisis.</span></p>
