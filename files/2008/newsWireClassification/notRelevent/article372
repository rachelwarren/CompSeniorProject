  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WASHINGTON</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Struggling to stave off financial catastrophe, the Bush administration on Friday laid out a bailout plan involving a takeover of a half-trillion dollars or more in worthless mortgages and other bad debt held by tottering institutions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Relieved investors sent stocks soaring on Wall Street and around the globe. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 368 points after surging 410 points the day before on rumors the federal action was afoot. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">President Bush acknowledged risks to taxpayers in what would be the most sweeping government intervention to rescue failing financial institutions since the Great Depression.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The risk of not acting would be far higher,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The administration is asking Congress for far-reaching new powers to take over troubled mortgages from banks and other companies, including purchasing sour mortgage-backed securities. Administration officials and congressional leaders are to work out details over the weekend.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Congressional officials said they expected a request for legal authority to buy up the bad loans, at a cost in excess of $500&nbsp;billion to the government. Democrats were discussing whether to try to attach middle-class assistance to the legislation, despite a request from Bush to avoid adding items that could delay action. An expansion of jobless benefits was one possibility.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In other major steps, the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve moved to give money-market mutual funds the same kind of federal protection, at least temporarily, that now applies to savings and checking accounts and certificates of deposit at banks. And the Securities and Exchange Commission acted to block short-selling in financial securities, a trading method that bets the value of stocks will go down and has been blamed for accelerating the plunge in stock prices of banks and other financial institutions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This is a pivotal moment for America's economy,&quot; Bush said. &quot;In our nation's history, there have been moments that require us to come together across party lines to address major challenges. This is such a moment.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told lawmakers that the financial system had been perilously close to collapse.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">According to notes taken by one participant in a call to House members, Paulson said that the failure to pass a broad rescue plan would lead to nothing short of disaster. Bernanke said that Wall Street had plunged into a full-scale panic, and he warned lawmakers that their constituents were in danger of losing money on holdings in ultra-conservative money-market funds.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Congressional leaders of both parties welcomed the administration's moves after a series of ad hoc rescues, but the political obstacles to resolving the financial crisis remained high. The first is simply a matter of time: Congress is set to adjourn at the end of next week, and it is being asked to approve a plan involving more money than any single program in history.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As of Friday evening, Paulson had yet to deliver a formal plan to Congress. House and Senate leaders pledged to work through the weekend, but they insisted that Paulson bring them a detailed plan.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">An even bigger obstacle was the goal of the plan. Bush and Paulson made it clear that their primary, and perhaps only, goal was to stabilize the financial markets by removing hundreds of billions of dollars in &quot;illiquid assets&quot; from the balance sheets of banks and financial institutions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Confidence in our financial system and its institutions is essential to the smooth operation of our economy, and recently that confidence has been shaken,&quot; Bush said. &quot;We must address the root cause behind much of the instability in our markets - the mortgage assets that have lost value during the housing decline and are now restricting the flow of credit.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But Democratic lawmakers insisted that any plan would also have to provide relief to millions of families that were poised to lose their homes to foreclosure.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The federal government already has pledged more than $600 billion in the past year to bail out, or help bail out, some of the biggest names in American finance. That includes the rescue of investment bank Bear Stearns in March; the takeover of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac earlier this month; and the takeover of the world's largest insurance company, American International Group, this week.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the contagion continued to spread, bringing political consensus that drastic and comprehensive federal action was needed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paulson said the new troubled-asset relief program that he wants Congress to enact must be large enough to have the necessary impact while protecting taxpayers as much as possible.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I am convinced that this bold approach will cost American families far less than the alternative - a continuing series of financial institution failures and frozen credit markets unable to fund economic expansion,&quot; Paulson said. &quot;The financial security of all Americans ... depends on our ability to restore our financial institutions to a sound footing.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bush said simply, &quot;We must act now.&quot;</span></p>
