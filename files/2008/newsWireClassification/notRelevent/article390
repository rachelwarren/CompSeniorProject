  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> One U.S. Senate candidate is synonymous with tax cuts; the other, tax increases.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The increasingly bitter contest between two former Virginia governors - Republican Jim Gilmore and his successor, Democrat Mark R. Warner - has focused largely on their fiscal stewardship during an era shaped by sharp swings in revenue.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The issue is expected to surface again tomorrow, in the rivals' second of three scheduled debates - this one in Northern Virginia, the state's economic and political engine. The debate will be telecast only in the Washington suburbs on News Channel 8. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Undoubtedly, when you're talking about a Senate race that involves two former governors, the signature issue of the past 10 years - balancing the budget - will be front and center,&quot; said political analyst Stephen J. Farnsworth of George Mason University.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But a shorthand has emerged during the campaign - one that perhaps oversimplifies the fiscal claims of the candidates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore says he eliminated the despised, locally imposed tax on personal motor vehicles, the so-called car tax. The tax - driven by the market value of cars, trucks, vans and motorcycles - still exists and continues to be collected by cities and counties.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Localities receive additional cash from the state in return for trimming the tax on the first $20,000 of a vehicle's assessed value by about 75 percent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore's attempt at a full rollback was disrupted by economic decline and a standoff with fellow Republicans - in particular, moderates in the Virginia Senate - who considered the car-tax cut a budget-buster.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner, meantime, is running a television advertisement suggesting Gilmore's policies depleted more than $6 billion from Virginia's budgets.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The ballooning costs of the car-tax rollback contributed to the cash crunch. But the dot-com collapse and the aftershocks of the Sept. 11 attacks were the principal causes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The resulting economic tailspin had the greatest impact on Northern Virginia, seat of the info-tech boom that had fueled Warner's personal fortune a decade earlier.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> For both politicians, the Virginia budget was quite literally a vehicle for their ambitions. To minimize chances that their signature initiatives would be disrupted, Gilmore and Warner, with the consent of legislators, wove through the budget, respectively, tax breaks and tax increases.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But for Virginia's fast-changing electorate - perhaps more attuned to Iraq, the sagging economy and other issues driving the national campaigns - the Gilmore-Warner duel over the state budget may be ancient history, if not a mystery altogether.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Memories are probably relatively short,&quot; said Robert D. Holsworth, a political scientist at Virginia Commonwealth University.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore makes no mention in his first television commercial of his record as a tax-cutter. Rather, Gilmore - apparently tying his fortunes to Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee - depicts Warner as a likely supporter in the Senate of higher federal taxes should Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, win the White House.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The advertisement is pegged to the broken promise that ultimately defined Warner's four years in Richmond: He raised taxes by $1.4 billion after repeatedly pledging not to do so.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Polls show Virginians generally supportive of the increase for public education, law enforcement and social services.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But because a tax increase seemed implausible in a state with a strong Republican tradition, the victory hastened speculation that Warner would run for president this year as a proven bipartisan coalition-builder.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner tested the waters but withdrew in 2006.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Both sides in the Senate campaign say the emphasis on state fiscal matters is logical, given the candidates' r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. Gilmore was governor from 1998 until 2002, Warner from 2002 until 2006.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;The most important aspect of the job [of governor] is developing and managing the state budget,&quot; said Sen. R. Edward Houck of Spotsylvania County, the No. 2 Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. &quot;There's no greater task.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But Del. M. Kirkland Cox of Colonial Heights, the House Republican whip and a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, summed up the external factors that influence the budget, and - by extension - its principal author: a governor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Governor Gilmore came in good times and left in bad,&quot; Cox said. &quot;Governor Warner came in bad times and left in good.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore vaulted to the governorship from the attorney general's office on a pledge to eliminate the car tax.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A strong economy allowed Gilmore to put in place a multiyear phase-out, even though the annual cost of the car-tax rollback - if fully implemented - was projected to breach $1 billion, or nearly twice the $620 million he predicted.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> An economic downturn and the budget-and-tax impasse with fellow Republicans in 2001, near the close of Gilmore's term, hastened Warner's rise.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Promising to work with the Republicans who then controlled the House of Delegates and the Virginia Senate, Warner - an investor who never had held elective office - vowed discipline in fiscal affairs. He also endorsed the car-tax cut and said he would not raise taxes - positions he abandoned as governor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner has argued that his hand was forced by circumstances beyond his control; that the budget - when he took office in January 2002 - was in far worse shape than he had imagined several months earlier as a candidate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The result: the biggest tax increase in Virginia history, coupled with a cap on one of the state's largest tax cuts.</span></p>
