  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> * Editor's Note: The Times-Dispatch Editorial Pages asked each of the major-party candidates for Virginia's open seat in the U.S. Senate, being vacated by retiring Republican Sen. John Warner, to answer questions about issues they are likely to face if elected. Below are the unedited answers (except for minor style and grammar changes) from former Republican Gov. Jim Gilmore and former Democratic Gov. Mark Warner.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> How do you define the federal government's principal responsibilities?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: To provide for the defense of the nation and the people of the U.S. and to protect our national interests domestically, to ensure a civic environment for individuals and families to strive for accomplishment, obtain independence, and enjoy opportunity. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: The federal government's primary responsibility is to protect our national security and keep Americans safe. We should also create and implement a national competitiveness plan that supports infrastructure investment and works with states to provide a first-class public education system. The federal government also has a responsibility not to leave debts and deficits to our children and grandchildren. There should be a safety net for our most vulnerable citizens, and the federal government must provide the framework to ensure the long-term viability of our Social Security system.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> How do you assess (1) the Bush administration's response to 9/11 and (2) the specific situations in Iraq and Afghanistan?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: As former chairman of the &quot;Gilmore Commission&quot; on Terrorism and Homeland Security, I approve of the Bush administration's aggressive pursuit of terrorists overseas. At home, I applaud the security advancements, but would add a call for total citizen involvement in a national plan for homeland security.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I applaud the Iraq surge and hope it will achieve the goal of creating a stable Iraq as our military involvement is diminished. I have visited Afghanistan and believe we must execute a more strategic plan to achieve stability without the re-establishment of control by the Taliban.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: In the immediate aftermath of 9/11 President Bush rallied the nation to take on the threat of terrorism. But he also missed a key opportunity - the chance to use that moment of crisis to bring Americans together around a plan to get us off foreign oil.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Iraq, our troops have performed heroically, and now is the time for the Iraqi government to step up and start spending its $79 billion in oil profits on its own reconstruction so we can begin to bring our troops home. We should shift our focus to the continuing terrorist threat in Afghanistan and commit to finishing the job against al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Do you support or oppose the Supreme Court's ruling in the Boumediene case granting habeas rights to alleged enemy combatants held at Guantanamo Bay? Explain. Should the Camp Delta detention facility at Guantanamo Bay be closed? If so, what should be done with the remaining detainees? If not, would you support the establishment of a special national-security court to review the cases of the detainees, or are military commissions sufficient?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: I support the Boumediene case. I believe the court's goal was to ensure the survival of the vehicle of habeas corpus to ensure liberty in all instances, even those beyond the issue of Guantanamo Bay. Nevertheless, I oppose turning every prisoner of war or enemy combatant into a criminal defendant with full legal rights. I do agree that some process must be available for independent review to make sure arbitrary authority does not result in mistakes or a miscarriage of justice.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I believe the Camp Delta detention facility should be closed, as the security no longer outweighs the loss of American moral authority in the world. The remaining detainees should be held in the custody of the U.S. military. I believe that military commissions can be sufficient so long as the fundamentals of a fair chance to contest incarceration are maintained. A reasonable right of appeal should also be provided.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: I believe that we should close the facility at Guantanamo. Guantanamo does not represent the principles that the United States stands for, and the best way to make this clear is to close the facility. Regarding Boumediene v. Bush, I believe the Supreme Court's decision sent a clear signal that the United States stands behind the rule of law. I have some concerns, however, that the ruling could be interpreted as setting precedent for extra-territorial application of the U.S. Constitution.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Last, as for the detainees at Guantanamo, many of whom have been held without legal counsel for more than six years, they should be provided a process and an opportunity to present their defense. I am confident that we can work with other countries to find suitable placements for detainees who are not found guilty by a court and that we can convict and continue to detain those who are guilty of crimes against the United States. We must continue to use all legal tools at our disposal to pursue terrorists. In this way we can keep our country safe while protecting the basic principles of our democracy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The U.S. fought in Korea, Vietnam, the Balkans, and in Kuwait, and is fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan without formal declarations of war. Do resolutions authorizing the use of force meet constitutional provisions investing Congress with authority to declare war?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: In confrontations between nations the constitutional power of the Congress to declare war should be adhered to. The unfortunate departure from this practice in the 20th century has been due to emergency circumstances. The War Powers Act was drafted to limit executive power and maintain the authority of the Congress. The rise of international organizations, criminal and otherwise, will likely require the use of organized military force and the doctrine of war declaration will continue to evolve. Wherever possible, the Congress' declaration of war powers must be maintained.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: In cases of emergency or when America is under attack, the president has the authority as commander-in-chief to defend the nation. But when an imminent threat becomes a long-term conflict, the War Powers Act says that Congress needs to sign off. We should not have open-ended commitments without declarations of war.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Can the U.S. effectively promote peace in the Middle East?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: Yes. The United States must promote peace to prevent a general war that would likely draw in the United States, and to protect Israel. We must use all American resources - diplomatic, military, and economic - in our Middle East policy. For this reason, it is imperative that we seek energy independence and economic recovery.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: Yes, and we need to start by continuing to work with Israel, our strongest ally in the region. We need to bring full diplomatic pressure to continue to push for peace in the region.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In 10 years will China be perceived as friend or foe?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: In China today there are two independent elements. One group consists of those who wish advancement and are willing to apply capitalist principles and international economic cooperation. The second group is more aggressive and military and definitely perceives the U.S. as its enemy. We must promote the group that seeks peaceful economic advancement and resist with all our power the nationalist military elements in China who would seek to do harm to the U.S. and its allies. The success or failure of this policy will determine how China is perceived 10 years from now.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: With the right policies in place, in 10 years China should be a great market for American goods and services. Right now China holds way too much of our debt. Instead of allowing China to be our banker, we need to make China our best customer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Do disputes such as the one between Russia and Georgia threaten America's interests? What do you think of the U.N.? Should NATO expand?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: America's interests are threatened by aggressive Russian foreign policy as the Cold War so clearly demonstrated. Russia must be discouraged from any effort to re-establish its Eastern European empire. We must make very clear that threats to the Baltic states or Poland will not be tolerated by the United States or its allies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The United Nations is today a forum for anti-American propaganda and on the whole not helpful. I would aspire to utilize the United Nations as a forum for the vigorous presentation of American policy. I would seek to utilize the U.N.'s international prestige to promote American national interests and to make our case for American policy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> NATO should expand. However, we must develop a consensus with our allies over which countries we would agree to defend to the point of war with Russia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: Russia was emboldened to invade Georgia because of Russia's staggering oil and gas profits - yet another reason why we need to get off foreign oil. I think that the U.N. can be an effective body but the United States must retain its ability to act on its own behalf. I would support an expansion of NATO if it were done in a careful and thoughtful way.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> What are your thoughts regarding U.S. relations with Latin America, and with Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela in particular?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: Latin America is the next crisis point in international relations. I believe the United States can still get ahead of this crisis if we act vigorously to build our friendships with Latin American countries on the basis of mutual respect. I have visited South America as governor and have a deep understanding of the sophistication of Latin American societies and the opportunity for mutual advancement.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> With respect to the specific countries, we must engage Mexico more deeply to solve the problems of illegal border-crossing and illegal immigration. Colombia is a good friend and ally and must be supported in its anti-drug and anti-terrorists efforts. Venezuela presently seeks to define itself as an enemy of the United States and must be contained. Efforts to find common ground with the people of Venezuela cannot be allowed to endanger the safety of the American citizens.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: Venezuela, financed by our purchases of its oil, poses a threat to stability in Latin America. I believe we need to continue to partner with Colombia to eradicate its drug trade. A healthy and stable Mexico is in our interest, not only as a trading partner but also to ensure that fewer people from Mexico try to enter our country illegally.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Summarize the provisions of the perfect bill to address the problem of illegal immigration.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: Congress needs to secure our borders. Additionally, Congress must insist our immigration laws be enforced. Illegal immigration is costing Virginia taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars each year and Congress needs to mandate the enforcement of our immigration laws.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> We are a nation of immigrants. Immigrants from all over the world have been extremely important to the development and the success of our nation , so we should continue to respect them and be willing to consider legislative reforms that address our workforce needs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: We need a comprehensive immigration policy, one that is tough on border security, is effective, and is fair to taxpayers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> First, we need to secure our borders. By increasing our border security, we can prevent more undocumented people from entering the country illegally.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> We must also enforce our existing immigration laws. The federal government should hold accountable any business owner who knowingly hires undocumented workers. Undocumented workers should be required to pay back taxes, pay a fine, and learn English.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Finally, for those in the country illegally, blanket amnesty isn't an option. Anyone who has broken the law should be immediately deported. This issue must be resolved at the federal level and should not penalize those individuals who have followed the law and are legal.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> What is your attitude toward global trade?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: We need to level the playing field in our trade policy. A pro-growth tax policy is essential to keeping good jobs here at home. We have the second-highest corporate tax rate in the world, which makes us a less appealing place to do business.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In addition to making our country a more appealing place to do business by lowering our corporate tax rate, we must ensure our trade policies focus on American workers and businesses, while still allowing us to compete in the demanding global economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: There needs to be a level playing field where countries play by the same rules on environmental, labor, and currency manipulation issues. But I think America can compete and win in the global economy and that will include increased trade. That's one of the reasons why we need a national competitiveness strategy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> What is your policy on energy? What should a national energy policy include?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: Whether to drill for oil right here in the U.S. is the key issue in this Senate campaign. We need to drill both offshore in the outer continental shelf and in ANWR in Alaska, and we need to do it now! Increased domestic drilling will help reduce gas prices. It's a matter of national security and should not be left up to the states. As Virginia's U.S. senator, I will push for immediate action and support fast-track legislation to permit oil production in Alaska, in our oil shale areas, and off our coasts - so we can increase supply and reduce gas prices.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> We also need to encourage private industry to continue its development of alternative fuels, alternative energy sources, and clean coal technology, which is of particular importance to Virginia. And, we need to streamline the burdensome regulatory process so that we can build more oil refineries, more nuclear power plants, and clean coal facilities.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: To address prices, we should lift the offshore moratorium and allow more domestic offshore oil and gas drilling, invest in alternative energy technology, and crack down on oil speculators. We should make the energy research and development tax credit permanent so we can create millions of new jobs here in America. If we do this right, American workers will build hybrid vehicles that get up to 100 miles per gallon within 24 months.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In the long-term, we need a comprehensive energy plan that reduces our dependence on Middle Eastern oil by investing in nuclear, cleaner coal, wind, solar, alternative fuels, and domestic oil and gas to power our country. If we do this, we can both lower the price of gas and make our nation more secure.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> What do you think of the federal tax code? Is it effective, is it fair? Are rates too high, too low, or just about right?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: As governor of Virginia, I cut the car tax and $1.5 billion in taxes for working families. I helped lead the national fight to block the Internet tax and for the repeal of federal communications taxes. And as Virginia's U.S. senator, I will work to reduce wasteful spending and allow for working Americans to take home more of what they earn by making the federal tax cuts permanent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> We must hold the line on taxes. Raising taxes in a troubled economy would be a disaster for working Virginians who are already struggling. Furthermore, I believe the Alternative Minimum Tax must be indexed for inflation. Because it has not been, increasing numbers of middle-income families have become subject to this so-called &quot;tax on the wealthy.&quot; The rates in the current tax code are too high and prevent individuals from obtaining financial independence.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: The federal tax code needs to be simplified. I support a progressive tax system and we need a re-examination of all of the tax exemptions to make our tax code fairer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The next president likely will nominate at least one justice of the Supreme Court, and certainly will nominate scores of judges to federal lower courts. What is the judicial philosophy you would like to see in the nominees?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: I will support judges who will not legislate from the bench, who understand the law is made by legislatures and Congress. Justices should seek to preserve liberty as intended by the founders with reference to the legal and historical precedence. The judges should not use the law to define the lives of American citizens.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: I will support the most qualified and competent legal minds nominated by the president. I would want men and women who believe that the Constitution is a living document, and that the rights enshrined in it - including the right to privacy - are what make our country great.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Do you support or oppose parental notification for minors seeking abortion? What's your position on federal funding of stem-cell research? Does embryonic stem-cell research hold more promise than research involving adult stem cells?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: As governor of Virginia, I stood for the sanctity of life, pushing through legislation that created a 24-hour waiting period for women seeking abortions, required parental notification for minors, and banned partial birth abortion. As a U.S. senator, I will continue to work to preserve Virginia values, including the protection of human life - and that includes opposing federal funding of embryonic stem-cell research.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: I support Roe vs. Wade. But I think folks with differing views on the issue of abortion can all agree that we ought to do everything we can to reduce unintended pregnancies. I signed a bill when I was governor to require parental notification with a judicial bypass. As the father of three daughters, I am very comfortable with this law. I support stem-cell research, and we should let science dictate the most promising techniques and research.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Name three federal programs you would like to start, and three you would like to shut down.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: With regard to three federal programs I would work to eliminate, I do not believe the No Child Left Behind Act is working and I believe we need to return those responsibilities and the money that is currently being used to fund it to the states. I would also work to eliminate transportation enhancement projects that fund critter underpasses and lighthouses rather than the construction of roads. And third, I oppose the federal bailout program which gives taxpayer money to Wall Street firms that behaved irresponsibly, in return for transferring lousy business deals to the balance sheet of the taxpayers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I do not propose any new programs, but would design a national policy to provide for more drilling for oil in the United States and energy independence.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: We need to start a national reinvestment program for infrastructure that eliminates earmarks and creates a real strategic plan to expand broadband deployment, improve rail, and cut down on time wasted in traffic. To renew the public's trust we need to shut down or eliminate congressional earmarks in transportation funding.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> We need a comprehensive energy plan that reduces our dependence on Middle Eastern oil by investing in nuclear, cleaner coal, wind, solar, alternative fuels, and domestic oil and gas to power our country. In terms of tax breaks, we need an energy program that gives the same opportunities for alternative energy that are currently given to oil companies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> We should also make the energy research and development tax credit permanent so we can create millions of new jobs here in America. If we do this right, American workers will build hybrid vehicles that get up to 100 miles per gallon within 24 months.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Finally, we need more accountability in our budgeting. I have a record of cutting spending as governor. And, as Chairman of the National Governor's Association, I created a plan to slow the growth of the Medicaid entitlement programs that 46 governors agreed to support.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> We should create new rules that bring transparency and accountability to the budget process. Every federal program should be examined and continued only if there is a way to measure its success. We should eliminate all federal programs that have outlived their use.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> What grade would you award the No Child Left Behind Act? What is the federal role in public education?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: While I was governor, the General Assembly voted for my efforts to hire 4,000 new teachers so we could get our education resources into the classroom where they could make a difference for our children. Today, as a result of that effort the pupil-teacher ratio in Virginia is the third best in the nation. I also worked to implement the Standards of Learning, mandated that state lottery proceeds be used for education and helped Virginia's college students by cutting the cost of college tuition by 20 percent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As I stated in the previous question, I do not believe the No Child Left Behind Act is working and I believe we need to return those responsibilities and the money that is currently being used to fund it to the states.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: The idea behind No Child Left Behind - to bring more accountability to our schools - is a good one, though the act has been poorly implemented and is way too bureaucratic. It also penalized states such as Virginia, which have already adopted their own aggressive accountability standards. I would give it an 'A' for concept and a 'D' for implementation. The federal role in public education should be to provide the right incentives for underperforming schools and to work with states and localities to make sure we have an educated and competitive workforce.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Did authorities take appropriate action regarding Bear Stearns? Regarding Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae? Should the government bail out Detroit? Does commercial aviation require a governmental fix?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: This election is about regular Virginians who are struggling day to day to make ends meet.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I am extremely concerned the taxpayers are being asked to bail out investment companies, banks, and real estate firms that allowed their executives to make risky lending decisions. I believe we need to restrict these kinds of taxpayer bailouts. It is not appropriate for the taxpayers to be put in a position where their tax dollars are used to bail out companies who made bad business decisions!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Obviously we need more oversight, but we must be careful not to allow so much regulation that Washington intrusion disrupts the free market. One example of a free market solution that should have been considered would require troubled companies to issue a bond to draw money from the U.S. Treasury, which they would then repay with a low interest rate. It is wrong to ask America's hard-working families to cover the bets of the Wall Street high rollers and insiders who exploited flaws in government regulations to make personal fortunes and devastate our economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Requiring America's working families to cough up $700 billion without providing them any additional assurances for their own financial security is wrong. Many Washington politicians find it easy to take more and more of your money, but I do not. It is time we restore accountability in Washington - and on Wall Street - so America's taxpayers are protected and our economy prospers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: The worst thing about this crisis is that it could have been avoided if folks weren't asleep at the switch in Washington and on Wall Street. As someone who spent more than 20 years building businesses in the private sector, I think we need more leaders in Washington who understand finance and can read a balance sheet.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In the short term, Washington needs to act to prevent further financial meltdown. I plan to withhold final judgment on any specific package until the full details are available. Any plan must protect the interests of the taxpayers, prohibit excessive executive compensation packages for CEOs who ran their companies into the ground, provide for independent oversight while Treasury implements the bailout, and help stabilize the home real estate market.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> For Detroit, rather than bailouts, I'd like to see incentives in place such as making the energy research and development tax credit permanent so we can create millions of new jobs here in America. If we do this right, American workers will build hybrid vehicles that get up to 100 miles per gallon within 24 months. On aviation, I have major concerns about the safety of our air traffic control system and the way passengers are treated.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Do you accept global warming? Does human behavior play a role? What are your approaches?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: We know the climate is changing, but we do not know for sure how much is caused by man and how much is part of a natural cycle change. I do believe we must work toward reducing emissions without damaging our fragile economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: Yes, global warming is real and human behavior does play a role. We need to address this through a comprehensive energy plan that reduces our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and invests in nuclear, cleaner coal, wind, solar, and alternative fuels and includes a carbon cap - something that both Sen. John McCain and Sen. Barack Obama support.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> What are your views on affirmative action as it relates to both race and class?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: I do not support quotas, but all during my career I have worked to create opportunities for minorities and other disadvantaged citizens. As attorney general, I joined with my fellow attorney general across the south - Democrats and Republicans - and held a national conference on church burnings in America. A strong statement was made against such crimes. Gov. Doug Wilder was invited to keynote the conference and the church burnings stopped. As governor, I provided extra support to Virginia State University and Norfolk State University to ensure those universities were expanded to the highest quality. Also, as governor, I provided for a separate Martin Luther King holiday and invited Coretta Scott King to the governor's mansion.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: I'd like to see an America where there's not a need for affirmative action, but for now, we need to make sure there is a level playing field for everyone to participate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I come from the business world, and I think most business people will tell you that they want to recruit employees who were educated in an environment where they were exposed to diverse people and ideas. As I have said many times in the past, I continue to be opposed to the use of quotas.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Which president in your lifetime is your favorite?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: Ronald Reagan. Because he provided sunny optimism to the nation, and won the Cold War without firing a shot.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: John F. Kennedy</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> You and your opponent both served as governor. How would you rate your opponent's administration?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: I am sure much constructive work was done during my opponent's administration. However, his principle initiative was raising taxes on the people of Virginia after promising not to do so. I cannot support an administration for which that was the principal goal.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: I trust the voters of Virginia to decide which governor left Virginia in a better spot.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> What do you most admire in your opponent?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: I believe Gov. Warner is good husband and a good father. My son, Ashton, is acquainted through school with one of Gov. Warner's daughters, and he has always expressed that Gov. Warner's children are wonderful girls.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner:I respect Gov. Gilmore's service beginning in the late 1990s on homeland security issues.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Almost 50 years ago John Kennedy inspired a nation with his &quot;Ask Not&quot; speech. What is the rallying cry for a new era?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore: To enable citizens to prosper, and achieve independence and control over their own lives - to secure the nation from foreign threats - and to preserve the liberties of all Americans. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner: There is no challenge that this country faces that is also not an opportunity if we ask our people to step up - not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans. The issues we face are less about left vs. right, liberal vs. conservative or even Democrat vs. Republican - it's about the future vs. the past. We need to seize the opportunities of the future.</span></p>
