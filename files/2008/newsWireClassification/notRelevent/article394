  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">GOLDEN, Colo.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama traded increasingly barbed insults along with prescriptions for the ailing economy Tuesday as financial fears shoved aside lipstick on pigs and every other political issue in a blink with just weeks left in the long presidential campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">An ad by Democrat Obama said: &quot;How can John McCain fix our economy if he doesn't understand it's broken?&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republican McCain retorted: &quot;Sen. Obama saw an economic crisis, and he's found a political opportunity. My friends, this is not a time for political opportunism; this is a time for leadership.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain commented as he and running mate Sarah Palin addressed a rally late Tuesday in Vienna, Ohio.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The verbal dueling showed the importance both candidates put on the issue of the economy as the continuing financial meltdown on Wall Street has driven other issues out of the news. Both campaigns now believe the candidate who manages to wrest control of the issue and gain voters' confidence could well be the next president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Earlier in the day, McCain called for a crisis commission, while Obama laughed that off as &quot;the oldest Washington stunt in the book.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This isn't 9/11,&quot; Obama told a noisy crowd of more than 2,000 at the Colorado School of Mines, dismissing the idea of a need for study. &quot;We know how we got into this mess. What we need now is leadership that gets us out. I'll provide it. John McCain won't.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain, campaigning in Florida, promised reforms, too, to expose and end the &quot;reckless conduct, corruption and unbridled greed&quot; that he said had caused the financial crisis on Wall Street.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The turmoil has shaken Americans' confidence, erased hundreds of billions of paper wealth for U.S. stockholders and led McCain and Obama to forsake other campaign focal points and scramble back to the economy as the primary concern of voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The presidential campaign had taken an odd turn to side issues - Alaska's &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot; and moose-hunting, Obama's crack about lipstick on a pig - after McCain's surprise pick of Alaska Gov. Palin as his running mate. There was a fascination with huge crowds attracted by Palin. But the collapse and merger of some of Wall Street's legendary companies forced a return to reality seven weeks before the election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What do the voters think?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain and Obama now are trusted equally on the economy, with 34 percent of voters naming each as the candidate who would do a better job dealing with what is easily the country's top worry, according to an Associated Press-Yahoo News poll conducted last week. Previously, Obama had had a solid advantage on the issue.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Tuesday, McCain criticized the Illinois senator for taking donations from executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - the mortgage giants taken over by the government last week - and for putting former Fannie Mae Chief Executive Jim Johnson in charge of his vice presidential search. The Arizona senator also chastised Obama for missing an economic stimulus vote, even though McCain himself missed a vote - and the possibility of breaking a Senate tie - a day earlier on a broader package. Obama voted for that package.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As for Wall Street and the nation's housing woes, Obama called the crisis &quot;the most serious financial situation in generations.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He said McCain and President Bush subscribe to the same approach: &quot;support ideological policies that made the crisis more likely, do nothing as the crisis hits and then scramble as the whole thing collapses.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain declared Monday that &quot;the fundamentals of our economy are strong.&quot; Then, after Obama accused him of being out of touch, he conceded the country was in an economic crisis but still said the fundamental strength of the American worker remained strong.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">barbs on the economy</span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Said Barack Obama: &quot;How can John McCain fix our economy if he doesn't understand it's broken?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Retorted John McCain: &quot;Sen. Obama saw an economic crisis, and he's found a political opportunity. My friends, this is not a time for political opportunism; this is a time for leadership.&quot;</span></p>
