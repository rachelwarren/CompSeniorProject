  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WASHINGTON</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Barack Obama introduced Sen. Joe Biden as his running mate at a rally in Springfield, Ill., on Saturday, revealing a choice that strengthens the Democratic ticket's credentials on foreign policy as Obama heads into the fight with Sen. John McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Biden, Obama selected a six-term senator best known for his expertise on foreign affairs - Biden spent last weekend in Georgia as that nation engaged in a tense confrontation with Russia - but also his skills at political combat. Obama passed over other candidates who might have brought him a state or reinforced the message of change that has been central to his candidacy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At the rally outside the Old State Capitol where Obama announced his candidacy for the White House 20 months ago, Obama offered a portrait of a running mate who filled in what many Democrats have described as his political shortcomings. He presented Biden as the product of a Catholic blue-collar home in Pennsylvania who had endured personal tragedy in the death of his wife and daughter and his own near-death, who could relate to the culture of the Senate or of blue-collar voters. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I can tell you that Joe Biden gets it,&quot; Obama said. &quot;He's that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in Cedar Rapids and the corridors of the Capitol, in the VFW hall in Concord and at the center of an international crisis.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;That's because he is still that scrappy kid from Scranton who beat the odds, the dedicated family man and committed Catholic who knows every conductor on that Amtrak train to Wilmington,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The choice of Biden suggested a concern by Obama's advisers that his overseas trip this summer may not have done enough to deal with persistent voter concerns about his level of experience, especially on national security. He announced his decision when the conflict between Russia and Georgia has provided Republicans an opportunity to re-inject foreign policy into an election that has increasingly focused on the economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama woke up to a TV ad from McCain's campaign Saturday morning - even before the rally began - using Biden's own words from when he was running against Obama to discredit him, showing Biden saying that Obama, 47, is &quot;not ready&quot; to be president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For good measure, it included a quotation from Biden talking about McCain on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; in 2005: &quot;I would be honored to run with or against John McCain, because I think the country would be better off.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After trotting onto the stage Saturday, Biden said McCain was &quot; genuinely a friend of mine. I've known John for 35 years.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At the same time, he argued that, in what aides said was part of an effort to push back on McCain's efforts to use his past criticism of Obama in this campaign, he'd seen him grow in the crucible of a presidential campaign in which &quot;you're tested and challenged every single day.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Over the past 18 months, I've watched Barack meet those challenges with judgment, intelligence and steel in his spine,&quot; Biden said. &quot;I've watched as he's inspired millions of Americans to this new cause. And during those 18 months, I must tell you, frankly, I have been disappointed in my friend John McCain, who gave in to the right wing of his party and gave in to the Swift Boat politics he once so deplored.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And in a sign to McCain that friendship goes only so deep in politics, he mocked McCain for owning at least seven houses, as he talked about the kitchen table conversations struggling Americans were having today.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;That's not a worry John McCain has to worry about,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a pretty hard experience: He'll have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama announced his choice in text and e-mail messages that began streaming out of his Chicago headquarters at 3 a.m., hours after news of his decision began leaking out.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Barack has chosen Senator Joe Biden to be our VP nominee,&quot; read the text message. &quot;Watch the first Obama-Biden rally live at 3pm ET on www.BarackObama.com. Spread the word!&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At the end of the process, Obama was working off a list of four contenders: Biden, Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana, Gov. Timothy M. Kaine of Virginia and Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas. It did not, by every account, include Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clinton issued a statement Saturday morning praising the choice and calling Biden &quot;an exceptionally strong, experienced leader and devoted public servant.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Biden, 65, is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and is familiar with foreign leaders and diplomats around the world. Although he initially voted to authorize the war in Iraq - Obama opposed it from the start - Biden became a persistent critic of President Bush's policies in Iraq.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Biden, who sought the Democratic presidential nomination himself this year before pulling out after performing poorly in the first contest, in Iowa, has shown himself to be a tough political brawler, a characteristic that many Democrats say Obama has not displayed against McCain. That is something that presidential candidates typically look for in a running mate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Biden seems likely to fill in other gaps in Obama's political appeal that became increasingly clear during the primary season and going into the fall. He has a blue-collar background, potentially giving him appeal among white working-class voters. And he was born in Pennsylvania, a battleground state that could be vital to both parties.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The selection was disclosed as Obama prepares for the party's four-day convention starting Monday. From Springfield they went their different ways: Obama is going to begin a tour of swing states that will bring him into Denver on Wednesday. Biden is to head straight to Denver where, aides said, he would spend time meeting Obama delegates, with a particular effort to try to help soothe any tensions with Clinton's supporters there.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">the choice</span><br /></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;In naming my colleague and friend Sen. Joe Biden to be the vice presidential nominee, Sen. Obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong, experienced leader and devoted public servant. Sen. Biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help Sen. Obama both win the presidency and govern this great country.&quot; - Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I know that Joe will campaign well for Sen. Obama, and so I think he's going to be very formidable. I've always respected Joe Biden, but I disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first Gulf War to his position where he said you had to break Iraq up into three different countries. We really have different approaches to many national security issues.&quot; - Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We now have the ticket that's going to bring the change we've all been hoping for. I join all of the members of the Senate Democratic caucus in congratulating Joe Biden - a great friend, a great Democrat, and now our party's nominee for vice president.&quot; - Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I congratulate Sen. Barack Obama on his selection of my friend, Sen. Joe Biden, to be his vice presidential running mate. I have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with Joe Biden to bring strong bipartisan support to United States foreign policy.&quot; - Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Joe Biden is the right partner for Barack Obama. His many years of distinguished service to America, his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century.&quot; -- Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think he's made a great pick with Joe Biden. It's not just foreign policy. He has expertise in matters of the judiciary, in his work for families.&quot; - Virginia Gov. Timothy M. Kaine</span></p>
