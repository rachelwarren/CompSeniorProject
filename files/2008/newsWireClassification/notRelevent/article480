  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Annapolis grads for Obama</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re &quot;McCain seen as having an edge with military members, vets,&quot; front page, Sept. 4:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The story spotlights the opinion of former POW Paul Galanti of Richmond who said, &quot;Everyone I know who's ever worn a uniform will vote for McCain.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Galanti and I attended the Naval Academy together, and we are classmates from 1962. I believe that Paul believes what he said, but that does not make it true.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On the other hand, I will give you a fact -- every single Naval Academy graduate with whom I now correspond with intends to vote for Obama and against McCain. In both cases, a &quot;so what?&quot; is in order. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So, let's take a closer look at why Paul says he is for McCain. His idea is that we are at war and we need a &quot;wartime president.&quot; That is absurd when you know the war being discussed was not necessary, was based on lies, is counterproductive to the interests of the U.S. and needs to be ended as soon as possible. What we really need is a peacetime president, and that is why we need Barack Obama.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alaskan abstinence</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">According to the Chicago Tribune, our new vice presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, favored sex-abstinence education versus a more proactive, informative approach. The paper reported that &quot;Palin addressed teen pregnancy prevention in her 2006 run for governor, indicating on a questionnaire that she favored abstinence-until-marriage education over explicit sex education programs, school-based clinics and condom distribution in schools. The high school that Bristol Palin attended for part of last year, Wasilla High School, teaches abstinence in health class, its principal said.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Unfortunately, if Bristol had been informed of preventative measures, and, in fact, used a condom or other birth control, Gov. Palin would possibly not have a daughter who is 5 months pregnant. Apparently, her daughter did not receive the message about abstinence until marriage and was ignorant in ways to prevent a pregnancy. What a colossal failure on all accounts.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Just politics</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Am I the only one &quot;getting it&quot; about why John McCain can say we need no new taxes? If you look at a list of pork awards from individual congress persons to their constituents, you can see how to fatten our treasury immediately by cutting them out.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With our treasury refilled, why would we need to tax? There is a maxim that our forefathers understood: You owe no loyalty to a government that cannot govern justly. By just, I mean decent roads, decent schools and decent medical policies. Our present government willfully turns its back on what is good for the nation as a whole and focuses on that which is good for getting officials re-elected.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ben Franklin said we get the government we deserve. Perhaps it's true. Maybe that's why I feel like I'm tugging on Superman's cape. I love my nation, warts and all. My heart aches that individual opportunism (exhibited by too many of our congressional members) seems to have replaced that obligation to honor the social contract between governed and governing.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">House cleaning needed</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re &quot;From Dean to McCain in four years,&quot; op-ed, Aug. 31:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The writer's basic premise seems to be that because the current Bush administration has so damaged this country that the Republican Party will lose significant seats in the Congress and that the Democratic Party will almost certainly control the next Congress.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If that is the worry, then why reward eight years of mismanagement with another four years of this type of administration? John McCain, in his own words, is not so interested in domestic policy. Logically then, he would allow political appointees, good Republicans all, to keep running departments that Republicans have already mismanaged or destroyed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain is not the problem. We need a thorough cleaning of the Bush/Cheney bunch that is destroying this nation. McCain will not do this. I don't expect Barack Obama will ever make up for our failure to remove President Bush four years ago. But it is absolutely certain that John McCain won't.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">American turning point</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Finally! The Aug. 28 front page of The Pilot (&quot;Barack Obama makes history&quot;) was one for the ages. The photo of Democratic delegate Moe Spencer of Washington captured perfectly an extraordinary and long overdue moment in our nation's history.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The tears streaming down his face, with his gritty smile, presented a look of unadulterated joy, justice and hope, a level of emotion not often experienced in a lifetime. From 2,000 miles away, I shared that moment with watery eyes and a lump in my throat. But his photo showed a depth of emotion that I, a Caucasian, could only imagine. Feeling sadness for past injustices and joy for new successes, only one word came to mind: finally. Finally, we had confronted massive injustice and made right.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's been 389 years since the first black man arrived in Jamestown, 221 years since the Constitution proclaimed him three-fifths of a person, 145 since Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, and 132 since Rutherford Hayes gave birth to 88 years of segregation by trading an end of Reconstruction for Electoral College votes that won an election. It's been 60 years since Truman desegregated the armed forces, 50 years since Virginia's Massive Resistance laws closed our schools rather than integrate them and 44 years since civil rights legislation ended segregation in the United States.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What was not obvious on Aug. 27 was that it's been 221 years since Abigail Adams reminded her husband not to forget the women as he left to attend the Constitutional Convention, 88 years since the 19th Amendment allowed women to vote and only two months since Hillary Clinton put &quot;18 million cracks&quot; in the glass ceiling. As a nation, we have not always been true to our stated principles. It sometimes seems as if we will never get there. But the good news is that we keep trying to make it right.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And now, whenever a native-born child -- black, white, red, brown, yellow, male or female -- asks a parent or teacher: &quot;Can I be president?&quot; The answer is &quot;Yes, you can.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Winning vs. governing</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re &quot;From Dean to McCain in four years,&quot; op-ed, Aug. 31:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The writer says that divided government is the way to go because if Barack Obama should win and Democrats maintain their hold on Congress, there will be no way for the nation to get to the &quot;pragmatic&quot; center.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">First, he is confusing Democratic Party-run government, which actually works, with Republican-run government. Its right-wingers know how to win elections through fear and smear but can't actually govern after they win.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Second, the writer's one-sided view of John McCain as war hero and moderate leader of the people does not take into account his hyper-hawkish neo-con allegiance, blatant ignorance of our teetering economy and ideological bondage to the extremist far right. There's no maverick left in him.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re &quot;An inconvenient debate: Abortion,&quot; Saturday Break, Aug. 30:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Adelle M. Banks of the Religion News Service wrote of the tension caused by Catholics in public office whose decisions of conscience conflict with official church teaching on abortion.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Several U.S. Catholic bishops, namely Saltarelli recently of Wilmington, Del., and Burke, of St. Louis, have sanctioned prominent politicians, Sens. Joe Biden and John Kerry, on this issue.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It is interesting that Saltarelli accepted a large contribution from Biden for a school building, but, for his pro-choice position, refused to &quot;honor&quot; Biden by naming this building for the senator, his lifelong Catholic contributor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Apparently these &quot;pastoral&quot; leaders do not accept (or they ignore) the official teaching of the Church's Council of Trent (1545-1563), as well as the U.S. bishop's recent document entitled Faithful Citizenship. Both are unequivocal in stating that the ultimate criterion for a person's decision is the individual's conscience. Conscience alone dictates whether an individual action is right or wrong.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fowl accusation</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Are the chickens coming home to roost? The Obama campaign (&quot;Sharp attack ad hits Va. airwaves,&quot; front page, Sept. 1) is complaining about ads focusing on his association with Bill Ayers, a violent Vietnam-era underground group known as the Weathermen. Obama is pleading that he was only 8 years old in the 1960s when those events happened and that he &quot;denounces violence.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He was, however, an adult in 1993-2001 when he and Ayers served on the board of directors of a supposedly tax-exempt organization known as the Woods Fund of Chicago. One of the disbursements for $6,000 was given to the Trinity United Church of Christ, pastored by his minister of 20 years, the Rev. Jerimiah Wright. He is the one who uttered the expletive about America and proclaimed that America deserved the 9/11 attack and that the chickens had come home to roost.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama says professor Ayers &quot;lived in his neighborhood,&quot; was an upright guy he only knew casually. It is no wonder that campaign is crying foul, or should it be fowl?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re &quot;Surge vindicates McCain,&quot; letter, Sept. 1:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The writer asserts that the surge in Iraq was a success. Am I the only one who noticed that this success coincided with the Iraqi government signing an agreement handing over oil production to four huge oil companies?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Too few cooks in the kitchen</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I was struck during Gov. Sarah Palin's acceptance speech of the insensitivity she showed to the family cook she dismissed from the governor's staff, one of her efforts to save Alaskans some money. I wonder how the fired cook felt about losing her job? Has the cook now been added to the millions of unemployed that already exist in America? I would hope the governor has better things to do than cook family meals, much less for one with five children.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Missing maverick</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After seeing Sen. Joe Lieberman's speech decrying partisanship, presidential candidate John McCain's choice of Gov. Sarah Palin is all the more confusing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If it's true that McCain preferred Lieberman as a running mate, but bowed to pressure from the GOP base in his choice of Palin, one has to wonder if we've lost our champion of common sense and common ground for good.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lieberman may have been an unpopular choice among conservatives, but for longtime fans of McCain and undecided voters like myself, it would have been an inspiring show of political courage and a stunning reinforcement of the campaign's &quot;Country First&quot; slogan.</span></p>
