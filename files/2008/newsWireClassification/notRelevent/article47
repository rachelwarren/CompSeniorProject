  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">RICHMOND | Hours before Virginia voters head to the polls, the NAACP will go to federal court to demand that more voting machines be placed in minority polling places.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A hearing in federal court was set for 3:15 p.m. Monday after the organization renewed its motion Friday to redistribute voting machines, extend voting hours, and make paper ballots available in some precincts.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People sued last week, alleging the state was unprepared for Tuesday's huge turnout in the presidential election. The group withdrew the request Thursday after mediation with state officials. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">NAACP officials said they did not expect any new hearing before the election. But NAACP President Ben Jealous said the organization concluded Friday that the problems still exist .</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barack Obama struck back Friday at a claim by the John McCain campaign that Obama would cut defense spending 25 percent - an attack that could cost Obama votes in Hampton Roads, with its concentration of military forces and defense contractors.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a news release, Obama's campaign called the Republican TV and radio ads &quot;desperate and dishonest.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Democrat began airing his own TV ad in the Norfolk market in response. It quotes Robert Kagan, a military adviser to McCain, saying that &quot;Obama wants to increase defense spending. He wants to add 65,000 troops to the Army and recruit 27,000 more Marines ... to fight terrorism.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The McCain ads are based on a statement made by U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Despite the Obama rebuttal, Republicans continued the attack Friday. In a conference call with Virginia reporters, a group of prominent McCain supporters, including former U.S. Sen. George Allen and Attorney General Bob McDonnell, argued that congressional Democrats will push next year for defense spending cuts that, in McDonnell's words, &quot;will be devastating for the national defense and for Virginia.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The defense spending attack will be a key part of McCain's &quot;closing argument,&quot; particularly in Hampton Roads, McDonnell added.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The State Board of Elections has sent at least four staff members over the past week or so to help the Suffolk registrar's office meet the huge demand from absentee voters, said Valarie Jones, deputy secretary of the state board. Suffolk is one of a handful of offices in Virginia receiving the extra help, Jones said. Virginia Beach also has received some assistance.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The state board offered its services to localities with the biggest increases in new voter registrations, Jones said. Some registrars said they didn't need the help.</span></p>
