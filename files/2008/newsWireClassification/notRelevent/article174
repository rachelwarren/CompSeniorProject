  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The line on the upcoming vice-presidential debate in St. Louis: a young governor unaccustomed to the ways of Washington and the world against a 35-year senator so respected on the world stage that he was called to help Georgia when Russia attacked the former Soviet republic early last month.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Based on such calculus, one would expect Joe Biden, the veteran Democratic senator from Delaware, to handily defeat Sarah Palin, the two-year Republican governor from Alaska. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That is as long as Biden doesn't ... shoot too much from the hip ... say something insensitive that offends Palin's female fans or women in general ... fumble facts ... contradict Democratic nominee Barack Obama's position on an issue ... or invent some new verbal gaffe.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In other words, Biden looks to be a strong debater, if he can just avoid being his usual self.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His biggest recent head-scratching error came earlier this week on the &quot;CBS Evening News.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;When the stock market crashed, Franklin D. Roosevelt got on the television and didn't just talk about the, you know, the princes of greed. He said, 'Look, here's what happened,'&quot; Biden told news anchor Katie Couric.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Good point, senator, except that Herbert Hoover was president when the stock market crashed in October 1929. FDR took office in 1933. And Americans didn't have TVs in their homes back then, anyway.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The gaffes just keep on coming.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On a rope line in Ohio this week, a woman asked him why he and Obama support &quot;clean coal&quot; technology.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We're not supporting clean coal,&quot; Biden replied, putting his hands on the questioner's shoulders. &quot;Guess what? China's building two every week, two dirty coal plants, and it's polluting the United States. It's causing people to die.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Later in the exchange, he said: &quot;No coal plants here in America. Build them, if they're going to build them, over there (in China). Make them clean, because they're killing you.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That might be good Democratic politics, looking pro-environment and all that.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But check his running mate's energy policy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Under &quot;New Energy for America,&quot; barackobama.com says: &quot;Obama's Department of Energy will enter into public-private partnerships to develop five 'first-of-a-kind' commercial scale coal-fired plants with clean carbon capture and sequestration technology.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Biden was back on message Thursday in Wilkes-Barre, saying, &quot;I am for clean coal.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Then comes the best part. A Biden spokesman denies the obvious contradiction.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Ohio, you see, Biden was trying to convey that &quot;even if we stopped investing in clean coal tomorrow, the reality is China is building dirty coal-fired power plants, which contributes to global warming,&quot; spokesman David Wade explained.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Got that? No, neither did we.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Biden also jumped ahead of Obama on Sept. 16, telling NBC News that &quot;I don't think (AIG) should be bailed out by the federal government.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A week later, speaking on the same network, Obama was asked why he had criticized GOP nominee John McCain for opposing the government's bailout of the insurance giant when Biden had, too.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think ... that in that situation, I think Joe should have waited, as well,&quot; Obama said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Unfortunately for Obama, that situation, and ones similarly embarrassing, are a Biden staple.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If Biden commits a gaffe in his debate with Palin on Thursday, Obama will no doubt agree with a recent comment the Delaware senator made to a Hillary Clinton critic during a town-hall meeting in Nashua, N.H.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;She's easily qualified to be vice president ... and quite frankly, might have been a better pick than me,&quot; Biden said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Indeed. Palin's chances are looking better all the time.</span></p>
