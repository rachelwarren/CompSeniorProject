  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nov. 1--If you think you've been seeing a lot of television commercials for Sen. Barack Obama, you are right.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama spent almost four times as much money on TV in Virginia in the week between Oct. 21 and Oct. 28 than Sen. John McCain did, The Wisconsin Project, which monitors television advertising, said yesterday. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That spending did not include the 30-minute infomercial that Obama paid for Wednesday night.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">According to the Wisconsin Project, Obama paid for $2.45 million in commercials on Virginia stations to McCain's $637,000.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The more you speak, the more likely you are to be heard,&quot; said Steve Farnsworth, political scientist at George Mason University.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Farnsworth said the Obama money might be well-spent in Virginia, because Republicans traditionally have had a more effective turnout operation. This year, however, the Obama turnout operation might match that of McCain's, he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The two campaigns fought yesterday over a radio ad in which Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., suggested that Obama would cut defense spending, which would hurt Virginia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Fellow Virginians, cuts in the defense budget will weaken Virginia's economy and weaken national defense,&quot; Warner says. Virginia receives more defense spending than almost any other state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Warner cites a recent statement by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., in which the liberal congressman says Congress will cut defense spending by 25 percent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But Obama took out a television ad saying he would increase defense spending. He has said he wants to add 65,000 Army troops and 27,000 Marines.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But on a conference call with reporters, George Allen, Virginia's former governor and senator, said the question that needs to be answered is whether Obama as president would veto a bill cutting defense spending if Congress sent the bill to him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Allen, former Attorney General Jerry W. Kilgore, Attorney General Bob McDonnell and Del. Christopher B. Saxman of Staunton, representing the McCain campaign, said the campaign is &quot;closing fast&quot; in Virginia and elsewhere and has enlisted 20,000 volunteers for a get-out-the-vote effort in the state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Recent polls show McCain trailing Obama in Virginia and nationwide.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Asked why Obama is leading in what was a reliably Republican state, McDonnell said, &quot;Obama has done a better job indicating he stands for change.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But he said McCain is closing the gap by pointing out that the change is not necessarily for the good.</span></p>
