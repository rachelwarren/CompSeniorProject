  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">INDIANAPOLIS | Sen. Barack Obama supporters gathered around the television for Tuesday's debate warned against the presidential candidates going negative.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;People don't want to see that, they want to see real answers,&quot; said Cindy Jackson, 59.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She was one of a few dozen people gathered at Carol Myers' home here to witness the second debate between Mr. Obama and Republican nominee Sen. John McCain. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Democratic nominee acknowledged the concern - amid a week where the race has gotten especially nasty - in one of his opening answers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;You're not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers,&quot; Mr. Obama said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Thank you,&quot; several debate watchers here said in unison.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the candidates didn't really keep to that idea, and several voters at the party said they wished the debate would have stayed more positive.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They also complained the town-hall-style event did not include questions on education, crime, drug policy or gas prices.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dennis Smith, a Republican financial adviser from Bloomington, who came to the gathering undecided, left the watch party leaning toward Mr. Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I liked his response about what we need to sacrifice,&quot; he said. &quot;The most important thing in the next president's term will be the ability to bring the country together. I think Obama is more likely to do that.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The group - brought together via BarackObama.com - was weighted with supporters of the Democratic nominee. But a handful of Republicans attended, with all but one saying they weren't going to be persuaded.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ms. Myers, a former high school principal, said her brother and brother-in-law are Republicans, along with her mom, who has never voted for a Democrat. She didn't invite them, however, to change minds.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I just want to have a conversation. I don't want to convince anyone,&quot; she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama supporters at several points in the night felt like Mr. McCain was dodging questions, and groaned each time the Republican used his signature line: &quot;My friends.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I hate it when he says that,&quot; one debate watcher complained as others laughed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I'm not his friend,&quot; Obama supporter Mary Jo Rattermann said from the back of the room.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Another woman chimed in: &quot;This guy is not my friend, how many houses does he have? Seven, eight, nine, ten? He doesn't know how many he has.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There was predictably partisan head-shaking and mocking, mostly directed toward Mr. McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The multiracial group spanned several generations, but each person was similarly transfixed on the television.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When Mr. McCain needled his rival by saying, &quot;I'll answer the question,&quot; Ms. Myers shouted, &quot;Unlike Sarah,&quot; a reference to McCain running mate Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin who last week avoided answering several questions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Another woman piped up, &quot;Did he just wink?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Several started laughing at the joke about Mrs. Palin winking during her debate, but one of the Republicans in the room grew annoyed when the Obama supporters mocking Mr. McCain grew louder.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I'm not able to hear,&quot; he told the host, frowning.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The group liked Mr. Brokaw asking who would be considered for Treasury secretary under either man's administration.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Good question!&quot; two people shouted.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When Mr. Obama railed on AIG executives who took a retreat after getting money from the government, saying they &quot;should be fired,&quot; the room applauded.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama will hold a rally here Wednesday. Polls show Mr. McCain with a lead in the Hoosier State, but the race has tightened as Team Obama treated it like a true battleground with multiple offices, candidate visits and television commercials.</span></p>
