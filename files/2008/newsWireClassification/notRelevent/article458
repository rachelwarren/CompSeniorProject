  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A soaring jobless rate, an unprecedented jump in oil prices and a sliding dollar sent tremors through financial markets yesterday and cast fresh doubt on how soon the U.S. economy would be able to break out of a pattern of feeble growth and financial instability.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The nation's unemployment rate shot skyward last month to 5.5 percent, the biggest leap in more than two decades, and crude oil prices rocketed up $10.75 a barrel, sending U.S. stock markets tumbling and shaking the economic and political landscape just as the general election season begins. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It was one of the worst days of economic news in a year already well-stocked with disappointment. The Dow Jones industrial average reacted by plunging 394.64 points, or 3.13 percent, its sharpest decline since Feb. 27, 2007. Other major indicators also dropped about 3 percent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Today's events are a combination of really nasty news for American consumers,&quot; said Andrew Tilton, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Crude oil prices hit a new trading record of more than $139 a barrel before settling at $138.54. This more than erased a drop earlier in the week and promised further increases in motor fuel prices. The nationwide average is already just a penny shy of $4 a gallon for regular gasoline.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The one-day increase in crude prices was the biggest ever in dollar terms, the largest in percentage terms since June 1996 and more than the cost of an entire barrel a decade ago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Meanwhile, the jobless rate for May was up 0.5 percentage points from April, the Labor Department said, the largest swing in a single month since 1986. The number of jobs on employers' payrolls fell by 49,000, the fifth consecutive monthly decline for an economy that has shed 324,000 jobs this year. Joblessness rose across race and gender. Professional, commercial, construction, business service and manufacturing employers all cut jobs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;When you have an employment situation like that, and you see crude bounce ... that's shocking to anything that's going to touch the consumer,&quot; said Bart Barnett, head of equity trading at Morgan Keegan, an investment and brokerage firm. &quot;Outside of anything to do with oil, everything is down -- airlines, restaurants, furniture stores, retailers, transportation.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Much of the spike in unemployment was caused by an unusually large surge of teen-agers and people in their 20s into the labor force. And those young workers had little success finding work. The jobless rate among 16- to 19-year-olds rose to 18.7 percent from 15.4 percent in April. Retailers, who employ a large number of unskilled teen-agers during the summer, cut 27,000 positions in the month.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rising unemployment, however, spread well beyond young people. The jobless rate rose among almost every other group -- men, women, blacks and whites. The rate was unchanged among Latinos.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At the same time, average weekly earnings for non-managerial workers appeared to lose ground to inflation, rising only 3.2 percent in the year that ended in May. Analysts expect this to be less than inflation over the same time span. That inflation figure has not yet been released.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's crystal clear that the economy is not generating the job and income growth people need to maintain their living standards,&quot; said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Job losses continued in the construction industry, which has been hit hard by the housing downturn. That sector lost 34,000 positions in May and has now lost 475,000 jobs since its peak two years ago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There were worrisome signs in the professional and business service sector, which has been a stalwart of job creation in the past year. It lost 39,000 jobs, most of them temporary workers who are often shed to avoid layoffs of permanent employees.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's a muddling economy that continues to muddle on,&quot; said John Silvia, chief economist at Wachovia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Faced with the grim economic news, President Bush is considering new measures to help stimulate the battered economy, the White House said yesterday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">White House counselor Ed Gillespie said Mr. Bush's advisers are constantly looking at options for new economic proposals.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;There's a short window for the president here when it comes to new policy. We understand that,&quot; Mr. Gillespie said. &quot;So I guess what I'm saying is, don't rule it out.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Gillespie spoke before a Bush speech on the economy, timed around the ceremonial swearing-in of the president's new housing secretary, Steven Preston. In his remarks, Mr. Bush stuck to promoting his existing economic policies, such as making some of his tax cuts permanent and allowing more oil exploration and drilling in the United States.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The economy's latest woes didn't go unnoticed by the two men vying for Mr. Bush's job.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barack Obama, the likely Democratic nominee, called the employment figures &quot;deeply troubling,&quot; while Republican rival John McCain said they were a &quot;stark reminder of the economic challenges facing American families.&quot; Both candidates pledged to turn around the economy. </span></p>
