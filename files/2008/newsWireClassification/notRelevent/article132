  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">EYE FOR FASHION</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;But who knows? He may land his own show on Bravo.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So surmises Joshua Green of the Atlantic, referring to veteran Republican political operative Jeff Larson, who is believed to have been Gov. Sarah Palin's personal wardrobe shopper to the tune of $150,000. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As Mr. Green points out, &quot;even hateful liberals would have to admit that Mrs. Palin dresses awfully nicely.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">YO, JOE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The John McCain-Sarah Palin campaign has just released its latest ad, entitled &quot;I am Joe.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It features everyday Americans who submitted homemade videos to the campaign explaining how they are like &quot;Joe the Plumber.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">'FAIR' WARNING</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Proposed legislation sure to get a heated airing in the upcoming 111th Congress will be a &quot;Fairness Doctrine,&quot; which if enacted would require broadcasters to air both liberal and conservative commentators, conceivably sounding a death knell for popular ideological programs like those hosted by Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A number of Democratic leaders, including 2008 presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, have said they would support such controls. Now Sen. Jeff Bingaman, New Mexico Democrat, is among lawmakers adding his voice to the demand for so-called &quot;fairness.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Radio and media generally have a higher calling than to just reflect a single point of view,&quot; Mr. Bingaman opined this week while being interviewed on Albuquerque's KKOB-AM.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But Chris Berry, president and general manager of WMAL-AM in Washington, KKOB's sister station, believes that if Democrats push for a Fairness Doctrine, they could be surprised at the response from their constituencies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Millions of people listen and enjoy programs such as those hosted Rush Limbaugh and Chris Plante,&quot; says Mr. Berry, whose top-rated station features a heavy lineup of conservative voices (we reported last month that WMAL won the National Association of Broadcasters' [NAB's] Major Market Station of the Year award, beating out other stations across the country).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He predicts that, if engaged, radio listeners from coast to coast &quot;will respond in a massive way if [House] Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi and other Democrats try to mandate content.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Otherwise, Mr. Berry informs Inside the Beltway that a &quot;Fairness Doctrine&quot; is anything but fair.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Just the name 'Fairness Doctrine' is misleading,&quot; he says. &quot;Let's call it what it is: It's an attack on the First Amendment and puts quotas on free speech. We don't need the government controlling our thought process and what we can say as Americans.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">'THE RACE'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;On a college campus in the nation's capital, public discourse about this election cycle is in no short supply,&quot; explains Michael Rohd, visiting professor at Georgetown University, who conceived and directs an unprecedented theater project - part performance and part political forum, mirroring the 2008 presidential battle - called &quot;The Race.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The production - updated with the latest news headlines, thus each performance may vary on any given day - incorporates a cross section of voices into an onstage conversation about important issues raised this election season, including what demographic will vote for each candidate and why, and what it takes to be a leader.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Rohd is founding artistic director of the Sojourn Theatre in Portland, Ore.</span></p>
