  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">IS BARACK Obama a dishonorable troop-hater?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">According to John McCain and Sarah Palin, you betcha. As one recent McCain&nbsp;ad puts it, Obama &quot;says our troops in Afghanistan are 'just air-raiding villages and killing civilians.' How dishonorable.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But what exactly is wrong with decrying military tactics that cause needless civilian casualties and undermine our counterinsurgency efforts? What's wrong with denouncing the stupid strategic decisions that forced the adoption of those tragic and counterproductive tactics in the first place?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That's what Obama was doing in New Hampshire in August 2007, when he made the comments the McCain-Palin team has so enthusiastically ripped out of context. He was arguing that the diversion of U.S. troops to Iraq had had devastating consequences for the efforts in Afghanistan. We need more troops in Afghanistan, Obama asserted, so that U.S. forces won't need to rely so much on airstrikes as an anti-insurgency tool.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We've got to get the job done there,&quot; he said. &quot;And that requires us to have enough troops so that we're not just air-raiding villages and killing civilians, which is causing enormous problems there.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Not exactly eloquent, but Obama's fundamental point is unassailable. With so many U.S. troops bogged down in Iraq, our troops in Afghanistan are spread dangerously thin. As the Afghan insurgency picks up steam, overwhelmed U.S. ground troops increasingly call in close-air-support bomb attacks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">These airstrikes are far more deadly for Afghan civilians than U.S. ground attacks, for the simple reason that whereas a soldier can usually tell the difference between an unarmed child and an insurgent, a bomb dropped from thousands of feet up can't. So far this year, at least 395 Afghan civilians have been killed in NATO airstrikes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Should we care?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The mothers of dead Afghan children and the wives of dead Afghan men certainly care. And we should, too, both for moral reasons and for self-interested reasons.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Again, it's classic counterinsurgency doctrine: If your anti-insurgency tactics have the unintended consequence of killing innocent civilians, you're going to drive more civilians into the arms of the insurgency, thus undermining your own efforts.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Is it &quot;dishonorable&quot; to say that we need to change our approach in Afghanistan so that we'll rely less on airstrikes, cause fewer unintended civilian casualties and therefore increase our chances of a successful counterinsurgency campaign?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If it is, Obama will have plenty of company in the &quot;dishonorable&quot; corner. He'll be joined there by Gens. David H. Petraeus and David D. McKiernan, who have repeatedly voiced nearly identical concerns.</span></p>
