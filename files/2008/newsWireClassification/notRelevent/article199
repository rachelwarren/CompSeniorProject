  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Former Gov. Jim Gilmore said Tuesday that he will not request special appropriations known as &quot;earmarks&quot; if he wins election to the U.S. Senate but insisted he will be an advocate for federal funding of Virginia priorities.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Republican candidate signed a &quot;No Earmark Pledge&quot; promoted by FreedomWorks, a Washington, D.C.-based grass-roots organization that advocates for lower taxes and limited government. The practice of directing federal spending through earmarks has been criticized by watchdog groups and reform advocates who charge that lawmakers excessively load up legislation with pet projects. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gilmore said earmarks are used to buy votes and called the practice &quot;bad finance&quot; and &quot;bad politics.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gilmore is battling former Democratic Gov. Mark Warner for the Senate seat held by Republican John Warner, who is retiring. They are not related.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John Warner has sponsored or co-sponsored congressional earmarks that directed federal funds for key military and defense projects in Virginia, as well as transportation projects and college research initiatives. But Gilmore said the veteran senator &quot;has made an effort to put things into the proper process, into the appropriations process, so they can be weighed and balanced, and I don't take issue with that approach.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Warner agreed that the use of earmarks should be reformed, particularly in transportation spending bills, saying, &quot;The problem with earmarks is when people try to slide these things in without any transparency.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Warner points to impact of globalization on region</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">U.S. Senate candidate Mark Warner told a group of 25 mostly young professionals Tuesday that sweeping changes wrought by technology and globalization have brought both challenges and opportunities to Western Virginia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">During a candidate forum sponsored by NewVa Connects, a young professionals networking and advocacy group, Warner spent part of his time addressing energy and market issues, but he tailored much of his speech toward Southwest Virginia's ability to compete globally.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He said that globalization has resulted in some jobs lost, but it's also helped to level the playing field for people in rural communities and small cities.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The National Rifle Association has pegged presidential candidate Barack Obama as an enemy of gun rights, but U.S. Sen. Jim Webb is defending his fellow Democrat on the Second Amendment.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a new radio ad for Obama's campaign, Webb says: &quot;I am an NRA member, and I know that my friend Barack Obama will protect our Second Amendment rights.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad is airing on radio stations in much of Virginia. Obama's positions on gun rights are getting more attention as the Democrat competes for votes in rural areas of the state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The NRA's political arm has endorsed Republican John McCain and depicted Obama as a threat to gun rights, warning that Obama would be &quot;the most anti-gun president in American history.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama has raised the issue of Second Amendment rights himself in visits to Southwest Virginia. At a rally in Lebanon last month, he told the crowd: &quot;I will not take your shotgun away. I will not take your rifle away. I won't take your handgun away.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While his campaign insists he will not curtail gun rights, Obama has been endorsed by one of the nation's most visible gun control organizations. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence announced its support for Obama on Monday.</span></p>
