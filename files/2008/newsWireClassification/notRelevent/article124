  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Facts are facts; this paper should stick to them</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dan Radmacher might better understand increasing public mistrust of the objectivity of newspapers by reading a purported &quot;news&quot; story in the Oct. 10 Roanoke Times -- &quot;Economy notebook: Pelosi calling for action over $150 billion plan.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The final paragraph about failed Democratic efforts to pass a second House-backed stimulus package in the Senate reads, &quot;If Democratic nominee Barack Obama wins the White House and if Capitol Hill Democrats make gains in the elections as well, it might be easier to pass a stimulus measure over dispirited Republicans.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Is this news, or is it the hypothesis of an unidentified wire service or Times &quot;reporter&quot;? If it's the latter, it should be relegated to the op-ed page, rather than presented as news. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Times is utilizing an ostensible news article to advise readers that a vote for Obama and other Democrats could lead to another redistribution of wealth from those who have applied themselves to earn it to those who have not.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What we have here is a failure to communicate objectively. News is news, and opinions are opinions. This paper and others are increasingly blurring that distinction at the risk of further eroding the declining trust of their readership.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Editor's note: The paragraph quoted was published as written by The Associated Press. The paragraph that preceded it, as written and published, might be helpful to some readers: &quot;The House did pass a $61 billion economic aid proposal last month before lawmakers left Capitol Hill ahead of the Nov. 4 election. But a similar plan failed to pass the Senate. President Bush had promised a veto anyway.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Don't let Obama appoint justices</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When you vote on Election Day, remember our next president will likely nominate one, maybe two, justices to the U.S. Supreme Court -- where they will serve for life.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain has promised to nominate justices who will respect the original intent of the Constitution. But Barack Obama is sure to nominate radical leftists like himself. Such judges will be pro-abortion, pro-homosexual rights and against any influence of America's Christian heritage in law or government.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The recent Supreme Court decision to uphold a ban on partial-birth abortion was by a narrow margin of 5 to 4. The ruling that the Second Amendment applies to individual citizens was also 5 to 4. If just one Obama appointment had been on the court, those victories for life and liberty would have gone the other way.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Those who plan to vote for Obama should realize his socialist people's paradise will come at a great cost to the economy and our national security. The greatest cost, however, will be that we will have missed our last chance to keep constitutional integrity on the Supreme Court. For the sake of America's future, vote for McCain.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin represents traditional values</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When John McCain selected Sarah Palin, he hit a home run and Democrats knew it. They were out-witted and stunned. Immediately a tirade of caustic letters appeared in The Roanoke Times that still continues, trying to demean and belittle her and her family.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Valid concerns about qualifications are important, but Palin's qualifications for vice president far exceed Barack Obama's for president. The nit-picking of most of the first letters was a frantic attempt to sway voters who think she will be the breath of fresh air needed to shake up the good ol' boys in Washington as she did in Alaska. Her experience as governor is more assuring than Obama's as community organizer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin represents values the majority of us hold dear: faith in God, sanctity of life, motherhood, traditional marriage and the Second Amendment. Polls haven't been favorable for John McCain and Palin and their election is doubtful. But if those of us who are the silent majority favoring them express our approval and vote, they will be elected.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I fear that many of our freedoms will be lost and America will be changed forever if Obama is elected. Changes that we don't want.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Extra section takes on a liberal slant</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Articles on the opinion and commentary pages of The Roanoke Times are predominately liberal. The liberal slant also is found in the comic section (&quot;Doonesbury&quot;).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Oct. 4, liberal views slid into the Extra section with a vengeance. Page one offered a preview of Bill Maher's latest movie, &quot;Religulous&quot; (&quot;Irreverent humor saves 'Religulous' &quot;). It is largely a tirade against religion, especially Christianity. All religious people are stupid. There was no criticism of the movie, which was &quot;saved&quot; by &quot;irreverent humor.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The same kind of humor was employed by &quot;An American Carol&quot; but now it becomes &quot;left-bashing&quot; and &quot;rude and irreverent.&quot; Double standard? Rife in The Times.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If you agree with this leftward slant, then Sen. Barack Obama is the man you should vote for. The sanctity of life is not the only thing that he consistently ignores.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Goode's ad was on target</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sara Braaten was wrong in her Oct. 10 letter (&quot;Goode's ad doesn't reflect well on him&quot;). Tom Perriello is a New York lawyer. He is a member of the New York bar.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Perriello had that information on his resume early in the campaign and then removed it. I wonder if he is ashamed of being a New York lawyer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He has also gotten more than $160,000 in contributions from New Yorkers. He has received $7,000 in campaign contributions from the PACs of New York Rep. Charles Rangel. We do not need New York values in Virginia. We need Virgil Goode and Virginia values.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Try to treat all religions equally</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: &quot;Absences are excused but not pardoned during Jewish holidays&quot; (Oct. 8 The Edge section), reporting how Roanoke students are denied a perfect-attendance certificate if they miss school for non-Christian religious holidays:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In elementary school in Loudoun County in the 1960s, I once had this experience when my only missed day was a Jewish holiday. I thought the time was long past when any student in Virginia would have to experience this minor, but unnecessary, disappointment.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But lo and behold, the policy persists in Roanoke; moreover, if it's still the policy in Roanoke, I imagine other school systems have the same policy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here's a modest suggestion: Allow students one or two days per year that can be pardoned (for perfect-attendance reasons) for a non-Christmas religious observance. The school system already excuses such absences, so no debate should be needed over which absences would be considered legitimate for the pardon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's a fairly small thing in the life of a student to get, or fail to get, a perfect-attendance certificate. But it's a big lesson for students to see their local school system and government doing their best to treat all religions equally, as the First Amendment challenges us to do.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Health inspectors fell down on the job</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I just wanted to say how shocked I was to see the filth in the food court downtown. I have only one question: Do we not have health inspectors? After the nasty stuff your paper showed, why would any inspector pass these places and allow them to serve food?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That filth did not happen overnight. If we do have inspectors, maybe someone should retrain them, as it is evident that someone may be getting paid for a job that has not been done. I have taken my family down there to eat and was just sick to see how bad things were.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Roanoke is a beautiful place. We should be proud of our town, and I am. I just hope stuff like this never happens again.</span></p>
