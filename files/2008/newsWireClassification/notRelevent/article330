  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The crucial first debate between John McCain and Barack Obama gained an even brighter spotlight last night as a financial bailout package was debated and the contenders traded recriminations over McCain's involvement in it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It wasn't clear until late yesterday morning that the 9 p.m. EDT debate at the University of Mississippi would take place. That's when McCain, who had asked to postpone the forum until Congress and the Bush administration reached an agreement to stabilize U.S. markets, reversed himself and agreed to go ahead.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama had said he would attend no matter what McCain decided to do. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The debate, expected to reach a huge viewing audience, was supposed to focus on foreign policy, a topic generally viewed as a McCain strength. But given the roiling economic situation, moderator Jim Lehrer of PBS indicated he wouldn't be constrained by the boundaries the two campaigns negotiated months ago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The debate was crucial for both Obama and McCain, their first encounter before a national audience in a race that remains exceedingly close just over five weeks from Election Day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The candidates came with different objectives and points to prove.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama, 47, needed to convince some skeptical voters he is ready to be commander in chief and steward of a precarious economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The 72-year old McCain, a 26-year House and Senate veteran, hoped to cast himself as an experienced hand in times of crisis while also distancing himself from President Bush, the unpopular leader of his own party. McCain also needed to tamp down concerns about his age.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain generally won praise for his debating skills during the GOP primaries, delivering answers that were crisp and to the point while getting in the occasional zinger. He also displayed flashes of temper.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> There is no mention of these debates in the Constitution or in any law of the land, but over the past three decades they have become the most important events in America's presidential elections.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Both the Obama and McCain camps believe the debates could decide who wins in November - as they probably did when Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in 1980, for example. Political scientists have argued that debates also helped elect Bill Clinton in 1992 and George W. Bush in 2000, and made the race close in 2004.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> On the stage, said Lehrer, who has moderated more such debates than anyone, the tension is compelling. &quot;You can smell it. It's under your arms and in your toes,&quot; he said. &quot;It is extraordinary what these guys go through.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;It's the only event that the entire electorate can really share,&quot; Lehrer said. &quot;And it's the only time that the candidates stand on the same stage and talk about the same subjects at the same time.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;It's a high-wire act,&quot; added Ed Fouhy, a retired television executive who was the executive producer of the presidential debates in 1988 and 1992, &quot;and we all watch it for the same reason we go to the circus . . . to see if he falls off the wire.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The effort both camps have put into preparations for the debates reveals their importance. The candidates work harder on debate readiness than on any other campaign activity, according to participants in past efforts.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Preparation involves studying briefing books on every issue that might be raised, reviewing the opponent's past debate performances, and - for Obama at least - long hours of practice against a Washington lawyer who has spent weeks learning to debate like McCain. He is Gregory Craig, one of Clinton's defense lawyers in the impeachment process in 1998. Craig played Bush in the elaborate rehearsals that prepared Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., for his three debates. &quot;Greg was a better Bush than Bush was,&quot; said Bob Shrum, the campaign consultant who ran Kerry's campaign. So good that &quot;he made me angry,&quot; Kerry added in an interview.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Debates suck up so much time,&quot; said former Sen. Bill Bradley, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2000, &quot;and they create an unreal universe - in which you are supposed to be 'real.' &quot; As Bradley's remark suggests, these are theatrical performances. Television conveys images and impressions even better than it conveys positions on issues. Viewers will see, for example, that Obama towers over McCain by nearly half a foot, perhaps an unexpected visual for many voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Judging by the comments made in the past in polls and focus groups, some voters will draw conclusions about which candidate appears more presidential, more commanding or more comfortable with himself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Separately, spending on campaign commercials suggests Obama could be making inroads in states that have been reliably Republican in recent presidential elections, drawing McCain into ad wars there.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The two presidential hopefuls are scheduled to debate twice more, at Belmont University in Nashville on Oct. 7 and at Hofstra University in Hempsted, N.Y., on Oct. 15. Vice presidential contenders Sarah Palin and Joe Biden are to square off in a single debate Oct. 2 at Washington University in St. Louis.</span></p>
