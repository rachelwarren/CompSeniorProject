  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Virginian-Pilot</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For Bee Fox, the office adornment she's had since February is a mood-lifter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It gives me hope,&quot; Fox said. &quot;It makes me happy to drive up in the morning and see my Obama sign.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Morgan Anton wears a McCain-Palin sticker at work and has nine campaign signs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I listen to my customers; they tell me everything,&quot; Anton said. &quot;Why shouldn't I tell them who I am? I want people to know that I'm a Republican.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fox, the regional manager of the Tranzon Fox auction company in Virginia Beach, and Anton, the owner of Jonathon's Tavern in Norfolk, belong to the minority of businesspeople who unashamedly expose their political persuasions in the workplace. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Most businesspeople, though, steer clear of political endorsements on their property, not wanting to risk alienating customers or candidates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Prince George's County, Md., a hotel faced threats of a boycott after it put up a pro-John McCain message on its marquee, The Washington Post reported. Locally, though, businesses that display campaign signs voice few worries.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The great thing is, you can express your political views without fear in this country,&quot; said Fox, whose Obama sign hangs on the front window.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Elected officials know how we feel about things,&quot; real estate developer Michael Barrett said. &quot;I don't think a sign by itself is going to cause any problem.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barrett, chief executive officer of Runnymede Corp., has allowed signs to be placed at eight properties in Virginia Beach and Norfolk for Beach mayoral candidate Will Sessoms, City Council hopeful Glenn Davis and Democratic congressional candidate Glenn Nye.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barrett said the signs went up only at locations with more than one tenant. &quot;There's no implication that all of those tenants support the candidate.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Suffolk, which is gearing up for its first mayoral election, Bert Young took a multi-partisan approach.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Suffolk is a small town,&quot; said Young, co-owner of Young Properties, a real estate company on Main Street. &quot;We pretty much know all of the mayoral candidates.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So he allowed any who asked to put signs on his property.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As of Friday, three had taken him up on the offer: Mike Debranski, Linda Johnson and Tom Powell.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They are accompanied by a better-known name. With all the local signs popping up, &quot;we decided, 'What the heck, we'll put one up for president,'\&quot; Young said. So he added one for his preferred candidate, McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Most of the signs that have sprouted at businesses are for municipal candidates, who tend to be more eager for local exposure.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">E. Andre Brown, owner of E. Andre Brown Funeral Establishment on Holland Road, said he has allowed signs for the two Virginia Beach candidates who canvassed him - Sessoms and Georgia Allen, who is running for City Council.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Brown said his company is a client of TowneBank, where Sessoms is the Virginia Beach president. &quot;I did it because of his views and the issues he deals with, more so than we bank at TowneBank,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sessoms said about 300 businesses had put up his signs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;In my mind, it's quite critical; I'm running against someone who has tremendous name identification,&quot; he said, referring to Meyera Oberndorf, the mayor for 20 years. &quot;How do you overcome it? You do everything you can.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Another mayoral candidate, John Moss, said the signs &quot;help put your name out with new voters.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For rival Scott Taylor, &quot;I think that the grass roots - talking to people and shaking their hands - is much more important than signs.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Moss estimated he had 65 signs at businesses. Taylor, who said his count was in the &quot;double digits,&quot; said he'd been rebuffed by some &quot;who were skeptical about talking to me because they have an affiliation with TowneBank.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sessoms said he would not discourage bank customers from supporting his opponents: &quot;Banking and politics are separate. I would never, ever do that, and if I did, my job would be in jeopardy, as it should be.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Oberndorf has no signs anywhere. That's intentional.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She has supported revisions in city laws to reduce the permissible size of business signs. &quot;I didn't want to be a hypocrite,&quot; Oberndorf said. &quot;It wasn't right for me to make laws that I would not observe myself.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If she wins, she said, she will not hold grudges against businesses that backed her rivals. But she did acknowledge feeling &quot;a little strange if I go into a commercial place of business&quot; with an opponent's sign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;What that says to me is, 'You're not welcome, and anyone who supports you is not welcome,'\&quot; Oberndorf said. &quot;If I were an entrepreneur, I'd want everyone to come to my place of business and feel at home and respected and valued.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">J.T. O'Donnell, a workplace consultant in New Hampshire, said she would not counsel businesses against permitting campaign signs. After all, it could be &quot;good for business and build political connections.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But, she said, businesspeople should know the consequences, which could include discomforting customers and employees who favor another candidate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Local proprietors who allow candidates' signs said they've gotten no flak inside or outside the office. &quot;For us, it's not really an issue,&quot; said Young in Suffolk. &quot;We're not in the business of selling anything.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Likewise, Fox said her office, off Witchduck Road, is visited mostly by mail and delivery people, not customers. Six other people work in the office regularly, she said. One is a McCain supporter, &quot;and we have great discussions. He has never said he is offended by the sign.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nor should a customer be offended, said Brown, the funeral home owner.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We provide a service to everyone, Democrat, Republican or independent,&quot; he said. &quot;My service should speak for itself. Not who I allow to put up a sign.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anton, whose Hampton Boulevard bar sits less than a mile from the Norfolk Naval Station, said most of her patrons are Republicans. A few Democrats have told her good-naturedly, &quot;You're going to lose.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Her diplomatic response: &quot;May the best man win.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Inside hang four McCain-Palin and two &quot;Country First&quot; Republican signs. Outside are three McCain-Palin placards. Another, closer to the street, was stolen, she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The signs, she said, are fitting in an establishment where political talk is commonplace. During an interview, two customers were debating gun rights within earshot.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think people should be more honest about who they are,&quot; Anton said. &quot;I'd rather lose some customers than lie to them about who I really am.&quot;</span></p>
