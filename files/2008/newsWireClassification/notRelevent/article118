  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">DENVER</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. John McCain opened up a fresh line of attack against his presidential rival in Colorado on Friday, saying Sen. Barack Obama's election would give Democrats unchecked authority over the nation's purse strings.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The answer to a slowing economy is not higher taxes, but that's exactly what's going to happen when the Democrats have total control of Washington,&quot; he warned, while also taking a swipe at Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., for suggesting that taxes and spending may need to be increased to deal with the nation's economic crisis. &quot;When he says that, quote, there are, quote, 'a lot of very rich people out there whom we can tax,' it's safe to assume that means you,&quot; McCain said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain spent the day in Denver, Colorado Springs and Durango, campaigning in a traditionally Republican state where Obama is leading in the polls and has been flooding the airwaves with advertisements. McCain was accompanied by John Elway, a former Denver Bronco quarterback legendary for fourth-quarter heroics, who told the Denver crowd that he &quot;knows a thing or two about comebacks&quot; and expressed confidence that McCain would defy predictions that he will go down to defeat here.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain hammered away at Obama on taxes, spending and the question of whether he is ready to become commander in chief, the subject of a McCain campaign ad released Friday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Sen. Obama said yesterday that if you want to know how he would respond in a crisis, look what he's done during his campaign,&quot; McCain said. &quot;But we've seen the wrong response from him over and over during this campaign.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain noted that Obama &quot;opposed the surge strategy that is bringing us victory in Iraq and will bring us victory in Afghanistan,&quot; continuing: &quot;He said he would sit down unconditionally with the world's worst dictators. When Russia invaded Georgia, Sen. Obama said the invaded country should show restraint. He's been wrong on all of these.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The GOP nominee also picked up on new reports of rising foreclosures to sharpen his critique of the administration and Congress for not moving fast enough to help struggling home&shy;owners. McCain wants the federal government to spend up to $300 billion to buy bad mortgages and give home&shy;owners a break, and on Friday morning he appeared to refer to reports that the federal government may start guaranteeing home mortgages.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Finally Congress and the administration are putting together a plan to address this problem,&quot; McCain said. &quot;Let me say: It's about time.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama took a day off from campaigning to visit his critically ill grandmother in Hawaii. But two frustrated Republicans popped up to voice concern with their own presidential candidate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I would have done things differently the last few weeks,&quot; Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin said in an interview with The Associated Press.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think McCain's economic and health care plans should have been more vigorously defended, and unfortunately Obama has been able to incorrectly define McCain's plans and ideas,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge expressed a different concern to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ridge said the race would have been different in his state, which has 21 electoral votes, if McCain had chosen him as running mate instead of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think we'd be foolish not to admit it publicly,&quot; he said .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ridge later released a written statement saying his remarks had been taken out of context and that he had often praised Palin. He added that the race in Florida would have been different if that state's governor had been placed on the ticket, or in Minnesota similarly. Florida has 27 electoral votes and Minnesota 10. Alaska has three.</span></p>
