  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democrat Barack Obama leads Republican John McCain in the presidential race in the battleground state of Virginia, according to a poll published Wednesday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The CNN/Time magazine poll of 698 likely Virginia voters shows that 53 percent supported Obama and 43 percent backed McCain. Four percent either supported neither candidate or were undecided.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The results are outside the poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. It was conducted by phone Saturday through Tuesday by Opinion Research Corp. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Most polls have shown McCain and Obama in a close race in Virginia with the results generally within the margin of error.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republicans have won the past 10 presidential races in Virginia. Democrats have won back-to-back governor's elections and Democrat Jim Webb narrowly upset Republican Sen. George Allen in 2006. In February, Obama won the state presidential primary in a rout, defeating Hillary Clinton by nearly a 2-to-1 ratio.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Even so, a 10-point victory by a Democrat this fall is unlikely, said Virginia Commonwealth University political science professor Robert D. Holsworth.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The maximum Democrats have achieved has been 6 points, and it's hard to believe that is going to happen in Virginia,&quot; Holsworth said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The last time a Democrat exceeded that margin of victory in Virginia was 1988 when former Gov. Chuck Robb won his first U.S. Senate term over Republican Maurice Dawkins.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For the first time in decades, however, Virginians are watching the final phase of a presidential race fought out in full fury on their home turf.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama or his running mate, Joe Biden, have visited the state eight times since June, and Obama is due back in Roanoke on Friday. McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, have campaigned here twice over that time, and McCain is due back in Woodbridge on Saturday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama, however, has used his fundraising advantage to saturate Virginia's most populous area, the Washington, D.C., suburbs, with television advertising. He has opened more than 40 campaign offices statewide.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His campaign has aggressively sought to register new voters, particular young people. That effort contributed substantially to 436,000 new voter registrations since Jan. 1, boosting Virginia's voter rolls past 5 million for the first time, the State Board of Elections reported Wednesday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the Democrats' new, highly organized cadre of campaign workers statewide faces a Republican organization that has proved its ability to turn out conservative voters on precinct and neighborhood levels in presidential elections for at least 20 years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both McCain and Obama began major efforts aimed at women voters this week. Allen's wife, former Virginia First Lady Susan Allen, headlined an event for McCain in Richmond on Wednesday. Current First Lady Anne Holton and Lisa Collis, her predecessor and wife of former Gov. Mark R. Warner, take on a daylong string of Obama events Thursday in Virginia Beach, Williamsburg, Richmond and Herndon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nationally, McCain enjoys more support among men while women trend more toward Obama, said University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;In Virginia, the gender war is more equally matched, which is why it's closer here,&quot; Sabato said. &quot;On the whole, based on what I've seen around the country, I think women are more moveable, either to build up a bigger Obama majority or to narrow the chasm for McCain.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Also, Obama's rival for the nomination, Sen. Hillary Clinton, on Wednesday asked Democrats who volunteered for her campaign to work for Obama in Virginia. The same program, called Hillary Sent Me!, has been used to marshal her loyalists in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Every single conversation, every single phone call, every single volunteer could make a difference in winning Virginia,&quot; said an e-mail solicitation sent to activists by her political action committee, HillPAC.</span></p>
