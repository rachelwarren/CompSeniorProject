  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sullivan I</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For much of Sunday, Andrew Sullivan (http://andrewsullivan.the atlantic.com) was pumping up one of the most bizarre tinfoil-hat theories to hit the campaign, easily topping the &quot;Barack Obama is secretly a Muslim&quot; chain mails.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Sullivan picked up and amplified for his more mainstream audience rumors mongered at that journalistic paragon the Daily Kos (http://www.dailykos.com) that Sarah Palin's youngest son, Trig, the Down syndrome baby she didn't abort, really wasn't her son, but her grandson.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">According to the theory to which Mr. Sullivan has devoted more than a dozen posts as of Monday afternoon, the governor faked her own pregnancy to cover up the pregnancy of daughter Bristol Palin, and Trig is actually Bristol's son.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Photos from this spring in which Mrs. Palin is rather obviously in her seventh and eighth months quickly surfaced Sunday night and the rumors never had any serious basis beyond some semi-understood gynecology surrounding the word &quot;leakage&quot; and a picture of Bristol Palin wearing an engagement ring. (If &quot;they&quot; could cover up a pregnancy, could such a devious and powerful &quot;they&quot; have her wearing such a thing in public?) </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Sullivan quickly Monday tried to make the issue the vetting by John McCain's campaign, saying the Republican candidate had to offer rebuttal and saying that rumors need to be answered publicly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Conservative blogger Ace of Spades (http://ace.mu.nu) - among many, many others - went absolutely ballistic, and sent an e-mail to &quot;a bunch of the heavy hitters in the right-leaning respectable blogosphere to suggest a full boycott of linking Sullivan, forever.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Large parts of his diatribe are unprintable, but make reference to an episode involving Mr. Sullivan's gay Internet cruising and how he &quot;screamed bloody murder when his own privacy was invaded.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;There is a limit, and ... now he's way beyond it He is not a serious commentator; he is a vicious bridge-troll of a propagandist, a nasty little rotten-hearted [epithet] who gets his jollies assailing a sixteen year old girl because her mom threatens&quot; the Obama campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sullivan II</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Andrew Sullivan considered Sarah Palin just plain weird, even before he began spreading groundless rumors about Trig Palin's parentage.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Less vile, but no less absurd, was his disseminating a false theory about the names of the Palin children, printing the following correspondence with the approving intro that &quot;a reader plumbs the weirdness.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot; 'Willow' was Buffy the Vampire Slayer's best friend and 'Piper' was the eldest sister on the series Charmed played by Shannen Doherty. The governor obviously has a penchant for television shows of paranormal female empowerment. (I know, it's too gay that I know this.)&quot; After six degrees of Internet repetition, this became, in an Alan Wolfe article in the New Republic (http://www.tnr.com), the claim became Mrs. Palin &quot;named two of her children after witches.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Groundless.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Alas, one problem for this theory is the timing: Buffy the Vampire Slayer didn't start airing until 1997, whereas Sarah Palin's daughter Willow is described as being 14 years old. I don't know whether she turned 14 this year or will turn 15 later this year, but I'm pretty sure that 2008 minus 14 equals something before 1997. Otherwise, that's a great theory,&quot; dryly observed Stuart Buck of the Buck Stops Here (http://stuart buck.blogspot.com).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fact-checking being too much for Andrew Sullivan and the New Republic, we turn to the hard-bitten and hard-boiled cynics at People magazine (http://www.people.com).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Sarah's parents were coaches and the whole family was involved in track and I was an athlete in high school, so with our first-born, I was, like, 'Track!' Bristol is named after Bristol Bay. That's where I grew up, that's where we commercial fish. Willow is a community there in Alaska. And then Piper, you know, there's just not too many Pipers out there and it's a cool name. And Trig is a Norse name for 'strength,' &quot; second-gentleman hopeful Todd Palin told the magazine.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dead-enders</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The tinfoil-hate brigade in the fever swamps of the liberal blogosphere isn't giving up the &quot;Sarah Palin faked her pregnancy&quot; lie.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Within hours of the pictures of an obviously pregnant Mrs. Palin showing up, there was no backing down among the commenters and diarists at Daily Kos (http://www.dailykos.com) and Democratic Underground (http://www.democratic underground.com), even though Kos himself, Markos Moulitsas, and other site leaders said the rumors were unfounded.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a comment by prius04 at Daily Kos, which won 5 &quot;thumbs up&quot; and no &quot;thumbs down&quot; grades: &quot;I would suggest that maybe Karl Rove himself started this story. By getting everyone in a tizzy over the grandmother angle he gets us all to stew over it for a few days. Then proof that the Gov is the mother surfaces and we all have black eyes. This also damages DailyKos and other reality based sites.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Others speculated that Daily Kos specifically was set up and wanted an investigation of the Kos Diary item that started the whole affair.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a post now apparently removed from Democratic Underground, but preserved for posterity at Atlas Shrugs (http://atlas shrugs2000.typepad.com) and Ace of Spades (http://ace.mu.nu) the morals of some in the netroots are made explicit. This is from NoodleyAppendage, who had posted more than 1,000 times there and frequently lapses into all-capital letters:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;122. What many here don't understand. It doesn't matter if it's true or not. Rumor is truth. The modern laws of media hype and political warfare have a useful tenet: Repeat anything or raise false concern over anything and it is likely to be planted in the conscious/subconscious of many voters. If people start to think that there might be something fishy with Palin's last kid (if hers), then that's fine. One more doubt (whether tied to reality or not) is another hesitation at the ballot box. Get with the program people. The 'rising above it' [expletive] has served us so well in the past, hasn't it?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Congratulations</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At the American Scene blog (http://theamericanscene.com), contributor Reihan Salam tells liberals what a wonderful job they are doing handling the Sarah Palin pick as, in the title of his post, &quot;Beyond the Palin.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Attention all those who want to defeat McCain-Palin: please ridicule Sarah Palin. Five kids with silly white trash names! She was the mayor of a small town! Ha! I mean, look at her - she must be dumb! And where did she go to school? I mean, come on! I mean, is McCain serious? What a joke. Her mere existence is an insult to women. She eats moose, she rides a snowmobile, and she supports drilling.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Serious people, incidentally, don't support drilling: serious people support clean-coal-powered automobiles built by un-outsourcable American workers, each of which will be available at subsidized prices to all Americans. I mean, everybody knows that. Come on.&quot;</span></p>
