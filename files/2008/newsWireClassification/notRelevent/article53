  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Garry Trudeau is putting his money (and ink) on Barack Obama. Trudeau's &quot;Doonesbury&quot; comic strip for next Wednesday -- already submitted and sent to newspaper editors across the country -- declares the Illinois Democrat the victor of Tuesday's presidential contest.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If I didn't call the election, I'd have no premise for the week and be forced to write about something else. I didn't want to write about something else. This is history,&quot; Trudeau told our colleague Michael Cavna, who writes The Post's Comic Riffs blog. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Trudeau calls his prediction &quot;rational risk assessment.&quot; &quot;Nate Silver at Fivethirtyeight.com is now giving McCain a 3.7 percent chance of winning -- pretty comfortable odds,&quot; he said. &quot;If Obama wins, I'm in the flow and commenting on a phenomenon. If he loses, it'll be a massive upset, and the goofy misprediction of a comic strip will be pretty much lost in the uproar.&quot; (Hmm. Last time we checked, newspaper editors aren't huge fans of &quot;goofy mispredictions.&quot;)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Trudeau's syndicate confirmed as much yesterday. Universal Press Syndicate had already received a dozen calls and e-mails from newspaper editors requesting substitution &quot;Doonesbury&quot; strips, rep Kathie Kerr said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Some of them haven't made a decision about running them, but they do want access to them,&quot; Kerr said. &quot;Still, that's not a huge percentage, considering the size of Garry's client list,&quot; which includes about 1,400 newspapers, this one among them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Washington Post plans to run the strip as scheduled.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">Gun Found in Hudson Family Case </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Forensic testing has confirmed that a gun recovered by Chicago police Wednesday was the weapon used to kill actress and singer Jennifer Hudson's mother, brother and nephew, the Chicago Tribune reported yesterday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Police found the .45-caliber Sig Sauer semiautomatic pistol in the bushes of a vacant lot, one block away from where a white Chevy Suburban containing the body of Hudson's 7-year-old nephew, Julian King, was found Monday. King had been missing since last Friday, when police found Hudson's mother, Darnell Donerson, 57, and brother, Jason Hudson, 29, shot to death on Chicago's South Side.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sources told the Tribune that unfired bullets in the gun matched the make and model of shell casings found at the crime scene. Federal officials had also traced the gun to its original owner in Michigan, who reported it stolen. Now officials are trying to figure out how it got to Chicago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">William Balfour, estranged husband of Jennifer Hudson's sister, Julia, remains in custody after being questioned. He has not been charged in the slayings.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">Armani Gets More Beckham Spice </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Armani just can't get enough Beckham: Hot on the heels of David Beckham's racy Armani underwear ads comes word that wife Victoria Beckham will be the spokeswoman for the fashion house's new lingerie line.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The company said Friday that Beckham will debut in the spring-summer 2009 advertising campaign for Emporio Armani women's underwear.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If the modeling gig isn't praise enough, Armani called the former &quot;Posh Spice&quot; of the Spice Girls a &quot;style icon, a dynamic lady whose influence and recognition will add great excitement&quot; to the ad campaign.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">End Quote </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think she wants to just be not pregnant anymore. . . . It's a struggle to go up and down the stairs. Going out in public is insane.&quot; -- Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz, 29, on his &quot;very pregnant&quot; wife, singer Ashlee Simpson-Wentz, 24. Wentz told DJ Ryan Seacrest on Thursday that Simpson-Wentz is due to give birth any minute.</span></p>
