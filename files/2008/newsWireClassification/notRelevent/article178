  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let me get this straight. A couple of agitated yahoos in a rally of thousands yell something offensive and incendiary, and John McCain and Sarah Palin are not just guilty by association -- with total strangers, mind you -- but worse: guilty according to the New York Times of &quot;race-baiting and xenophobia.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But should you bring up Barack Obama's real associations -- 20 years with Jeremiah Wright, working on two foundations and distributing money with William Ayers, citing the raving Michael Pfleger as one who helps him keep his moral compass (Chicago Sun-Times, April 2004) and the long-standing relationship with the left-wing vote-fraud specialist ACORN -- you have crossed the line into illegitimate guilt by association. Moreover, it is tinged with racism. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The fact that, when John McCain actually heard one of those nasty things said about Obama, he incurred the boos of his own crowd by insisting that Obama is &quot;a decent person . . . that you do not have to be scared [of] as president&quot; makes no difference. It surely did not stop John Lewis from comparing McCain to George Wallace.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The search for McCain's racial offenses is untiring and often unhinged. Remember McCain's Berlin/celebrity ad that showed a shot of Paris Hilton? An appalling attempt to exploit white hostility at the idea of black men &quot;becoming sexually involved with white women,&quot; fulminated New York Times columnist Bob Herbert. He took to TV to denounce McCain's exhumation of that most vile prejudice, pointing out McCain's gratuitous insertion in the ad of &quot;two phallic symbols,&quot; the Washington Monument and the Leaning Tower of Pisa.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Except that Herbert was entirely delusional. There was no Washington Monument. There was no Leaning Tower. Just photographs seen in every newspaper in the world of Barack Obama's Berlin rally in the setting he himself had chosen, Berlin's Victory Column.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Herbert is not the only fevered one. On Tuesday night, Rachel Maddow of MSNBC and Jonathan Alter of Newsweek fell over themselves agreeing that the &quot;political salience&quot; of the Republican attack on ACORN is, yes, its unstated appeal to racial prejudice.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This about an organization that is being accused of voter registration fraud in about a dozen states. In Nevada, the investigating secretary of state is a Democrat. Is he playing the race card, too?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What makes the charges against McCain especially revolting is that he has been scrupulous in eschewing the race card. He has gone far beyond what is right and necessary, refusing even to make an issue of Obama's deep, self-declared connection with the race-baiting Rev. Wright.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the name of racial rectitude, McCain has denied himself the use of that perfectly legitimate issue. It is simply Orwellian for him to be now so widely vilified as a stoker of racism. What makes it doubly Orwellian is that these charges are being made on behalf of the one presidential candidate who has repeatedly, and indeed quite brilliantly, deployed the race card.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">How brilliantly? The reason Bill Clinton is sulking in his tent is because he feels that Obama surrogates succeeded in painting him as a racist. Clinton has many sins, but from his student days to his post-presidency, his commitment and sincerity in advancing the cause of African Americans have been undeniable. If the man Toni Morrison called the first black president can be turned into a closet racist, then anyone can.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And Obama has shown no hesitation in doing so to McCain. Weeks ago, in Springfield, Mo., and elsewhere, he warned darkly that George Bush and John McCain were going to try to frighten you by saying that, among other scary things, Obama has &quot;a funny name&quot; and &quot;doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain has never said that, nor anything like that. When asked at the time to produce one instance of McCain deploying race, the Obama campaign could not. Yet here was Obama firing a preemptive charge of racism against a man who had not indulged in it. An extraordinary rhetorical feat, and a dishonorable one.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What makes this all the more dismaying is that it comes from Barack Obama, who has consistently presented himself as a healer, a man of a new generation above and beyond race, the man who would turn the page on the guilt-tripping grievance politics of Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I once believed him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&Acirc;&middot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Last week I wrote that in 1995 Bill Ayers gave Barack Obama a fundraiser in his home. I should instead have called it a campaign event.</span></p>
