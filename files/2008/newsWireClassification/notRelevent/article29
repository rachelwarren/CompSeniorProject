  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Evon Austin was born only 13 years after American women gained the right to vote. Yet, she has never done so in a presidential election - until now.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At age 75, Austin cast her absentee ballot on Oct. 17, the first time she's voted for the nation's chief executive.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I voted for city government when I lived in Chesapeake,&quot; said the downtown Portsmouth resident. &quot;But I just never did vote for president.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The grandmother of seven and great-grandmother of one said she feels that voting is a privilege. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While Austin's Christian beliefs dictate that &quot;His will will be done, no matter what we want,&quot; she understands that civic responsibility includes voting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I've been very sick the past few years and couldn't get around to it,&quot; said Austin, who is affectionately known as &quot;Big Mama&quot; at Portsmouth's Senior Station, where she spends several days a week socializing with friends.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Everyone knows Big Mama,&quot; said Senior Station recreational aide Shea Coleman. &quot;She's well loved here and looks out for everyone.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Austin grew up in rural Alabama, picking cotton in a town near Montgomery.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She remembers racial strife when Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in 1955 and when National Guard troops were called out to safeguard the integration of the University of Alabama in 1963.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">To Austin, having a black man, albeit of mixed-race, run for president is an event she never thought she'd live to see.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;But I'm a person that holds no animosity,&quot; she said of the racial discrimination she experienced in her early life.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Issues that concern her today include health care and the rising costs of food and prescription medicine .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I've seen our ups and I've seen our downs,&quot; she said. &quot;I believe things can get better.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Virginia Beach teen Kayce Herrod may be a minority in her age group. Going into Tuesday's election, she's still undecided.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At age 18, she is one of the young voters both major candidates have tried to woo the past several months.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Although Herrod is unsure who she will vote for, she's certain she will participate .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's just a huge turning point,&quot; said Herrod, who will attend Old Dominion University in the spring.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The war in Iraq weighs on her mind. Herrod said she wants the troops to come home but is concerned about the consequences. She feels strongly about supporting stem cell research and is pro-choice.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She's also ardent about protecting the environment. &quot;Those issues I can actually do something about,&quot; she said. Rita Frankenberry, 222-5102, rita. frankenberry@pilotonline.com</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pompeyo &quot;Shorty&quot; Castaneda and his wife, Jeanette, are following the debates and studying the candidates. Now these two Isle of Wight residents are about to become first-time voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Shorty&quot; Castaneda, 50 and owner of a roofing business, worked for years to gain his citizenship. He's been living in the United States since 1977.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It took a long time because I had never stepped into a school,&quot; he said. &quot;They gave me a booklet to learn about the history of the U.S. It was intriguing - the more you learn the more you like it.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His favorite U.S. leader? Ronald Reagan, who was president when Castaneda, a native of Matehuala, Mexico, got his first green card.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Jeanette Castaneda, 46, was born in the U.S. but had never registered to vote - until November 2007, one month after her husband applied for citizenship. &quot;His enthusiasm in wanting to vote inspired me,&quot; she said .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shorty Castaneda received his citizenship on Sept. 4 . &quot;I'm hoping the good Lord will give me the sense to vote for the right one,&quot; he said. Phyllis Speidell, 222-5556 phyllis.speidell@pilotonline.com</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Deborah Cole doesn't want to be someone who complains but never votes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I want to do my best to be heard,&quot; said the Chesapeake resident soon to turn 20.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Her main concern in choosing a president is the economy. &quot;If people don't have money to spend, then businesses don't make money, either, and that affects jobs,&quot; said Cole, who works in the service department at Priority Toyota. &quot;I know of people who are taking second jobs to take care of their mortgages and bills.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The war in Iraq is another of Cole's top issues . &quot;I have close friends and family who are in the military. I would be lying if I said I didn't want to see them come home,&quot; she said. &quot; But if we pulled out of Iraq altogether, I'm not sure we wouldn't get attacked again. &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">TV ads have done nothing to help her decide . &quot;Obama says McCain is doing this, while McCain says Obama is doing the same thing,&quot; she said.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Although Deborah Cole was old enough to vote in November 2007 and spring 2008 state and city elections, she didn't register June of this year, in time for this month's presidential election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I wanted to make sure my vote counted for this election,&quot; said Cole, a Chesapeake resident who is almost 20. &quot;When people complain about the president or those running, I always ask if they voted. When they tell me 'no,' that they feel their vote won't make a difference, I ask them: 'So if you didn't vote, then why are you complaining?' I don't want to be one of those people. I want to do my best to be heard.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A 2007 graduate of Oscar Smith High School, Cole works in the service department at Priority Toyota. Her main concern in choosing a president is the economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If people don't have money to spend, then businesses don't make money, either, and that affects jobs,&quot; she said. &quot;I know of people who are taking second jobs to take care of their mortgages and bills.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Another top issue, for her, is the war in Iraq.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I have close friends and family who are in the military. I would be lying if I said I didn't want to see them come home, but if we pulled out of Iraq altogether, I'm not sure we wouldn't get attacked again. But I miss my friends and family and I worry about them.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">TV commercials have done nothing to help her decide how to vote.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Obama says McCain is doing this, while McCain says Obama is doing the same thing,&quot; Cole said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She suggested doing research to find out how Sen. John McCain voted while in office, and what Sen. Barack Obama has done in his career.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Base your vote off that information,&quot; she said. &quot;Not what they say in their commercials.&quot;</span></p>
