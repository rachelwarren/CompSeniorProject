  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sep. 10--Hoping to woo coalfield voters who overwhelmingly spurned him in February's Democratic presidential primary, Sen. Barack Obama told a crowd in Appalachian Virginia yesterday that coal -- crucial to the local economy -- is key to America's future.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We're the Saudi Arabia of coal,&quot; Obama said during a speech on broad economic themes delivered in the Lebanon High School gymnasium. &quot;We can figure out the technology to make it environmentally sound. This is America. We figured out how to put a man on the moon in 10 years.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama campaigned in Southwest Virginia on the first day of a two-day swing that takes him to Norfolk today. Sen. John McCain and his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, also are in Virginia today, campaigning in Fairfax County. The dual appearances underscore how much both campaigns prize Virginia's 13 electoral votes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama has campaigned for development of &quot;clean coal&quot; technologies such as turning coal into gas and storing carbon emissions from power plants before they reach the smokestack. Yesterday, his supporters stressed that Obama's calls for more reliance on renewable energy do not mean an uncertain future for coal.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Senator Obama is a friend of coal,&quot; said Rep. Rick Boucher, D-9th, before a roaring, capacity crowd of about 2,400.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The United Mine Workers of America has endorsed Obama, and union President Cecil Roberts took the stage to urge the crowd to work for an Obama victory. &quot;The Republicans have had their chance and they have blown it,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a conference call yesterday, Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., and Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling warned that Obama would raise taxes on the coal industry and criticized Obama for referring to coal as &quot;dirty energy.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;His economic plan would be a disaster for Southwest Virginia,&quot; Bolling said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In February, a columnist for the San Antonio Express News asked Obama about the possibility of taxing emerging energy sources, such as wind power, to fund education. Obama said: &quot;What we ought to tax is dirty energy, like coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama also used yesterday's visit to Lebanon, in mountainous Russell County, to deride his Republican rival, McCain, for portraying himself as an agent of change.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;You can put lipstick on a pig, it's still a pig,&quot; Obama said, noting that the Arizona senator usually sides with President Bush.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Last night former Mass. Gov. Jane Swift, head of the McCain campaign's new Palin Truth Squad, accused Obama of calling Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin a pig, and demanded an apology. The Obama campaign said &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; is a common expression and that Obama was not talking about McCain's running mate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Whether Obama can stay competitive in the coalfield region is uncertain. While he defeated New York Sen. Hillary Clinton handily in Virginia's Feb. 12 primary, Clinton crushed him in Southwest Virginia, winning more than 80 percent of the vote in six of the seven westernmost counties.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yesterday, Obama asked voters in the mountainous corner to give him a chance, telling them that his energy plan not only serves the nation's interests, but the interests of the coalfield economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Coal plants account for 52 percent of the nation's electricity production, and the federal government estimates there's enough coal in the United States, 273 billion tons, to meet the current power demand for 250 years. On the downside, coal-fired power plants pump significant greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's energy plan calls for:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">--Investing $150 billion over 10 years to spur private development of clean energy sources, a plan Obama says will also create 5 million jobs. Among the types of innovations Obama hopes to foster is the clean coal technology.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">--Putting a million made-in-America, plug-in hybrid cars -- each one capable of getting 150 mpg -- on the road by 2015.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">--Ensuring that 25 percent of the nations electricity comes from renewable sources -- not coal -- by 2025.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">--And cutting greenhouse gas emissions -- another problem associated with coal-fired power plants -- by 80 percent by 2050.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's energy plan calls for:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">--Expanding exploration for domestic oil and using more of the nation's natural gas.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">--Offering a $300 million prize for the commercial development of a battery technology that will prompt the development of plug-in hybrid cars. The plan also calls for a $5,000 tax credit for people who buy cars that emit no carbon -- an incentive for automakers to create such cars.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">--Constructing 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">--And slashing greenhouse emissions to 60 percent below their 1990 levels by 2050.</span></p>
