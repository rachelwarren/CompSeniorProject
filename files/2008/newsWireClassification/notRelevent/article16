  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After being outspent for months, Republicans poured money into advertising in the final two weeks of the election campaign, in hopes of countering the record fundraising by Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Independent groups that supported Sen. John McCain's presidential bid by airing ads or canvassing for votes dramatically increased their spending, surpassing the lead that groups supporting Mr. Obama once held.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Between Oct. 19 and Thursday, independent groups spent $33.4 million on advertisements, mailings or canvassing in support of Mr. McCain or against Mr. Obama, while groups that support Mr. Obama or oppose Mr. McCain spent $8.1 million, according to an analysis of records filed at the Federal Election Commission. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The late surge pushes total spending by outside groups into Mr. McCain's favor. Before Oct. 19, groups supporting Mr. Obama had outspent those backing his opponent by about 25 percent. Combined, theyhave spent $141.2 million this election cycle.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The tally of spending by independent groups includes only those that have to file reports with the FEC and that name a presidential candidate in their ad. It does not include money spent on local races or work on behalf of a party, by groups such as the Republican-leaning Let Freedom Ring or Democratic-leaning Patriot Majority.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">An unofficial tally from the Campaign Finance Institute (CFI) found that federally oriented 527 and 501(c) groups - so named for their section in tax codes - have collected or spent $350 million and are on track to top $400 million. They have spent money on both presidential and local races.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democratic 527 groups have about a 3-1 advantage over Republican 527s, while Republicans favor 501(c) groups, according to CFI.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The spending by Republican groups has helped Mr. McCain's campaign counter a losing battle against Mr. Obama's substantially larger war chest. Over the entire campaign, Mr. Obama had raised more than $600 million as of the end of September, while Mr. McCain had $324 million to spend. The senator from Arizona raised $240 million for the primary outside the system of public financing but, unlike Mr. Obama, took federal money for the general election, which limited him to the $84 million it provides.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That has enabled the Obama campaign to outspend the McCain campaign by 3-to-1 in television advertising alone from Oct. 21 to Oct. 28, according to a study released Friday by the Wisconsin Advertising Project, which tracks political ads.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign spent nearly $21.5 million and Mr. McCain spent $7.5 million during that same period.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The advertising advantage held by the Obama campaign this year puts us in unchartered waters,&quot; said Ken Goldstein, a University of Wisconsin at Madison professor of political science and director of the Wisconsin Advertising Project. &quot;This year, the spending is hugely unequal, and in some cases, the Obama campaign has massive advantages.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In recent days, the Republican groups have dramatically increased their spending.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The upstart National Republican Trust PAC, for instance, late last week bought $1.2 million in ads highlighting Mr. Obama's controversial former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. It has also run ads that say Mr. Obama wants to allow driver's licenses for illegal immigrants, a claim that fact-checking groups have disputed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Republican spending is led by the Republican National Committee, which had planned to spend nearly $25 million in the past two weeks on advertising in battleground states.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The most important days of the campaign is the last five, and the second most important is the next-to-last five,&quot; said Brad Todd, whose firm, On Message Inc., is doing independent expenditures for the RNC.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Though he recognizes that outside Republican funding is not going to match Mr. Obama's fundraising prowess, &quot;It's our hope that the very clear, really true difference will be easy to understand with less resources,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Groups supporting Mr. Obama and Democrats haven't slowed, either.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Patriot Majority, which is funded by unions, spent $3.4 million last week running television ads critical of Republican senators in tough elections.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Service Employees International Union Committee on Political Education, which also supports Mr. Obama and other Democratic candidates, spent more than $1 million last week alone, part of an $85 million campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We're absolutely intensifying our ground campaign,&quot; said Michelle Ringuette, an SEIU spokeswoman.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the last 72 hours of the campaign, she said, the group will have more than 100,000 union members working to get out the vote.</span></p>
