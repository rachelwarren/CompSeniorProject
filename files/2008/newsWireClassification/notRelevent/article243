  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The signs: &quot;Read My Lipstick - Palin Rocks.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The pink buttons: &quot;Hot Chicks Vote Republican.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The wild cheers at the end of her every exhortation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It didn't even matter that she fumbled her lone attempt at pronouncing Lancaster.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clearly, Sarah Palin was the star and provided the buzz when the Republican presidential ticket whipped up a raucous crowd of near-adulators Tuesday at Franklin &amp; Marshall College's Alumni Sports &amp; Fitness Center.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I was a disappointed Republican, but now I'm back,&quot; declared James Saunders, 51, a Manheim Township resident. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin is the greatest thing since sliced bread.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Marci Bressler, 46, a mother of eight from Kirkwood, may have been with McCain from the beginning, but predicts Palin was an addition of historic proportions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton may have started the battle of getting women in the White House but Sarah Palin is going to end it,&quot; she predicted.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;That gives all of us that want to work and have kids a chance to do everything a guy can do, and not be stuck in the kitchen,&quot; Bressler said</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Judging from crowd reaction, Palin's 22-minute speech took on more of a keynote address than a warm-up for her boss.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I'm ready to vote!&quot; an energized Marcia Stabley of York said moments after John McCain had finished his pep talk amid thunderous applause from a wildly supportive, sign-waving crowd in the auditorium.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Several loyal Republicans admitted sheepishly that they wouldn't have come if Palin hadn't also been on the podium.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Temptations song that blared before the speeches with the words, &quot;Look out baby, 'cause here I come,&quot; fits both candidates, but Palin was garnering the elephant's share of attention.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I'm in love with Sarah Palin!&quot; said Sheila Myers, 66, of York. &quot;I like her openness. She's very genuine. She's likable. I like everything about her.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;She brings a breath of fresh air, for sure. His campaign has taken off like a rocket. I think he realizes he struck gold.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Many said they liked Palin's &quot;outsider&quot; status.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;She's not typical Washington,&quot; said Karen Aydt, 49, of Gladwyne. &quot;That's what I'm sort of sick of. She actually may get in Washington and we actually may have a chance of cleaning things up.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Octogenarian Arlene Holbein of Millersville says she groaned &quot;Oh no!&quot; out loud when she first heard that McCain had tapped the unknown governor from Alaska as a VP.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She now sings a different tune.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;She's terrific. I just like the way she carries herself. (McCain) needed a boost. She's just a positive person.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The crowd lit up when Palin spoke, punctuating her speech with chants of &quot;Sarah! Sarah! Sarah!&quot; and &quot;USA! USA! USA!&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">People held aloft a sea of campaign signs such as &quot;Country First&quot; that were handed out at the rally. Plenty brought their own, hoisting slogans including &quot;Preschoolers for Palin,&quot; &quot;Energy Independence&quot; and &quot;If We Were 18, We'd Vote McCain-Palin.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">People said McCain's campaign got a burst of energy with Palin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Neal Lesher, 23, of Palmyra, one of many in the crowd from beyond Lancaster County, said, &quot;I'm super-excited about John McCain. I think he has the vision and leadership necessary to lead this country for the next four years.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin, he said, &quot;is exactly what this country needed to get excited.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Jack Boyd, of Devon, said he thought it took &quot;tremendous courage&quot; for McCain to pick a relatively unknown woman from Alaska as his running mate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It was a brilliant move,&quot; he said. &quot;She's a sleeper. ... She will be responsible for a lot of infusion of fringe voters and cross-party voters.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Others praised McCain's character, and said Palin meshes well with that.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;He's a real person,&quot; said E.J. Richter, 42, of Wayne. &quot;You can tell when you see a person and when they are trying to sell you something. ... I think she doubly emphasizes that point. I relate to Sarah. She's got integrity.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There were many veterans in the crowd and they received a long, loud ovation when McCain asked them to raise their hands.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">One of them, John Frederick, 67, of Manheim, who lost a best friend in Korea, said the main reason he came was to hear Palin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He predicted that if the McCain-Palin ticket wins in November, Sarah Palin will be elected president in 2012.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At 33, Rebecca Weiler will be voting in her first presidential election, a voting record she is not proud of.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I just feel I need to set a better example for my son and be an American citizen,&quot; she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Her choice: McCain. &quot;He served our country and to me that says a lot.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Several McCain-Palin supporters said the two candidates' anti-abortion stands was the crux of their support.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A handful of protesters showed up outside the rally, quietly holding signs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Charles Lane, a 74-year-old Lancaster Township resident, leaned stoically on an umbrella, holding a sign that said, &quot;McCain Is Bush Warmed Over.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He braved without reply occasional taunts.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I see a pure white crowd here,&quot; he observed. &quot;It's a little sad in a way.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Josh Redd, of Students for a Democratic Society in Millersville, had water thrown at him by someone who yelled, &quot;Get a job!&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Numerous people brought their children to the rally, holding them on their shoulders and handing them signs to wave.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some came not to cheer but to listen.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Angela Richards, 57, of Lancaster, has not made up her mind about the presidential race. A registered Independent, she also attended Barack Obama's rally Thursday in Lancaster.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She had hoped to hear more specifics about where McCain and Palin stand on issues such as the economy and health care, she said Tuesday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I'm still on the fence,&quot; she said, &quot;I want to hear less rah-rah and more issues.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">About 10 Lancaster County Amish men and women were at the rally.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">One of them, who estimated about 15 percent of the local Amish adults will vote this November, said Amish tend to vote Republican because of the party's pro-life platform.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Of McCain, one Amish man said, &quot;Our people look at someone with gray hair and think it's someone who is wise.&quot;</span></p>
