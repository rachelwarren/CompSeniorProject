  <p class="c5"><span class="c7"> THE AYERS CONTROVERSY </span><br /><br /><span class="c7">Obama Responds With New Ads </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Barack Obama is pushing back anew against the &quot;palling around with terrorists&quot; charge -- running two television advertisements and a radio spot in states where the Republican Party has ads noting his association with 1960s radical Bill Ayers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama ads directly take on charges that he launched his political career in Ayers's living room, among others. One of Obama's TV ads shows an exterior shot of a Ramada Inn, and a narrator, with a weary-sounding tsk-tsk, says Obama started his &quot;first campaign here, not in anyone's living room.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The controversy over Ayers appears to have had little negative impact on Obama. In a just-released New York Times-CBS News poll, nearly two-thirds of respondents said they had already heard &quot;a lot&quot; or &quot;some&quot; about Obama's association with Ayers. Nine percent volunteered that they were bothered by that connection. A majority, 56 percent, said there was nothing about Obama's background or past associations that concerned them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The poll showed Obama up 14 points over John McCain overall.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The subject of Ayers is expected to arise in tonight's debate. McCain, in fact, said Obama had &quot;probably ensured&quot; that it will come up after Obama accused him of being too afraid to say it to his face in their two earlier encounters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's not that I give a damn about some old washed-up terrorist and his terrorist wife,&quot; McCain told a radio interviewer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;What I care about, and what the American people care about, is whether [Obama] is being truthful with the American people, whether it be on raising taxes or whether it be his commitment to take public financing or whether it be his association with Ayers, who he said was a guy in the neighborhood when the fact is he launched his political career in Bill Ayers's living room,&quot; McCain said.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">TOLEDO -- Barack Obama distanced himself from the voter registration group ACORN on Tuesday while also playing down the allegations of fraud that have embroiled the organization.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ACORN offices are under scrutiny in numerous states for allegedly having registered thousands of people under fake names.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Taking a break from debate preparations, Obama told reporters during a brief news conference this afternoon, that his &quot;relationship to ACORN is pretty straightforward. It's probably 13 years ago when I was still practicing law, I represented ACORN, and my partner in that representation was the U.S. Justice Department in having Illinois implement what was called the 'motor voter' law, to make sure that people could go to DMVs and driver's license facilities to get registered. It wasn't being implemented. That was my relationship and is my relationship to ACORN.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He said he had further interactions with the group through its Chicago office, in his capacity as a local elected official. Obama added, &quot;We've got the best voter registration and turnout and volunteer operation in politics right now, and we don't need ACORN's help.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The AFL-CIO announced a new wave of mail Tuesday that is part of a $53.4 million voter-mobilization effort aimed at gun owners, veterans and retirees in key states.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The mail pieces will be followed by phone calls and door visits by union volunteers to this group to reinforce the central message: 'I want to protect two things: my job and my gun. That's why I'm supporting Barack Obama,' &quot; Steve Smith of the AFL-CIO said in a statement.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Service Employees International Union also reported this week $356,000 in phone banking and mailers, along with a hefty run of TV ads focused on health-care issues and paid for by the union's political action committee. Environmental groups also sponsored mailers attacking John McCain; the League of Conservation Voters reported spending $280,000 for a &quot;media buy&quot; opposing McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The National Rifle Association reported small expenditures for literature opposing Obama. And a group called the National Republican Trust PAC reported spending $75,000 in the past 24 hours on e-mails and online banner ads opposing Obama.</span></p>
