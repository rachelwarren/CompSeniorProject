  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain's campaign has credited enthusiasm about his selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as a running mate for its August fundraising total of more than $47 million -- a record for the senator from Arizona.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Republican presidential candidate has raised $10 million since choosing Palin, according to campaign spokesman Brian Rogers. Palin may have succeeded in reaching a large number of conservative donors who had been sitting out the 2008 campaign because they considered the candidate too soft on core issues, but that won't become clear until McCain releases his finance reports for August to the Federal Election Commission later this month.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The fundraising haul is more than double what McCain had raised over the summer and puts him, for the first time, in the same league as Barack Obama. The Democratic nominee has collected more than $50 million in each of the past two months. An Obama spokesman said Monday that the campaign was not ready to release its August totals. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain is likely to finish this week with a considerable amount of money still in his primary campaign accounts. Because he will be accepting federal funds for the general election, he won't be able to spend primary funds once he formally accepts his party's nomination. But he is permitted under the law to transfer the remaining money to Republican Party accounts in key battleground states on a flexible timetable, his advisers said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That means he can, for instance, send that money to state party officials in October, once he knows which states will be most critical to his electoral success. Obama will not have to worry about those bookkeeping measures. He has decided not to take federal matching money, and so he can continue to spend any money he raised during the primary as the campaign pushes ahead.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ST. PAUL, Minn. -- At least 50 people were arrested at protests outside the Republican National Convention on Monday, police said. Police estimated that between 5,000 and 8,000 people joined a rally to the Xcel Energy Center, where the convention is being held. Police said the main antiwar demonstration was largely peaceful but a separate group of self-described anarchists smashed windows and set a trash bin on fire.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;There was a splinter group that came here to cause trouble,&quot; said Tom Walsh, a spokesman for the St. Paul police.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The crowds gathered at the Capitol grounds in the morning, as speakers and dancers performed. As the protesters made their way toward the conference center, they waved homemade signs that said such things as &quot;Bush/McCain = McSame&quot; and &quot;GOP -- Government, Oh Please.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A group of Iraq veterans pushed a coffin, covered in an American flag and Army fatigues, in memory of Lance Cpl. Alexander Arredondo, who was killed in Iraq in 2004. The father of Army Spec. Juan M. Torres carried a photograph of his son, who died in Afghanistan. Jose Rodriguez, a Vietnam War veteran from Houston, said he considered voting for John McCain but could not after eight years of the Bush administration.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Iraq is an unjustified war. Kids are dying for nothing,&quot; he said. &quot;We've got too many old people running things already.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Many families said they were enjoying the carnival atmosphere. Suzannah Ciernia said she had come from Northfield, Minn., with her friend Cindy Robinson and was having fun: &quot;We're a couple of moms for peace. My husband is over with the war veterans, and my son is over with the students group.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mike and Sue Starr traveled from Anoka, Minn., to protest against Vice President Cheney's role in the war. &quot;He is a five-time deferment and he is sending our son to war. Our son leaves in two weeks for 11 or 12 months,&quot; Mike Starr said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The war in Iraq was not the only issue being highlighted. Activists championed same-sex marriage, legalization of marijuana, an end to homelessness and better access to health care.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Maria Morales of Racine, Wis., was coordinating Voces de la Frontera, a group that supports illegal immigrants. &quot;It's exciting -- I hope something comes out of this,&quot; she said. &quot;We need legalization of the 12 million.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Many waved &quot;Obama '08&quot; signs, and &quot;I Back Barack&quot; T-shirts were on sale for $10 each.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There was a strong police presence along the march, with many officers in full riot gear. Some demonstrators complained of strong-arm police tactics throughout the holiday weekend. Doante Davis, 31, traveled up with a group from Louisville and was staying at &quot;Bushville,&quot; a camp set up outside the Asia Supermarket on Western Avenue. He said that police had tried to intimidate the protesters overnight.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The police had nothing better to do,&quot; Davis said. &quot;They made their dogs bark at us and flashed lights in our faces last night.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Democracy Now&quot; radio host Amy Goodman and two producers were arrested while covering the demonstrations. Goodman was released after being held for over three hours, but last night she was waiting to hear whether Sharif Abdel Kouddous and Nicole Salazar would be released.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I was down on the convention floor interviewing delegates when I heard that two of our producers had been arrested,&quot; said Goodman. &quot;I ran down to Jackson and Seventh Street, where the police had moved in.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Nicole told me that as they moved in on three sides, she asked them 'How do I get away from this?' and they jumped on her.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Goodman said that when she ran up to find out what was going on, she was also arrested: &quot;They seriously manhandled me and handcuffed my hands behind my back. The top ID [at the convention] is to get on the floor, and the Secret Service ripped that off me. I had my 'Democracy Now' ID, too. I was clearly a reporter.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">SCRANTON, Pa. -- Describing his role in the Obama campaign, Joe Biden said on CBS's &quot;60 Minutes&quot; Sunday night: &quot;The thing I can do is, hopefully, go into Scranton and Wilmington and Sacramento and other places and say, 'I know the guy.' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The senator from Delaware didn't wait long to make good on that promise and laud his running mate in his home town. Biden, who lived in Scranton until his family moved to Wilmington when he was 10, launched his first solo campaign swing by returning to his boyhood home.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;A lot of people say to me, 'What's Barack like -- what's he like, what's the deal, Joe?' &quot; Biden said. &quot;I promise you, my word as a Biden: If Barack grew up in our neighborhood like he did Kansas . . . he would have been our friend.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Biden apparently forgetting that his running mate grew up in Hawaii, continued: &quot;He would cover your back, he would be the guy who meets the standard . . . That's Barack Obama. I promise you, his value set is the same.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama campaign hopes Biden can help win over the older, non-college-educated white voters in places such as Scranton who overwhelmingly favored Hillary Clinton over Obama in the race for the Democratic nomination. During the long run-up to the Pennsylvania primary, Clinton constantly touted her Scranton roots, noting that her father grew up in the city and that her family often vacationed here when she was a child. Biden echoed similar themes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In an ad that Obama's campaign released on the eve of his visit, his running mate says: &quot;Scranton is a place that never leaves you. It becomes part of your heart.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Upon arriving at 2446 N. Washington Ave., where his family lived during tough financial times in his childhood, Biden yelled &quot;This is my mom!&quot; and hugged 91-year-old Jean Finnegan Biden. Biden's mother lives with him in Wilmington but came to Scranton for the event.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I am home now,&quot; Biden declared to a crowd of people standing in the street waving at him in this middle-class neighborhood, accompanied by his brother Jim, campaign aides, Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr., who also grew up in this neighborhood.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He then walked into the house, now inhabited by Anne Kearns, who has lived there since 1962. Kearns told the group that when she moved into the house, her family found the words &quot;Joe Biden was here&quot; written on the wall of the third-floor bedroom that had been occupied by Biden's great-aunt.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She told the senator she had painted over his message but would be honored if he'd go up and sign his name again. An aide handed him a marker. With it, he wrote: &quot;I am home. Joe Biden. 9.1.08.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If my father were here, he'd smack me,&quot; the candidate said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We won't paint over it this time,&quot; Kearns said.</span></p>
