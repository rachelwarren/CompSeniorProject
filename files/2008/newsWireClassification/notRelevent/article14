  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Every two years, The Fix picks some of the best (and worst) television ads from the election season. (For the full results, you'll need to check The Fix -- http://www.washingtonpost.com/thefix -- later this week, but a little sneak peek couldn't hurt anyone, right?)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here are a few of our favorites from the presidential candidates: </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&Acirc;&middot; Barack Obama, &quot;Our Moment is Now.&quot; Borrowing footage from Obama's speech at the Iowa Jefferson-Jackson Dinner late last year the ad effectively captured the idea of the senator's campaign as a movement. &quot;America, our moment is now,&quot; Obama says in the ad as music rises and the crowd cheers. Powerful stuff.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&Acirc;&middot; Hillary Rodham Clinton, &quot;3 a.m.&quot; By far the most talked-about ad in the Democratic primary race, the ringing-phone commercial focused on the issue of crisis management and framed the choice between the experienced and steady hand of Clinton and the untested Obama. Unfortunately for Clinton, the ad was too little, too late.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&Acirc;&middot; John McCain, &quot;Celebrity.&quot; It's hard to argue that the daring ad, which sought to draw comparisons between Obama and celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, didn't work. Using images of the massive crowd Obama drew in Berlin during his midsummer European tour, McCain's campaign turned what could have been a strength for their Democratic opponent into a weakness. A brilliant piece of political jujitsu.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&Acirc;&middot; Bill Richardson, &quot;Job Interview.&quot; Give the New Mexico governor this: He's not afraid to take chances. Surrounded by better-known candidates in the Democratic primary campaign, Richardson played the role of a job interviewee; the series of ads made the point, in a humorous way, that he has a lengthy r&Atilde;&copy;sum&Atilde;&copy; and record of accomplishments. A good twist on the traditional biographical ad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&Acirc;&middot; Mike Huckabee, &quot;Chuck Norris Approved.&quot; The breakout star of the Republican primaries (He runs marathons! He plays the bass guitar!) topped himself with this spot featuring the action star. Best line? &quot;Chuck Norris doesn't endorse; he tells America how it's gonna be.&quot;<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">Murtha, Blindsided and Scrambling </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Is Jack Murtha in trouble? He is sure acting like it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The veteran House Democrat got into hot water last month when he suggested that Barack Obama may underperform in his western Pennsylvania district because it's a &quot;racist area.&quot; Now he's pushing the political equivalent of the panic button, by calling in the Clintons to campaign for him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bill Clinton and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton recorded last-minute robocalls for Murtha. And the former president will headline a rally today in Murtha's home town of Johnstown, before heading to Wilkes-Barre to help out another embattled senior Democrat, Rep. Paul Kanjorski.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hillary Clinton was among the first to answer the SOS sent out by Murtha, cutting a $5,000 check from her HillPAC to the incumbent's campaign. All told, Murtha raised $917,000 in a 12-day period ending Saturday, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. The overwhelming majority of contributions came from the political action committees of fellow Democrats, but a few cut checks from their personal bank accounts, such as the $2,300 from Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.). Elsie Pascrell, wife of Rep. William Pascrell (D-N.J.), gave Murtha $1,000 from her personal funds.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Murtha, 76, is a decorated Vietnam War veteran who chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee on defense. One of his party's most prominent voices on military issues, he became an unlikely liberal darling when he turned against the Iraq war.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the 17-term lawmaker is also a typical previously &quot;safe&quot; incumbent, utterly unprepared for the backlash over his &quot;racist&quot; remark. It earned him a parody on &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; and Republicans promoted it as a Democratic version of conservative Rep. Michele Bachmann's infamous anti-Obama rant on MSNBC.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A late-October survey by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review showed Murtha barely leading his aggressive and well-funded Republican opponent, Bill Russell.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I was blindsided this time. It was my own fault. I take full responsibility, and I'm worried that I waited too long to get people activated,&quot; Murtha, 76, told volunteers at his campaign headquarters last week, according to the Associated Press.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">A Chance for Extra Innings </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For those of you already suffering withdrawal symptoms with Election Day just around the corner, never fear. Your fix -- pun intended -- may come from Georgia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) is locked in a tight battle with former state representative Jim Martin (D), a race that many insiders suspect could determine whether Democrats reach their goal of a filibuster-proof majority of 60 seats. The Peach State requires a true majority of at least 50.1 percent of the vote to win, and Libertarian Allen Buckley has been taking 2 to 7 percent of the vote in public polling over the past week. Chambliss has been ahead in almost every poll, but is mired in the mid- to upper 40s.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With former congressman Bob Barr (Ga.) on the Georgia ballot as the Libertarian nominee for president, some Republicans fear that Buckley could prevent Chambliss from getting to the magic number.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A runoff between the two top vote-getters would be held Dec. 2, setting up a month-long battle that would draw waves of tested (and worn-out) campaign operatives and millions of dollars in contributions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Boy, oh, boy,&quot; Charles Schumer (N.Y.), chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said at the thought to reporters last week. Asked how much money he thought would flood Georgia under such a scenario, Schumer said simply, &quot;A lot.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republicans privately suggest Chambliss would have the upper hand in a special because the expected large African American turnout for the historical significance of Obama's campaign would be hard to replicate a month later, in a race without Obama at the top of the ticket.</span></p>
