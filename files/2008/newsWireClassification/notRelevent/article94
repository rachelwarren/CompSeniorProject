  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Trump card</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Smart Republicans like Jim DeMint of South Carolina and Jeb Hensarling of Texas are starting to recognize their party holds the ultimate trump card in the current energy debate,&quot; Wall Street Journal editorialist Stephen Moore writes at www.opinionjournal.com.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;In 41 days, the long-imposed moratorium on offshore oil drilling and domestic oil shale production is set to expire - gone. This happens automatically and can be stopped only if Congress votes to re-establish the ban. Lifting the moratorium might free up as much as 100 years' worth of oil and gas for domestic consumption,&quot; Mr. Moore said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;But keeping domestic energy supplies off limits is something Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and their environmentalist allies desperately want to do. Ms. Pelosi has said that stopping new oil production is about 'saving the planet.' Nevertheless, Mr. DeMint tells me it would be a 'tough vote for congressional Democrats to make just weeks before an election.'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;No kidding, with gas prices at near $4 a gallon and polls showing voters supporting an America-first drilling strategy by a two-to-one margin,&quot; Mr. Moore said, noting that Mr. DeMint says he already has 38 senators poised to filibuster any attempt to extend the drilling moratorium, and Democrats &quot;would need 60 votes to get a budget passed with the drilling moratorium rider attached.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Can Republicans keep it together? A House Democratic leadership aide says Democrats will accuse Republicans of shutting down the government and preventing seniors from collecting Social Security checks. But Democrats run Congress now, so 'it will be difficult for Pelosi and her gang to blame the minority Republicans for a congressional train wreck,' answers Mr. DeMint.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Back to back</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;For the first time in memory, the two parties are holding their conventions right after one another,&quot; Dick Morris writes in the Hill newspaper.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Within 72 hours of Obama's acceptance speech on the night of Aug. 28, in front of 75,000 adoring fans outdoors in Invesco Field at Mile High, the Republican Convention's opening gavel will come crashing down. How will it work? What will be the impact of these nearly simultaneous events? Nobody really knows, but the answer is critical. Usually, the post-convention polling sets a pattern that lasts at least until the candidates debate,&quot; Mr. Morris said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Will Obama's magic and aura last for the ensuing week, casting a fog over the Republican Convention, obscuring its proceedings and dulling its impact? Or will the winds of criticism against Obama, for four nights in a row in [St. Paul, Minn.], dissipate the vapors and nullify his bounce?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;At the moment, the scheduling of the conventions appears to make a prolonged deadlock between the two campaigns the most likely result.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Exceptional race</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Primary elections among challengers for a House seat held by the other party aren't normally of great political interest. But the race for the Republican nomination in a New Hampshire district is an exception,&quot; Fred Barnes writes at www.weeklystandard.com.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The reason: Jennifer Horn, a conservative talk radio host, is running. She's the first member of the talk radio tribe, so far as I know, to give up her radio perch to run for Congress,&quot; Mr. Barnes said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Horn, the mother of five, has proven to be an impressive campaigner in her first bid for public office and no slouch at the rough-and-tumble of electoral politics. When one of her four Republican opponents, Grant Bosse, accused her of misusing campaign funds, she fired back with a press release headlined, 'Grant 'Make Up the Facts' Bosse Strikes Again.' She denied the charge.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Horn's breakthrough in the race came last week when she won the endorsement of the state's most influential newspaper, the Manchester Union-Leader, after being grilled by publisher Joe McQuaid and editorial page editor Drew Cline. 'She is smart, likable, energetic and solid on the issues,' the paper wrote. 'She stands the best chance of beating [Democrat] Paul Hodes this November, and if elected, she would vote the way a New Hampshire representative ought to - for smaller, more responsible government, a strong national defense and low taxes.'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Hodes defeated Charles Bass, a 12-year Republican incumbent, in the Democratic landslide in 2006 in New Hampshire, once considered a reliably Republican state.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Giddy media</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The headline conveyed urgency: 'Obama Ready to Announce Running Mate' said a breathless New York Times. In language worthy of a Madison Avenue pitchman, the paper reported Obama had 'all but settled' on his choice and would launch 'an elaborate rollout plan' of events,&quot; New York Daily News columnist Michael Goodwin writes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Holy hype, Batman. Another day, another inflated report on the routine doings of The One.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;John McCain's mocking nickname for Obama came in an ad comparing Obama's grandiose promises to Moses parting the Red Sea. It was funny, but I'm starting to think it wasn't a joke. The Obama campaign and its media handmaidens are taking their candidate way too seriously.&quot; Mr. Goodwin said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;So much so that they could be setting up a backlash against the hype. No human being can meet the wildly inflated expectations that accompany the rookie senator's every move. It can't help that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Obama 'a leader that God has blessed us with at this time.'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;That's the kind of remark that can turn voters into problems. Most Americans famously resent being told an election is over months before the polls open or that God is taking sides.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Forget Clinton</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;As Sen. Barack Obama gets set to announce his running mate, there is growing evidence that his backers and the public in general do not favor an Obama-Clinton ticket,&quot; Paul Bedard writes in the Washington Whispers column of U.S. News &amp; World Report.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;In our exclusive Washington Whispers poll, Obama's success in ending the Clinton era was cited by nearly 1 in 3 as his best aspect, right behind his liberal-progressive positions,&quot; Mr. Bedard said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Synovate eNation Internet poll of 1,000 nationally representative households asked: What aspect of Sen. Barack Obama do you like most? &quot;Liberal-progressive positions&quot; came in at 34 percent, followed by &quot;Ended the Clinton era&quot; at 30 percent, &quot;Youthfulness&quot; at 25 percent, and &quot;Mixed-race background&quot; at 11 percent.</span></p>
