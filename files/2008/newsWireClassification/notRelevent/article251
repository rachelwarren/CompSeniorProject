  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arizona Sen. John McCain and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin criticized Illinois Sen. Barack Obama over the amount of money he has requested for his home state, even though Alaska under Ms. Palin's leadership has asked Washington for 10 times more money per citizen for pet projects.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At a rally in swing state Missouri, the Republican presidential nominee and his running mate accused Mr. Obama, Mr. McCain's Democratic rival, of requesting nearly $1 billion in earmarks for his state during his time as a senator. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The new line of attack came after Mr. Obama over the weekend made his first direct criticism of Mr. McCain's vice-presidential choice, citing the topic of Ms. Palin's earmarks, which are special projects that lawmakers try to get for their districts and constituents.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Just the other day our opponent brought up earmarks -- and, frankly, I was surprised that he would even raise the subject at all,&quot; Ms. Palin said. &quot;I thought he wouldn't want to go there.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama hasn't asked for any earmarks this year. Last year, he asked for $311 million worth, or about $25 for every Illinois resident. Alaska asked this year for earmarks totaling $198 million, or about $295 for every Alaska citizen.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ms. Palin has cut back on pork project requests, but under her administration, Alaska is still the largest per-capita consumer of federal pet-project spending by far.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The governor did reject plans to build the notorious &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot; after Congress had cut off its financing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin were presented as a maverick team in an ad their campaign released yesterday that played up their reputation for taking on entrenched interests. The ad credits Ms. Palin with stopping the bridge, without mentioning that she once appeared to support it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">President Bush, who came to Washington as a former Texas governor without national legislative experience, called the Alaska governor &quot;an inspired pick&quot; by Mr. McCain. &quot;She's had executive experience, and that's what it takes to be a capable person here in Washington, D.C., in the executive branch,&quot; he said in a Fox News interview to be shown today.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Rome, Vice President Dick Cheney also sought to deflect Democratic criticism that Ms. Palin, a former small-town mayor with less than two years in the governor's office, lacks the gravity to be vice president. &quot;Each administration is different,&quot; he said. &quot;And there's no reason why Sarah Palin can't be a successful vice president in a McCain administration.&quot; He said her convention speech was superb.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In attacking Mr. Obama yesterday, Mr. McCain said the Illinois senator's earmark total over the years amounts to &quot;almost a million dollars for every single day he was in the United States Senate.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For his part, Mr. McCain doesn't seek pork projects and vows to do away with them as president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While speaking to voters in Indiana over the weekend, Mr. Obama ridiculed the idea of Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin presenting themselves as reformers, and suggested that Ms. Palin was distorting her own record on earmarks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I know the governor of Alaska has been saying she's change, and that's great,&quot; Mr. Obama said Saturday. &quot;She's a skillful politician. But, you know, when you've been taking all these earmarks when it's convenient, and then suddenly you're the champion anti-earmark person, that's not change. Come on! I mean, words mean something; you can't just make stuff up.&quot;</span></p>
