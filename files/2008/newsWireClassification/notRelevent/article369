  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Political philosophy 101</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Columnist Leonard Pitts' piece on Gov. Romney's 'hypocrisy' (&quot;Romney-speak gets a workout,&quot; op-ed, Sept. 6) is an example of why the left and the right cannot communicate. He makes the same mistake that most people make, identifying a political philosophy by the individuals, or by the issue, rather than a defining principle.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both liberal and conservative philosophies have a unique principle that is always present, and operate in the same manner, and serve the same purpose, as principles found in math or science. That principle is the placement of responsibility. Conservatism puts responsibility on the individual, liberalism on the group. Another factor that must be understood is the three political and social philosophies of the left -- progressive, liberal and socialist -- are identical because each is a group responsibility. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In most cases, a liberal will take offense at being called a socialist, even though the underlying principle is identical. Conservatives are not immune to ignoring conflicting principle in their claim to be a &quot;conservative.&quot; An example is John McCain's promise to have a program that would make up the temporary difference in lost wages for employees who lost their jobs under certain conditions and had to take a lower-paying position; it is a 100 percent socialist approach.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The bottom line? Take the personality out, and simply identify where the candidate places responsibility. That, and that alone, will tell you if he or she is taking a conservative or socialist approach.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wrong kind of change</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As I ponder The Pilot's letters daily, I am flabbergasted by the Americans who claim that they desire change but want Barack Obama for our next president. He stands for redistribution of wealth, continued high gas prices and the same old song and dance most candidates proclaim.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Pilot's letter writers continue to bash Sarah Palin. From what I can see and read, Palin is an average American who absolutely wants change, and she has a record of doing it in Alaska. Her support for the commercial fishermen of Alaska gives me pride as someone who works for the little guy without celebrity backing. While many Republican and Democratic candidates talk out both sides of their mouths, the regular people need at least one mom in Washington working for real change in the way the government spends money on frivolous projects.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The tax cut test</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amidst all the political outrage over lipstick -- and which animal it is politically correct to put it on -- we seem to have forgotten something important. We have forgotten that one of the most blatant misrepresentations put forth during this presidential campaign is that, as president, Barack Obama will raise our taxes. This is completely false.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In reality, four out of five American households will see reduced taxes under the Obama tax plan. The non-partisan Tax Policy Center reports that anyone earning under $120,000 (the vast majority of Americans) will see substantially lower taxes under his proposal, compared with that of John McCain. And even people with incomes up to $600,000 will see their tax burden essentially stay the same under the Obama plan.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If everyone votes purely based on his or her pocketbook, Barack Obama should receive 80 percent of the vote.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Reforming the reformer</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain and Sarah Palin are running ads touting their maverick credentials. They claim to have taken on Republicans time and time again to push through change. Now, I personally believe that McCain's record these past eight years reveals that he hasn't so much reformed the Republican Party as the Republican Party has reformed him. And I wonder why someone who was for the Bridge to Nowhere before she was against it (but still kept the money) should even raise the issue. But there is one point in the ads on which I agree, and for that I commend the McCain-Palin ticket: They both realize that Republicans are the problem.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A Hoover for president</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There has never been a person nominated for president by a major party with less experience than Barack Obama. During World War II and the Korean War, the question was, &quot;Would you want him in a foxhole with you?&quot; Now the question is, &quot;Do you want him in a Hummer with you?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama does talk smooth and slick, but I had a vacuum cleaner salesman come to my house selling vacuums. He was a good talker, too, but I would not want him for a president, either.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Better than Batgirl</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For summertime theater, it doesn't get any better than this. In Sarah Palin, a star is born, and she's even better than Batgirl. In the nick of time, she swoops from the wings to rescue a stage filled with stuffed shirts and pantsuits. The neo-conservative audience goes wild with applause for the former Miss Alaska beauty queen who, in her own words, &quot;isn't going to Washington to win anyone's good opinion.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I can't wait for the rest of the script to unfold. She talks of big guns and pit bulls. She's ready for war both at home and abroad, shouting to an audience of righteous warriors. She'll &quot;declare war&quot; on Big Oil by handing ANWR over to the Halliburton cast. Moose rifle in hand, she'll shoot down our $9.6 trillion debt by shuttering liberal libraries and Planned Parenthood clinics. She'll elevate our foreign entanglements to a Holy Crusade.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As I watch McCain trying to keep pace with his leading lady, I'm reminded of an immortal line from his own war era: &quot;Sometimes we have to destroy a village in order to save a village.&quot; I sure hope this play doesn't have too many intermissions. I can't wait to see how it ends in November.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Maybe this will be the grande finale after all, and the neocons have had it right for the last seven years. Maybe we just need to destroy our country in order to save it.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chelsea vs. Bristol</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So, Cal Thomas thinks liberals are being hypocrites for talking about Bristol Palin? Does anyone think Fox News would have shied away from the story had it been Chelsea Clinton? If Chelsea got pregnant at 17, Bill O'Reilly would have led every newscast with how the Clintons were failures as parents, and ask how they could presume to govern the country when they couldn't even govern their daughter. When a party forces &quot;family values&quot; down our throats and continually doesn't live by them, they should be exposed.</span></p>
