  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">PUPPY MILLS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Owners of dogs know what most dogs give them: unconditional love and trust (almost a mirror image of God's love for us).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Zimmerman brothers in neighboring Berks County betrayed that love and trust by shooting 80 helpless dogs. It is bad enough they operated a puppy mill, but to take advantage of an obscure, outdated law that allows owners to destroy their animals is worse. They killed man's best friends in cold blood.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some puppy mill owners claim they are trying to save the family farm or make some other excuse for their actions. They can save the family farm, but they do not need to be cruel, abusive or neglectful.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The lives of innocent, trusting animals should not be forgotten. Call or write your state senator or House representative immediately. The archaic law allowing owners to destroy their own dogs and cats needs to be abolished. The laws presently are not tough enough to properly punish savages like the Zimmermans. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gary Hornock, Elizabethtown</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As a lifelong resident of Lancaster County, I have always been proud of my heritage - until now. I am ashamed to live in a state and county known as &quot;The Puppy Mill Capital of the East.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The recent slaughter of 80 dogs in Berks County is just one example of the horror experienced by innocent dogs in puppy mills. Mass breeding, cruelty and neglect are common in puppy mills, and hundreds of such kennels are in Lancaster County. These abuses will continue until the health and welfare of dogs are seen as more important than profits. Every person who allows these atrocities to continue devalues what it means to be a compassionate, caring human being.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You can help by contacting your legislators (www.legis.state.pa.us) and urging them to pass House Bill 2525, which would make it illegal for anyone but a veterinarian to euthanize dogs in commercial breeding kennels and improve the conditions for thousands of dogs suffering behind the closed doors of Pennsylvania's infamous puppy mills.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sylvia Evans, Lancaster</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I sympathize with those standing vigil for the slaughtered kennel dogs. I extend this compassion to all creatures that collectively inhabit and support life on earth.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The &quot;green&quot; movement may promise better things, but people and animals have long suffered the effects of our exorbitant lifestyle. Many lives have been lost so that we could be the powerful consumers we are.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let us remember the atrocities committed to protect our national interest - in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, in Cambodia, Chile, El Salvador and Guatemala. Yet we continue to tolerate half-thought-out, illegal regime changes (Iraq) and support for sleazy governments in which our political and business leaders have friends (Saudi Arabia).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Other developed nations can learn from our dead dogs, too. In one town in Chile, a huge trading partner of the U.S. whose grapes flood our supermarkets, stray dogs are rounded up once a year and disposed of quietly. Witnessing this, I thought, should we invade?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert McLane IV, Millersville</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For Pennsylvania to put up with the horror of puppy mills for so many years is a sad statement about our state government, lawmakers, and those who elected them. Is this how we teach our youth the value of life ?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This case is so disturbing I have lost sleep, wondering how exactly do you shoot 80 dogs? How many shots did it take to kill each of them ? I am sure the breeders' association is going to have to put some serious spin on this story. I hope their lobbyist is up to the task.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What now for the Zimmermans?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Perhaps a nice roadside stand selling produce, using their discarded product as fertilizer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Please contact your state representatives and urge them to pass House Bill 2525, which seeks to improve life for dogs living in the state's commercial breeding kennels.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As for the Amish farmers whom tourists find so quaint and charming , it is customary for them to treat their animals like this - not as fellow beings but as commodities to be disposed of like garbage when they no longer have commercial value.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sherry Wolfe, Lebanon</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Animal rights are OK, but when you try to anthropomorphize pets that takes it too far. While many people cite the horrors of dog fighting, people don't seem to realize that human politics can be very similar, and more important.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Politicians around the world do kill each other and torture other countries' peoples- and, ironically, may be invested in by both sides of a conflict. Our country is gambling all right, but not on dogs. The stakes are trillions of dollars this time, and instead of sending those kids to college on a fraction of that money, we sent them to die in ... you finish the sentence.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There are far too many places in the world where human beings are being treated as animals. God gave human beings an ability to reason far above any animal.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Do not let your love of animals become your ignorance of humans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chris Trachte, Reamstown</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">SEX OFFENDERS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This is in reference to the letter to the editor from Fay Hess Aug. 10, &quot;Let Them Alone!&quot; Fay, I think the letter is a disgrace to your womanhood in praising Tom Armstrong and suggesting help for these sex offenders.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">These kinds of men are pariahs, not fit to live in our communities or society as a whole. If our courts and laws see fit to keep releasing them, our communities need to pull together and and try to get unfair laws changed. The alternative is to sit these pariahs in the middle of the desert, surrounded by high electric fencing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fay, I shiver to even think that one of your children or grandchildren would ever encounter one of these monsters who you seem to think can be redeemed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Our town is far from perfect, but on the subject of what matters the most, the safety of our innocent children, our town is - praise be to God - right on target.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">TEACHER HEALTH CARE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The lengthy article scrutinizing health care costs within school districts in Lancaster County [Aug. 17] was enlightening to be sure and, as districts are taxpayer-funded, perhaps relevant during such economic times.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But remarks such as those made by Susan Friedman, attorney for several districts, questioning the fairness of providing health care coverage for family members of teachers, are themselves quite unfair and somewhat inflammatory.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ms. Friedman would have us pit one teacher against the next, predicated on who is married, has children or perhaps has a child in need of special care. What a selfish system that would be, and an insult to one of the core foundations of our society, the American family.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Of course, the true solution to this issue, all the other misery caused by the myriad health care systems this country has, and all the poor souls who go to bed each night worrying whether their illness will be cared for is a simple, complete, national health plan. One group that for the most part opposes such a plan is lawyers, who make a fine living keeping things confused and in court.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Franchot Egry, Ephrata</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As a retired teacher from New Jersey, I take serious issue with the statistics quoted in the Aug. 17 article &quot;Teachers assigned more health care costs.&quot; By comparing average teacher salaries with average salaries of local workers, the public is again fooled into &quot;teacher-bashing.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Having applied to substitute-teach in Lancaster, I have undergone intense scrutiny of excellent credentials and teaching history. It brings to mind the quality of life one must lead to teach. How then can one compare the salaries paid to those who have lived lifestyles that hold up to such scrutiny to the overall working population, including the many who flip flapjacks, dig ditches and so forth?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Those who deal with our youth must have made frequent lifestyle choices and personal restrictions to qualify. How about comparing teacher wages and benefits with other professional careers?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Teachers have the right to seek the best wage and benefit packages for themselves, just as local taxpayers expect only the highest caliber of individual to be working with their youth.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It is unfair to expect public employees to sacrifice clean lifestyles and records just because it is decided to compare them with &quot;average&quot; workers!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joan Galloway, Lancaster</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">SMALL GAMES OF CHANCE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Once a year, the Department of Pennsylvania American Legion holds &quot;Legion college.&quot; State police and members of the Liquor Control Board conduct separate classes that day, and many questions are asked on small games of chance. Guess what never gets the same answer from both organizations? Seems to me it is about time for them to get together and get rules printed so all are on the same level.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I don't think the public realizes what the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars help to sponsor with the money generated from small games of chance. They help youth baseball teams, scout troops, school programs, fire companies, ambulance organizations, police departments and many more. With this crackdown on only paying out $5,000 in a seven-day period, organizations have to cut back on the amount they can contribute.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wise up, Sen. Armstrong. You and others in Harrisburg have cut the budget for the above-mentioned groups, so bring the small games bill out for a vote so the American Legion and the VFW can increase their donations.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Earl B. Rettew, Landisville</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">OTHER SUBJECTS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At the last public meeting of the Lancaster County Office of Aging, it was announced that more than 300 people are on the waiting list for services.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Is it because there are not enough people to provide these services? No, it is because the funding has been exhausted.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Many of these are very simple issues, such as getting a meal or someone to help you with a bath, or maybe help pay for a Lifeline alert. These people are striving to maintain their independence and just need a little help.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We cannot always look for funding to be provided by federal and state programs. We must start to look locally. Local government, businesses and individuals can help by sending a check to the Lancaster County Office of Aging. I am sending my check today.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">David A. Boas, Lancaster</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This is in regards to the bike race through Farmersville Aug. 17. I guess it really is a race, seeing as how they did not yield to stop signs and passed buggies and cars that had to slow down due to bikers taking up the entire lane. Also, there was no respect for vehicles sitting at stop signs waiting for a chance to pull out.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I think I am safe in saying most of these bikers also drive cars. If you were treated this way, wouldn't that make you cross?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We all have places to go. So let's use the utmost respect for our fellow citizens on the road.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mary Beth Zimmerman, Ephrata</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Were you paying attention to the &quot;debate&quot; between Barack Obama and John McCain [Aug. 16]? In case you weren't listening, let me repeat:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Q: &quot;At what point is a baby entitled to human rights?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A: &quot;At the moment of conception. I have a 25-year pro-life record in the Congress, in the Senate. And as president of the United States, I will be a pro-life president, and this presidency will have pro-life policies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;That's my commitment to you.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">No equivocation. No hesitation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Allow me to translate:If you have an abortion, my presidency will be committed to seeking to charge you with murder of another human being.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">No one likes abortion. No one I know is in favor of abortion as a policy. But what John McCain is saying, what the Republican position presents, is that at the moment of conception, no matter what the circumstances, you surrender all your rights to make a decision for yourself about your body.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It seems that there has been some misconception going around that John McCain respects the value of every human being.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Remember that in November.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Jeffrey Thal, Lancaster</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Did you hear the joke about the nine Republicans and two Democrats who spent 18 months studying their county government and determined that its 200-plus-year-old form of government is outdated and needs upgrading?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The joke is that both parties appear to support their own political agenda rather than guiding Lancaster Countians to a more representative, responsive government.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It may be a joke, but it ain't funny! When will both parties realize that this charter is good for the people and support the results? Why would they selfishly maintain their good ol' boy politics to the detriment of the public?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There is nothing funny about ineffective government.</span></p>
