  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Democrat Mark R. Warner appears to be gliding to an easy victory for U.S. Senate over Jim Gilmore, leading the Republican nearly 2-to-1 in the latest Richmond Times-Dispatch Poll.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Heading into the election Tuesday, Warner is backed by 61 percent; Gilmore by 32 percent. Six percent of voters are undecided and 1 percent prefer other candidates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The findings essentially are unchanged from three previous polls conducted in September and October for The Times-Dispatch by Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Research Inc. of Washington. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Warner-Gilmore contest is a lopsided affair, in part, because of the Democrat's enormous advantage in fundraising. Warner has collected $12.3 million, compared with $1.7 million by Gilmore.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The money edge, paired with his popularity, has allowed Warner to dominate the debate and quickly drown out Gilmore's criticism.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Also, this has freed Warner to make appeals on behalf of the presidential nominee, Sen. Barack Obama, among Warner voters perhaps considering Sen. John McCain, the Republican nominee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner's favorable rating is 63 percent, compared with 34 percent for Gilmore.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner succeeded Gilmore as governor in 2002, inheriting a recession-battered state budget that the Democrat - going back on a campaign promise - later stabilized with $1.4 billion in new taxes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gilmore, in contrast, was a tax cutter, partially erasing the locally imposed car tax. The initiative, however, proved pricier than anticipated and was capped by Warner at $1 billion a year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The poll is based on interviews Wednesday and Thursday with 625 registered and likely voters. Results could vary 4 percentage points in either direction.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In September, Warner was ahead of Gilmore, 61 percent to 28 percent. There were similar spreads in two surveys in October.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner and Gilmore are vying for the Senate seat of retiring five-term Republican John W. Warner.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Though he has contributed money to Gilmore, John Warner is not saying whether he will vote for him. Twice this week, Warner has said only that he is closely following the campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mark Warner unsuccessfully challenged the senator in 1996. They later became political allies, with John Warner backing the governor's tax increase for education, social services and law enforcement.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> According to the latest Times-Dispatch Poll, Mark Warner leads Gilmore in all areas of the state, though Warner is barely ahead in the Shenandoah Valley and Piedmont, both Republican strongholds.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Warner also leads among blacks and whites, and is pulling 32 percent of self-identified Republicans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Two other polls released yesterday affirmed Warner's frontrunner status.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A survey by Roanoke College's Center for Community Research showed Warner outpacing Gilmore 57 percent to 22 percent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The CNN/Time/Opinion Research Corp. Poll put Warner in front, 63 percent to 35 percent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Warner maintains big lead</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Former Gov. Mark R. Warner continues to lead former Gov. Jim Gilmore in regions across the state, according to a poll conducted for the Richmond Times-Dispatch.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Q: If the 2008 election for Virginia's U.S. Senate seat were held today, would you vote for Mark Warner, the Democrat, Jim Gilmore, the Republican, or one of the other party candidates?</span></p>
