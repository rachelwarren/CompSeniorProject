  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WASHINGTON</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Having tried without success to unlock frozen credit markets, the Treasury Department is considering taking ownership stakes in many U.S. banks to try to restore confidence in the financial system, according to government officials.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Treasury officials say the just-passed $700 billion bailout bill gives them the authority to inject cash directly into banks that request it. Such a move would quickly strengthen banks' balance sheets and, officials hope, persuade them to resume lending. In return, the law gives the Treasury the right to take ownership positions in banks, including healthy ones.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Treasury plan, while still in preliminary stages, resembles one announced Wednesday in Britain. Under that plan, the British government would offer banks like the Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC Holdings up to $87 billion to shore up their capital in exchange for preference shares. It also would provide a guarantee of about $430 billion to help banks refinance debt. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Wednesday, for the second consecutive day, the Federal Reserve took action in hopes of staving off a global financial collapse. And again U.S. financial markets failed to calm, extending losses for a sixth straight day while shrugging off a Fed-led, globally coordinated half-point cut in interest rates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Under normal circumstances, rate cuts are a cause for cheer because they lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and business, spurring economic activity. But the fear on Wall Street is proving difficult to contain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Before U.S. markets opened Wednesday, and after steep stock losses in Asia and Europe, the Fed announced a coordinated half-point interest-rate cut with central banks in England, China, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland and the European Central Bank. It lowered the benchmark U.S. federal funds rate to 1.5 percent, bringing down the prime rate that commercial banks charge their best customers to 4.5 percent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The coordinated rate cut was unprecedented and surprising. Never before has the Fed issued an announcement on interest rates jointly with another central bank.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yet traders in New York, ignoring the very rate cut they'd been clamoring for, began selling stocks at the opening bell, and the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 200 points within a minute of opening.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It bounced back and forth between loss and gain for much of the day before closing down 189.01 points, to 9,258.10. The S&amp;P 500 finished off 11.29 points, to 984.94, and the Nasdaq too was down 14.55 points, to 1740.33.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Markets are manic depressive, and they're really in a depressed state right now,&quot; said Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman, now a Princeton University economics professor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Right now, loan rates don't matter much because most large banks won't lend.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So while Wednesday's Fed action may help eventually, it has very little immediate impact for ordinary Americans who are finding it difficult to borrow to buy a home or car.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Credit card users may see some benefit, however, particularly if they have good credit. Borrowing costs should also drop almost immediately for consumers with variable-rate home equity and other loans tied to the prime interest rate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As Wall Street staggered, the proposal for the Treasury Department to take an ownership stake in banks, officials say, emerged as one of the most favored new options being discussed in Washington. The appeal is that it would directly address the worries that banks have about lending to one another and to other customers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The concern is that the bailout law calls for limits on executive pay when capital is directly injected into a bank. The law directs Treasury officials to write compensation standards that would discourage executives from taking &quot;unnecessary and excessive risks&quot; and that would allow the government to recover any bonus pay that is based on stated earnings that turn out to be inaccurate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In addition, any bank in which the Treasury holds a stake would be barred from paying its chief executive a &quot;golden parachute&quot; package.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Treasury officials worry that aggressive government purchases, if not done properly, could alarm bank shareholders by appearing to be punitive or could be interpreted by the market as a sign that target banks were failing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There is no shortage of ideas, ranging from the partial nationalization proposal to a guarantee by the Fed of all lending between banks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, on Wednesday refined his proposal - revealed in a debate with the Democratic nominee, Sen. Barack Obama, the night before - to allow millions of Americans to refinance their mortgages with government assistance.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As Washington casts about for Plan B, investors are clamoring for the Fed to lower interest rates to nearly zero. Some are also calling for governments worldwide to provide another round of economic stimulus through expensive public works projects.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yet behind the scramble for solutions lies a hard reality: The financial crisis has mutated into a global downturn that economists warn will be painful and protracted.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Everyone is conditioned to getting instant relief from the medicine, and that is unrealistic,&quot; said Allen Sinai, president of Decision Economics, a forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass. &quot;As hard as it is for investors and jobholders and politicians in an election year, this crisis will not end without a lot more pain.&quot;</span></p>
