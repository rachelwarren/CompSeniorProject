  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michael Bloomberg,</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">mayor of New York City From wire reports</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WASHINGTON</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The nearly 3,000 people who died when hijackers commandeered four passenger jets on Sept. 11, 2001, were remembered Thursday, as President Bush dedicated the first national memorial to the victims and the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates came together in a moment of silence.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a ceremony at the Pentagon, where 184 people were killed, Bush recalled how the &quot;doomed airliner plunged from the sky, split the rock and steel of this building, and changed our world forever.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His voice cracking, he noted , &quot;There has not been another attack on our soil in 2,557 days&quot; and said he hoped that future generations of Americans with &quot;no living memory&quot; of the attacks would conclude that, &quot;We did not tire, we did not falter and we did not fail.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;A memorial can never replace what those of you mourning a loved one lost,&quot; he told the audience, estimated at 15,000 people and includ ing many family members and friends of those who died at the Pentagon that day. &quot;We pray that you will find some comfort amid the peace of these grounds. We pray that you will find strength in knowing that our nation will always grieve for you.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In New York City, where 2,751 people were killed when American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 slammed into the World Trade Center towers, causing the buildings to collapse, presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama walked with Mayor Michael Bloomberg and McCain's wife, Cindy, to a temporary memorial site. They laid roses at a reflecting pool at the base of ground zero and paused, bowing their heads in silence. They also greeted a group of survivors, first responders and family members of the people who died.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Today marks the seventh anniversary of the day our world was broken,&quot; Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at the start of the ceremony, calling Sept. 11, 2001, a &quot;day that began like any other and ended as none ever has.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The crowd fell silent in a park just east of the Trade Center site at 8:46, 9:03, 9:59 and 10:29 a.m. - the times when two hijacked jets slammed into the buildings and the twin towers fell.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alex, Aidan and Anna Salamone - now 13, 11 and 10 years old - wore old soccer jerseys belonging to their father, broker John Patrick Salamone, who was 37 when he was killed. They recalled playing in the yard with a toy wagon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;He was strong. He was funny. He always made me laugh,&quot; Alex Salamone said. &quot;I wish I could remember more, but we were so young when he died.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We love you, daddy,&quot; said Anna.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Still others chose to forgo the public observances altogether and mark the day in quieter, more private ways. Kai Thompson Hernandez toasted her late husband, Glenn Thompson, at a beach, with his favorite brand of beer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I try and celebrate his life rather than mark the place of his death,&quot; she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In honor of the anniversary, both presidential campaigns suspended television advertising for the day. The two men appeared Thursday night at Columbia University at a forum on national service.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a statement posted on his campaign Web site, Obama recalled that on that tragic day, &quot;Americans across our great country came together to stand with the families of the victims, to donate blood, to give to charity, and to say a prayer for our country. Let us renew that spirit of service and that sense of common purpose.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Before traveling to New York, McCain spoke at a remembrance ceremony at a field near Shanksville, Pa. - the spot where United Airlines Flight 93, with 40 passengers and crew aboard, crashed after what investigators have concluded was an uprising against the four hijackers. In his remarks, the Arizona senator noted that the plane's intended target was believed to be the U.S. Capitol.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Hundreds, if not thousands, of people would have been at work in that building when that fateful moment occurred, and been destroyed along with a beautiful symbol of our freedom,&quot; he said. &quot;They and, very possibly, I owe our lives to the passengers who summoned the courage and love necessary to deny our depraved and hateful enemies their terrible triumph.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At the Pentagon ceremony, former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who helped people flee the building after the crash, fought off tears as he talked about how &quot;a great building became a battlefield.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He mourned the Pentagon employees who &quot;one morning kissed their loved ones goodbye, went off to work and never came home,&quot; and the passengers on American Airlines Flight 77, which had left Washington Dulles International Airport barely an hour before the crash, &quot;who in the last moments made phone calls to loved ones and prayed to the Almighty before their journey ended not far from where it began.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It was here that their fates were truly merged forever,&quot; he said. &quot;They fell side by side as Americans. And make no mistake, it was because they were Americans that they were killed here in this place.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Family members and friends of those who died at the Pentagon took solace in the ceremony and in each other's company.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I just couldn't come back here right after it happened,&quot; said Pam Thornton, whose son died at the Pentagon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Now, being here around everybody else who has had people they love die makes it easier.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Doris Brunelle, who lost her brother, said she hoped that the memorial reminds others of the sacrifice people made on that day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Freedom is not free,&quot; she said while waiting to see her brother's bench.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We should thank God when we wake up in the morning that we are still free and alive.&quot;</span></p>
