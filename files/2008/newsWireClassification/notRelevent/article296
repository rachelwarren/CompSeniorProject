  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">DENVER - With a forceful and gracious Hillary Rodham Clinton setting the tone, the Democratic Party last night called for unity behind Barack Obama and escalated its verbal assault against Republican John McCain. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The unequivocal call to come together was sounded by the New York senator, who ran the most successful presidential campaign ever by a woman and whose most devoted supporters have had trouble accepting that she came up just short. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;My friends, it is time to take back the country we love,&quot; Clinton declared, urging her voters to join her as a &quot;proud&quot; Obama supporter. &quot;And whether you voted for me or voted for Barack, the time is now to unite as a single party, with a single purpose. We are on the same team, and none of us can sit on the sidelines.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And lest anyone not get the point, she added: &quot;No way. No how. No McCain.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The crowd at the Pepsi Center, which had erupted in a thunderous, 2 1/2-minute ovation when daughter Chelsea introduced her as the evening's headliner, roared its approval. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clinton thanked her loyalists, including &quot;my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits,&quot; praised Michelle Obama and vice presidential candidate Joseph R. Biden Jr., and cited at length the positions she and Barack Obama share. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And she joined in the McCain-bashing that had characterized most of the evening. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It makes perfect sense that George Bush and John McCain will be together next week in the Twin Cities,&quot; she said of the Republican convention in St. Paul, Minn., &quot;because these days, they're pretty hard to tell apart.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clinton's enthusiastic endorsement of Obama was the highlight of a night in Denver that differed markedly from the first - which some analysts had criticized as too weak and amorphous. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The attacks on McCain, missing on Monday, came from every quarter, including from the normally mild-mannered Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Casey, in a prime-time speech, said the Republicans deserve &quot;not four more years. Four more months.&quot; The crowd picked up the chant, &quot;Four more months!&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And he declared: &quot;John McCain calls himself a maverick, but he votes with George Bush 90 percent of the time. That's not a maverick. That's a sidekick.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Speaker after speaker drew the choice in this election in stark terms, labeling Obama as the voice of the middle class and change - and McCain as the candidate of big business and the status quo. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If he's the answer, then the question must be ridiculous,&quot; New York Gov. David Paterson said of the Republican. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Said Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland: &quot;While families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day, John McCain is sleeping better than ever . . . because he thinks 'Americans, overall, are better off' . . . thanks to President Bush.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius took on McCain's multiple homes and his inability, when asked, to remember how many he and his wife owned. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I'm sure you remember a girl from Kansas who said, 'There's no place like home,' &quot; said Sebelius, referring to Dorothy in </span><span class="c10">The Wizard of Oz</span><span class="c2">. &quot;Well, in John McCain's version, there's no place like home. And a home. And home. And home.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama, appearing at a town-hall meeting in Kansas City, Mo., also talked economics, albeit slightly less stridently: &quot;Over the last eight years, your lives are less secure. Those are the facts, and John McCain is not promising to do anything different than George Bush did.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The exception to the tone of the day came, oddly, in a future-oriented keynote speech by former Virginia Gov. Mark Warner. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I know we're at the Democratic National Convention, but if an idea works, it really doesn't matter if it has an 'R' or 'D' next to it,&quot; he said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Before last night's session, several of the strategists behind Bill Clinton's two election victories, James Carville among them, had criticized the early tone of the convention as not being tough enough on the Republicans. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They appeared to be speaking for party leaders who wonder whether Obama's reluctance ever to look fighting mad helps explain why downscale white Democrats have been slow to warm to him - and why the polls are so tight, nationally and in the key states. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We've got to start smacking back in short understandable bites,&quot; Gov. Rendell told the Washington Post. &quot;Everybody is nervous as all get out. Everybody says we ought to be ahead by 10, 15 points. What the heck is going on?&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's obvious personal gifts, the Pennsylvania governor added, make him &quot;not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Republicans, for their part, were offering a clear message in a tough tone, one meant to feed public doubts that Obama does not have enough experience to be president. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Overnight, the McCain campaign put out a new ad, one recalling the famous ad Clinton used against Obama in the primaries, asking who Americans would want answering a 3 a.m. crisis phone call in the White House. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It quotes a remark Clinton made when she, too, was trying to raise the experience issue and was suggesting she'd be the better opponent for McCain. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I know Sen. McCain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the White House,&quot; she says in a video clip used in McCain's&nbsp;ad. &quot;And Sen. Obama has a speech he gave in 2002,&quot; referring to Obama's early declaration of his opposition to war with Iraq. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Later yesterday, party leaders including former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a possible McCain running mate, reinforced the message at a news conference here under the title: &quot;Not Ready '08: A Mile High and an Inch Deep.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Said Romney: &quot;Barack Obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family. But he's not ready to be president of the United States of America.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bill Clinton didn't help matters with his own comments, made yesterday in Denver. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Suppose you're a voter, and you've got candidate X and candidate Y. Candidate X agrees with you on everything, but you don't think that candidate can deliver on anything at all,&quot; he said. &quot;Candidate Y you agree with on about half the issues, but he can deliver. Which candidate are you going to vote for?&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The former president quickly added, &quot;This has nothing to do with what's going on now.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the view of some worried Democrats, these are the kinds of attacks that have allowed McCain to dominate the political dialogue for much of the summer. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Today brings the presidential and vice-presidential roll calls, the formal nominations of Obama and Biden, and Biden's acceptance speech. </span></p>
