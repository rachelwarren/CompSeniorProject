  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Why is Montgomery County Board opposing jobs and growth?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With 6.4 percent (4,980 workers) unemployment in the New River Valley, one would think that the Montgomery County Board of Supervisors would be willing to pay $1 million to have the inland port built in Elliston.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Instead, those short-sighted and narrow-minded elected officials are willing to pay the city of Salem $1 million to take it off their hands.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Don't those officials realize that this will bring jobs to their depressed area and commercial real estate tax money into the local treasury?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If you want to see what the inland port will contribute drive up to Front Royal (Exit 6N off I-66) and view their facility. It is beautiful and adds lots to the area. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Where are the citizens of Montgomery County who oppose this decision? Is Billy Joe Duncan the only taxpayer in Montgomery County willing to stand up and express his sentiments to the board of supervisors?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If you are opposed to the board's viewpoint you should contact the supervisors immediately and let them know how you feel. Could it be that a large landowner in the Shawsville/Elliston area is a silent force in the board's decision to oppose growth for our area?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I'm so tired of hearing about the different Americas, like white America and black America.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Is Obama really going to be good for America or is he going to be good for his race?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let's go back to 9/11, a tragic source of events for America. For once in my lifetime, it didn't happen to black or white people. It happened to all Americans and the whole America banded together. That's what we need for us to really coexist. That's a shame. Everything we work for is in vain.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mark Warner represented Virginia well Tuesday night in his thoughtful and intelligent call for attention to the middle class and working people of this country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The last eight years have been a plunge into the abyss of runaway spending on an unpopular war, destruction of our economy and a widening gap between rich and poor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It is heartening that we finally have positive choices like Barack Obama, and Warner and a governor like Tim Kaine.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Locally, a creative Roanoke businessman, Sam Rasoul, is working hard to create jobs and a turn around in the energy crisis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I hope that Virginia voters take the time to check out the substantive plans of these candidates and refuse to be distracted by negative campaign ads and editorials that deluge us with hate speech and division.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's time we got some intelligence, caring and hope back into Virginia. Your vote really counts this time.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am a life member of the National Education Association, have been a local association president and have been on numerous education association committees over the years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I thought I was used to mailings that did not reflect my views, but recently the NEA has gone well over the edge.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I refer to several NEA flyers sent that support Senator Barack Obama for president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I cannot and do not support Obama because of both his lack of foreign policy experience and his views on economic and social issues, especially on abortion. The flyers held highly distorted information.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I once was proud of my NEA membership. It was a true professional organization. We held ourselves superior to the then teachers union, and it is ironic that some of those old leaders of the American Federation of Teachers are now unhappy with the NEA's political stance and are supporting Sen. John McCain for president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I intend to work as hard for the election of McCain as I once did for NEA. I have also talked with many other teachers who are thoroughly in agreement that the NEA no longer speaks for us. Not when it comes to selecting a president.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Salute McCain's service; vote for Obama</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: &quot;Obama needs more than a 'D' by his name,&quot; Aug. 24 letter: Time in service is not the only criteria of leadership. Thought and work are the two most important factors as they accelerate experience.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Time in service (experience) can mold after it ceases to be productive, like bread that sweetens before molding; thus we find Sen. John McCain, sweet and moldy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some maintain the importance of age and experience as the only criteria of presidential leadership. Although President Bush is currently the most experienced man for the office (eight years), thought and work are rarely evident. Here we see a president with a 28 percent approval rating.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Check McCain's biography and compare it to Barack Obama's to find a vast difference between the two regarding concerns, thought and work.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Then compare McCain with Bush. You may be afraid to find so many similarities. Obama is the man with the right type of experience, energy, judgment and unflawed character. He is the candidate of our time.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We salute McCain for his past services, but we need to elect Obama for his ability to serve us now.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Roanoke Times reported Aug. 19, that several college presidents were calling for state lawmakers to lower the drinking age to 18 years old (&quot;Lower drinking age is on the table,&quot; front page). What are they thinking?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I can speak from personal experience that most people that age drink for the most part for one reason: to get drunk. If they cannot get alcohol, they find anyone older who would be willing to buy it for them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This means you will have 18 year olds buying for those even younger. If they would listen to the psychology classes they teach in their own colleges, they have already proved that young adults even in their late teens have brains that have not matured to the point that they can make good decisions at critical times.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I feel the colleges want to lower the age to pull the monkey off their backs of trying to police underage drinking on and around campuses.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In congruence with the Aug. 24 commentary, &quot;Big oil drums up support,&quot; offshore drilling is not the solution to high gas prices.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As Congress approaches its next session, energy costs are a high priority. We need congressmen like Rep. Rick Boucher to support real energy solutions from clean, homegrown energy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">America sends more than $700 billion overseas every year, allowing hostile nations to threaten our national security. These dirty fossil fuels contribute to global warming as well.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">American innovation is the solution, in building cars that get 100 mpg or more, expanding public transportation, more efficient buildings and harnessing renewable energies like wind and solar power.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Offshore drilling puts our beaches and our last wild places at risk. It will do nothing to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Bush administration's Energy Information Administration agrees that offshore drilling will have &quot;no significant&quot; impact on gasoline prices.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A new energy future with clean renewable energy sources, plug-in hybrid cars, and more efficient buildings will cut energy bills and global warming pollution. We urge Boucher to support real energy independence solutions and to reject drilling proposals that would only increase our destructive dependence on oil.</span></p>
