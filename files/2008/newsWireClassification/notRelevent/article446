  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">NONE OF us has ever lived through an election at a time when 80 percent of voters think the country is headed in the wrong direction. But now that we're in the thick of it, a few things are clear. From voters, the demand is: Surprise Me Most. For candidates, the lesson is: Weirdness Wins.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Last winter, Barack Obama succeeded by running a weird campaign. He wasn't just a normal politician aiming for office, he was going to cleanse the country of the baby-boom culture war mentality. In his soaring speeches, he denounced the mores of both the Clinton and Bush eras and made an argument for unity and hope over endless partisan warfare. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Over the course of the spring, however, Obama's campaign got less weird. The crucial pivot came when he failed to seize on McCain's offer to do a series of joint town-hall meetings across the country. Those meetings would have elevated the race and shown that Obama is willing to take risks to truly change the way things are done.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Instead, Obama's speeches became more conventional, more policy-specific and more orthodox. His Denver acceptance speech was different from his Iowa speeches. It was more traditionally anti-Republican and pro-Democratic. In the speech's crucial contrast Obama declared: &quot;It's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America. You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It is easy to see why Obama might tack this way. Democrats have a huge advantage in a straight-up issue contest. McCain is vulnerable on health care and the economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But by campaigning in this traditional way, Obama ceded the weirdness edge to McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The old warrior jumped right in. Think about how weird last week was. The Republican convention was one long protest against the way the Republicans themselves have run Washington. McCain's convention speech barely mentioned his own party. His vice presidential nominee came out of the blue and seems totally unlike the regular crowd of former eighth-grade class presidents who normally dominate public life. McCain's campaign ideology, exemplified in a new ad released on Monday, is not familiar conservatism. It's maverickism -- against the entrenched powers and party orthodoxies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And it all worked. McCain got a huge post-convention bounce in the polls.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now the campaign has become a battle between two different definitions of change. The Obama camp has become the champion of policy change -- after eight years of failed Bush-McCain policies, it is time for different, Democratic ones. The McCain campaign is the champion of systemic change -- after two decades of bickering and self-dealing, it's time to shake up the whole system to get things done.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama change is more responsible and specific, but it has all the weirdness of a Brookings Institution report. (Not that there's anything wrong with that.) The McCain promise of change is comprehensive and vehement, though it's hard to know how it would actually work in office.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It will still be hard for McCain to win in this environment, but his emphasis on broad systemic change may appeal to swing voters. Independent voters do not believe the country's problems can be solved merely by replacing Republicans with Democrats. They cast a pox on both houses.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Furthermore, the maverick theme allows McCain to talk directly about character. Obama can hint at his values when he describes his tax cuts and health care plans, but he is indirect. Most voters, especially ones who decide late, vote on character over policies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If I were advising the candidates, I'd tell them to double down on weirdness. Obama needs to occasionally criticize his own side. If he can't take on his own party hacks, he'll never reclaim the mantle of systemic change. Specifically, he needs to attack the snobs who are savaging Sarah Palin's faith and family. Many liberals claim to love working-class families, but the moment they glimpse a hunter with an uneven college record, they hop on chairs and call for disinfectant.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If I were McCain, I'd make the divided-government argument explicit. Republicans are intellectually unfit to govern right now, but balancing with Democrats, they might be able to do some good. I'd have McCain tell the country that he looks forward to working with congressional Democrats, that he is confident they can achieve great things together.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The candidates probably won't take this kind of advice. But remember: Weirdness wins. Surprise me most.</span></p>
