  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sep. 25--The good news about Virginia's unusual status as a battleground state is that the commonwealth will get plenty of notice from the candidates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The bad news is that Virginia is getting another kind of attention: Both campaigns and independent special interest groups are flooding Virginia's airways with 30-second ads, most consisting of simplifications, distortions or outright lies about the opposing side.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Virginia voters should brace themselves for the onslaught to continue over the next month and a half -- and they should make sure not to accept any ad by any candidate at face value. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">All ads are designed to manipulate, but political ads are generally more pernicious than those selling soap or mouthwash.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The most innocuous statement by an opponent will be plastered, completely out of context, across a screen while a sinister-sounding voice-over artist makes him sound like a cross between Adolf Hitler and Osama bin Laden.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A vote for a huge budget bill will be painted as a vote for a minor provision contained within.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Voters have a responsibility to try to wash away the mud and attempt to dig up the actual facts. There are several good places to do that.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">FactCheck.org is a nonpartisan, nonprofit operation run by the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Staff members there examine political ads, candidate speeches, chain e-mails and other potential sources of disinformation. They compare the claims to the record, and call out the exaggerations, lies and distortions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They've hit Sen. Barack Obama for exaggerating Sen. John McCain's plans for Social Security. They've hit McCain for repeatedly misstating Obama's tax plans. They exposed Sen. Joe Biden's use of partial quotes to distort what McCain has said about the financial crisis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They examine the claims of third parties, too, including the NRA and authors like Jerome Corsi, whose best-selling &quot;Obama Nation&quot; they call &quot;a mishmash of unsupported conjecture, half-truths, logical fallacies and outright falsehoods.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Politifact.com, from Congressional Quarterly and The St. Petersburg Times, offers a handy &quot;Truth-O-Meter&quot; that rates claims from &quot;Pants-On-Fire&quot; to &quot;True.&quot; The Web site also recently started a &quot;FlipOMeter&quot; to judge candidate's flip-flops.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Many newspapers, including The Washington Post and USA Today, also do fact-check articles on advertisements.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So if you find an ad compelling and think it may help you make up your mind, do yourself -- and the nation -- a favor. Before you push the button on the voting machine, make sure you've checked the facts first.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Don't trust political ads. Doubt every claim they make until you can verify it yourself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">blogs.roanoke.com/roundtable/ Join us for a live blog of the first presidential debate, scheduled for Friday at 9 p.m. (Sen. John McCain has asked for the debate to be delayed so he and Sen. Barack Obama can help forge a compromise to address the financial crisis.)</span></p>
