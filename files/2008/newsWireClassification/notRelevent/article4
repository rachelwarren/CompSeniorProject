  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By Matthew Bowers and Shawn Day</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Virginian-Pilot</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Virginia Beach</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The doormat read &quot;beware of dog.&quot; Behind the storm door barked Shakespeare and Bella - two Chihuahuas.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Piece of cake,&quot; Myra Jennings, an experienced Democratic canvasser, told her rookie partner, Carolyn Wood, on Monday morning.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lisa Nietling appeared at the door holding a coffee mug as the dogs yapped and scratched at the glass. &quot;We're Republicans,&quot; she said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I usually wait until after the debates to make a decision,&quot; added her husband, Daniel.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Thank you for keeping an open mind,&quot; Jennings said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Labor Day has long been considered the traditional start of the election season - a quaint idea now, when presidential campaigns can run two years. Perhaps also quaint, but still considered important despite Web sites and TV ad blitzes, are supporters knocking on doors.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The only people on the campaign that most people meet are us,&quot; said Jennings, 62, a retired middle-school science teacher.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Saturday, Republicans Seamus Owens and John Woolard made a similar journey across the city.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They were among 40 or so Republican supporters, many in their teens or 20s, who met at U.S. Rep. Thelma Drake's campaign office on South Independence Boulevard.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Democrats targeted all registered voters. The Republicans analyzed voting records to find high concentrations of &quot;swing voters.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If they vote every year, they're hard-core. You don't have to worry about them,&quot; Owens explained, walking through the Pocahontas Village neighborhood. People who vote less frequently are less likely to vote strictly along party lines, he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Since March, Republican staffers and volunteers have knocked on 50,000 doors in Virginia Beach, Norfolk and Hampton, and organizers aim for another 20,000 before the Nov. 4 election, said Corry Bliss, Drake's campaign manager.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When Owens knocked on a door hoping to talk to his first voter of the day, a man in a T-shirt opened, spotted a sticker promoting Republican U.S. Senate candidate Jim Gilmore and bellowed, &quot;Gilmore! All right!&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The man pledged his support for Drake and presumptive presidential nominee Sen. John McCain and, after accepting brochures, wished Owens and Woolard well.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;That was a softball,&quot; Owens conceded.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Owens, 24, is a paid staffer for Drake's campaign. Woolard, 16, is a First Colonial High School junior who won't be able to vote Nov. 4, but he didn't let that stop him from taking part in his first door-to-door canvass.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Woolard rang one bell and someone inside shouted, &quot;Someone's at the door!&quot; Seconds passed with no answer. He left a brochure and went next door.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Again, no answer. Another brochure.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This is par for the course,&quot; Owens said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Still, Woolard said later, pounding the pavement for someone you believe in is worth the effort.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;You actually feel like you're doing something,&quot; he said. &quot;This is how you win.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Monday, Democrats Jennings and Wood hit the jackpot at their first stop in Lynnhaven Woods, just north of Lynnhaven Mall. Donna Ivins broke from spraying weeds to say her whole family was voting for Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Put your stuff down and come along with us,&quot; Jennings said. &quot;You've made my day.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Jesse Nimmo, another Obama supporter, agreed to post a yard sign but hadn't decided on the Senate or House races - and hadn't heard of Drake's Democratic challenger, Glenn Nye. This got noted on a clipboard.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Along with measuring support and registering voters, canvassers take the concerns and issues they hear on the street from voters on both political sides and pass them up the campaign chain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Across the street, Sean McLaren said he supported McCain but took time to discuss issues and voting rationales. Jennings told him she appreciated his research - he even had read Obama's book.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;As a citizen, it's my duty,&quot; McLaren said. &quot;You should never vote randomly.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It was the third time this election that his house had been canvassed by Democrats.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's a good thing,&quot; he said later. &quot;It would influence someone who was on the fence and undecided. I think it's good for democracy.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Campaign workers Myra Jennings, left, and Carolyn Wood talk with Virginia Beach resident and Barack Obama supporter Jesse Nimmo about politics in his front yard Monday. Nimmo agreed to post a yard sign, but he said he hasn't made up his mind on the Senate or House races. McCain fans</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Daniel Sileo, 16, center, is one of 40 or so GOP supporters - even though he's too young to vote - who met at U.S. Rep. Thelma Drake's campaign office to canvass Beach neighborhoods Saturday. Since March, GOP canvassers have knocked on 50,000 doors in the region, an official said. - online</span></p>
