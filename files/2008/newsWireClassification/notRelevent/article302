  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's lie</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While on the stump in Florida last weekend, Barack Obama contended that John McCain's talk of Social Security privatization could leave seniors destitute: &quot;If my opponent had his way, the millions of Floridians who rely on it would've had their Social Security tied up in the stock market this week.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama lied. No nest eggs would have disappeared, because the McCain plan exempts every American born before 1950. I could also detail the Obama TV ad on Social Security that has been aired in Florida, Pennsylvania and five other states -- it falsely claims that McCain favors &quot;cutting benefits in half&quot; -- but here's the point: The Obama camp has apparently decided that the candidate needs to scare senior Americans into voting for him, because he doesn't appear to be connecting with enough of them any other way. ...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The latest nonpartisan Pew Research Center poll shows plus-65 voters favoring McCain over Obama by five points; the higher the age bracket, the lower the percentage share for Obama.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pay the band</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For nearly a century, over-the-air broadcasters have benefited from an exemption in copyright law that allows them to play music without paying the people who performed the music. Songwriters get paid, but performers don't.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That seems unfair. Internet, satellite and cable radio outlets pay performers for their work. It's time traditional radio stations did as well. The Performance Rights Act, introduced last year by Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., would lift the exemption. It should become law.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">NERO multiplied</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If the United States does experience an economic catastrophe in the months and years ahead, and if future historians wish to identify the date on which it began, Monday may turn out to be as good a candidate as any for the title of Black Monday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Despite agreement among the White House and Democratic and Republican congressional leaders on a financial rescue package, back-benchers from both parties scuttled the plan in the House on Monday, by a vote of 228 to 205. Amid news of spreading financial distress in Europe, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 777 points.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yet the gathering darkness is as much political in nature as economic. Just when it seemed that American democracy had at least temporarily conquered its ugliest habits of partisanship, that the people's elected representatives were about to make a tough decision in the long-term national interest -- pique and polarization carried the day.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On deck?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A baseball stadium has returned to the on-deck circle in Richmond politics. The mayoral candidates are talking about it. Mayor Doug Wilder has praised the virtues of a park in the Bottom.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Braves have taken their last swings at The Diamond and next season presumably will be playing in the friendly confines of Gwinnett, Ga. Boosters expect minor-league baseball to return to central Virginia, although perhaps not at the AAA level (at least at first), and perhaps not so soon as originally hoped.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Stories about baseball's future typically report that a new stadium remains a crucial part of the equation. The policy questions relate to financing and ownership.</span></p>
