  <p class="c5"><span class="c7">It May Be Time to Drop a Few Balls Around Town </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Mothball those ball gowns! Washington's black-tie blowouts are going the way of your 401(k). Monday's gala for the Shakespeare Theatre's Harman Center for the Arts took a hit -- and that's only the beginning of what looks like a seismic shift on the charity scene.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The $1,000-a-ticket fundraiser (honoring Chita Rivera, choreographers Rennie Harris and Peter Martins, and benefactor Sidney Harman) raised almost $900,000, but fell short of the $1.2 million goal -- even though most of the money was raised before the economy went south. Individual patrons were &quot;very, very generous,&quot; but corporate donations fell off, co-chair Beth Dozoretz said. &quot;We worked very hard. Usually these things happen with just a push. This was a lot of asking.&quot; To save money, designer David Stark filled the National Building Museum with white ribbon streamers and candles instead of flowers; organizers hired a DJ instead of a band. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Doesn't bode well for D.C.'s spring fundraisers, which will have to fight over donors or downscale dramatically. And what does this all mean for January's inauguration? Still too many of those overcrowded, underwhelming fancy balls, no doubt, but nothing like the $40 million celebrations of 2000 and 2004.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">He Might Not Be Political, but He Knows the Score </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Republicans and Democrats are increasingly singing the same tune -- at least in their campaign ads.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">From his studio in Clarendon, composer Todd Hahn provides the soundtrack for candidates across the country. He's worked for both teams over the years and says their tastes are slowly converging.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The GOP sound -- like the ads he scored for John McCain in 2000 -- used to be &quot;very heroic, very cinematic,&quot; with studio-synthesized French horns and timpani, &quot;big, dense, orchestral.&quot; The Dems leaned toward a &quot;Bruce Springsteen sound&quot; with guitars. Now everyone likes an acoustic, &quot;organic&quot; sound, he says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The music is the subliminal delivery agent of the message,&quot; Hahn says. &quot;They're like 30-second film scores, designed to tweak people's emotions good or bad.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For a positive Obama ad (&quot;Three Bedroom Ranch&quot;), Hahn scored talk of the candidate's economic plan with twinkly soft-rock. For a negative one (&quot;Book&quot;) blasting McCain's plan, Hahn laid down agitated rhythms and an ominous whoosh he calls &quot;ethereal wash.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As for Hahn's own politics, &quot;I'm right up the middle,&quot; he said. &quot;I failed all my government courses in high school. I still don't know a lot about it.&quot;<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">This Just In . . . </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&Acirc;&middot; Ted Kennedy returned to his D.C. home last night -- his first time in the city since July. &quot;He thought this would be a good time to be back,&quot; said spokesman Anthony Coley. &quot;He may pop into the office at some point.&quot; Kennedy, battling brain cancer, will stay until Thanksgiving; undecided if he'll join the post-election Senate session.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&Acirc;&middot; Libertarian Bob Barr -- who brags he's the only presidential candidate with a concealed-firearm permit (he holsters a .45 Glock) -- yesterday offered a &quot;new, in the box, hard to find, 12 gauge Mossberg Model 590A pump shotgun&quot; to the donor who contributes the highest sum by midnight tonight.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">End Quote </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If some thug breaks into my home, I can use my roundhouse kick. But I prefer he look down the barrel of my gun.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">-- &quot;Black-belt patriot&quot; Chuck Norris urging voters to seek out gun-rights candidates in his first-ever NRA ad, which rolled out yesterday in 10 battleground states. The Mike Huckabee supporter recently wrote that John McCain won his vote by picking Sarah Palin as his running mate.</span></p>
