  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Easy money</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now that the Fed has bailed out yet another corporation, the American people are being fed more lies from the Democrats. First it was the Democratic Congress that pushed hard for financial institutions to take on subprime loans. Remember, they said it was only fair that all Americans own a home, regardless of ability to pay.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Money was so cheap that these financial institutions lined up to give it away. So now all of these institutions are saddled with mortgage-backed securities that are worthless. No credit checks, no income or asset verification paved the road we're on today. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to say the Democrats had no part in this is truly disingenuous. She's singing the same old tune that failed Bush policies caused this. Before the Democrats took control of Congress in 2006, our economy was doing far better than today.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We don't need more government regulation. Financial institutions were deregulated under Bill Clinton. The media need to be more honest with the American people, too, like bringing up that little tidbit.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wrong road</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After the events of this past Monday (some are calling it Black Monday) when the Dow dropped more than 500 points and ended the day in the worst decline since 9/11, I am more committed than ever to voting for Barack Obama in November.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain is divorced from the economic reality of hard-working Americans. By repeating that the &quot;fundamentals of our economy are strong,&quot; McCain is driving home just how far removed from middle-class voters he really is.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Former Sen. Phil Gramm, who pushed legislation that allowed the investment and mortgage crises to spiral out of control, has been McCain's right-hand man on economic policies throughout his campaign. He made headlines by calling America &quot;a nation of whiners,&quot; while claiming that the current crisis is simply &quot;a mental recession.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's solutions will help rebuild the middle class. He'll give 95 percent of working Americans a tax cut of up to $1,000.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Voice for taxpayers</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If Virginia Beach voters knew that they had a choice in the mayor's race for a candidate who understands their tax burdens and who could cut unchecked spending by the local government, I think that candidate would win overwhelmingly. Unfortunately, candidates like John Moss don't get enough campaign donations to advertise. I'll send my check to Moss, even though it won't be much. Many people will not even recognize his name and, sadly, he will probably receive a small percentage of the vote. But maybe, just this once, it won't be politics as usual and we'll get someone we deserve.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pro-planning mayor</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re &quot;Fiction on planning,&quot; letter, Sept. 17:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The writer's reaction to the Sept. 7 news story about planning for development in Virginia Beach was refreshingly factual. One reason the current mayor of Virginia Beach, Meyera Oberndorf, has been repeatedly returned to office is that she has a strong voting record of supporting the comprehensive plan. Unfortunately, having only one vote to cast, the mayor has frequently been in the minority. For this reason, checking the voting record, if there is one, of anyone running for mayor or City Council is a good idea.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">No need for hotel</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re &quot;Lucas to revive hotel plans,&quot; Hampton Roads, Sept. 15:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If Sen. Lucas thinks another hotel and conference center is such a great idea for Portsmouth, then why can't she find a venture capitalist willing to take the risk? The city of Portsmouth is already in the hotel business and losing money every year, with vacant rooms at The Renaissance Hotel.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Empowerment Zone financing she seeks is just another name for wasteful pork. And it would only be a matter of time before Lucas came back to Portsmouth City Council, hat in hand, looking for another bailout. This is nothing more than a smokescreen for ego and entitlement.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A tailor's legacy</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Aug. 27, Ghent lost one of its favorite businessmen, Frank Paolocci, who died from heart complications. I met Frank when he came to Norfolk in 1966, having been invited by Shulman &amp; Co. to emigrate from Italy for a job. After Shulman's, Frank and his wife, Mina, opened their own business, the Ghent Seamstress &amp; Tailor Shop on Colley Avenue.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Frank was undoubtedly the finest men's tailor I have ever known. Not only was he a master craftsman, but he was a man of sterling character. He was honest, industrious and fiercely patriotic, having become a citizen. He was always smiling, and he and his wife deemed it their duty to satisfy and serve their customers. You left their shop with a sense of pride knowing that you would be completely satisfied with their fine work.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Exceptional Navy command</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Last Friday, the local press missed the change of command of the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command, from Rear Adm. Michael Tillotson to Rear Adm. Carol M. Pottenger, both impressive officers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pottenger took over a command of more than 30,000 highly trained Americans. The commands encompass 11 warfare specialties, including explosive ordnance disposal, riverine forces, naval construction, diving operations and expeditionary forces that are deployed throughout the world.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The remarks by Adm. Jonathan Greenert, Commander U.S. Fleet Forces Command, told the story of the command's accomplishments as it defeated terrorism from Iraq to the Horn of Africa.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">These heroic Americans put boots on the ground while their families, our neighbors, waited for their heroes to return. Forty-four have sacrificed their lives.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As one of the active-duty and retired admirals in attendance, I was honored to be in the presence of the troops.</span></p>
