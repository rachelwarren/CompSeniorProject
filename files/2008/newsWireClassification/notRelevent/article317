  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The sharpening rhetoric between Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama over their competing plans to overhaul the nation's tax system has underscored one of the most profound differences between them -- how they would target America's wealthiest taxpayers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Under Mr. McCain, the rich would see their tax burden ease. Under Mr. Obama, their rates would rise dramatically.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For much of the campaign, the two candidates have talked sparingly and obliquely about how they would deal with affluent taxpayers. But a recent volley of acid-edged campaign ads stirred up the tax issue, and a question posed last weekend by Orange County pastor Rick Warren zeroed in on how both men defined &quot;rich.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama said the dividing line was income of $250,000 a year, while Mr. McCain responded somewhat flippantly that it was $5 million. McCain aides said later that the senator was joking, but his remark quickly became a campaign flashpoint. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I guess if you're making $3 million a year, you're middle-class,&quot; Mr. Obama sniped, prompting a McCain aide to fire back: &quot;It's not the job of the government to define who is rich.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Where to draw the line among the nation's wealthiest taxpayers is the central difference between rival tax blueprints that offer starkly differing formulas for reviving a faltering economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Tuesday, new ads from both camps played on the public's rising anxiety about taxes, incomes and the volatile economy. &quot;Three Times,&quot; an Obama television ad airing from Virginia to Colorado, savages Mr. McCain for lavishing $200 billion tax &quot;giveaways&quot; on &quot;big corporations.&quot; Mr. McCain responded with &quot;Millions,&quot; a radio ad that predicts Mr. Obama will &quot;raise taxes on your income, your electric bills, even your life savings.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The two camps immediately issued rebuttals, each claiming its position on taxes was being distorted by the opposition. The Obama campaign contended that the overwhelming majority of Americans would not see a tax increase under his plan, only the wealthiest 5 percent or so. The McCain side retorted that the &quot;$4 billion&quot; in tax breaks for oil companies mentioned in Mr. Obama's&nbsp;ad was misleading because Mr. McCain is proposing an across-the-board tax cut for all corporations and is not favoring the oil industry.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A close look at their proposals shows that the differences fall neatly along the traditional policy gulf that has long divided Republicans and Democrats: liberating the wealthy with tax cuts to stimulate the nation's prosperity versus raising their rates to redistribute the tax burden and pay for crucial government programs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The real fault lines are over how to treat people in the highest tax brackets. It gets to the heart of their economic philosophies,&quot; said Leonard E. Burman, a senior fellow with the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan Washington-based tax reform group that has questioned the details of both tax plans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both candidates have promised to balance their tax relief programs with budget cuts designed to trim soaring deficits. But the Tax Policy Center has warned that both plans -- coupled with the candidates' high-cost healthcare proposals -- would balloon the $9.6 trillion national debt. The center's analysis reported that Mr. McCain's tax proposals would add $5 trillion to the debt over the next 10 years, while Mr. Obama's would add $3.6 trillion.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Both tax plans take for granted a big peace dividend from ending the war in Iraq,&quot; Burman said. &quot;That's a big assumption.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. McCain's plan would cater to wealthy taxpayers and corporations by extending and expanding the Bush tax cuts, slashing corporate taxes and weakening the estate tax, but it would also aid taxpayers across the board by making the full Bush cuts permanent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A deficit hawk and formerly a critic of the massive tax cuts launched in 2001 by the Bush administration, Mr. McCain now embraces the tax policies of supply-side economists who contend that lifting the tax yoke on the rich would encourage investment and stimulate the economy. &quot;Wealth creates wealth,&quot; Mr. McCain said during a primary debate in Michigan last year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Under his proposals, Mr. McCain would make all the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts permanent. That would keep the two highest tax brackets at their current rates of 33 percent and 35 percent -- rather than reverting to 36 percent and 39.6 percent, where they were during the Clinton administration.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;They've been law for eight years now, and taxpayers are used to those rates,&quot; said J.D. Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington. &quot;Allowing them to expire would be tantamount to a massive tax increase.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. McCain also has proposed a sharp reduction in corporate taxes. He would pare the highest two corporate tax brackets, 35 percent and 34 percent, down to 25 percent. The top bracket would be immediately eliminated and the 34 percent bracket would be phased down to 24 percent between 2009 and 2014.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He would also maintain the 15 percent tax rates on dividends and capital gains for the highest-tier taxpayers. And starting in 2010, Mr. McCain would substantially reduce the estate tax. He would increase the exemption on inherited funds from $3.5 million to $5 million and sharply lower taxes on remaining wealth from 45 percent to 15%, moves that would enable affluent families to hold on to more of their wealth.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democratic-leaning economists say Mr. McCain's plans offer little new aid to squeezed middle-class families. And they question whether corporations and wealthy taxpayers would convert McCain-era tax savings into new investments that would bolster the economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama's tax plan is aimed at strengthening benefits for lower-rung taxpayers and raising rates at the top. His plan would restore the Clinton-era rates for the highest two tax brackets to 36 percent and 39.6 percent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Springfield, Mo. last month, Mr. Obama pledged that if &quot;you're a family making less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes go up.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama would exempt seniors making less than $50,000 from paying any income tax. And he would make the Bush cuts permanent for poor and middle-class Americans, adding tax breaks like a refundable credit for wage earners and a higher education credit for students who agree to work 100 hours of community service.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Under Mr. Obama's plan, the highest corporate tax tier would hold at 35 percent -- a nod to Wall Street, but higher than Mr. McCain's slashed rate. But Mr. Obama would raise the highest rates on dividends and capital gains from 15 percent to 20 percent. And he would keep the estate tax in the same form approved by Congress for 2009, with an exemption for the first $3.5 million and a top tax rate of 45%. That would mean a higher rate on the wealthy than Mr. McCain would allow.</span></p>
