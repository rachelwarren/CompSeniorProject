  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gov. Ed Rendell said he plans to announce a &quot;truth squad&quot; initiative tomorrow to counter &quot;lies and distortions&quot; by the campaign of Arizona Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At a news conference yesterday morning in Pittsburgh with Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, Mr. Rendell said that television ads and statements by the campaign have inaccurately suggested that Mr. McCain's Democratic opponent, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, would raise taxes on most Americans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The vast majority, in fact, would receive bigger tax breaks under Mr. Obama's tax plan, he said, outlining various groups of lower- and middle-income people, ranging from a single parent with young children to couples and elderly widows, that he said would do better.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Lindsay, a McCain campaign spokesman, said that at a time of increased economic hardship, Pennsylvania families deserve to know about Mr. Obama's record, including that he has voted for higher taxes &quot;nearly 100 times&quot; in the Senate and &quot;plans to tax coal and natural gas that are an engine for job growth in the state.&quot; In February, Mr. Obama did tell a San Antonio newspaper, &quot;What we ought to tax is dirty energy, like coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas.&quot; But the remark was made after he was asked whether taxes should be levied on renewable energy sources and &quot;was not a general call for increasing taxes on coal or natural gas,&quot; according to FactCheck.org. Mr. Obama &quot;certainly does not have any such proposal as part of his public platform,&quot; the Web site noted.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Rendell and others have accused the McCain campaign before of making false statements about Mr. Obama's tax plan. Last week, for example, FactCheck.org said the McCain campaign &quot;has released yet another ad that makes false claims.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;As we keep saying,&quot; the Web site noted, &quot;Obama says he'll raise income taxes and capital gains taxes only for couples earning more than $250,000 per year or singles making over $200,000.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Less clear is how Mr. Obama, if elected, would accomplish those goals, particularly facing budget deficits and a struggling economy, said G. Terry Madonna, a political science professor and pollster from Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Rendell was in town yesterday for political meetings and appearances, but no official business, said his spokesman, Chuck Ardo.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The news conference was held at Grandview Park, Mount Washington, where the Obama campaign kicked off &quot;Steps for Change,&quot; a local effort to register new voters. While those efforts have been ongoing, &quot;Steps for Change&quot; acknowledged Pittsburgh's status as the U.S. city with the most public stairways -- 712, with a total of 44,645 steps.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Polls show the race between Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama has narrowed in Pennsylvania, considered a battleground state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Speaking to a small group of Obama canvassers at the news conference, Mr. Ravenstahl and Mr. Vilsack, a Pittsburgh native, urged them to press on.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We need to continue to do whatever we can&quot; before the Nov. 4 election, Mr. Ravenstahl told the group. &quot;You all will make the difference.&quot;</span></p>
