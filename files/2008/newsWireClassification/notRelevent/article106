  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wes who?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He ran in the 2004 Democratic presidential primaries, and pundits discussed him as having a serious shot in that crowded field. Some even said he was their man - a blunt-talking four-star general who presided over a victorious humanitarian intervention.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In 2008, however, Gen. Wesley Clark is persona non grata at the Democratic National Convention.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I was told by General Clark's personal office in Little Rock that he would not be attending. Clark was informed by Barack Obama's people that there was no reason to come. General Clark has been given no role of any kind at the convention,&quot; Steve Clemons writes at the Washington Note (www.thewashingtonnote.com) before going on to note a particularly pointed slap.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Rubbing salt in the wound even more, the 'theme' of Wednesday's Democratic convention agenda is 'Securing America.' Wesley Clark's PAC also happens to be called Securing America.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Conservative blogger Sister Toldjah recalled Gen. Clark's penchant for foot-in-mouth disease, citing his famous dis of Sen. John McCain that &quot;I don't think ... getting shot down is a qualification to become president&quot; and linking back to a post detailing much, much more</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I honestly don't blame the Obama campaign for telling him he wasn't needed at the convention. ... I wouldn't want him speaking at the GOP convention, either, even if he was a Democrat who had decided to support McCain,&quot; she wrote at her site</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(http://sistertoldjah.com/).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Be afraid, Austria</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Self-described Cranky Conservative (http://crankycon.politicalbear.com/) Paul Zummo knows the meaning of &quot;schadenfreude.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I have to admit that I get a certain amount of pleasure observing the sheer moonbattery of some elements of the unhinged left. There isn't a conspiracy theory too crazy to be left off the table,&quot; he writes before launching into a &quot;fisk&quot; of Robert Scheer's article on the Nation Web site titled &quot;Georgia War: A Neocon Election Ploy?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the article (www.thenation .com), Mr. Scheer goes beyond merely noting (as cited here last week) that Randy Scheunemann, a top McCain aide, has been a lobbyist for the government of Georgia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That fact becomes Exhibit A in his case that &quot;the neocons&quot; engineered the war to create an early &quot;October surprise,&quot; a &quot;garbage issue&quot; to aid Sen. John McCain and continue feeding the military-industrial complex. He calls it &quot;inconceivable&quot; that Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili would start a war &quot;without some assurance from influential Americans he trusted, like Scheunemann, that the United States would have his back.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Zummo laughs at such a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; about evil neocons, noting that arming Georgia and pushing for its NATO membership was the public policy of the actual, sitting U.S. government - more obvious and important surely than sympathy from a senator who may (or may not) become president in January, never mind one adviser to that man. Besides, he wrote, &quot;do you really think the leader of a country is going to risk being invaded by a much larger force based on the conjecture that he will receive some vague kind of assistance?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the high point was this Scheer smear of Georgia: &quot;How convenient to forget that [Josef] Stalin was a Georgian, and indeed, if Russian troops had occupied the threatened Georgian town of Gori, they would have found a museum still honoring their local boy ... Indeed, five Russian bombs reportedly were dropped on Gori's Stalin Square</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">on Tuesday&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Zummo drew an analogy between Stalin and his sometime ally and role model, Adolf Hitler: &quot;How can we possibly dare accuse the Russians of being imperialist when it's the other guy's country that bred - over a century ago - a mass murdering tyrant? Surely it's not in the Russian DNA to be tyrannical. Based on this logic, I guess Germany has carte blanche to invade Austria. Be afraid Austria, be very afraid.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Silent running</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As Moe Lane at RedState (www.redstate.com) put it: &quot;How do we know that [Sen. John] McCain won the Saddleback forum?: Because his opponent's people are apparently claiming that McCain cheated, that's how.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Saddleback Church pastor the Rev. Rick Warren asked the same questions of both men in back-to-back one-hour question-and-answer sessions. Because whoever went second could have up to an hour to mull over an answer and prepare for an awkward question, the candidates were required not to listen in, and Mr. Warren said during Saturday night's event that Mr. McCain was in a &quot;cone of silence.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">However, in an interview Sunday on CNN, linked to by a score of liberal blogs, Mr. Warren acknowledged that Mr. McCain was not in the church for the first half-hour of Mr. Obama's session but was in a Secret Service motorcade on his way there.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Warren told CNN's Rick Sanchez that the &quot;no listening&quot; rule was given to both campaigns before either knew who would go first. Before Mr. McCain went on, &quot;we asked them, did you hear&quot; anything, and the McCain team denied it, Mr. Warren said, adding: &quot;I trust the integrity&quot; of both men.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The liberal netroots do not trust the integrity of John McCain (understatement).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The honor system, are you kidding me?&quot; says furiousxxgeorge at Daily Kos (www.dailykos.com). GottaLaff at Political Carnival (http://thepoliticalcarnival.blogspot.com ) writes: &quot;straight-talking P.O.W.s and pastors don't lie. And the audience didn't pay $2,000 to clap extra loud in support of their guy. And Orange County, CA ... isn't skewed Republican either All in all, this was a fair and balanced forum, wouldn't you agree?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The McCain campaign denied any cheating to both CNN and the New York TImes. An Obama spokesperson told CNN's Political Ticker (http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/) that the Illinois senator's campaign is not pursuing the matter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cross crossed</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some in the liberal blogosphere are accusing Republican presidential candidate John McCain of making up the &quot;cross in the dirt&quot; story, which the Arizona senator told again at Saturday night's forum at Mr. Warren's Saddleback Church.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Andrew Sullivan said he has &quot;now heard it countless times. McCain has used what appears to be an intensely personal moment in a prison camp as a reason to vote for him in a campaign ad. As he tells it [Saturday], it was the pivotal moment in his struggle to survive in the Hanoi Hilton.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;And yet, in his first thorough account of his time in captivity, in 1973, the story is absent,&quot; Mr. Sullivan writes, linking to a 17-Web-page first-person account Mr. McCain gave to U.S. News &amp; World Report shortly after he arrived back in the United States.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At his Atlantic blog (http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/), Mr. Sullivan also links to a Daily Kos piece by RickRocket, titled &quot; 'Cross in the Dirt' story stolen from [Aleksandr] Solzhenitsyn.&quot; Both accounts center on communist guards drawing crosses in the dirt as a secret sign of sympathy for an inmate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">RickRocket further notes that the Solzhenitsyn account was in &quot;The Gulag Archipelago,&quot; which was published in the U.S. the same year Mr. McCain arrived back from captivity and that Mr. McCain frequently expressed admiration for Mr. Solzhenitsyn.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Sullivan would only go so far as to say &quot;the story is also hauntingly like that recounted by Solzhenitsyn.&quot; Yet he concludes his post with: &quot;I have one simple question: when was the first time that McCain told this story?&quot;</span></p>
