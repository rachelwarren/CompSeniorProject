  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Surrounded by an enormous, adoring crowd, Sen. Barack Obama promised a clean break from the &quot;broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush&quot; on Thursday night as he embarked on the final lap of his bid to become president of the United States.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;America, now is not the time for small plans,&quot; the 47-year-old Illinois senator told an estimated 84,000 people packed into Invesco Field at Mile High, a stadium backdropped by the Rocky Mountains.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He vowed to cut taxes for nearly all working-class families, end the war in Iraq and break America's dependence on Mideast oil. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;For the sake of our economy, our security and the future of our</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">planet,&quot; he said, &quot;I will set a clear goal as president: In 10 years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By contrast, he said, &quot;John McCain has voted with President Bush 90 percent of the time,&quot; an indictment of his Republican rival - on health care, education, the economy and more.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change,&quot; Obama said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;America, we are better than these last eight years,&quot; he said. &quot;We are a better country than this.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's speech came on a night that offered a reminder of the historic nature of his candidacy: 45 years to the day after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech in Washington.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama is the first African American to be nominated for the White House by a major party, a fact that, for all its significance, has been barely mentioned over the course of this four-day gathering.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Even in invoking the anniversary of the King speech, Obama only alluded to race.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things,&quot; he said. &quot;They could've heard words of anger and discord. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked. That together, our dreams can be one.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Campaigning as an advocate of a new kind of politics, he suggested at least some common ground was possible on abortion, gun control, immigration and gay marriage.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama delivered his 44-minute nomination acceptance speech in an unrivaled convention setting before a crowd of unrivaled size - the filled stadium, the camera flashes in the night, the made-for-television backdrop that suggested the White House, and the thousands of convention delegates seated around the podium in an enormous semicircle.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama and his running mate, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, leave their convention city today for Pennsylvania, the first stop on an eight-week sprint to Election Day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain countered with a move of his own, hoping to steal some of the political spotlight by spreading word that he had settled on a vice presidential running mate. Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty canceled all scheduled appearances for the next two days, stoking speculation that he was the one.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democratic Rep. John Lewis of Georgia spoke first of the anniversary of King's memorable speech.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in Denver because we still have a dream,&quot; said the lawmaker, who marched with King, supported Obama's primary rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton, then switched under pressure from younger black leaders in his home state and elsewhere.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's aides were interested in a different historical parallel from King - Obama was the first to deliver an outdoor convention acceptance speech since John F. Kennedy did so at the Los Angeles Coliseum in 1960.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In his speech, Obama pledged to jettison Bush's economic policy and replace it with his own, designed to help hard-pressed families.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The speech didn't mention it, but Obama has called for raising taxes on upper-income Americans to help pay for expanded health care and other domestic programs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He did not say precisely what he meant by breaking the country's dependence on Mideast oil, only that Washington has been talking about doing it for 30 years &quot;and John McCain has been there for 26 of them.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His pledge to end the war in Iraq responsibly was straight from his daily campaign speeches.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts. But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons,&quot; he added.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As he does often while campaigning, Obama also paid tribute to McCain's heroism - the 72-year-old Arizona senator was a prisoner of war in Vietnam - then assailed him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Sen. McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush was right more than 90 percent of the time?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Speaking earlier in the night, former Vice President Al Gore picked up on the same theme. &quot;If you like the Bush-Cheney approach, John McCain's your man. If you want change, then vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The much-discussed stage built for the program was evocative of the West Wing at the White House, with 24 American flags serving as a backdrop. A blue-carpeted runway jutted out toward the infield, and convention delegates ringed the podium. Thousands more sat in stands around the rim of the field.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The wrap-up to the party convention blended old-fashioned speechmaking, Hollywood-quality stagecraft and innovative, Internet-age politics.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The list of entertainers included Sheryl Crow, Stevie Wonder and Will.i.am, whose Web video built around Obama's &quot;Yes, we can&quot; rallying cry quickly went viral during last winter's primaries.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a bid to extend the convention's reach, Obama's campaign decided to turn tens of thousands of partisans in the stands into instant political organizers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They were encouraged to use their cell phones to send text messages to friends as well as to call thousands of unregistered voters from lists developed by the campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In all, Obama's high command said it had identified 55 million unregistered voters across the country, about 8.1 million of them black, about 8 million Hispanic and 7.5 million between the ages of 18 and 24.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Those are key target groups for Obama as he bids to break into the all-white line of U.S. presidents and at the same time restore Democrats to the White House for the first time in eight years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Democratic man of the hour paid a brief visit to members of his home-state Illinois delegation before the curtain went up on his show.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot; I had this speech tonight. I wanted to practice it out on you guys, see if it worked on a friendly audience,&quot; he joked.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There was no joking about the stakes in the speech, a once-in-a-campaign opportunity to speak to millions of voters who have yet to make up their minds between McCain and him. The polls show a close race nationally, with more than enough battleground states tight enough to tip the election either way.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's hopes of victory rely on holding on to the large Democratic base states such as California, New York, Michigan and his own Illinois, while eating into territory that voted for George W. Bush. Ohio tops that list, and Democrats have also targeted Montana, North Dakota, Virginia and New Mexico, among others, as they try to expand their Electoral College map.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Biden, was frank about the Democrats' chances in an appearance before one state's delegation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This is not hyperbole: We cannot win without Pennsylvania,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Polling shows the race for that state's 21 electoral votes close. Both the two previous Democratic candidates, Al Gore and John Kerry carried Pennsylvania over Bush.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Biden, who was born in Scranton, Pa., and represents a state that shares a border with Pennsylvania, is expected to spend large amounts of time campaigning in the state over the next several weeks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain was in Ohio as Obama spoke, and after a series of sharply negative convention-week television commercials, his campaign aired a one-night advertisement that complimented Obama and noted that the speech occurred on the anniversary of King's famous address.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Sen. Obama, this is truly a good day for America. Too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed. So I wanted to stop and say, 'Congratulations,'\&quot; McCain says in the ad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;How perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day. Tomorrow, we'll be back at it. But tonight, senator, job well done.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This story was compiled from reports by The Associated Press, The New York Times and McClatchy News Service.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">foreign oil</span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I will set a clear goal as president: In 10 years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.&quot; the war in Iraq</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I will end this war in Iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan.&quot; health care</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves.&quot; jobs in the U.S.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.&quot; Kaine's time in the spotlight</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On &quot;The Daily Show,&quot; in interviews with Newsweek, the BBC and CBS, and on the convention stage - this week, the Virginia governor is all over the national scene.</span></p>
