  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sep. 9--They have little in common: One is a man, a Democrat, someone who's spent most of his life in national public service. The other is a woman, a Republican, who's had no political experience outside of being a mayor of a small town and who's served less than two years as governor of her home state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They're Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, and one will end up a heartbeat away from the presidency after Nov. 4.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both parties insist they've chosen the right person for the job, despite inconsistencies in their party's message. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Democrats are running on a platform of change, yet nominated a lifetime politician. After railing against the Democrats, saying Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., didn't have the experience to be commander-in-chief, the Republicans nominated a 44-year-old who's had less experience than other potential Republican nominees, a virtual political unknown.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So who's the most fit to serve as second in command? The Daily Press conducted an online, informal poll, asking readers -- based on what they know so far, and trying to set aside feelings about the presidential nominees -- which of the vice presidential nominees they view most favorably.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Poll results indicated that of 101 respondents, 56.49 percent prefer Palin, while 40.41 percent believe Biden would be the best choice.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While the online poll indicated Palin as the favorite, some in the area are not convinced she's qualified to do the job, including longtime Tahlequah resident Jeannette Wilson.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The job of vice president is to work with the president to reach policy goals,&quot; said Wilson. &quot;I feel Joe Biden is by far the superior of the two choices. Sarah Palin does not seem to have the foundation to reach this goal. She seems to have taken her NRA membership as a license to shoot off her mouth.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wilson pointed out the vice president is but one heartbeat away from the presidency, and said this means the person must have the knowledge to deal with economic issues, foreign policy and domestic policy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's no secret Biden has a long history of foreign policy experience, and has served as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin appears to think that a trip to the 'lower 48' qualifies as a foreign trip,&quot; said Wilson. &quot;Biden has worked with economic issues and policy in his state as well as the Senate. Palin touts the energy production of Alaska. If she works so well with these companies, why is most of the North Slope oil being sold to China and not the U.S.? I feel the United States would be more secure and safer with a Biden as VP than with a Palin.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">NSU Professor of Communication Studies and Mass Communication Dr. David Scott believes if Biden and Palin were running at the top of the ticket, the race wouldn't even be close.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Biden is much better prepared for the presidency,&quot; he said. &quot;It is interesting to note that Palin's profile most closely fits Spiro Agnew's experience upon being nominated for the VP slot.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Scott said Agnew was also a two-year governor from a small state, and that both attacked the media as being &quot;liberal,&quot; making abrasive speeches that pleased the right wing of the Republican party.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It is interesting to note that a bipartisan Alaska State Senate Legislative Counsel Committee is currently investigating claims that Palin abused her office to get the Alaska Public Safety commissioner fired because he refused to dismiss her ex-brother-in-law who served as a state trooper,&quot; said Scott. &quot;Agnew ultimately had to resign as VP as a result of ethics violations from his years as a Maryland politician.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Indeed, some of Palin's actions as an elected official have come under fire recently. In a report by the Associated Press, some of Palin's remarks during her acceptance speech were &quot;fact-checked&quot; and revealed she had been less than truthful.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin said she worked to &quot;end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress,&quot; and had told Congress &quot;thanks but no thanks for that Bridge to Nowhere.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But according to the AP, when Palin served as mayor of Wasilla, she hired a lobbyist and traveled to Washington annually to support earmarks for the town totaling $27 million. Alaska has requested nearly $750 million in special federal spending, by far the largest per-capita request in the nation. As for the &quot;Bridge to Nowhere,&quot; Palin only opposed the proposal after the plan was ridiculed in the national media.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin's personal life has also garnered close scrutiny after she announced her 17-year-old daughter, Bristol, is unmarried and five months pregnant.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Another report by Time magazine pointed out that while Palin was running for mayor of Wasilla -- a historically non-partisan position -- the state Republican party came in and worked to see that she was elected. Palin ran on standard Republican issues, including gun owners' rights and opposition to abortion.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After being elected to the mayoral position, Palin dismissed almost all the city department heads who had been loyal to her predecessor, some of whom had worked to get her elected. There was, at one point, talk of a recall, but Palin's opponents in the city council eventually opted to reconcile.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin also inquired about having books banned from the local library, saying some had &quot;inappropriate language&quot; in them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A recent poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports indicates 51 percent of people believe the media is being too harsh with Palin. Scott believes personal concerns shouldn't enter into the political debate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think the media's focus on Palin's family issues was inappropriate,&quot; he said. &quot;Barack Obama has clearly stated the Palin kids should be 'off-limits' in terms of media attention.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">NSU English Professor Dr. Sharon Winn doesn't necessarily agree.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I don't think the media has been too hard on Palin,&quot; she said. &quot;That's what you get when you step into the national spotlight, especially as a complete unknown.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Other polls indicate the Republicans were harsher than Democrats during speeches given at the convention, and Palin has been labeled the party's &quot;pit bull.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fritz Laux, associate professor of business administration at NSU, believes Republicans are more frank and direct in their message.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;You might say the Republicans have been 'harder' in their attacks on Democrats, but I'd put it differently,&quot; said Laux. &quot;I'd say the Republicans -- talking more specifically about McCain and Palin versus Obama and Biden -- simple spoke more directly and plainly. This may look 'harder,' but I don't believe it is. Repeating ad nauseum that McCain would be a third term of the Bush administration is clearly not true; you can check the DNA. Thus, it's just mush. The Republicans have been telling the truth about Obama and Biden, and that has a sharper and harder impact.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Laux views the Democrats' attacks as &quot;dishonest and cheap,&quot; which, in his opinion, may render them less effective.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The Republican attacks may seem harder, but this is only because they are more effective,&quot; he said. &quot;They're more effective simply because they are honest. Learning to know that truth and to be honest takes hard work and discipline. It's not as easy to do as people think. The honest person can speak with a moral authority and force that's hard to imitate.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Despite her party affiliation as a Democrat, Winn believes Palin is an effective speaker, and looks forward to the vice presidential debates. She watched both Biden's and Palin's acceptance speeches during the conventions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I thought both did well, though Palin was really good,&quot; said Winn. &quot;She's poised and confident and can tell a joke. I noted the Republicans joked a lot more than the Democrats, probably because their convention was after the Democratic convention, which gave their writers grist for jokes. I didn't necessarily believe Palin, but she's a formidable speaker.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Isabel Baker, delegate to the Democratic convention, pointed out that Palin failed to talk about several issues of concern: &quot;I have a lot of respect for Gov. Palin, but did you notice in her speech that she mentioned nothing about the economy, health care, protecting Social Security, national security, education for all of our children or taking care of our veterans and their families?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Regardless of their personal feelings, all those interviewed indicated they plan to watch the debate. Some said it may be the most-watched debate in political history.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Scott, as a former debate coach for NSU, believes the debate process has been watered down over the years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think Biden is the better debater; however, the ground rules for today's broadcast political debates are designed to limit exchanges between the candidates and extensive questioning by reporters,&quot; he said. &quot;Today's debates are more of a battle of memorable sound bites. In that context, Palin could very well 'win' the debate.&quot;</span></p>
