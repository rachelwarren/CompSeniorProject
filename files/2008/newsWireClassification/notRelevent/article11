  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">COLUMBUS, Ohio</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain and Barack Obama uncorked massive get-out-the-vote operations in more than a dozen battleground states Sunday, millions of telephone calls, mailings and door-knockings in a frenzied, fitting climax to a record-shattering $1 billion campaign. Together, they'll spend about $8 per presidential vote.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With just two days to go, most national polls show Obama ahead of McCain. State surveys suggest the Democrat's path to the requisite 270 electoral votes - and perhaps far beyond - is much easier to navigate than McCain's. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama exuded confidence.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The last couple of days, I've been just feeling good,&quot; he told 80,000 gathered to hear him - and singer Bruce Springsteen - in Cleveland. &quot;The crowds seem to grow and everybody's got a smile on their face. You start thinking that maybe we might be able to win an election on November 4th.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Peterborough, N.H., McCain held his final town hall-style event in the state that put him on the national map in 2000 and launched his GOP primary comeback eight years later.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I come to the people of New Hampshire to ask them to let me go on one more mission,&quot; said McCain, who is looking for an upset victory against Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Polls show the six closest states are Florida, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Nevada and Ohio. All were won by Bush and made competitive by Obama's record-shattering fundraising. The campaigns also are running aggressive ground games elsewhere, including Iowa, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Colorado and Virginia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">All that's left now for the candidates is to make sure people vote Tuesday - if they haven't already.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Indeed, Election Day is becoming a misnomer. About 27 million absentee and early votes were cast in 30 states as of Saturday night, more than ever. Democrats outnumbered Republicans in pre-Election Day voting in key states.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That has Democrats - and even some Republicans - privately questioning whether McCain can overtake Obama, even if GOP loyalists turn out in droves on Tuesday. Obama may already have too big of a head start in critical states like Nevada and Iowa, which Bush won four years ago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As the campaign closes, voters were being inundated with a crush of television ads and automated phone calls.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a new TV ad, Obama highlighted Vice President Dick Cheney's support for McCain. The ad features Cheney, an unpopular figure among many in the public, at an event Saturday in Wyoming, saying: &quot;I'm delighted to support John McCain.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Not to be outdone, the Republican National Committee rolled out battleground phone calls that include Hillary Rodham Clinton's criticism of Obama during the Democratic primary. She is heard saying: &quot;In the White House, there is no time for speeches and on-the-job training. Sen. McCain will bring a lifetime of experience to the campaign, and Sen. Obama will bring a speech that he gave in 2002.&quot; A Clinton spokeswoman said she disapproves of the ad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Another phone call to Pennsylvania and Ohio voters takes Obama's words about coal-burning technology out of context and claims he will &quot;bankrupt the coal industry.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Pennsylvania GOP also unveiled a TV ad featuring Obama's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, declaring &quot;God damn America!&quot; in a sermon .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama and McCain campaigned on each other's turf Sunday. Obama was in Ohio, a bellwether state Bush won four years ago and where polls show Obama tied or winning. McCain visited Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, states won by Democrat John Kerry in 2004. He trails in both.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain and the Republican National Committee dramatically ramped up their spending in the campaign's final days and now are matching Obama&nbsp;ad for ad, if not exceeding him, in key battleground markets in states such as Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Together, the two presidential candidates have amassed nearly $1 billion - a stratospheric number in a campaign of record-shattering money numbers. Depending on turnout, $1 billion means nearly $8 for every presidential vote, compared with $5.50 in 2004.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And that's just McCain and Obama. All the presidential candidates in the 2007- 08 contest took in $1.55 billion, nearly twice the amount collected by candidates in 2004 and three times the amount from 2000. The total includes fundraising for the primaries as well as the general election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Using all that cash, the candidates have traveled more miles, employed more workers and advertised more than ever.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After months of planning, the Republican Party launched the last stage of its vaunted &quot;72-hour program,&quot; when volunteers descend on competitive states for the final stretch. Democrats unleashed their &quot;persuasion army&quot; of backers scouring their own backyards to encourage people to back Obama in the campaign's waning hours.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The RNC reported making 5.4 million voter contacts last week, compared with 1.9 million in the same week in 2004, and it says its volume has steadily increased since October began. Overall, it says 26 million voters have been contacted by volunteers over four months. On Saturday alone, the RNC said, an estimated 3 million voters were contacted by phone or in person.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain planned visits to battlegrounds Florida, Indiana, New Mexico and Nevada today. A repeat trip to Pennsylvania also was slated before McCain returns home to Arizona.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama planned visits to Virginia, North Carolina and Florida today and a quick stop in Indiana on Tuesday morning.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">record numbers</span><br /></p>
