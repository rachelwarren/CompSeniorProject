  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">America's just fine</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">RE &quot;NO SPITTING,&quot; punditry, Aug. 24, by Karen Heller:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Not all of us join in the popular disrespecting and loathing of our current president and vice president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">America is still great.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We have been safe at home since 9/11.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There is prosperity and security. Just visit a restaurant or shopping mall and watch families spending money happily. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gas was about $2.50 when the Democrats took over Congress.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Perhaps we should be wary of the cry for change. Frankly, Sen. Obama's idea for change terrifies me.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">America has been, and still is, just fine, thank you.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And thank you, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney -- very much!</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Just say no to hot dogs</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As a dietitian with the nonprofit organization that produced the provocative &quot;Protect Our Kids&quot; anti-hot dog TV commercial, I think Americans deserve to know about the compelling scientific evidence linking processed meat consumption to increased risk of colorectal cancer A landmark report released late last year by the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund concluded that no amount of processed meat is considered safe to eat; ideally, it should be completely avoided. After reviewing 58 large scientific studies, researchers with the two cancer organizations concluded that processed meats increase one's risk of colorectal cancer by 21 percent for every 50 grams of processed meat consumed daily (a 50-gram serving is about the size of a typical hot dog).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As with all carcinogens, longer exposure likely means greater risk. That's why it's so important to get hot dogs and other processed meats out of the school lunch line and help kids develop healthy eating habits that can protect them from cancer later in life. Teaching kids about good nutrition sets the stage for healthy eating habits down the road and can help prevent heart disease, obesity and other diet-related diseases as they grow older.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bill of Rights rebuttal</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re &quot;Try Frederick at home,&quot; letter, Sept. 9:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The writer clearly has no grasp of legal concepts. He accuses the prosecutor of not having any regard for the Bill of Rights, one presumes, because Ryan Frederick is charged with using a firearm in the commission of killing a law enforcement officer. I guess the writer believes that you have a Second Amendment right to shoot your gun at the police as long as you do it from the comfort of your own home.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He also condemns Frederick's no-bond status as a violation under the Eighth Amendment, which it is not. Perhaps he thinks society is better protected when those charged with the most serious of crimes are allowed out on bond. Next, he stated, &quot;A normal search using a regular warrant would have turned up the same evidence.&quot; But police obtained a search warrant, the only warrant available to the police for this type of action.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Finally, his reliance on the text of the Sixth Amendment is one-sided. Both sides are entitled to a fair trial. No one seems to have much difficulty with the issue when the defense wants to move a trial, but if prosecutors ask for the same opportunity, they are demonized.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We are all waiting for the details of this night to come out completely. They will at Frederick's trial. Until then, those who have marched in support of Frederick may want to wait and save themselves a lot of embarrassment.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Race shouldn't matter</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">One of your readers wrote that Barack Obama is not African American (&quot;Historic hype,&quot; letter, Sept. 6). He also stated that Obama and his campaign are deceiving the American people in an effort to &quot;garner the African American vote.&quot; We know that Obama is not African American by definition, but he is, and will always be, a black man!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I would like to think that voters aren't ignorant enough to pick a candidate based simply on his racial makeup. But then again, this country was built on racist principles and has a long way to go in destroying the evils of discrimination. We must work together to bring about change that benefits Americans of all racial backgrounds.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While I am proud that Obama is a black man who may become president (I am African American), I am voting for the candidate whom I feel is the best choice to take charge of our country. He could be white, black, yellow, red or green, so long as he keeps America's democracy, growth and development in his sights.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">An old Chinese proverb says, &quot;No matter if it is a white cat or a black cat; as long as it can catch mice, it is a good cat.&quot; This should be the sentiment of American voters who truly care about this country's future.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thank you for the article, &quot;On the road less traveled: They crisscross Iraq, escorting cargo and scouring for threats. Every day brings a sense of purpose. Every mission is a gamble.&quot; (Daily Break, Sept. 7).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am First Sgt. Kevin Wood's wife. Our soldiers are a great bunch of hometown boys, and they all appreciate everyone who recognizes their hard work and sacrifices. As do all soldiers and families who serve with them.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pilot doesn't speak for me</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Your editorial on Sept. 6, &quot;Looking for answers on John McCain,&quot; stated the GOP &quot;put on a tired show of anti-media anger, economic entitlement and us-versus-them retrenchment.&quot; Amazing! According to Nielsen Media Research, 34.5 million viewers over three days watched this &quot;tired show&quot; compared to the 30.2 million viewers who watched the Democratic speakers and fireworks over four days.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Furthermore, you stated that Americans worry that McCain has disavowed his principles. What Americans are you speaking for? The ones on your staff who write these inane editorials and back a loser every four years or the ones who read The Pilot because it's the only paper in town? Get past your liberal biases and find out what people really think before you try to speak for them.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shouldn't we all just possibly realize the time has come that we do not need the most experienced candidate this time, but perhaps maybe the smartest?</span></p>
