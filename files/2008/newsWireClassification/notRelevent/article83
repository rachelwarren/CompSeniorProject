  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain has shown creativity and drive in his desire to solve energy problems for America. During his many years in the House and Senate, Mr. McCain has seen the U.S. struggle to wean itself from foreign oil as an energy source. He has created a plan for cleaner and new sources of energy. Mr. McCain knows the problems America's dependency on foreign oil entails. He is not naive about the need for new sources, and the staggering pain of energy costs for Americans. He understands how quickly the complex issues around energy can be solved. Mr. McCain has embraced the opportunities provided through developing new sources of energy in nuclear power, wind, hydro, solar, clean coal, untapped sources of natural gas and expanding domestic oil. He has specifically embraced the need for nuclear energy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. McCain was far ahead of the Democrats on this issue by putting it in his platform from the beginning. Early on in the campaign, Mr. Obama stayed away from even mentioning nuclear energy, primarily due to the complaints from the party's more liberal environmentalist base. If the liberal French can use nuclear energy in an environmentally friendly way, so can we. In fact, France has 59 nuclear power plants, according to the European Nuclear Society. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama has now included nuclear energy in his platform. Yet he also talks about how he worked on legislation in 2005 for nuclear energy waste-disposal regulation in the senate. The problem is that Mr. Obama has sided with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who has discounted Yucca Mountain as a possible site for nuclear waste, but has yet to name any alternative site for such use. He also discusses regulation that would have to be enacted pursuant to the development of more nuclear-energy plants.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">One-third of our oil comes from the Middle East and another third from our friendly neighbors such as Canada and Mexico. Mr. McCain has pointed out that American dollars for oil from the Middle East essentially support terrorists and dictators who threaten American peace. Mr. McCain supports offshore drilling, which would help reduce a 41 percent trade deficit from oil imports, grant access to billions of barrels of domestic oil, keep more American dollars in America and make the United States more energy independent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Then there is the issue of offshore drilling, and Mr. McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who supports drilling on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) - which has remained untapped due to environmentalist protests. Mrs. Palin has also advocated a $40 billion natural-gas pipeline to link Alaska to the lower 48 states. She strongly advocates the need for America to be energy independent. Although, Mrs. Palin does not always agree with Mr. McCain, who voted against drilling on ANWR, the two have agreed on twin common goals of energy independence and energy security.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Additionally, Mr. McCain plans to build a pipeline infrastructure so that we can use the 77 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) which will lower energy prices. Barack Obama does not plan to allow drilling in the OCS. And Mr. McCain will provide incentives for research and development so that plug-in hybrid and full electric automobiles become a viable commercial option. Electric and hybrid cars are also cleaner and better for the environment. Automakers will be provided with a $5,000 tax credit for each zero-emissions car that is sold.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. McCain would halt subsidies for corn-based ethanol. Research and development for market-based clear alternative fuels - solar, hydro and wind - will be encouraged by a system of tax credits that eventually will become a viable part of the marketplace.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Moreover, the federal government, which is the largest electricity consumer on Earth, will be subject to stricter regulations to save taxpayer money. Mr. McCain has no plans for a state run energy system, unlike Mr. Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We believe, a McCain-Palin administration would aggressively pursue every avenue for increased energy production while balancing a more common-sense approach to protect the environment. Mr. McCain and Mrs. Palin understand the need for cheaper, more efficient energy and the importance of free-market solutions to get us there. Mr. Obama has yet to give such an approach a full-throated endorsement.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. McCain has named his comprehensive energy plan the Lexington Project after the Massachusetts town where Americans historically asserted their independence. &quot;In a world of hostile and unstable suppliers of oil, this nation will achieve strategic independence by 2025,&quot; said Mr. McCain during a campaign speech. His assertion is correct, America must become energy independent.</span></p>
