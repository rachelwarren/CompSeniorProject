  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Republican presidential candidate John McCain yesterday blamed Wall Street's financial turmoil on unchecked corporate greed. His Democratic opponent, Barack Obama, dismissed McCain's call for a high-level commission to study the economic crisis as &quot;passing the buck.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The presidential campaigns argued over who would be better able to deal with the kinds of financial meltdowns that roiled the markets Monday and to prevent a similar crisis in the future. McCain proposed a review on the order of the one led by the Sept. 11 commission, the bipartisan panel that studied the events leading to the 2001 terrorist attacks. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;We need a 9/11 commission,&quot; McCain said yesterday on NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show. &quot;We need a commission to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it and I know we can do that and I'll do it.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama, campaigning in Golden, Colo., accused McCain of failing to offer concrete plans for dealing with economic issues.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Sen. McCain offered up the oldest Washington stunt in the book. You pass the buck to a commission to study the problem,&quot; Obama said. &quot;This isn't 9/11. We know how we got into this mess. What we need now is leadership that gets us out. I'll provide it. John McCain won't. And that's the choice for Americans in this election.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama continued to criticize McCain's remark Monday that &quot;the fundamentals of our economy are strong.&quot; In a television ad released yesterday, Obama's campaign asks: &quot;How can John McCain fix our economy if he doesn't understand it's broken?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> On Monday, a few hours after the remark about strong economic fundamentals, McCain backtracked and declared the economy to be in crisis. He also said that American workers and products - the &quot;fundamentals&quot; he claimed he was referring to earlier - were indeed sound but faced danger from greed and corruption.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In spite of a speedy rhetorical reversal, the Arizona senator was widely criticized for offering a seemingly upbeat outlook while the stock market was on its way to a loss of 500-plus points and new troubles arose for investment banks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> New Virginia poll: A new poll has the presidential race in Virginia tied.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Fox News/Rasmussen Reports telephone survey finds Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama each attracting 48 percent in the state. The poll a week ago showed McCain with a modest lead of 2 percentage points.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The poll of 500 likely voters was taken Sunday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Like another poll by Survey USA, the Fox News poll showed McCain's choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate did not have an impact in Virginia. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Bid to block Palin probe: Five Republican Alaska lawmakers filed suit yesterday to end the bipartisan investigation into Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's firing of the public safety commissioner, even though McCain's vice presidential candidate once said she welcomed the probe into allegations of abuse of power.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The lawsuit called the investigation &quot;unlawful, biased, partial and partisan.&quot; None of the lawmakers who filed the suit in Anchorage Superior Court serves on the bipartisan Legislative Council that unanimously approved the investigation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Palin fired public safety commissioner Walt Monegan in July. Weeks later, it emerged that Palin, her husband, Todd, and several high-level staffers had contacted Monegan about state trooper Mike Wooten, who had gone through a nasty divorce from Palin's sister before Palin became governor. While Monegan says no one from the administration ever told him directly to fire Wooten, he says their repeated contacts made it clear they wanted Wooten gone.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Palin maintains that she fired Monegan over budget disagreements, not because he wouldn't dismiss her ex-brother-in-law. &quot;Hold me accountable,&quot; said told investigators in July. McCain campaign spokesman Ed O'Callaghan now calls the investigation &quot;tainted.&quot;</span></p>
