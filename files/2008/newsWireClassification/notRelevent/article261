  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The government's planned takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, expected to be announced as early as this weekend, came together hurriedly after advisers poring over the companies' books for the Treasury Department concluded that Freddie's accounting methods had overstated its capital cushion, according to regulatory officials briefed on the matter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The proposal to place both mortgage giants, which own or back $5.3 trillion in mortgages, into a government-run conservatorship also grew out of deep concern among foreign investors that the companies' debt might not be repaid. Falling home prices, which are expected to lead to more defaults among the mortgages held or guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie, contributed to the urgency, regulators said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The details of the deal have not fully emerged, but it appears that investors who own the companies' common stock will be virtually wiped out; preferred shareholders, who have priority over other shareholders, may also end up with little. Holders of debt, including many foreign central banks, are expected to receive government backing. Top executives of both companies will be pushed out, according to those briefed on the plan.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While it is not yet possible to calculate the cost of the government's intervention, it could rise into tens of billions of dollars and will probably be among the most expensive rescues ever financed by taxpayers. The takeover comes on the heels of a rescue of the investment bank Bear Stearns, which was sold to JPMorgan Chase in a deal backed by taxpayer dollars. Already, the housing crisis has cost investors and consumers hundreds of billions of dollars.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both presidential nominees expressed support for the government's plans to take over the companies as necessary. Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., said as he campaigned in Indiana that not acting could place the housing market in further distress. &quot;These entities are so big and they are so tied into the housing market that it is probably true that we have to take steps to make sure they don't just collapse,&quot; Mr. Obama told an audience in Terre Haute yesterday. But he added that the government needed to take steps to guard against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ultimately profiting from the government assistance.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has long been critical of the mortgage finance giants. His running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, spoke out from a rally in Colorado Springs. &quot;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they've gotten too big and too expensive to the taxpayers,&quot; Ms. Palin said. &quot;The McCain-Palin administration will make them smaller and smarter and more effective for homeowners who need help.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The big question now is whether the federal government's move to take over Fannie and Freddie will restore investor confidence in the nation's credit markets, help stabilize the stock market and keep loans flowing to creditworthy borrowers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fannie and Freddie, by buying mortgages, provide banks and other financial institutions with fresh money to make new loans, a vital lubricant for the housing and credit markets.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As a result of the government's intervention, the cost of borrowing for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should decline, because the government will be insuring their debts. Equally important, because the government is backing the companies, they will continue to buy and sell home loans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the plan will probably do little to stop home prices from falling further. And foreclosures are almost certain to rise.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Just a week ago, Treasury officials were still considering a wide variety of options for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, ranging from doing nothing to taking over the companies completely, according to people with knowledge of those discussions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., who won authority from Congress last month to use taxpayer money to bolster the companies, always maintained that he hoped never to use that power. But, as the companies' stocks continued to languish and their borrowing costs rose, some within the Treasury Department began urging Paulson to intervene quickly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Then, last week, advisers from Morgan Stanley hired by the Treasury Department to scrutinize the companies came to a troubling conclusion: Freddie Mac's capital position was worse than initially imagined, according to people briefed on those findings. The company had made decisions that, while not necessarily in violation of accounting rules, had the effect of overstating the company's capital resources and financial stability.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Indeed, one person briefed on the company's finances said Freddie Mac had made accounting decisions that pushed losses into the future and postponed a capital shortfall until the fourth quarter of this year, which would not need to be disclosed until early 2009. Fannie Mae has used similar methods, but to a lesser degree, according to other people who have been briefed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Representatives of both companies did not return calls or declined to comment.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both companies have the option of challenging the conservatorship and asking for a judicial review.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Accusations of questionable accounting are not new for either company. Earlier this decade, both companies paid large fines and ousted their top executives after accounting scandals.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Freddie Mac's current chief executive and chairman, Richard F. Syron, joined the company in 2003 after the former managers revealed they had manipulated earnings by almost $5 billion. The following year Fannie Mae's chief executive, Daniel H. Mudd, was promoted to the top spot after that company was accused of accounting errors totaling $6.3 billion. People familiar with Treasury's plan say that both men, as well as other executives, will be forced to leave the companies.</span></p>
