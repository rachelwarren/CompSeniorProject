  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">DENVER -- On the eve of their national convention, Democrats appeared eager to woo a segment of the electorate more identified with the GOP in recent presidential elections: the God vote. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">More than 3,000 delegates, party officials and others participating in the Democratic National Convention assembled Sunday afternoon at the Colorado Convention Center for an interfaith worship service. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The service, including choirs singing hymns and spiritual leaders offering prayers from a variety of faiths -- Christian, Jewish, Islamic, Buddhist and others -- was touted as the first time an interfaith event kicked off the party's convention week. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's about time,&quot; said delegate Valerie McDonald Roberts, a former Pittsburgh city councilwoman and Allegheny County recorder of deeds, who attended the event. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It was a great event to kick things off, basically an invocation for the weeklong process of our convention that we are about to participate in,&quot; she said. &quot;Look, we are a big-tent party and that was one big tent in there. We had Buddhist and Jews, Catholics and evangelical Christians all talking quite frankly and respectfully about their role within the party.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The convention officially starts today as an estimated 50,000 delegates, visitors, politicians and journalists converge for the first formal session from 3 to 9 p.m. Opening hoopla gives way to business sessions and caucus meetings throughout the day, while nightly sessions allotted for prime-time speeches will build to a climax on Thursday with Sen. Barack Obama's acceptance speech. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama, the first black person to be nominated for president by a major party, is scheduled to accept the nomination before a crowd of 75,000 at Invesco at Mile High Stadium. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, hoping to unite the Democratic Party and cement her future in it, will gather her hard-won primary delegates Wednesday at a reception where she is expected to formally release them to Obama. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clinton has invited her pledged delegates to a reception at the Colorado Convention Center, not far from the main Democratic National Convention arena. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The high-profile gathering of political regulars who once fought against Obama serves a dual purpose for Clinton: Show fellow Democrats that she can be a team player and display her still formidable political strengths for the future. Many of her supporters want her to run for president again. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some Clinton delegates still plan to vote for her at the convention, even if she releases them. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This is much bigger than Hillary,&quot; said Pam Durham, a Clinton delegate from Fort Worth, Texas. &quot;I have a responsibility. I do not own my vote. I have to represent the voters who sent me.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pittsburgh City Council President Doug Shields, a delegate and Obama supporter, said it's appropriate for the party to allow Clinton backers to express themselves. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Politically, it's a smart move,&quot; said Shields of Squirrel Hill. &quot;Democratic primaries are always hard fought. I think it's out of respect, and that's good.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, started a television ad suggesting Obama snubbed Clinton for the vice presidential spot because of her criticism of him during the Democratic primary fight. McCain's campaign hopes to persuade disenchanted Democrats who backed Clinton to vote for him in the Nov. 4 election. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clinton aides responded that she clearly supports Obama and agrees with him on important issues such as health care and the Iraq war, and doesn't agree with McCain on those issues. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter welcomed the crowd at the interfaith service, saying Democrats need to &quot;remind the rest of the country that in our party there is absolutely an intersection of faith and politics.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democratic strategist Dane Strother said the interfaith service event, called &quot;Faith in Action,&quot; sends an important signal. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We cannot cede the evangelical voter any longer,&quot; he said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Christian conservatives played a significant role in President George W. Bush's victories in 2000 and 2004. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The Democrats are doing a much more inclusive job this year in reaching out to people of faith,&quot; Strother said. &quot;And, we are showing much more respect beginning with the convention having the interfaith service and asking various religious leaders to give invocations at the convention.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Burns Strider, who was dubbed Hillary Clinton's &quot;Faith Guru,&quot; said the service inspired him. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The Democratic Party has allowed something extremely authentic and unusual to happen today: an event absent of sound bites and controlled message. What a breath of fresh air,&quot; said Strider, a consultant to politicians, businesses and nonprofits on faith issues. </span></p>
