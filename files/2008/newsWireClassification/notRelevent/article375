  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's husband has refused to testify in the investigation into whether his wife abused her power, and a key lawmaker said yesterday the probe is not likely to be completed before Election Day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Todd Palin was among 13 people subpoenaed by the Alaska Legislature. McCain-Palin presidential campaign spokesman Ed O'Callaghan said yesterday that Todd Palin would not appear, because he no longer believes the Legislature's investigation is legitimate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Sarah Palin initially welcomed the investigation of accusations that she dismissed the state's public safety commissioner because he refused to fire her former brother-in-law, a state trooper. But she increasingly has opposed it since Republican presidential nominee John McCain chose her as his running mate. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Earlier this week, Alaska Attorney General Talis Colberg said the governor, who was not subpoenaed, declined to participate in the investigation and said Palin administration employees who have been subpoenaed would not appear.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> State Sen. Bill Wielechowski, a Democrat, said the McCain campaign is doing all it can to prevent the Legislature from completing a report.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Wielechowski, a member of the panel that summoned the witnesses, told The Associated Press that the witnesses can avoid testifying for months without penalty and that court action to force them to appear sooner is unlikely.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Palin fired Walt Monegan in July. It later emerged that Palin, her husband, Todd, and several high-level staffers had contacted Monegan about state trooper Mike Wooten. Palin maintains she fired Monegan over budget disagreements and not because he wouldn't dismiss her former brother-in-law.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Wooten had gone through a nasty divorce from Palin's sister before Palin became governor. While Monegan says no one from the administration ever told him directly to fire Wooten, he says their repeated contacts made it clear they wanted Wooten gone.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain and Palin decided to go the extra 5 miles yesterday to see flood damage in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain and Palin had planned to stick to an airport rally on their way to Green Bay, Wis., where McCain had an interview scheduled with CBS-TV's &quot;60 Minutes.&quot; But local leaders grew upset that they had no plans to see the flood-damaged city.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> So the GOP duo went downtown, to see an estimated $1.3 billion in destruction lingering from June floods that swamped hundreds of city blocks and damaged thousands of homes and businesses. Many in the city say federal help has been slow; McCain and Palin agreed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;The role of government in America, I say as a fiscal conservative, is to help Americans in a time of disaster,&quot; McCain said. &quot;They have experienced a disaster, and our assistance is overdue.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden, campaigning in Ohio, said yesterday that paying higher taxes would be patriotic for wealthier Americans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In an interview on ABC's &quot;Good Morning America,&quot; Biden said wealthier taxpayers would pay more under the proposals of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama. Under that plan, people earning more than $250,000 would pay more in taxes while those earning less - the vast majority of taxpayers - would receive a tax cut, he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In a new TV ad that repeats widely debunked claims about the Democratic tax plan, the McCain campaign charges that Obama would enlarge the federal government amid an economic crisis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The first political event to feature Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sarah Palin now will have neither. Organizers of a rally next week in New York City against Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced yesterday that no politicians will appear.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The collection of American Jewish groups putting together the rally angered Clinton aides by not telling them they also planned to have Palin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Clinton backed out Tuesday, as soon as she learned of the pairing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The National Coalition to Stop Iran Now said yesterday they would have no &quot;American political personalities&quot; at the rally to keep the focus on Iranian threats.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Palin camp criticized Clinton for backing out, saying all parties should rally together in opposition to the threat posed by a nuclear Iran.</span></p>
