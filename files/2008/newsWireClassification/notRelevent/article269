  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Oct. 6--Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen. Joe Biden recently put his foot in his mouth in Ohio, contradicting Sen. Barack Obama's position on &quot;clean coal.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;No coal plants in America,&quot; he told a woman on a rope line at a campaign stop in Ohio. &quot;We're not supporting clean coal.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The campaign quickly got Biden back on track, which didn't stop John McCain from releasing a misleading ad claiming that Obama didn't support clean coal.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But maybe Obama should listen to Biden on this one. &quot;Clean coal&quot; is really an oxymoron. Coal is a dirty fuel, period. There is only so much that can be done to make it less polluting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clean-coal proponents are putting most of their bets on one technique -- carbon capture and sequestration. The idea of CCS is to capture the carbon dioxide emitted from burning coal and divert it either underground or into oceans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But that's a long way from being commercially viable, and the method poses long-term safety risks that should not be ignored.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The federal government is not doing its part to prepare for large-scale CCS, a recent Government Accountability Office report concluded. &quot;Federal agencies have begun to address some CCS barriers but have yet to comprehensively address the full range of issues that would require resolution for commercial-scale CCS deployment,&quot; the report stated.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">One issue that shouldn't be overlooked is safety. Massive amounts of carbon dioxide could be deadly if released.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In 1986, a huge cloud of CO2 erupted from a volcanic lake in Cameroon. CO2 is denser than air, so the 150-foot-thick, 14-mile-long cloud of concentrated gas stayed close to the ground as it flowed down the slope.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The cloud suffocated 1,700 people.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This was not a man-made catastrophe, of course. And no one knows why the CO2 erupted. But if CCS is going to have a measurable impact on the level of CO2 released into the atmosphere, billions of tons of the gas will need to be sequestered every year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Before that is allowed to happen, the coal power industry needs to demonstrate conclusively that doing so is safe.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The industry's intense interest in securing liability waivers for any CO2 mishaps, however, shouldn't fill anyone with confidence.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In addition to safety, there are cost issues. The carbon capture process is energy intensive, which means that much of the electricity generated by burning coal will be lost to capturing the carbon emissions. This could double the retail cost of electricity, according to a U.S. Department of Energy study.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Clean coal&quot; sounds good. But achieving that goal is a long, long way off, and many difficult issues need to be resolved before it will ever be feasible.</span></p>
