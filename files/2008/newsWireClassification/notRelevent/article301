  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">FOR A SECOND DAY, protesters from the group &quot;Re-create '68&quot; demonstrated against the Democrats' decision to cordon them off in a &quot;demonstration zone.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We're going to stay here for just a couple of minutes to state our disgust with this abomination, the way the city and Secret Service are tearing the Constitution of the United States to shreds and then we will leave,&quot; &quot;Re-create '68&quot; organizer Mark Cohen told the Associated Press yesterday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Why somebody would want to re-create '68 beats us. If it did happen, it would beat them, too.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In 1968, in what an investigative commission later called &quot;a police riot,&quot; hundreds of cops bashed in the heads of anti-Vietnam War and anti-establishment yippies and hippies at the Democratic convention in Chicago. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Denver group, unlike that in Chicago, is a smorgasbord of causes: anti-war and pro-environment, mixed in with black-flag-waving anarchists.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">One of the anarchists said he &quot;opposed all authority.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hey, been there, done that, got the bloody T-shirt.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c7">Hillary's harridans</span><span class="c2">Clout dispatched special correspondent </span><span class="c7">Yanik Ruiz-Ramon </span><span class="c2">to the protest zone yesterday and he found a gaggle of Republicans, of all things.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The GOPers were expressing their support for three </span><span class="c7">Hillary Clinton</span><span class="c2"> Democrats who said they were going to vote for presumptive Republican nominee</span><span class="c7"> John McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The three women were wearing T-shirts that read &quot;NO-bama.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Even though Clinton herself has urged support for Obama, Hillaryite </span><span class="c7">Robin Carlson </span><span class="c2">said, &quot;I refuse to be emotionally blackmailed to vote for a candidate.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Carlson and her group marched down 16th Street to Union Station, where MSNBC was taping &quot;Hardball with </span><span class="c7">Chris Matthews</span><span class="c2">.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">During commercial breaks, Ruiz-Ramon told us, &quot;A tall blond producer was waving her arms trying to get more passion&quot; from the group.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We always thought that TV is just supposed to cover the stuff. Was Matthews waving a black flag off camera?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c7">Kenney: Biden made time</span><span class="c2">It was fall 1974. President </span><span class="c7">Gerald Ford</span><span class="c2"> had just pardoned </span><span class="c7">Richard Nixon </span><span class="c2">for crimes committed in the Watergate scandal.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A young attorney from Delaware, </span><span class="c7">Joe Biden</span><span class="c2">, was in his first term as a U.S. senator. And 15-year-old </span><span class="c7">Jimmy Kenney</span><span class="c2"> had a paper due.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The future city councilman, then a sophomore at St. Joe's Prep, called Biden's office and asked for an interview. Kenney was surprised at how quickly Biden's staff put it together. The young man was instructed to take the train to Washington, D.C., to meet the new senator on the platform.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Together, they rode a northbound train back to Wilmington, with Kenney asking questions and Biden giving answers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kenney doesn't recall the grade he got on the paper - &quot;An A or a B-plus, I think.&quot; But he does remember the lesson. When a student contacts him for a school project, Kenney makes the time to help out. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It just always inspired me that a person at that level would make time for me,&quot; Kenney said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c7">Narberth kid makes good</span><span class="c2">Denver Mayor </span><span class="c7">John Hickenlooper</span><span class="c2"> kicked off the convention by welcoming delegates to his city.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This makes us proud 'cause Hickenlooper is a Main Line kid who grew up in Narberth and Wynnewood, and graduated from the Haverford School in 1970.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">How did he get to Denver? Practice, practice, practice.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Actually, it was his career as an exploration geologist.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the late 1980s, however, he switched to a more Philly-style business: He opened a brewpub.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c7">Denver: Different century </span><span class="c2">It was exactly 100 years ago that the Democrats last held their convention in Denver.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some things haven't changed since 1908: Nominee </span><span class="c7">William Jennings Bryan</span><span class="c2"> called the Republicans &quot;the party of privilege.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But other things have changed: Although Bryan was progressive on labor issues and foreign policy, he refused to consider a civil-rights plank in the platform.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In fact, Bryan, fearful of losing votes in the segregationist South, would not even allow the platform to include a denunciation of lynching. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c7">Michelle: Soccer mom?</span><span class="c2">Last February, Clout said </span><span class="c7">Michelle Obama's</span><span class="c2"> style reminded us of </span><span class="c7">Jackie Kennedy</span><span class="c2">.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Last night, not so much. No pearls, for one thing. And that teal dress. Talbots?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We checked in with our style expert, </span><span class="c10">Daily News </span><span class="c2">columnist </span><span class="c7">Jenice Armstrong</span><span class="c2">, to find out if we were missing something.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;She talked the soccer-mom talk, but didn't look the soccer-mom part,&quot; Armstrong told us.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The dress was indeed &quot;simple and understated,&quot; Armstrong said, &quot;but do you think she looks like a soccer mom?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Well, she looks more like a sophisticated Harvard-trained lawyer to us, but what do we know?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Democrats' plan was to introduce Michelle as a down-to-earth Everymom. In that department it was her daughters who carried the day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The interaction between Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, and their mom after her speech did more to create the image the Dems sought than anything Michelle said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Nothing says it more than when she brought those girls out,&quot; Armstrong said. &quot;How beautiful.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now if only their dad could figure out the difference between St. Louis and Kansas City.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c7">Best of the blogs</span><span class="c2">When Democratic veep pick </span><span class="c7">Joe Biden </span><span class="c2">gets up there and talks poignantly about the typical American family sitting around the kitchen table late at night worrying how to pay its bills, and then twists the dagger on John McCain's &quot;seven kitchen tables,&quot; it's a great line politically, but . . . </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">An article in the </span><span class="c10">New York Times </span><span class="c2">makes it out to be something of a crock, because of Biden's long record of backing the Delaware-centric credit-card industry, especially the former MBNA Corp., which hired the senator's son </span><span class="c7">Hunter Biden</span><span class="c2"> for a lucrative lobbying gig.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In 2005, Biden helped win passage of a conservative, anti-working-class bill that made life a lot harder for that struggling family that he depicted at that kitchen table.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">- Will Bunch's Daily News blog Attytood, ( www.attytood.com) </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Talk about a full house! The Dems are said to be salivating at the possibility of a </span><span class="c7">John </span><span class="c7">McCain</span><span class="c7">-Mitt Romney</span><span class="c2"> ticket, as the two families apparently own 12 houses worth about $35 million.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;As the presidential campaign turns increasingly personal and the new Obama-Biden ticket strikes a decidedly more populist tone, Democrats believe a McCain-Romney ticket would provide a near-perfect frame for their class-conscious message.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It will be a contest, they'll say, between the son of a single mother and son of a car salesman against the son of an admiral and son of a governor.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">- Jonathan Martin blogging at the Politico, ( www.politico.com ) </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For many in Denver, the only story is whether Obama and Clinton can get along:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;And even those who are not passionately committed to one side or the other are trying to figure out why Obama didn't just go through the motions of vetting Clinton [for the vice presidency]. Tell her that she was high on the list and go through the entire process. It wouldn't have been true, and Clinton probably would have known it wasn't true, but what could she have done? As it turned out, since Obama blew her off, she can now claim that she was disrespected in all this.&quot;</span></p>
