  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sep. 7--Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's rise might show that for women, there's still a ways to go.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the shadow of her historic nomination as the second woman named to a major-party ticket, mixed reactions swirl. The topic is dish for everyone from 20-somethings in wine bars to stay-at-home mommy bloggers who are talking about politics instead of potty-training tips.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The conversations go far beyond Palin's impact on the presidential race, which in Virginia is not yet clear eight weeks before Election Day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Politically tinged reactions to Palin reflect something of a role reversal. Some liberal moms question the repercussions of this mother of five taking on such a demanding role, while socially conservative moms defend her ability to have it all and do it well. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But even the most ideologically disparate women agree that whether a parent can attend to family and also have a role on the world stage shouldn't be an issue for a woman if it isn't for a man.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think it's extremely unfair that they even bring it up. They never bring that sort of thing up with a man,&quot; said Vicki Garcia, a stay-at-home mother of three in New Kent County who runs a business out of her home with her husband.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Garcia sees Palin, 44, as a strong woman and role model for young girls, and she thinks Palin's husband, Todd, seems perfectly capable of keeping the family's domestic life moving.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I'm a home-school, conservative mother. You maybe wouldn't hear that [support for Palin] from most home-school moms who stay home with their kids, but it's balance,&quot; she said. &quot;It's almost an insult to [Todd Palin] to act like he can't help manage things.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mary M. Middleton, an independent voter from Henrico County, raised four children while teaching college. She's thrilled with Palin as a vice presidential candidate and thinks the scrutiny Palin is facing about how she would fare as a mother if elected is &quot;horrendous and outrageous.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Middleton said it's an insult to fathers such as her husband, and to Sens. Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden Jr., the dads on the Democratic ticket who have not been dragged into the same debate about making it all work.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sandy Fowler-Jones, a public-relations director and Richmond resident, said questions about the mother's balancing act are still part of breaking the glass ceiling.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It wasn't that long ago women were discriminated against in the workplace when they got pregnant,&quot; she said. &quot;We're still making progress in that arena.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fowler-Jones said she's most interested in whether Palin has the experience and leadership skills to be the second-in-command. &quot;The fact that she's a mother is a moot point,&quot; she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Margaret A. Dessypris Thomas is considering starting a family, and the balance between Margaret-the-career-woman and Margaret-the-mom is high on her mind.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Henrico resident, who considers herself an independent, doesn't want to put aside the education she's earned to stay at home. She disagrees with Palin on social issues but also wonders how well Palin would manage family life and her job as vice president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The fact that she has five children, I wonder what kind of care she provides for them, what kind of quality of life,&quot; she said. &quot;She, to me, hasn't done a good job teaching [her 17-year-old daughter Bristol] about abstinence -- or about birth control -- because she's pregnant.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin could probably cover extra help at home with her vice-presidential paycheck, but to Dessypris Thomas, it's a matter of priorities.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;You can't do it all. You do need help, you do need support,&quot; she said. &quot;So are her children really going to know their mom on a personal level, or are they going to watch her on the TV all the time?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Many women agree that there is a double standard. And the debate has become so divisive that some women interviewed for this story indicated they had cautiously held back certain thoughts to seem as inoffensive as possible.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Blogs have become sounding boards on the subject, with mothers from Atlanta to Chicago prefacing posts with &quot;I usually don't write about politics but . . . &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A mother blogging in Atlanta said she worries that if Sen. John McCain wins and Palin makes it look easy to work a full-time job, then &quot;Palin's facade could be the ultimate disservice to working moms and a good excuse for her not-so-progressive boss to keep us right where we are today.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In April, according to a report in the Anchorage Daily News, Palin gave an address at an energy conference in Texas while having contractions. She returned to work three days after her youngest son, Trig, was born.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Becky Suder, a Richmond mother who works part time and is raising two children with her husband, thinks the Democratic and Republican parties are using parts of Palin's family story for their own benefit. She asks whether it is really Palin's ability to do it all that causes concern, or whether some just disagree with Palin's conservative values.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;That to me is amazing -- that's the point [either side is] going to take so they can further their party,&quot; said Suder, who blogs about parenting for inRich.com.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Suder likes the prospect of a woman as vice president, but she said &quot;it's almost demeaning&quot; to vote for a woman for the sake of it. One Times-Dispatch reader called that prospect &quot;pander gate.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In picking Palin, who opposes abortion and supports gun rights, analysts say McCain hoped to energize the Republican base while potentially picking up some of the disaffected supporters of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was bested by Obama in the Democratic primary campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some Democrats have criticized McCain for what they considered his pandering to Clinton's 18 million supporters in the primaries. Palin quickly reached out to Clinton's voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When McCain introduced his running mate Aug. 29 in Dayton, Ohio, Palin said: &quot;It was rightly noted in Denver [at the Democratic convention] that Hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest, hardest glass ceiling in America. But it turns out the women of America aren't finished yet, and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So far, polls and interviews with Clinton supporters indicate that Palin's addition to the GOP ticket could attract a nominal portion of the Clinton backers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's support among Clinton backers increased after the Democratic convention, a week in which the party emphasized unity. At the convention, Clinton moved for Obama to be nominated by acclamation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The percentage of former Clinton supporters who say they will vote for Obama jumped to 81 percent after the convention from 70 percent before it, according to a Sept. 2 Gallup Poll of 1,835 registered voters nationwide. The poll has a margin of error of 2 percentage points.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some party loyalists, like Hazel Rigby, don't want just any woman. They want Hillary.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rigby, a retired veteran Alexandria public schools teacher who hopes to see a woman president before she dies, is so supportive of Clinton that she wants it chiseled into her tombstone.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rigby, who attended the Democratic convention, says the addition of Palin to the Republican ticket doesn't woo her. It offends her.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We're not that stupid,&quot; she said. &quot;My feeling is most women who would be inclined to vote for a woman, or Hillary especially, would not be attracted to that ticket at all.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin's largely conservative views are opposite of everything Clinton's supporters fought for, Rigby said. She said Palin supports teaching creationism alongside evolution in schools and thinks abortion should be illegal, except to save the mother's life. And Rigby said she's seen footage of Palin, a hunter who heads the Alaska National Guard, &quot;at least three or four times pointing a gun right at the [TV] screen.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I will not support her,&quot; she said. &quot;I can't find one issue she and I can agree on other than taking care of our own children.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Terry Holland, a Clinton supporter in Williamsburg, said McCain's selection of Palin inspired her to volunteer for Obama's campaign. She said she was &quot;incensed and insulted&quot; that McCain thought he could replace her vote for one woman with a vote for another.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;That was the straw that broke the camel's back,&quot; she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Middleton, the mother and college professor, said McCain's choice of Palin was not pandering but an example of the maverick in McCain. Selecting someone like former Mass. Gov. Mitt Romney, who ran for the GOP's presidential nomination, would have been more of a pander to the Republican base, she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Palin pick &quot;was a real swing for the fences, I thought,&quot; she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Political scientists in Virginia say it's too soon to know what kind of effect Palin will have on the fight for the state's 13 electoral votes. Palin was little known to much of the country a little more than a week ago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Independent voters are one group to watch in Virginia for potential Republican gains, along with female evangelical voters, said Quentin Kidd, a political scientist at Christopher Newport University. Virginia is known nationally to be among 10 states where evangelical voters make a difference in elections, he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Until the selection of Palin, pundits had suggested that newly registered and previously disengaged young voters and African-American voters could be a major factor this November, and polls show those group are largely left-leaning. But an energized conservative base and potential pickups among independents could help McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kidd said there is a chance, however, that Palin could widen the typical gender gap, in which more men favor Republicans and more women back Democrats. She could, for example, drive away some independent female voters who support abortion rights.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fowler-Jones said the Palin nomination shows that women are not a monolithic group.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We are extremely diverse and we respond to different things. She does seem to resonate with a certain group of women,&quot; she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Once the country recovers from the initial shock of Palin's rise from virtual unknown to vice-presidential nominee, voters will figure out how she represents issues that are important to them, she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;People who might be in the middle may be waiting to hear [the Oct. 2 vice presidential] debate so that they can get a better feel for who she is.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Virginia's Feb. 12 Democratic presidential primary, 60 percent of female voters supported Obama and 39 percent backed Clinton. Of independents who voted in that primary, 30 percent backed Clinton and 69 percent backed Obama, according to exit polls reported by CNN.com.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Susan Foster, a Chesterfield County mother of four, including twin daughters with Down syndrome, is attracted to Palin partly because she wants an advocate in Washington for people with disabilities. The Palins' infant, Trig, has Down syndrome.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Foster thinks Palin would likely get more help for her children in Washington than in Alaska.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And she noted that Todd Palin, a commercial fisherman who also works as a production operator in the oil fields, seems to help.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Families who live public lives such as actors and politicians have access to many more resources and much more professional help than other families,&quot; she said. &quot;There are many families in America who have both parents working full time without these options.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kathleen Levenston, a working mom in the Richmond area, doesn't identify with either political party. She's dismayed that the question of how well Palin could perform as a mom and a vice president even comes up.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I am not concerned about Palin's family constellation,&quot; she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I have plenty of concerns about the Republican platform, but I do not have an opinion about whether or not Mrs. Palin is doing a good job as a mother.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;She is a professional, and it is up to her to figure out a way to meet her responsibilities.&quot;</span></p>
