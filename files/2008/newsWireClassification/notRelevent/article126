  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Doctors should also have a 'choice' in participation</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">One would think the fundamental rights of conscience could be a common-ground First Amendment issue, yet anticipated Health and Human Services regulations to implement longstanding federal conscience-protection laws for health care workers have met with fierce debate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In her op-ed &quot;A harmful reversal&quot; (Aug. 3), Cristina Page of BirthControlWatch.org disparaged &quot;the few extremists [who] want to impose their deeply unpopular doctrine on the many.&quot; But the real question is: In opposing conscience protection, whose doctrine is being imposed on whom?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Pro-choice&quot; advocacy groups like BirthControlWatch.org and Planned Parenthood are &quot;pro-coercion&quot; in denying the rights of doctors and nurses to follow their own consciences. If abortion is a &quot;choice between a woman and her doctor,&quot; don't doctors have the right to choose not to participate? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Far from constraining women's choices, the regulations could broaden their access to options, as professionals would not be forced to leave the practice of medicine because of their moral and religious convictions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Health care professionals deserve protection from coerced participation in destroying nascent human lives. Secretary Michael Leavitt and the administration should be applauded for seeking to defend providers from such unjust discrimination.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A good column about a good company</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It was nice to see Shanna Flowers' column &quot;Farewell ad touts a bargain of a staff&quot; (Aug. 8). Flowers pointed out what thousands of longtime Roanoke Valley residents and Vinton Motors customers already know: Vinton Motors, a good valley business citizen, is the home of good people.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The company has always been a place to get a fair deal and excellent service. Good luck to owner Billy Vinyard and the entire staff. They will be missed.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Parenting column gives bad advice</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I have long taken issue with John Rosemond's Parenting column (Extra section). His responses inevitably devolve into repetitive rants about the 1960s, liberalism, self-expression and his favorite target, working mothers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He then waxes nostalgic about the 1950s, strictness and the virtues of his own mother. The decidedly political and misogynistic bent of his columns has no place in parenting advice.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His bizarre vitriol for all things related to the 1960s is unprofessional and tiresome, and the massive chip he carries on his shoulder can lead to terrible advice. In a recent column about misbehaving twins, Rosemond advocates group punishment. He cites his own first-grade class, in which the teacher used such a policy, resulting in the students &quot;policing one another.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">From my own experience, I can vouch for the fact that group punishment leads only to a resentful, toxic environment for both children and the authority. And I don't view vigilante children as an effective solution or as part of an ideal kindergarten class.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Furthermore, treating twins as one person guarantees problems. But Rosemond's fetish for authoritarianism practically guarantees unsound advice with a not-so-well-hidden agenda.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Editorial's claims defy belief</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: &quot;Oil on the campaign trail,&quot; Aug. 6 editorial:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barack Obama's statement that &quot;properly inflated tires and tuned-up engines could immediately save as much oil as offshore drilling would generate even at peak production in 20 years&quot; is beyond belief. In your haste to cover for this man's ignorance, you have also displayed your own.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Surely you cannot believe this, but you had to compound the problem by saying, &quot;He's wrong. Those simple steps would save even more, some analysts say.&quot; You owe it to your readers to print the names and credentials of your analysts or this is no longer ignorance. It is then deceit.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My analysts tell me that 80 percent of cars have properly inflated tires and, starting in the mid-'80s and totally since the mid-'90s, automobiles are continually being tuned for efficiency by their computers. Also, your statement that offshore drilling is &quot;risky and unproven&quot; is totally false. These are statements that come from talking points and not from a thinker.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If you love America, vote for Republicans</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republicans in Congress were trying recently to craft an energy bill that would allow oil exploration and drilling off America's coasts. This would have an almost immediate effect on bringing down gas prices. But Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi refused to let Republicans speak.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She ordered the lights and microphones turned off, and the Democrats left town for the scheduled five-week congressional vacation. We should remember this outrage on Election Day and realize the last thing America needs is more Democrats in Washington.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barack Obama, Mark Warner and Sam Rasoul might all be nice guys. But, in spite of what their slick advertisements say, if we send them to Washington, they will fall in line with their fellow Democrats.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Democratic Party is financial hostage to the environmental crazies who are keeping America from using its own resources; to the trial lawyers who tie our commerce and health care system in legal knots; and to the abortion and homosexual rights lobbies that are destroying the moral foundations of this country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If you care about the continued existence of America as a nation of liberty under law, then vote for John McCain, Bob Goodlatte and Jim Gilmore.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bubba gets a different take</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Readers' response to Barnie Day's &quot;Bubba's time has come&quot;( July 13 commentary) has been surprising to me. I interpreted Day's comments exactly the opposite -- I am not demeaning Bubba, but I do wish he could be more informed about who he is electing to run our country for the next four years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I felt that Day meant Bubba was more interested in the latest NASCAR race and whether Barack Obama wore a flag pin on his label and the fact that John McCain's old lady has a lot of money.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Our country is at a critical point, and if readers would just observe and listen to some of the comments made, they could see and hear firsthand who is electing our leaders. Day was pointing out that more citizens need to intelligently participate in the voting process and not leave it to the Bubbas to decide the fate of us all.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's rhetoric can't be serious</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Every day I hear or read, &quot;Do not drill offshore for oil&quot; and &quot;Put more air in your tires&quot; from Barack Obama. The only statement I have not heard as a solution to our country's health care problem is &quot;eat an apple a day,&quot; which is right up there with &quot;put more air in your tires.&quot; These solutions were not what the voters were promised at the start of this extra-long presidential race. Come on, fellows. Let's get real.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: George Kelly's Aug. 6 letter, &quot;Bush's Beijing visit is an insult to everyone&quot;:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I found he was lacking in his argument by not commenting on the U.S. Olympic team attending the event. Why did he not criticize our team for attending? Wouldn't that send a stronger message for protesting the Chinese stand on human rights issues?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">To those who think President Bush should not attend the Olympics, justify why the U.S. Olympic team should.</span></p>
