  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Barack Obama accepted his historic Democratic presidential nomination with soaring oratory that sought to identify his biography with the American dream and his campaign with a populist call to mend the American economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;America, we cannot turn back,&quot; Mr. Obama said at the end of his prime-time speech at Denver's Invesco Field, &quot;Not with so much work to be done.... At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As waves of cheers broke over a crowd of nearly 80,000, Mr. Obama's speech aimed to bind his life with the lives of struggling voters. At the same time, he and other Democratic speakers joined in portraying his Republican opponent, Sen. John McCain, as the unquestioning heir to the policies of an unpopular administration.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story -- of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to,&quot; he said, recalling the electrifying convention speech that made him a national figure even before he was elected to the U.S. Senate. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It is that promise that has always set this country apart -- that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After a summer of partisan debate on national security, Mr. Obama focused on the economy, arguing that Republican policies had failed to respond to crises in housing, health care and credit markets.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;America, we are better than these last eight years,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At times the stadium almost shook with the foot-stomping, roaring appreciation of the partisans who'd copped the toughest ticket in Denver.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less,&quot; he said at another point. &quot;More of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach. These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed presidency of George W. Bush.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With his speech, Mr. Obama finally took the full spotlight after a convention in which his unprecedented candidacy had competed for attention with Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the woman he had defeated in the longest and most expensive nomination fight in American political history.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Speaking earlier in the week, his wife, Michelle, called his march to the nomination an improbable story. Few would accuse her of hyperbole. Mr. Obama claimed his party's standard for the race against Mr. McCain after being raised in Hawaii and Indonesia by a single mother. He overcame much of his party's political establishment as he vanquished the wife of the last president of his party with a campaign that seized a message of hope and exploited the new tools of digital communication.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The setting and the scheduling evoked political history. The first African-American nominee of a major party spoke on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's &quot;I Have a Dream speech.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The outdoor setting, and even the Greek columns -- the object of immediate GOP ridicule as the &quot;Temple of Obama&quot; -- were reminiscent of the Los Angeles Coliseum address where President John F. Kennedy gave his acceptance speech in 1960.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alongside its uplifting notes, however, Mr. Obama's words included a flurry of criticisms of his opponent, whom he and other speakers cast as a born-again clone of President Bush.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Mr. McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush was right more than ninety percent of the time?&quot; Mr. Obama asked the crowd. &quot;I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Most prominent among a parade of speakers that preceded the nominee in the five-hour program was former Vice President Al Gore. The Nobel Prize winner alluded to his own bitter election experience to underline the stakes in November.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000, though it may be even more obvious now, because John McCain, a man who earned our respect on many levels, is now openly endorsing the policies of the Bush-Cheney White House and promising to actually continue them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The same policies all over again?&quot; the environmental activist demanded. &quot;Hey, I believe in recycling, but that's ridiculous.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Recognizing the power of the event, the GOP campaign took the unusual step of producing a rebuttal commercial featuring Mr. McCain that was to be broadcast in battleground states across the country. In terms of grabbing a share of national media attention, the rollout of Mr. McCain's vice presidential candidate today appeared calculated to compete with the roadblock coverage of the Obama speech. Calculated leaks reported that the Republican had informed his running mate of his choice sometime during the day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The afternoon preceding the main speakers included what one Obama aide called a &quot;a super, on-steroids voter registration camp.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">David Plouffe, the Obama campaign manager made the case that the venue was as much about grass-roots organizing as grand political stagecraft. He called on the swelling crowd to join in a campaign of voter outreach and registration from here to Election Day. Mr. Plouffe urged the crowd not to wait until they left the rally, urging them to make calls from their seats as the afternoon and evening wore on.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He cited Pennsylvania as a model of this kind of organizing, noting the state's significant gains in Democratic registration over the last year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Pennsylvania is now much harder for John McCain to win because of those registrations,&quot; he said. &quot;This election is in your hands, not mine, not anyone on the campaign staff, not the pundits, not the Democratic Party ... you need to own this campaign.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">More than an hour before the program began at 3 p.m. local time, a line of thousands of Democratic partisans snaked for nearly a mile from the stadium, inching its way toward the choke point of the magnetometer tents. Organizers passed out bottles of water as the line slowly made its way toward the stadium's gates.</span></p>
