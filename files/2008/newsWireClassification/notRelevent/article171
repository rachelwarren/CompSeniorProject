  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anti-growth tax plan</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">During the second presidential debate, the two candidates were asked about the effect of raising taxes on those whose earnings are above $250,000 and specifically small businesses.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Obama answered that only a handful would be adversely affected by his plan. This answer was far off the mark. Many small businesses are either limited liability corporations, S corporations or partnerships.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">All of these are taxed on their pro rata share of the company earnings in addition to their salaries, which often are modest. All of these companies depend on these profits for working capital, debt service and expansion so they can continue to grow, opening more locations and hiring more people. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">These are not rich people, although they are striving to succeed and to enjoy the fruits of our precious free enterprising system. His planned tax increase will surely serve to decrease the incentive for many young entrepreneurs as they purchase franchises with dreams of expansion, possibly a husband and wife hoping to open their second or third small restaurant, or even a small hardware store seeking another location.Such a plan will be a significant deterrent to growth.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democrat for McCain</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am a Democrat, and until now, have always been active in Democratic politics. I campaigned for and contributed generously to Mark Warner for governor and Jim Webb for the U.S. Senate, and I will vote for Mark Warner again this November. However, I am not voting for Barack Obama. Instead, I am actively campaigning for John McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am supporting Sen. McCain for two reasons. First, I have worked hard in building my own company, took significant risk and now employ more than 150 people.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama, a senator with a limited resume and someone who has never run a business, has decided that we should redistribute wealth away from people like me.Our economy cannot afford Obama as president. With Obama's certain tax hike, young entrepreneurs will do the math and decide the risk is greater than the reward. We can all say goodbye to future small business ventures.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Secondly, McCain is an independent thinker who has always and will always put our country ahead of himself and his political party. We know this because as a POW, John McCain refused early release from prison in North Vietnam to stay with his fellow soldiers. There is no better example of an American putting country first.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain reaches across the aisle to craft legislation that is best for all Americans, even when it wasn't politically expedient, or the popular thing to do.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Accepting Sam</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On March 5, 1999, in Virginia Beach, a boy was born to a white mother and an unknown black father. She gave him up, and we, who are white, adopted him. He has been ours since he was three days old. We have been blessed to have him as our son. He is absolutely beautiful, has a loving and compassionate spirit, and his smiles would rival the most brilliant sunrise. His name is Sam. So why is Barack Obama's run for the White House so important to us? In one word: Sam.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Unhealthy plan</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain's plan to tax employer-provided medical insurance will destroy one of the few functional elements of the health care system. Teachers, law enforcement officers, firefighters and military personnel are poorly compensated. One of the few benefits provided them tends to be good health care.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain wants to raise taxes on these already burdened and poorly compensated personnel, without whom we as a society would suffer. On top of this, McCain would slash Medicare and Medicaid.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It is bewildering that such plans could even be proposed, and it demonstrates that McCain is out of touch with the needs of normal American citizens.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fueling economic boom</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re &quot;Environmental issues are focus of forum,&quot; news, Oct. 8:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barack Obama's and John McCain's plans for fighting global warming are not &quot;pretty much the same.&quot; Obama's global-warming plan embraces future energy sources and the associated economic opportunities and &quot;green collar&quot; jobs. Obama has consistently voted for higher renewable-energy standards to ensure that 10 percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources by 2012 and 25 percent by 2025.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama will invest $150 billion over 10 years -- creating 5 million new jobs -- in developing and manufacturing new energy technologies. As president, Obama will partner with U.S. automakers to fast-track the development of high-mileage and advanced vehicles to ensure the cars of the future are built in America, not overseas.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In contrast, McCain voted against increasing fuel economy standards that would have saved Americans 2 billion gallons of gasoline costing $7 billion. He opposed tax rebates for purchasers of plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, while proposing to give $4 billion in tax breaks to oil companies. Finally, McCain has repeatedly voted against investing in and encouraging alternative and renewable energy sources like clean biofuels, solar power and wind power.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Drake should buy an ad</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re &quot;Drake criticizes ad saying she voted against vets' benefits,&quot; Hampton Roads, Oct. 2: So Rep. Thelma Drake claims that she is being unfairly treated in campaign ads by her opponent concerning her voting record. She is not unique in claiming unfairness. But when The Pilot publicizes her complaint as if it were news, doesn't that amount to political favoritism?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Her campaign should be required to explain her positions in paid advertising the same as any other candidate. Perhaps she could include an explanation as to why she supported the failed policies of the Bush administration about 95 percent of the time, even voting against Sen. Jim Webb's bill to expand GI Bill benefits for veterans of the Iraq war.</span></p>
