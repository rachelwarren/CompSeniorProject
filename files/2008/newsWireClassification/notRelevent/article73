  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WASHINGTON</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barack Obama spent 30 minutes and more than $4 million of prepaid television time Wednesday delivering his final introduction to the public.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Democratic presidential nominee capped the prime-time commercial with a live address from Sunrise, Fla., with an appeal for help and for votes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If you'll stand with me, and fight by my side, and cast your ballot for me, then I promise you, we will not just win Florida, we will win this election. And together we will change this country and change the world,&quot; he said . </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The commercial and his live remarks from a battleground in the presidential contest represented a return to the unifying themes of his speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention that launched him into national politics.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;In six days, we can choose hope over fear and unity over division, the promise of change over the power of the status quo,&quot; he said. &quot;In six days, we can come together as one nation, and one people, and once more choose our better history.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The spot was a mix of prerecorded Obama and voters, plus a live appearance from the campaign trail by the candidate. He offered prescriptions for an ailing economy and a rescue plan for a middle class caught in tough times.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I will not be a perfect president,&quot; Obama said. &quot;But I can promise you this - I will always tell you what I think and where I stand.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Aides described the unusual ad as a final summation of Obama's campaign. They put the total cost at roughly $4 million, enough to show it simultaneously on CBS, NBC and Fox. It also ran on BET, Univision, MSNBC and TV One.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The commercial included views of Obama speaking at the 2004 and 2008 Democratic conventions and elsewhere, as well as scenes of Americans discussing their economic and health care troubles, and testimonials to him by politicians and business executives.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama offered no new proposals in the ad. Instead, he stressed his plan to offer tax cuts to the middle class and &quot;restore the long-term health of our economy and our middle class.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama said the nation's neglected problems predate President Bush, but that the economic crisis was a &quot;final verdict on eight years of failed policies.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The video featured footage shot by Davis Guggenheim, the director and executive producer of former Vice President Al Gore's global warming documentary &quot;An Inconvenient Truth.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad did not appear on ABC because by the time the network decided to offer the time slot to Obama, his campaign had already finalized the ad buy, according to people familiar with the discussions .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Also Wednesday, Republicans John McCain and Sarah Palin accused the Los Angeles Times of protecting Obama by withholding a videotape of his attendance at a 2003 party for a Palestinian-American professor and critic of Israel.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The paper said it had written about the event in April and would not release the tape because of a promise to the source who provided it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain and Palin called Rashid Khalidi a former spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organization, a characterization Khalidi has denied .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Khalidi is a professor of Middle East Studies at Columbia University and a longtime friend of Obama's. Khalidi has publicly criticized Israel, but he and Obama have said they hold different opinions on Israeli issues.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">the commercial</span><br /></p>
