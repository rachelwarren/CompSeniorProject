  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Former House majority leader Richard K. Armey (R-Tex.), known for his opposition to higher taxes and earmarks, praised U.S. Senate candidate James S. Gilmore III in a conference call with Virginia reporters Tuesday. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Armey said the popularity of earmarks in Congress is &quot;so far out of control&quot; that only with determined opposition can members halt them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In recent weeks, Gilmore, a former governor, has come out against the $700 billion federal economic rescue package and earmarks. He signed a &quot;no earmarks&quot; pledge this week.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gilmore said that he opposed the bailout bill partly because it was filled with earmarks, including money for rum manufacturers and a company that makes wooden arrows. He said the practice of securing earmarks is open to &quot;fraud and abuse.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Armey is chairman of FreedomWorks, a group dedicated to &quot;lower taxes, less government and more freedom.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gilmore faces former governor Mark R. Warner (D) for the Senate seat being vacated by the retiring John W. Warner (R).</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Former governor Mark R. Warner will begin broadcasting new radio and television ads this week in his Senate race against former governor James S. Gilmore III.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The 30-second TV ad, called &quot;Fresh Approach,&quot; features Warner discussing the nation's economic crisis. A 60-second version will be broadcast on radio statewide.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;For too long, there were too many people both in Washington and on Wall Street asleep at the switch,&quot; Warner says in the ad. &quot;We need a fresh approach where we don't allow CEOs on Wall Street to walk away with millions of dollars while their companies go into the ditch. We've got to have leaders in Washington who put our country's interest first, not partisanship. That's what I'll do if you send me to Washington.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence announced Monday that it is endorsing Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Senators Obama and [Joseph] Biden know that we make it too easy for dangerous people to get dangerous weapons in this country,&quot; Brady President Paul Helmke said in a statement. &quot;They know that our weak gun laws have too many loopholes, which lead to over 30,000 deaths and 70,000 injuries from guns every year.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But in a state such as Virginia, which is home to the National Rifle Association and more than 1 million hunters, the endorsement carries considerable risk. The NRA, which has endorsed GOP nominee John McCain, is already running ads in Virginia noting that Obama once supported a ban on handguns in Chicago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And if Obama (D-Ill.) has made any gains in rural Virginia, it will be tempting for Republicans to use the Brady Campaign endorsement to undercut him on the gun issue.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">According to the Associated Press, Obama supported a ban on all forms of semiautomatic weapons and other restrictions on firearms when he was in the Illinois legislature. Obama now says he is a strong supporter of the Second Amendment and would not, as president, seek to interfere with an individual's right to own a gun for hunting and self-protection.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Donald Scoggins, a prominent African American Republican in Prince William County, condemned Virginia Republican Party Chairman Jeffrey M. Frederick on Monday for comparing Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) to Osama bin Laden.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Scoggins said that he's been involved in the Republican Party for 40 years and that Frederick's remarks are &quot;totally unacceptable.&quot; Scoggins once headed Republicans for Black Empowerment, which sought to recruit more African American Republicans to run for office.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;At this point in time, not just in Virginia, but all over, there needs to be a lowering of the decibel of hatred, and that was very much uncalled for,&quot; said Scoggins, who has been in touch with other GOP activists and leaders to discuss Frederick's remarks. &quot;For him to equate [Obama] with someone as vile and destructive as bin Laden is just very much beyond the pale.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Scoggins said Frederick's message runs counter to the platform he ran on this summer during his campaign to oust former lieutenant governor John H. Hager as party chairman. Frederick, who is Hispanic, vowed he would make the party more inclusive.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Scoggins said Frederick instead appears to be focused on &quot;appealing to a shrinking base.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;He can't get any more out of the base, so what he is doing is counterproductive,&quot; Scoggins said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Scoggins said he has never supported a Democratic presidential candidate. But he is not sure how he will vote this year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I am going to figure out who will be the best person for the country,&quot; Scoggins said. &quot;With the kind of talk Frederick did, that does not help blacks who would like to support McCain.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Frederick said he was making a joke. Chuck Smith, an African American who used to be chairman of the Virginia Beach Republican Party, rose to Frederick's defense.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It was an inappropriate statement and he shouldn't have made it, but was he calling Obama a terrorist? No,&quot; Smith said. &quot;Was he saying black people are terrorists? No.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Smith added: &quot;We as Republicans need to stand our ground and get away from the sense that if we attack Obama it is insensitive to the African American community. Obama is fair game for attacks. What Jeff was saying is his association with William Ayers is a basis from which he can be attacked.&quot;</span></p>
