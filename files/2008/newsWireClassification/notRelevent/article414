  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Inquirer's Jonathan Storm is reporting this week from the television critics press tour in Beverly Hills. These items originally appeared in his blog, &quot;From the Source,&quot; at www.philly.com/philly/blogs/from_the_source. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fox to try fewer commercials. Rejoice, rejoice, ye TV fans! Finally, there may be some medicine for the sickness you feel every few minutes when more ads roll around to destroy your shows. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fox boss Kevin Reilly confirmed yesterday afternoon that two eagerly awaited new fall shows, </span><span class="c10">Fringe</span><span class="c2"> from J.J. Abrams (</span><span class="c10">Alias</span><span class="c2">, </span><span class="c10">Lost</span><span class="c2">) and </span><span class="c10">Dollhouse</span><span class="c2"> from Joss Whedon (</span><span class="c10">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</span><span class="c2">), will run 50 minutes each week, about eight minutes longer than typical network dramas. Which means eight minutes fewer ads. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fox will pay a little more for those extra minutes, and advertisers - many have shown interest - will pay a premium to be featured far from the usual clutter. Fox hopes to come out about even, but it's certainly a bonanza for viewers. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's gotten to the point where you almost defy the audience to watch the commercials,&quot; Reilly told me. &quot;We can't keep whittling away until you wind up with the content filling just half the time.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Speaking to the TV critics en masse, Reilly also said: </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Fox is really excited about the two-hour </span><span class="c10">24</span><span class="c2"> &quot;prequel&quot; in November. It's a stand-alone movie sending Jack Bauer to South Africa, but it will set the stage for the show's seventh season, in which our fierce terrorism foe goes on trial for torture. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c10">The Simpsons</span><span class="c2"> is all set for its 21st season, and he would love to see it go on forever, &quot;but it won't.&quot; When the end comes, Fox will be ready to send it off properly and bring in something new. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Fox is &quot;not giving up&quot; on sitcoms, even though &quot;a lot of confidence has left the creative space.&quot; Writers are tentative and really don't know what to pitch, &quot;but we're going to really mix it up this year, and meet the writers on their own turf&quot; - whether that's in a restaurant, in their own house, wherever - rather than in &quot;the sterile space&quot; of Fox executive offices. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some stuffy critic asked Reilly why the network stood behind the skeevy </span><span class="c10">Moment of Truth</span><span class="c2"> show, in which people get money to reveal betrayals of family and friends. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hey, Reilly said. &quot;This is Fox.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c7">Quiet time with Karl.</span><span class="c2"> Former White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove spent a quiet 45 minutes with the TV critics yesterday afternoon. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Those expecting fireworks were disappointed as Rove acknowledged his Republican roots and John McCain contributions, said his refusal to acknowledge a congressional subpoena was between Congress and the White House, and told the critics they could read his book if they wanted to know whether he thought hiring Michael Brown as head of FEMA was a good idea. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rove, as you may know, now works as a political analyst for Fox News, and he was joined onstage by the network's latest hire, former Clinton campaign adviser Howard Wolfson, who acknowledged he was biased, too. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both said they would try to inform viewers, rather than shill for their respective parties. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rove got most of the questions. Nobody said, &quot;Awww,&quot; when he said his obsession with politics was &quot;a sad thing.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Like somebody who can name the starting lineup of the 1954 Cleveland Indians, I can give you precinct results,&quot; Rove lamented. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rove compared himself to the monster Grendel in </span><span class="c10">Beowulf</span><span class="c2">. No respect. &quot;A lot of people beat up on me. Who cares? I know who I am. I'm not the myth I've been developed into.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It was all very moderate, until anchor Chris Wallace accused the critics of having a double standard, asking Fox News mean questions they would never ask anybody else. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Baloney,&quot; and various other retorts, rumbled from the audience. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If Fox News came more often to the Television Critics Association Press Tour, Wallace might have a better idea of what goes on. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c7">Olbermann and O'Reilly: Good news at CNN.</span><span class="c2">CNN may not be knocking 'em dead, ratings-wise, weekdays at 8 p.m., but Phil Kent, chief executive officer at Turner Broadcasting, which owns the network, isn't shedding any tears. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I'm glad MSNBC hired Keith Olbermann,&quot; he said the other day. &quot;Now, people will have to stop screaming about how liberal we are.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While Olbermann rants from the left, and Fox News' Bill O'Reilly rails from the right, CNN sees itself comfortably in the middle, as the credible cable news network. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">CNN boss Jonathan Klein says his shop has embraced the &quot;post-partisan time where you've got lifelong Democrats who honestly don't know who they will, or should, vote for, and you've got diehard Republicans who see things in Barack Obama that they kind of like.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">CNN, he said, wants to provide them &quot;with the tools they need to make up their minds . . . Our competitors do the opposite. They're entrenched in calcified points of view, highly partisan . . . leaving the vast, open middle for us simply to provide the information.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But what about CNN's sister station, Headline News, with such crackpot, beyond biased characters as Nancy Grace and Glenn Beck? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;What?&quot; Kent responded. &quot;You don't like Glenn and Nancy?&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Uh, no. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c7">Jane Kaczmarek: Here comes the judge.</span><span class="c2"> From Mom in </span><span class="c10">Malcolm in the Middle</span><span class="c2"> to black robes and the bench, Jane Kaczmarek premieres on TNT on Labor Day in Steven Bochco's new legal drama, </span><span class="c10">Raising the Bar</span><span class="c2">. She plays an arrogant, and slightly crazy, judge. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Her </span><span class="c10">Malcolm</span><span class="c2"> costar, Bryan Cranston, has turned heads, starring in the AMC drama </span><span class="c10">Breaking Bad</span><span class="c2">, but it's a big change going from the 9-to-5 hours of toiling on a sitcom to the most demanding of the acting genres, TV drama, where the work can stretch to 16 hours, five days a week. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Bryan loves it,&quot; she said to me over cocktails. &quot;I love it every now and then.&quot; The veteran Bochco (</span><span class="c10">Hill Street Blues</span><span class="c2">, </span><span class="c10">L.A. Law</span><span class="c2">, </span><span class="c10">NYPD Blue</span><span class="c2">) has worked things out, devising a schedule that calls her to work only two days a week, so she can spend time with her three young children. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Following </span><span class="c10">Malcolm</span><span class="c2">, she had enjoyed doing just that fulltime - &quot;breakfast, bedtime and everything in between&quot; - but her agent talked her back to work. &quot; 'If you don't take a job soon,' she told me, 'you're going to stop being offered such great opportunities.' &quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This is Kaczmarek's second legal drama. </span><span class="c10">Equal Justice</span><span class="c2"> lasted a whole season in 1990-91. She got the part for that just as her pal, fellow Yale Drama School grad Chris Noth, was signing on to </span><span class="c10">Law &amp; Order</span><span class="c2">. &quot;I wished him a lot of luck, but I thought my show would last much longer than his,&quot; Jane said. </span></p>
