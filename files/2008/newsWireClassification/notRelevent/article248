  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Congress may not be in session, but that hasn't stopped Democratic leaders from convening hearings that highlight a staggering economy that is expected to pay dividends for them in the November elections.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rep. Henry A. Waxman of California, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, held two hearings this week intended to investigate the &quot;causes and effects&quot; of the financial crisis on Wall Street and has scheduled three more hearings leading up to Election Day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But Republicans are angered that mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose questionable lending practices lead to a government bailout last month, aren't even being addressed. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The two companies guarantee or own millions of mortgages issued to low-income families - a key Democratic voting bloc.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If Congress chooses to selectively examine the causes of this crisis by excluding the role that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac played, then this week's hearings will not be viewed as a serious effort, but rather a political charade,&quot; said Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for House Minority Whip Roy Blunt, Missouri Republican.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This week, Mr. Waxman chose to hold hearings on the failures of insurance giant American International Group (AIG) and Wall Street investment bank Lehman Brothers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Polls show that voters trust Democrats over Republicans to handle the nation's economy. Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential candidate, appears to have benefited with strong surges in several swing-state polls and national polling.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sixty-eight percent of voters are confident in Mr. Obama's ability to handle the financial crisis, 18 points ahead of his Republican rival, Sen. John McCain, and 42 points ahead of President Bush, a Monday CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll showed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democrats dismiss Republican accusations that they have ignored problems with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, saying the House under their leadership already passed reforms needed to oversee the mortgage giants, and that Republicans did nothing to reform the lenders when they controlled the House from 1995 to 2007.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Oversight is a primary responsibility of the Congress,&quot; said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat. &quot;Chairman Waxman's exemplary work will guide members on both sides of the aisle as Congress moves forward on reform.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The party in power historically has used the oversight committee against the minority party. Between 1997 and 2002, when Republicans controlled the House, the committee issued more than 1,000 subpoenas against the Clinton administration and the Democratic Party.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And Mr. Waxman is viewed by the right as no different.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Since taking control of Congress, the White House says Democrats have started nearly 700 investigations and held more than 1,300 oversight hearings.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rep. Brian P. Bilbray, California Republican and member of the oversight committee, has urged House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, Massachusetts Democrat, to immediately hold hearings on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's troubles.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;While the hearings we are holding in the [oversight committee] are instructive, we lack the jurisdiction to propose a package of reforms that are so clearly needed to address the failures of the market,&quot; wrote Mr. Bilbray in a letter sent Wednesday to Mr. Frank and Mrs. Pelosi.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A report on the causes of the financial crisis by Rep. Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the oversight committee, was released this week and called Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac &quot;the central cancer of the mortgage market, which has now metastasized into the current financial crisis.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Waxman has promised future hearings on Freddie Mae and Fannie Mac, although his office has said it's unlikely they will be scheduled before next month's elections.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democrats say a Sept. 25 House Financial Services Committee hearing already addressed the problems leading up to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's demise.</span></p>
