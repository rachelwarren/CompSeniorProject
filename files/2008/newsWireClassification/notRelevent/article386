  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">RALEIGH</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">All of a sudden, North Carolina matters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It hasn't for decades in presidential elections.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Then Democrat Barack Obama made an aggressive play for this traditionally GOP state and polls showed the race tightening. That forced Republican John McCain to defend his turf or risk ceding the Southern state - and its 15 electoral votes - to Democrats for the first time in 32 years. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now, seven weeks before the election, North Carolina has become a general-election battleground, one of 13 states where both candidates are competing with television commercials and campaign staff on the ground.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;They clearly see the threat,&quot; Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said after McCain's campaign intensified its efforts here.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Steve Schmidt, McCain's chief strategist, insists the campaign is unconcerned: &quot; John McCain will win North Carolina and soon you will see the Obama camp withdraw from North Carolina like you have seen them withdraw from other states.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Public polling shows a competitive race, though private surveys for both Republicans and Democrats give McCain an edge of anywhere from 3 to 8 percentage points.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A Time/CNN/Opinion Research Corp., poll released Wednesday showed the race virtually tied. Arizona Sen. McCain had 48 percent; Illinois Sen. Obama, 47 percent .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The challenge for Obama may have increased after McCain selected Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, a choice that has energized conservatives. At a recent Republican gathering in Cary for veterans, the mere mention of Palin's name drew thunderous applause while McCain's name elicited a tepid response.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I'm not that thrilled about McCain,&quot; said James Arscott, 66, a National Guard veteran and a Republican. &quot;That is, I wasn't thrilled about McCain until Sarah Palin came about.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Even Democratic loyalists say it is difficult to imagine North Carolina voting for Obama, who would be the country's first black president. &quot;I would be stunned,&quot; said Tim Rohde, a Democrat from Raleigh. &quot;But it would be amazing.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Look no further than the state's population spurt - and its origins - to understand why Obama thinks he has a shot this year, and why McCain isn't taking it for granted.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The state has seen steady growth over the past four years as transplants from the more liberal Northeast were drawn to the region for jobs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Voter registration rolls also illustrate the shifting tide.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">State Board of Elections records show that Democratic registrations have risen 7 percent since the start of 2008, while Republican registrations grew about 1 percent. There are now about 40 percent more Democrats than Republicans in North Carolina, although members of both state parties tend to be more conservative than their national counterparts. Registrations among blacks, a pivotal part of the Democratic base, are up almost 10 percent while white registrations are up 4 percent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The number of registrations for voters who don't claim a political party jumped 11 percent this year.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">Obama visit</span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michelle Obama will campaign today in Charlotte and Greensboro, campaign officials said. The appearances will be her first in North Carolina since May to campaign for her husband, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tickets are free but required for both events and can be picked up at Obama campaign offices in Greensboro, High Point and Charlotte.</span></p>
