  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">DENVER - Sen. Barack Obama, accepting the Democratic presidential nomination last night, sought in language by turn uplifting and scathing to frame the change he wants to bring to a nation whose promise, he said, is imperiled by &quot;broken politics.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;America, we are better than these last eight years,&quot; Obama declared amid the roar of 84,000 people jammed into a football stadium. &quot;This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama linked Republican candidate John McCain to George W. Bush's &quot;failed policies&quot; and questioned McCain's judgment on foreign affairs and national security.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Sen. McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time?&quot; Obama said. &quot;I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In a nation whose founders included slave owners, the first-term Illinois senator made history as the first African American nominated by a major political party. Adding to the resonance, he spoke on the 45th anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's Jr.'s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech - one in which people heard, Obama said, &quot;that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He spoke of his grandfather, a World War II veteran who went to college on the GI Bill; his grandmother, who rose from secretarial work to middle management; and his mother, a single parent who once turned to food stamps.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine,&quot; he said, alluding to McCain's ads comparing Obama to the likes of Paris Hilton. &quot;These are my heroes.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama spelled out specifics, promising to cut middle-class taxes, close loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas, end the &quot;oil addiction&quot; that makes the United States vulnerable to Middle Eastern instability, wind down the war in Iraq &quot;responsibly,&quot; and defend the nation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain remains more inflexible on the question of withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq than either that country's leaders or the Bush administration, Obama said, adding that the war has distracted from the pursuit of terrorists.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;That's not the judgment we need. That won't keep America safe,&quot; he said. &quot;We need a president who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And he declared that neither he nor his Republican rival should question the other's patriotism. &quot;I've got news for you, John McCain,&quot; Obama said. &quot;We all put our country first.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When Obama finished his 40-minute acceptance, flashbulbs ricocheted around Invesco Field at Mile High, the audience waved small flags, and fireworks burst over the stadium, the home of football's Denver Broncos. He was joined on stage by his running mate, Delaware Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., and their families, as confetti shot off by air cannon rained down upon them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Earlier, former Vice President Al Gore carried the theme of McCain as Bush III.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Hey, I believe in recycling, but that's ridiculous,&quot; Gore said, referring to McCain's support of tax cuts skewed toward the wealthy and an unwise war in Iraq.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;So why is this election so close?&quot; Gore asked. &quot;Well, I know something about close elections, so let me offer you my opinion: I believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change Barack Obama represents.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The stadium filled as the setting sun played on the distant Rocky Mountains. Thousands of people stood in lines that snaked through surrounding streets and over a bridge across Interstate 25, waiting up to two hours to clear security. Inside, they found a carnival atmosphere, more a concert interrupted by the occasional political speech than a convention. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Olympic gold-medal gymnast Shawn Johnson - a native of Iowa, the state that started Obama's rise with a caucus victory in January - opened the celebration by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Academy Award winner Jennifer Hudson belted out the national anthem.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama himself walked onto a stage flanked by Greek columns and jutting like a peninsula into the crowd at the 50-yard line. Republicans had mocked the setup as a pretentious &quot;Temple of Obama,&quot; continuing their attack line that he is a narcissistic celebrity.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Campaign officials said they wanted to open up the convention and believed that would help Obama carry Colorado, a closely contested state with nine electoral votes. The campaign wanted to turn the event into a &quot;working, organizing experience,&quot; spokesman Dan Pfeiffer told reporters in a conference call.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama was the first presidential candidate to make an acceptance speech outdoors since John F. Kennedy was nominated at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum 48 years ago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Before the speech, Obama and his advisers sought to downplay expectations, in the wake of attacks that he is prone to high-flown rhetoric without specifics. Some Democratic leaders have fretted in recent weeks as Obama's lead in the polls dwindled that he was not forceful enough in addressing GOP attacks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama took on that concern in his speech.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values,&quot; Obama said. &quot;And that's to be expected. Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters. If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama and Biden go to Beaver County, Pa., today to begin a bus tour that will continue into Ohio and Michigan.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As the Democrats closed down their four-day convention, suspense mounted on the the Republican side as McCain prepared to name his running mate today, ahead of next week's GOP convention in St. Paul, Minn. The unusual political split-screen moment had the potential to limit the traditional public-opinion &quot;bounce&quot; that Obama could expect from a successful convention.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain also appeared in a TV ad last night speaking directly into the camera to congratulate Obama on his historic achievement, a sharp departure from the harshly negative tone of the campaign in recent weeks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Senator Obama, this is truly a good day for America,&quot; McCain said in the ad. &quot;Tomorrow, we'll be back at it. But tonight, Senator, job well done.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Nevertheless, McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds issued a statement last night calling Obama's speech &quot;misleading&quot; and decrying his record as &quot;meager.&quot; &quot;The fact remains,&quot; Bounds said, &quot;Barack Obama is still not ready to be president.&quot;</span></p>
