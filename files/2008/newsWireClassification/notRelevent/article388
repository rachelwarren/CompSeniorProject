  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At the end of an increasingly contentious week of campaigning, Sen. John McCain yesterday denied that he was going negative against Sen. Barack Obama, even as his camp released a new Web ad that mockingly contrasts Mr. Obama's soaring rhetoric with clips of actor Charlton Heston playing Moses in &quot;The Ten Commandments.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Earlier this week, the McCain campaign unveiled an ad that compared the Illinois senator with celebrities Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. On Thursday, Mr. McCain and his campaign manager accused Mr. Obama of playing &quot;the race card&quot; by warning voters against attacks that he looks different from other presidents on U.S. currency. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I don't think it's negative,&quot; Mr. McCain said at a Panama City news conference. &quot;I think we're drawing the difference between us.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama campaign fired back quickly. &quot;It's downright sad that, on a day when we learned that 51,000 Americans lost their jobs, a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics,&quot; said spokesman Hari Sevugan.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The new McCain spot, entitled &quot;The One,&quot; opens in the manner of a Hollywood movie trailer, with a deep-voiced announcer declaring: &quot;In 2008, the world will be blessed. They will call him: The One.&quot; It then cuts to some of Mr. Obama's loftier moments -- his declaration that, &quot;We are the ones we have been waiting for,&quot; and his speech upon clinching the Democratic nomination promising, &quot;This was the moment when the rise of our oceans began to slow, and our planet began to heal.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Asked about the spot, Mr. McCain said, &quot;We're going to display a sense of humor in this campaign.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Late in the day, Mr. Obama dismissed his opponents' tactics. &quot;They're calling folks names like they used to do in fifth grade. You remember fifth grade? Calling each other names, and petty fights. We don't have time for that. That doesn't lower gas prices and secure people's jobs.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Earlier yesterday, Mr. Obama unveiled a $50 billion emergency economic stimulus. At a campaign stop in St. Petersburg, he called for energy rebates of as much as $1,000, five years of a windfall profits tax on oil companies and $25 billion to replenish the highway trust fund.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some of the elements of the plan were from Mr. Obama's prior proposals, but on the day the government announced that the unemployment rate hit 5.7 percent, a four-year high, the likely Democratic presidential candidate stepped up the stakes with the energy rebate, more details on the profits tax and the extra funds for highways.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This [energy] rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months,&quot; he said at a town hall meeting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Noting a headline in the morning's St. Petersburg Times that told of the first recessionary downturn in the state since 1991, Mr. Obama again linked Mr. McCain and President Bush, blaming both men for failing to aid Americans struggling with job loss and home foreclosures.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In an interview yesterday with The Palm Beach Post, Mr. Obama said he would be willing to support limited additional offshore oil drilling if that was what it took to enact a comprehensive policy to foster fuel-efficient autos and develop alternate energy sources.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shifting from his prior opposition to expanded offshore drilling, the Democrat said he could support a compromise with Republicans and oil companies to prevent gridlock over energy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. McCain, who earlier dropped his opposition to offshore drilling, has been criticizing Mr. Obama on the stump and in broadcast ads for clinging to his opposition as gasoline prices topped $4 a gallon. Polls indicate that those attacks have helped Mr. McCain gain ground on Mr. Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;My interest is in making sure we've got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;If, in order to get that passed, we have to compromise in terms of a careful, well thought-out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage -- I don't want to be so rigid that we can't get something done.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Asked about Mr. Obama's change of heart, Mr. McCain said: &quot;We need oil drilling, and we need it now offshore. He has consistently opposed it. He has opposed nuclear power. He has opposed reprocessing. He has opposed storage.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Republican said his rival doesn't have a plan equal to the nation's energy challenges.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Today, Mr. Obama will address the Urban League's national convention in Orlando.</span></p>
