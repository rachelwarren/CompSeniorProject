  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Among the special attractions at the Arlington Cinema 'N' Drafthouse over the years has been the stand-up of Janeane Garofalo and &quot;Daily Show&quot; co-creator Lizz Winstead, and the regular showings of &quot;Office Space&quot; and &quot;The Big Lebowski.&quot; And let's not forget the Monday-night screenings of &quot;Grindhouse&quot; and &quot;300&quot; for a dollar, with nachos and beer delivered to you tableside.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Beginning this month, a trip to Virginia won't be necessary for any of that. Residents of MoCo can hit the new Montgomery Cinema &amp; Drafthouse in Wheaton. Why this is exciting: When it opens sometime in the next week, the theater will book the same comedians from its Arlington location, host the same Dude Fests and $1 movies and free sporting-event screenings, and even bring in the same quaint office-chair-like seating that makes the Arlington theater so not like a movie theater.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Plans for the new cinema were announced in February, with renovations of a pre-existing movie theater space beginning this July. It's off Veirs Mill Road and little hard to spot behind a Bally Total Fitness at Westfield Shoppingtown Wheaton, but it's just across the street from the Wheaton Metro station, and we timed a drive from Rockville at just about 10 minutes. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;People may get off work at 5, but they're not getting home till 7,&quot; says the theater's president, Greg Godbout, when asked why the complex was planned for Montgomery County. &quot;They're not going to go back to the city [for entertainment].&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Walk in the door to a glossy new lobby area with tables and a long bar serving 20 brands of beer, including Stella Artois, Guinness, Flying Dog and &quot;probably like eight you've never heard of,&quot; Godbout says. There is no concession stand, because the theater offers table service, but you can still get popcorn (you just have to get it off the menu).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Virginians, take note: The MoCo drafthouse is, at 32,000 square feet, bigger than the sister location (there are six theaters, with two equipped for live entertainment) and will offer the first-run movies that Arlington doesn't. And there is, finally, a huge parking lot -- fans of the original location, you know what we're talking about.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Already slated in coming weeks: Redskins games, the &quot;Maryland Grindhouse&quot; triple feature of raunch-horror flicks, Dude Fest (a screening of &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; and a comedy show featuring Arj Barker, who opened the Flight of the Conchords show at Lisner Auditorium this May).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As is typical of new venues, the opening date is a little fuzzy, but the theater is scheduled to open in the next week; check the theater's Web site for updates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Movies will be $9.25 for first-run films, matinees are $7.75; comedy shows will run $15-$25; live children's entertainment will be about $8. The theater is for those 21 and older; younger patrons are allowed only if accompanied by a parent or guardian.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">FOR FAMILIES Halloween, the Musical? Um, sort of. Post-Classical Ensemble's &quot;scary music&quot; performance at Strathmore at the end of the month is a concert -- for children! -- in the spirit of Halloween, with moody lighting, a giant snake puppet and more to set the scene. &quot;Carnival of Creatures&quot; includes such works as Henry Cowell's &quot;The Banshee&quot; (famed for its wailing sound and for its technical experimentation) and &quot;Tiger&quot;; Silvestre Revueltas's &quot;Sensemay&Atilde;&iexcl;,&quot; based on a chant for killing a snake; and Saint-Sa&Atilde;&laquo;ns's joyous &quot;The Carnival of the Animals,&quot; in which instruments depict the sounds creatures make.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">THE SCENE Girls' Day Out: &quot;How Not to Look Old&quot; Charla Krupp's best-selling book breaks down the ways in which women, particularly those over 40, can update their looks in ways small (new, hip eyeglasses) and large (uh, &quot;injectables&quot;?). &quot;It's not about looking good to get a guy,&quot; says Krupp -- a columnist at More and former beauty director at Glamour -- whom we chatted with by phone from New York. &quot;It's about looking good when you want to reenter the job market, when you want to keep your job.&quot; To help Washington women get themselves updated, Krupp is visiting Tysons Corner Center to talk about her tips, particularly how women can pick out jeans for their weekends as well as casual Fridays. And don't worry, she's not going to try to &quot;update you&quot; into skinny jeans: She says those don't work &quot;unless you are Kate Moss.&quot; The talk is also a &quot;beau-tea&quot; party with mini-mani beauty bars and light hors d'oeuvres and tea. Best part: It's free, but reservations are recommended. The event is Saturday from 2 to 4 p.m. Macy's Court, Tysons Corner Center, 1961 Chain Bridge Rd., McLean. To RSVP, call 703-893-9401 or e-mail bethany.zorn@macerich.com</span></p>
