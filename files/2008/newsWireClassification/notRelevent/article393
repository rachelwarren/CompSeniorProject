  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cartoons raised the level of venom on the Opinion page</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Congratulations! The Roanoke Times has outdone itself. Your political cartoons of Sept. 3 and 4 had something to offend everybody (&quot;Hail to Thee Oh Magic Orb&quot; and &quot;GOPea in the Pod&quot;). Such venom seems to help sell newspapers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I would like to ask a question that has bothered me for years. Does anyone else find it strange that American voters expect their candidates to be both paradigms of virtue and able players of the dirtiest game of all -- politics? How can one be both?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Children should not be issues, either. What should be important are the candidates' stand on what affects us all, such as the economy, our troops abroad and the health and welfare of our nation. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But wait, Rick Davis, John McCain's campaign manager says this election is not about issues, but about what people think about the candidates. So what we are doing is electing a homecoming king and queen on the basis of their likability.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I doubt a truly virtuous person would get anywhere near this process. If we get caught up in the ad campaigns, with their &quot;image making,&quot; we will get what we deserve; all shadow and no substance.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">News coverage will only hurt The Glebe</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: &quot;The Glebe faces a crossroads,&quot; Sept. 7 front page:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">First it was Botetourt County trying to put The Glebe at risk. Now you are adding fuel to the fire.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Every sentence in the article was negative. It seems as though your purpose was to destroy any chance for The Glebe to recover from its financial problems. Your negativity dampens marketing efforts, hurts the bond holders and generates unnecessary anxiety among the residents in their twilight years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What if you had written something like this: &quot;The Glebe, a wonderful retirement community (describe in some detail) has financial problems (detail this also) but all it needs is a few more residents. If you need a place to spend your twilight years, go take a look. You will be doing yourself a favor and will help The Glebe survive the economic downturn that all people are experiencing.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My wife and I feel blessed to be two of the very happy residents here. We will survive. How different the world would be if we all had compassion, helping and encouraging each other instead of kicking someone when they are down. How different your paper would be if you majored on positives instead of negatives.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A distorted view of The Glebe</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The front page article on the financial problems of The Glebe was, in many respects, a biased and inaccurate commentary (&quot;The Glebe faces a crossroads,&quot; Sept. 7).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Glebe is in default of only $7.5 million, as $7.5 million was paid off on July 1. All the interest on the bond issue has been paid to date and there exist sufficient funds to pay interest on the bonds for the next two years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The current real estate market is hurting The Glebe's ability to fill unoccupied units. There are 11 units committed, but are waiting for houses to be sold before residents can pay and move in.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By the way, the agreement whereby Glebe residents in financial difficulty can have their payments subsidized is in full force and effect.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Living in the lap of luxury&quot; is an egregious distortion of fact.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lastly, if being a charitable institution means having to admit poor people, would you tell me how we are to choose them? By lottery? How many charitable cases are housed by Brandon Oaks or Kendall at Lexington? Or other tax-exempt senior residences?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For that matter, where does Botetourt County house its charitable cases?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">How can the uninsured expect to survive?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Sept. 5, the three major television networks got together many stars and people dealing with cancer to &quot;Stand up to Cancer.&quot; This effort was to raise funds for cancer research. Cancer research is definitely important. Early detection by screening was stressed, which is the best way to fight cancer and it works.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I can attest to survival by early detection because I am a cancer survivor. I could do this because I have health insurance.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My question is: &quot;What about the 47 million Americans who do not have health insurance?&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Being a maverick isn't always a good thing</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the Sept. 1 New York Times (&quot;A star is born?&quot;), columnist William Kristol wrote: &quot;The Palin pick already, as Noemie Emery wrote, 'Wipes out the image of McCain as the crotchety elder and brings back that of the fly-boy and gambler, which is much more appealing, and the genuine person.' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Fly-boy and gambler.&quot; Appealing? John McCain and Barack Obama have made their first presidential decisions, selecting potential vice presidents.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama chose Joe Biden, who, as Senate Foreign Relations chairman, has developed firsthand knowledge of foreign leaders and international flash points.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain chose Sarah Palin, who, in 20 months as commander in chief of the Alaska National Guard, expressed no substantial views on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the global war on terrorism, Iranian nuclear ambitions, renewed Russian belligerence, a troubled Pakistan and other pressing issues.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Which candidate, Obama or McCain, has exhibited in his choice the seriousness and judgment we need in a commander in chief?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">About John McCain: Democrats point to his 90 percent support of the Bush agenda, painting him as &quot;more of the same.&quot; Republicans play up McCain the &quot;maverick.&quot; McCain's judgment that Palin is ready for the presidency if something happens to him certainly bolsters his maverick image. Is that a good thing?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Punt 'Doonesbury' for something funny</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Roanoke Times has had a great deal of trouble managing the comics section, starting when &quot;Doonesbury&quot; decided to take a break. You put a comic into your funny pages that was actually funny (&quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot;). When &quot;Doonesbury&quot; returned, you decided to return to the unfunny &quot;Doonesbury.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fortunately, you listened to the readers and &quot;made room&quot; for funnies in your comic section. Now &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot; is changing and will do a retrospective, and again you want to eliminate what is funny in the comics.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If you really want to make room for &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot; on Sunday, why don't you move &quot;Doonesbury&quot; to the op-ed page where it truly belongs? &quot;Doonesbury&quot; has been a radical-left editorial and stopped being funny more than two decades ago; please keep up with the times in Roanoke.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hoping the polls are wrong again</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The latest polls show John McCain and Barack Obama nearly tied in the presidential race. I wonder about the accuracy of these polls.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A study by the National Center for Health Statistics, the results of which were released on May 14 in USA Today, concluded that &quot;34.5 percent of people 25-29 years old lived in households with only wireless phones. For those 30-44, the rate drops to 15.5 percent. It's 2.2 percent for those 65 and over.&quot; According to that study, the percentage of homes with only wireless phones more than doubled from 2004 to late 2007.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the 1948 election, newspapers relied on Gallup and other polls to predict that Dewey had won, resulting in the famous photograph of Harry Truman grinning while holding a Chicago Daily Tribune proclaiming &quot;Dewey Defeats Truman.&quot; Overreliance on telephone polling was partially blamed because households equipped with telephones were likely to be populated with wealthy Republicans, leaving Democrats largely unsampled.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Although land-line customers pay a monthly fee to keep their numbers unlisted, cellphone owners must pay to have their cell numbers published, leaving them less likely to be polled. Might history repeat itself 60 years later? I'm counting on it.</span></p>
