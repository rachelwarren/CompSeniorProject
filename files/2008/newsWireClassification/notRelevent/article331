  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain and the adjective &quot;maverick&quot; were once seemingly inseparable, and his quixotic attempt in 2000 to win the Republican presidential nomination helped weld that link.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But now that the Arizona senator is about to become his party's nominee, he finds himself in an uncomfortable spot: having to defend his reputation as a political independent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. McCain's campaign unveiled an ad this month that calls him &quot;the original maverick,&quot; and he has retooled his stump speech to remind independent voters disenchanted with Republicans that he defied his party on campaign finance reform, tobacco regulation and the early Iraq strategy. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democrats, sensing a weakness, have started to chant that this year's John McCain is not the voluble insurgent who terrorized his party's establishment eight years ago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Elkhart, Ind., Mr. McCain's Democratic opponent hit this theme hard. &quot;The price he paid for his party's nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position,&quot; Illinois Sen. Barack Obama told voters at a town hall meeting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;And now, he embraces the failed Bush policies over the last eight years -- politics that helped break Washington in the first place. And that doesn't exactly meet my definition of a maverick.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This debate over Mr. McCain's maverick-ness reflects a new challenge in his second bid for the presidency: the dilution of the McCain brand. To win the GOP primary this year, Mr. McCain embraced party dogma in ways big and small, from switching his opposition to President Bush's tax cuts, which he had criticized as skewed to the rich, to making amends with religious leaders he once denounced as &quot;agents of intolerance.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The campaign has also undercut Mr. McCain's image as a straight-talker by dramatically limiting the national media's access to the candidate, who once charmed reporters and voters alike with his easy, free-wheeling, common-man conversational style on his campaign bus.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In 2000, few questioned Mr. McCain's maverick credentials. He had stirred anger among conservatives by pushing a ban on the unlimited contributions to the parties that were used to finance campaigns. He locked horns with the tobacco lobby in 1998, when he sponsored an anti-smoking bill that would have raised cigarette taxes and was ultimately derailed by Republicans. He had long rankled colleagues with his campaign against earmarked projects, farm subsidies and pork-barrel spending. And he famously called televangelists Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell &quot;agents of intolerance.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His iconoclastic path continued into the early Bush years. He opposed the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, he pursued lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his associates, who were accused of bilking tribes of millions of dollars.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But Mr. McCain's positioning for the 2008 race undercut that firebrand image. He now supports making the Bush tax cuts permanent. He has vowed to appoint conservative judges. And he gave the commencement speech at Mr. Falwell's college, Liberty University.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I do not believe in holding grudges in life or in politics,&quot; Mr. McCain said at the time.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Around 2005 or so, he realized he was running for president ... He was going to do whatever was necessary to win this office,&quot; said Matt Welch, editor in chief of Reason magazine, whose book &quot;McCain&quot; is subtitled &quot;The Myth of a Maverick.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nonetheless, analysts say Mr. McCain still fits into a venerable tradition of legislators who tend to back their political party, but will go against it on key issues.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;A maverick doesn't mean you're always against your party,&quot; said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University history professor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dr. Zelizer pointed to the lingering distrust of Mr. McCain within the GOP.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;So many Republicans just hate him because he doesn't play ball,&quot; he said. &quot;That's the definition of what a maverick is.&quot;</span></p>
