  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain is taking aim at his rival party's plans to cut military spending, which Sen. Barack Obama details in a 2007 video making its way around the Web. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The October 2007 video shows the Illinois Democrat telling the Caucus for Priorities, a liberal, anti-defense spending group, that he plans to cut &quot;tens of billions of dollars in wasteful spending&quot; from the Pentagon's budget, including the nation's fledgling missile defense program.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems. I will not weaponize space. I will slow our investments in future combat systems,&quot; Mr. Obama says in the video.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There is no mention in Mr. Obama's current campaign Web site of his earlier plans to &quot;cut tens of billions of dollars&quot; in defense spending. Instead, he promises &quot;to rebuild the military&quot; for 21st-century tasks by increasing &quot;our ground forces by 65,000 soldiers and 27,000 Marines,&quot; project U.S. sea power &quot;by replacing aging ships&quot; and &quot;fully equipping our troops for the missions they face.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Virginia, Mr. McCain, who is trailing Mr. Obama, is running a TV ad aimed at the state's large defense industry and military population that cites a call for a 25 percent cut in military spending by Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;America's safety depends on Virginia, and Virginia's economy depends on our military,&quot; the ad says. &quot;But what would happen if Barack Obama wins? One of Obama's top allies in Congress has already announced plans to cut our military by 25 percent. Twenty-five percent. What would that mean for your job?&quot; the ad asks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama campaign Thursday called the McCain&nbsp;ad &quot;dishonest and dishonorable,&quot; and Mr. Obama, campaigning in Sarasota, Fla., said, &quot;I will never hesitate to do what it takes to defend this nation. From day one of this campaign, I have made clear that we will increase our ground troops and our investments in the finest fighting force in the world.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Frank told his home district's South Coast Standard Times last week that the Democratic Congress would slash defense spending by 25 percent next year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We don't need all these fancy new weapons,&quot; the liberal lawmaker said at an editorial board meeting with the newspaper's editors and reporters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Virginia Sen. John W. Warner, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, on Wednesday said he was &quot;completely shocked&quot; by the remark.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Warner, a former secretary of the Navy, said that Mr. Frank's comments showed Mr. Obama &quot;would be in a constant arm-wrestling contest with Democrats like Barney Frank,&quot; adding that such cuts would &quot;weaken America&quot; and destroy thousands of defense-related jobs in Virginia.</span></p>
