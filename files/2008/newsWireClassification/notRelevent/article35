  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The two plastic yard signs planted in the mulch in Fairfax County confound passersby. Same with two others stuck in a lawn four blocks away. What kind of people -- at the end of a divisive campaign, in a battleground state -- would have signs for both Sen. John McCain and Sen. Barack Obama in front of their homes?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alex Fetgatter stepped inside out of the drizzle one recent night, dropped his gray fleece on Ezzie, the family poodle, and, along with his dad, Jim, started to explain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They have been living together south of Alexandria since Alex graduated from the University of Virginia this summer, and the old patterns are still in play: Father takes on the liberal media at the breakfast table, seeing bias in the coverage. Photos capturing unflattering Republican facial expressions are always a good trigger. Holding forth may then ensue. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's amazing what you can do with a picture,&quot; Jim, 63, says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I just tease him about how obsessed he is with all this,&quot; says Alex, 22.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I'm really not.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Umm, I don't know about that.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They do a lot of jabbing and joking, and that's the way they approach their private conversation about the nation's politics.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There are no bespectacled moderators or 90-second time limits in the places where most Americans argue about politics, just the love, history and imperfect patter of communication and miscommunication that shape family life. Campaign signs can be quick distillations of those debates. More rarely, the flimsy plastic exclamations advertise unresolved clashes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After Jim's McCain sign went up, Alex parked his Jeep Cherokee -- well, the Jeep Cherokee he was borrowing from his dad -- in front to block the view. Jim, who had a Bush sign four years ago, said he'd prefer if his son got his own.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I woke up at 6:30, and it was there -- a magic mushroom,&quot; Jim said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And that was that. Though it wasn't, really.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alex's older brother, Ryan, 24, who lives in Rosslyn and works in real estate development, occupies the family's right flank. Uprooting his brother's sign and leaving it to be discovered behind a bush became a favorite provocation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While Alex and his father have been keeping the political talk tamped down while living under the same roof, things devolve when Ryan joins them for dinner.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Then it's . . .&quot; Jim begins.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Oh, God,&quot; adds Alex.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Wide open,&quot; Jim says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Then it explodes,&quot; Alex says. &quot;I really hate talking about politics, actually. You're not going to change anyone's opinion, and to be honest, I'm not that well-informed, so . . . &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Obviously,&quot; his dad can't help but interject.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alex voted for President Bush shortly after leaving home for Charlottesville, where he studied history. He was &quot;kind of Republican by association,&quot; he said. He now works at a private contractor for the Department of Agriculture and believes that a more activist government, led by Obama, will better protect the environment. He welcomes &quot;more direct, intense government involvement in things, 'cause I feel like that's really the only way to get people to change.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It would also be a striking feat for the United States to have a black president, Alex adds. And he thinks Obama would be better at defending the civil rights of Alex's gay friends.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That's &quot;not even worth talking about right now, with everything else going on,&quot; says Jim, who runs an association for foreign real estate investors. His focus is economics, terrorism and stopping a Democratic sweep. On the Iraq war, &quot;McCain has been right all along, and Obama has been wrong along,&quot; he adds.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Despite the sparring, they agree on some big things. They think the campaign has gone too long, with too much minutiae and gossip. (&quot;I find it hard to even watch Fox News anymore,&quot; Jim says.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Most important, they still share the same family values.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Being honest,&quot; Alex says. &quot;Being a good friend.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Work ethic,&quot; his father adds. And the value of education.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alex offers: &quot;The importance of family.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Less than a half-mile away, teacher Barbara Leonard saw the new blue accompaniment to her McCain/Palin lawn sign as she headed out for church.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It was two Sundays ago, and her son Alden, who works as a paralegal for an immigration law firm in the District, had come home after 2 a.m. from a party in Dupont Circle and posted his pro-Obama counterpoint.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The precipitating event was the appearance of the Alaska governor's name on his mom's two most recent signs. Her solo McCain sign had been stolen, and she had replaced it with ones that included the Arizona senator's running mate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But Alden's sign was quickly overshadowed. On the drive to church with her husband Chip, Barbara heard that former secretary of state Colin Powell was endorsing Obama. &quot;I was just furious,&quot; she says. &quot;I talked about it nonstop for the next two days.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Add the torrent of Obama advertisements flowing over family dinners in front of the nightly news, like the one about McCain voting with Bush 90 percent of the time or one on health care she thinks is unfair, and Barbara was feeling besieged.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;They'll jump in and say, 'The McCain camp is doing the exact same thing with Obama's plan. You really don't have a right to complain,' &quot; says Barbara, 58. &quot;I'm the odd man out anyway because I'm the only woman in this household of men. I guess I get a little tired of that sometimes.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barbara's parents were so conservative that talking politics could easily be seen as talking back, which could get her banished to her room. &quot;If that was the case today, I'd never leave my room,&quot; says Alden, 23.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barbara, an independent, twice voted for Bush but had been inspired by her husband to campaign for Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primary. Chip Leonard, 59, a military research analyst, had volunteered for Clinton across the country, sometimes paying his own expenses. He loved her passion and ability to see the big picture, and his family fed off his enthusiasm. Alden organized a campus group for the New York senator at the College of William and Mary. Barbara liked how Clinton laid out detailed plans, something she doesn't find in Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It was fun in the beginning, because we were all on the same page,&quot; she says. &quot;We'll talk about it when we're in the nursing home. 'Remember that year?' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She had hoped she could pull some family members with her to McCain, but she learned this week that her two other sons, one in Charlottesville and another in Colorado, also a key swing state, have decided to go for Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chip is still ambivalent. He said earlier that he was considering writing in Clinton's name, but he's still weighing what's important to him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alden had been down on Obama, too. &quot;He was so angry with Obama months ago for stealing the nomination from Hillary. He had said things like, 'I would never vote for him.' He's really come around. It's like talking to a different person. But Obama's very persuasive,&quot; Barbara says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Monday night, Alden sent his mom an e-mail full of links. She had said McCain would be better than his rival on health care and would restore America's status abroad. Wrong candidate, he argued.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It just seems more and more he's on me now about the way I should vote,&quot; Barbara says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But he's too late. She voted absentee last week, something she's not sure her son heard. &quot;He doesn't listen to everything I say.&quot;</span></p>
