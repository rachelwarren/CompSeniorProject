  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After an emotional speech by an ailing Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, the face of the Democratic Party shifted on Monday night to a new generation of leaders, as Michelle Obama opened the Democratic National Convention with a tribute to her husband and a call to the country to listen &quot;to our hopes instead of our fears,&quot; and &quot;to stop doubting and to start dreaming.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Seeking to ground Sen. Barack Obama in the experience of America's working class while recapturing the lofty ideals that propelled him toward his party's presidential nomination, Michelle Obama's family-themed speech was the climax of a dramatic opening day for a political party confident of its chances of capturing the White House but still struggling to lay aside its own divisions. A weak economy and a war in Iraq now in its sixth year have offered Democrats and their young candidate an ideal political environment in which to push for widespread change. But Obama has yet to close the deal with the electorate, or even some of the Democrats who backed his primary opponent, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.). </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But once the curtain raised on a raucous Pepsi Center, the party appeared poised to come together. The delegates cheered every mention of Clinton and gave the same treatment to Obama's running mate, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (Del.), and the party's 2004 nominee, Sen. John F. Kerry (Mass.). Kennedy, who has a brain tumor but appeared spry in a surprise appearance, offered a poignant moment of reflection on the last time a youthful Democrat won the White House. To thunderous applause, he promised to be present in the Senate in January to greet a new Democratic president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The work begins anew. The hope rises again, and the dream lives on,&quot; he said, echoing his speech from the 1980 Democratic convention, in which he was denied the party's nomination.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michelle Obama also did her part to try to heal the lingering wounds of the long struggle for the nomination when she recognized Clinton, &quot;who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling, so that our daughters -- and our sons -- can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the stream of new faces -- including Michelle Obama's brother, Craig Robinson, and freshman Sen. Claire McCaskill (Mo.), one of the candidate's fiercest supporters -- and a rousing anthem from John Legend, who helped craft the viral music videos that have powered the Obama movement, signaled that the torch is changing hands. Caroline Kennedy tried to bridge that generational shift when she told the crowd, &quot;I have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them, but I do now: Barack Obama.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When Michelle Obama took to the podium, she was greeted with sustained applause and a sea of blue &quot;Michelle&quot; placards.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Barack doesn't care where you're from, or what your background is, or what party -- if any -- you belong to. That's not how he sees the world,&quot; she said. &quot;He knows that thread that connects us -- our belief in America's promise, our commitment to our children's future -- is strong enough to hold us together as one nation.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After she finished, daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, met her onstage, where they were soon joined by her husband via a video link from Kansas City, Mo., where he watched the speech at the home of Jim and Alicia Girardeau. &quot;You were unbelievable,&quot; he said, &quot;and you look pretty cute,&quot; to which Sasha replied, &quot;Thanks.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michelle Obama's task was to reintroduce her husband to the nation as the candidate most capable of responding to the struggles of ordinary Americans, weary of war and beset by debt, division and fears of decline.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Even though he had this funny name, even though he'd grown up all the way across the continent, in Hawaii, his family was so much like mine,&quot; she recalled of the man who courted her as a young lawyer. &quot;He was raised by grandparents who were working-class folks just like my parents, and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did. And like my family, they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves. And Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you're going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Standing &quot;where the current of history meets this new tide of hope,&quot; the woman who would be the first African American first lady looked ahead to an evening when her daughters would tell their children about the 2008 election, and &quot;how this time, in this great country -- where a girl from the South Side of Chicago can go to college and law school, and the son of a single mother from Hawaii can go all the way to the White House -- we committed ourselves to building the world as it should be.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Indeed, the anti-Republican red meat was left for an unlikely source, soft-spoken former GOP congressman Jim Leach of Iowa, who hailed Obama as &quot;a transcendent candidate&quot; as he criticized his own party.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The party that once emphasized individual rights has gravitated in recent years toward regulating values,&quot; Leach said. &quot;The party of military responsibility has taken us to war with a country that did not attack us. The party that formerly led the world in arms control has moved to undercut treaties crucial to the defense of the Earth. The party that prides itself on conservation has abdicated its responsibilities in the face of global warming. And the party historically anchored in fiscal restraint has nearly doubled the national debt, squandering our precious resources in an undisciplined and unprecedented effort to finance a war with tax cuts.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Campaigning in Iowa, Obama tried to ease his party's divisions, conceding that &quot;there are going to be some of Senator Clinton's supporters who we're going to have to work hard to persuade to come on board -- that's not surprising.&quot; But, he added: &quot;If you take a look this week, I am absolutely convinced that both Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton understand the stakes.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the nerves were not easily calmed ahead of Hillary Clinton's speech on Tuesday and Bill Clinton's appearance on Wednesday. Hillary Clinton addressed the New York delegation at a breakfast in the morning. But while supporters waved signs declaring &quot;Hillary Made History,&quot; the senator's focus was on the future.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We were not all on the same side as Democrats, but we are now,&quot; she said. &quot;We are united and we are together and we are determined.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clinton is expected to release her delegates to Obama on Tuesday. That symbolic gesture reduces the prospects for major disruptions when the roll is called to nominate the senator from Illinois -- a historic moment when Obama will become the first black politician to head a major party's national ticket.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Divisions clearly remain, however, and the campaign of Republican Sen. John McCain did its best to foment unrest. It released a new advertisement featuring Wisconsin delegate Debra Bartoshevich declaring herself &quot;a proud Hillary Clinton Democrat&quot; who for the first time is supporting a Republican, McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;A lot of Democrats will vote McCain,&quot; she says in the spot. &quot;It's okay, really.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clinton repudiated the ad in her appearance before the New York delegation, saying: &quot;I'm Hillary Clinton, and I do not approve that message.&quot; But Howard Wolfson, who was her communications director, went public with the grievances her husband is still nursing. Writing in the New Republic, Wolfson said the former president &quot;feels like the Obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administration's accomplishments. And he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wolfson made it clear that he thinks it is Obama who needs to make amends.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Senator Obama would go a long way towards healing these wounds if he were to specifically praise the accomplishments of the Clinton presidency in a line or two during his speech on Thursday,&quot; he concluded. &quot;That should be painless.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Staff writers Shailagh Murray in Denver and Anne E. Kornblut, traveling with Obama, contributed to this report.</span></p>
