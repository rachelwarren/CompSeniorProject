  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The next president of the United States will face a stunning list of problems: two wars that must be won; a financial system in need of fixes that prevent the excesses of recent years without squelching growth and innovation; an economy that has almost certainly sunk into a recession likely to spread around the globe; a health care system that is too expensive and leaves too many uninsured; a large and growing federal budget deficit; Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid programs marching relentlessly toward bankruptcy; nuclear weapons in North Korea and Pakistan - and an aggressive program to build them in Iran; wasteful spending in Washington; genocide in Darfur; assertive dictatorships in Moscow and Beijing; and an existential threat from Islamic terrorists that seems to be fading dangerously from the national consciousness.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And those are simply the challenges we know about today. If other administrations - including George W. Bush's - have taught us anything, it is that the most serious troubles are often unanticipated.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Nearly every election lays claim as the most important in history. This one is not. But it may rank near the top of the list. (The Editorial staff has been in frequent contact with both campaigns). </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The success of Sen. Barack Obama's candidacy is a testament to many of the values America holds most dear: opportunity for all, a willingness to embrace and elevate determined talent regardless of race, creed, gender, or ethnicity. He is truly a son of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s second American Revolution. We salute the Illinois senator's accomplishment and share most of our countrymen's pride in his quest to win the nation's highest office. It reflects well America's remarkable progress over the past half century.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* * *</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> We believe that Obama is qualified by temperament to serve as president, though his limited experience does give pause. We believe he possesses the depth and the eloquence to inspire his fellow citizens and to spread America's message of liberty and freedom abroad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But we are troubled by many of his policy positions. His devotion to higher taxes on work, capital, innovation, and risk-taking seem particularly dangerous during a year in which the U.S. economy is struggling. His tepid, on-again-off-again support for free trade is equally frightening. He seems not to understand the forces that created the Great Depression nearly eight decades ago - at a moment when that understanding is absolutely essential.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> We are also discomfited by Obama's almost reflexive belief that government solutions are the best - perhaps even the only - solutions to most problems. His health care proposals lay the groundwork for a nationalized health system by putting government care in competition with the private sector. Guess who wins that one? One of his campaign's low points came when it grossly distorted John McCain's proposals to create a more efficient and effective health system driven by empowered patients and physicians. It's a great mystery why the McCain campaign and the media failed to aggressively counter these distortions. Or to emphasize that many of Obama's &quot;tax cuts&quot; are actually federal handouts to people who do not pay income taxes. The Democrat is proposing an end to &quot;the end of welfare as we know it&quot; by converting the Internal Revenue Service into an agency that collects money from people who pay income taxes in order to send checks to those who do not.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In a phone interview with a member of The Times-Dispatch Editorial staff Thursday, McCain emphasized his belief that &quot;redistribution of wealth doesn't work, hasn't worked, and won't work.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Arizona senator also chided his opponent for &quot;going back on his word&quot; by refusing federal campaign funding after promising to accept it &quot;back when he was an underdog.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> An Obama presidency will undoubtedly move the federal judiciary far to the left, with many unpleasant implications for personal liberty, the sanctity of life, and small &quot;r&quot; republicanism.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Most significantly, Obama's reluctance to acknowledge improvements on the ground in Iraq - a result of both the troop surge he opposed and an improved anti-insurgency strategy - calls into question his judgment, and emphasizes that his character remains untested.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* * *</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> John McCain is hardly an orthodox Republican on economic matters. But he does understand the fundamentals - to use a word that got the Arizona senator in trouble a few weeks ago with the chattering class - that drive dynamic free-market growth. He knows that American companies will find it difficult to compete when they must pay the second-highest tax rate in the developed world. So he is proposing a necessary - but politically dangerous - cut in the corporate tax rate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He also understands that low taxes are not the cause of today's economic tribulations - and has steadfastly refused to raise taxes on anyone while the economy struggles. He knows that it is businesses large and small that produce wealth and create jobs. And McCain recognizes that removing the secret ballot from union organizing elections and denying free trade with Colombia - the strongest U.S. ally in Latin America - to curry favor with Big Labor is not only economic folly but morally indefensible.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain seeks sensible, incremental changes to make health care more available and more affordable, while avoiding Obama's magical claims about reducing every American's health insurance premiums by $2,500 - as if it were that easy. McCain begins by ending the unfair system that allows employees to buy insurance tax-free while the self-employed receive no tax benefits. Despite commercials and stories to the contrary, McCain supports a health care credit that will lower the tax bills for almost all Americans, except those with gold-plated policies typically worth $15,000 or more. On this issue, the Arizona senator has suffered unfairly because his plan is nuanced and realistic while his opponent's relies on demagogy and outlandish promises. McCain told The Times-Dispatch that his health plan would cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Among the bipartisan spendthrifts who populate Congress, few if any can match McCain's record in opposing out-of-control spending. It's one of the main reasons the Bush administration and many fellow Republicans have frequently considered McCain a pain in the pork barrel.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The addition of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to the ticket has been a mixed blessing. She has electrified the Republican base and demonstrated an exceptional talent for retail politics. She boasts a strong record so far as governor. But it is a short record. At times, Palin's limited experience has shown, raising questions about her mastery of some complex issues. Her treatment by the press has been deplorable. But that does not mean all of the doubts about her readiness are misplaced. Still, we suspect she has a bright future in national politics, particularly after she has broadened her experience, perhaps as vice president. She seems to be a quick study.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Democrat Joe Biden has made himself into a laughingstock. In his interview with The Times-Dispatch, McCain clearly enjoyed recounting Biden's recent guarantee that a President Obama would face a major international crisis within six months of taking office. &quot;It's one of the most remarkable statements I've heard in American politics.... It's about Joe Biden riding to the rescue,&quot; McCain said. Obama has publicly dismissed his running mate's comments as &quot;rhetorical flourishes.&quot; McCain's response: &quot;He didn't know Joe Biden was capable of rhetorical flourishes? I could have told him that!&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* * *</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Experience - particularly in international and military affairs - is a significant issue at the top of the tickets. These Editorial Pages have long maintained that national security ranks as the most important responsibility of any American president. And by this measure, John McCain is the clear and unambiguous choice in 2008. The world remains a very dangerous place. McCain has demonstrated the courage and sound judgment needed to protect the free people of this nation - and assist those fighting for freedom around the world.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He sacrificed more than five years of his life for his country - suffering as a prisoner of war in ways that most of us cannot imagine. As a political leader, McCain has continued to exhibit bravery and good sense. He spoke loudly - again to the dismay of the Bush administration - about the need for more troops and a new strategy in Iraq, a deeply unpopular stance that nearly destroyed his presidential aspirations. We know now that McCain was right - and that his principled criticism was essential to avoiding defeat in Iraq.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When Russia invaded Georgia earlier this year, McCain immediately demonstrated a firm grasp of the risks and the actions needed to counter them - while Obama dithered. Unlike the junior senator from Illinois, McCain will face no learning curve in the Oval Office. He understands the complexities of the Middle East, the dangers posed by Islamic jihadists, the strengths and the limits of the American military. He knows, from profound personal experience, all about the power of American liberty and ideals, and about the determination - and calculation - required to defend them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* * *</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> We urge Virginians - who will play a crucial role in the national decision for the first time in more than a generation - to vote for John McCain for president. He is the right man for our perilous times.</span></p>
