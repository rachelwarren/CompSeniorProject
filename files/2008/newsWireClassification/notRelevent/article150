  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Oct. 20--MARTINSVILLE -- Todd Palin, husband of Republican vice presidential candidate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, served as an honorary race official during today's TUMS QuikPak 500 at Martinsville Speedway. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin, campaigning on behalf of Republican presidential candidate, Sen. John McCain, toured the pit area and visited with NASCAR officials and team members. His appearance was among several weekend stops by the McCain campaign in key battleground states Virginia and North Carolina.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin was introduced at the drivers' meeting before the Sprint Cup event. He appeared in the media center briefly before greeting fans as they filed into the racetrack for Race 6 of the Chase for the Cup.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin, who was joined by former governor and senator George Allen and U.S. Rep. Virgil Goode (R-Va.) at the race, told the crowd, &quot;I've done a little racing myself.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin said being around the racetrack made him want to take a Sprint Cup car for a spin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's just a thrill for us to be down here and I'll leave my telephone number with any NASCAR racer if they want to come up and go run with us,&quot; said Palin, a a commercial fisherman.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For now, Palin's focus is campaigning. Admittedly, he said it isn't his forte.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We've got one politician in the house and I've been going around the last few days touching on who we are as far as sportsmen and fishermen and hunters, and then today, being part of an American tradition, racing,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin's visit comes on the heels of Gov. Palin's visit to Richmond International Raceway earlier this week. Cindy McCain visited with drivers, team owners and NASCAR officials prior to last weekend's events at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C., and McCain made an appearance at Loudon, N.H. for the first Chase race.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Friday, South Boston's Jeff Burton was asked if NASCAR officials should try to achieve some kind of political balance in the garage, by encouraging the appearance of Democratic nominees. So far, neither Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and his running mate, Sen. Joe Biden, have campaigned at an event, according to a NASCAR spokesman.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;On the surface of it I think what's best for all of us is to not make a decision until we have to walk into the booth,&quot; Burton said. &quot;I think the more exposure that we have to the candidates the better we can make that decision.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This is always been a very conservative garage if you think about the politicians that have come. They typically have been conservative politicians.&quot;</span></p>
