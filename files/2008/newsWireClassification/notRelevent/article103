  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elitist? Who are the Republicans kidding?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">. . . For the past eight years, there's been no accountability in the Republican administration, whether it's enforcing environmental laws, banking regulations, the outing of CIA agents, domestic spying, torture or secret prisons. Where is our heart and soul? Our basic sense of decency? . . . These people call Barack Obama an elitist -- a man who was raised by a single mom, earned his scholarships and gave up a Harvard lawyer's salary to help folks whose steel mills had been shut down. These filthy rich, people who can't even remember how many houses they own, call this gifted young man an elitist?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;All he can do is give a good speech,&quot; they sneer. Well, the president's real power is in his ability to communicate. Our greatest presidents were great orators, we learned in school. They were &quot;great communicators&quot; who listened closely to their advisers, made an informed decision, then led the nation with their words. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Of course, snake oil salesmen are good yuk-yuksters, too. That's what we've had for the past eight years. Tap-dancing on the portico of the White House while the country falls apart. We need a president who can pronounce the word &quot;nuclear.&quot; I know I mispronounce hundreds of words everyday, just as surely as my Friday Night Jamboree dancin' shoes have taps on them. But I'm not running for president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When Obama explained to some city slickers how us country folk feel about things, he got it right:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We do love our guns. The fence posts at my mother-in-law's house sport more spent lead than staples.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We do love our religion. As a part Cherokee, my church is the mountains themselves. But along Route 221 there's a church every five miles.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And we are pretty darn bitter, from what I hear in the parking lots and shopping lines around the county.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's time we exercised our independent streak and voted against the trend. The Republicans have run the presidency, the Congress and the courts long enough.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Look beyond race</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">. . . I had wanted to believe that racism is rare enough to be a non-issue in this election. Unfortunately, making phone calls on behalf of Barack Obama has, at times, been a chilling dose of reality for me. I have heard harsh, bitter words that I haven't heard in decades.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My hope for people holding racist beliefs is that something will happen in their lives that creates a pathway for their hearts and minds to open. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We must be vigilant, proactive and encourage people to vote by speaking the truth as we know it to be. Racism, which we deeply wish was a thing of the past, is still a force to be reckoned with. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Another hopeful shift is found in the thinking of young people. My sons, working hard for Obama, are stunned when they hear racist comments. Young people seem to be more likely to view race as a non-issue. Typically, they see diversity not as something to fear, but rather as a goal to work toward and embrace. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If you see in Obama a person unique in his ability to lead and unmatched in wise judgment and thoughtful temperament, please consider being as proactive and involved as you are able to be.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A vote for Obama spells disaster</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">. . . How is it possible that a man could be friends with and have mentors like Jeremiah Wright, Philip Phleger and William Ayers and no one even questions his judgement? The despicable Louis Farrakhan has even anointed him &quot;Messiah Obama.&quot; How comforting. If he were not the Democratic nominee for president, Obama couldn't get a job at Wackenhut Security because of his association with known terrorists and extremists. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And who among us believes Ayers was &quot;just a guy in the neighborhood&quot;? Excuse me but how stupid do you think we are? I really don't care how old you were when the guy was blowing up government offices and the Pentagon, but I do care that you helped raise millions of dollars and funneled it into Ayers' program to radicalize school kids in Chicago and that your candidacy was hatched in his home and that you served on boards with him although he is unrepentant of his actions even today. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama and Biden always want to talk about the last eight years. Why don't we talk about the last two years when America voted for &quot;change&quot; by putting the Democrats in charge of both houses of Congress. Two years ago, the stock market was booming, gas prices were in the $2 per gallon range, we had low inflation and low unemployment. The real question is: Are you better off now than you were two years ago, under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, who have led this Congress to its lowest ever approval rating -- even lower than the despised George Bush. I am not sure that we, as Americans, can survive any more change like that.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On matters of the economy, McCain has failed</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.&quot; -- Albert Einstein</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For all those who believe the statement has some thread of truth please consider (McCain's record.) . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I ask not rhetorically but with the full force of McCain's economic policy record available for all to review: Is this man, who has been shown to have poor economic judgment, consistently voted for banking deregulation, even after going through the excesses and cost of the savings and loan crisis, the one who you believe will be able to guide us through the next four years?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now that is insanity.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">- Adam Cohen is a resident of Roanoke County.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's goals are singular and personal</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In his Sept. 18 commentary, &quot;Maverick is the name,&quot; Sam Riley reports that Karl Rove and his Republicans gave the name &quot;Maverick&quot; to presidential candidate John McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But upon reading McCain's books, &quot;Worth Fighting For&quot; and &quot;Faith of My Fathers,&quot; one learns that John McCain gave himself that separatist's accolade years ago. So proud of its label, he lays it on his running mate as he takes Sarah Palin to his side. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As a chaplain in McCain's Navy, I have been vitally interested in and very proud of his courage as a shot-down flyer, captured, tortured and thrown injured and untreated into an enemy's horrid prison. Genuine respect and heartfelt camaraderie binds me to this fellow veteran. So it is with much regret that I cannot give him my vote for president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Reasons being that I have heard him speak, watched him campaign, studied his record in the Senate, observed his choice of a maverick running mate, and I have read another book: Barack Obama's &quot;The Audacity of Hope.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Whereas McCain's writings point to singular, personal goals, Obama writes of personal experiences to introduce and explain hopes and dreams, not for himself, but for America and all its people.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Over and over again, fascinating, exacting moments in history are personalized for the reader whose mind and heart confirm the authenticity of Obama's mental and moral compass.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So well grounded in the Christian faith, he is not shaken by ultraconservatives, extreme liberals or the dynamics of other religions. So brilliant his memory, so acquainted with America's past, so aware of our nation's present virtues and needs, Obama offers us renewed inspiration and hope. Indeed, with candid confidence he dares to invite us all to believe in the audacity of hope.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's plans: too risky for Americans</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">. . . The Washington Post's conservative columnist George Will astutely referred to &quot;Applied McCainism,&quot; which he defined as the &quot;visceral judgment by one who is confidently righteous.&quot; Will concluded, &quot;the viscera are not the seat of wisdom.&quot; While many of presidential nominee John McCain's decisions are &quot;from the gut,&quot; his established policy positions are also not from the seat of wisdom. In particular, McCain's use of the banking model as the basis for his Social Security and health care plans is far from wise, as demonstrated by recent events. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Applied McCainism bases Social Security policy on the banking model, disregarding the hard lessons on regulation. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The private accounts for younger Americans that McCain proposes for Social Security place our Social Security retirement savings and our children's life insurance protection on the roulette table. It also endangers the pay-as-you-go Social Security system that allows us to cover today's tab for current retirees' benefits. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's health care plan shifts risk to the middle class and directs wealth elsewhere. McCain wants to effectively raise taxes on employers who provide health insurance to their employees by abolishing the tax exemption employers currently receive. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain confidently believes that the fundamentals of his retirement and health security are strong, but like the banking model, McCain's policies shift risk onto the middle class. Whether from the viscera or a more tempered place, playing roulette with our retirement and health security is unwise.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">America is at a crossroads. To the left, we have the Democratic Party. To the right, we have the Republican Party. And straight ahead, beyond the challenges of our time, destiny awaits. But to overcome these challenges -- and we will -- we must not forget where we've been and how we got here.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ever since our forefathers provided us with a powerful plan in the U.S. Constitution, the dynamic evolution of our government has been critical to our survival as a nation. It has made this nation the strongest democracy in the world.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But I am not so sure it remains a democracy anymore. We, the people, are becoming less and less involved with the political process. We're losing faith in our political leadership, and we're losing touch with the increasingly convoluted process, causing people to feel powerless, hopeless and disenfranchised. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There are bright minds in every part of America, working all kinds of jobs, who have the know-how to solve local, state, national and even international issues. Let us put our freedom and talents to good use and solve the problems we are facing. Each person can make a contribution to this process.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Don't cave to fear</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">. . . [B]oth parties are to be chastised for questionable tactics and misleading statements. But there are those in our current election who are deliberately inciting fear on multiple fronts in a desperate attempt to win an election by polarizing and paralyzing our county. Our current economic crises are to a large extent the result of eight years of policies that Sen. John McCain continues to advocate. The &quot;trickle down&quot; concept has not worked for eight years and will not produce any better results in the future. However, while Sen. Barack Obama is trying to discuss possible avenues to lead us out of our economic mess, the Republican candidates are telling us that Obama is not a &quot;real&quot; American. They are willing to sacrifice the unity that this country so desperately needs just to attract a few more votes. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What does the color of a man's skin have to do with his ability to lead this nation? What does an individual's passing acquaintance with someone who may have believed in violence as a means of protest 40 years ago have to do with his ability to propose solutions to our problems? What does the sound of someone's name tell us about a candidate's character? Nothing, nothing and nothing! Yet the Republican candidates want us to believe that these irrelevant points are more important than the global economic and security issues we face. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This great country and its citizens deserve nothing less than a discussion of policy and approaches to dealing with our current crises.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Want to talk guilt by association?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Republicans are now airing an ad ominous in its tone talking about Barack Obama's judgment because of his relationship with Bill Ayers. Ayers, it is rightly pointed out, was an active member of the Weatherman's radical underground movement of the '60s. The pitch of the ad is to question Obama's judgment when it comes to with whom he chooses to associate. If the information I have gleaned from the Internet is accurate, Ayers and Obama lived in the same neighborhood in Chicago and were part of a homeowners group for that neighborhood, truly a radical group in some folks' eyes. And, yes, they met socially as well. Ayers was an early supporter of Obama's political career. Guilt by association it appears. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Because of the totally inept and almost criminal manner in which the Bush administration has handled the Iraq war, i.e., its total lack of understanding of Iraq's multicultural and divisive religious demographics, its atrocious planning and execution of the war, one can argue that the number of American casualties (and Iraqi casualties, too) were far more than they should have been because of those factors. And because John McCain voted for the war and has been a supporter of that war, shouldn't he also be condemned in some dark, ominously framed ad that questions his judgment? Is not McCain guilty by association with a Republican administration whose ineptitude has clearly led to a number of unnecessary deaths among the 4,177 killed and 30,634 wounded of our gallant forces to date?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So, which is more telling of judgment: the relationship between Obama and Ayers, or McCain and the Bush administration?</span></p>

I'm not just some pompous New Yorker -- believe me, there are plenty of those already. I grew up in Roanoke, and my family still lives all over Southwest Virginia. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Four years ago on Election Day, I was living three blocks from Ground Zero when New Yorkers watched in saddened disbelief as so many states like Virginia fell to President George W. Bush, who ran a campaign of fear based upon keeping us safe. Whom exactly was he keeping safe, we wondered. We were pretty sure it wasn't us.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Terrorism is a part of our daily lives here. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barack Obama has the temperament and judgment to restore our international credibility and moral authority while also tending to immediate threats and thus keeping me in New York, and you in Virginia, safe. He also understands the severe urgency to reducing our dependence on oil that will protect our planet and move us ahead into another era of economic prosperity.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And he will move us toward a long overdue health care system that will take the power of medicine out of the hands of your for-profit insurance company and give it back to you.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shoot from the hip, miss the target</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain is justly known as the maverick, an individual who will break away from the crowd and inject new ideas. He is also known as one who shoots from the hip. Both these traits can be useful or dangerous. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">One of George W. Bush's largest failings was shooting from the hip. Do you remember when he looked into Vladimir Putin's eyes and said, &quot;I can trust this man&quot;? Bush ignored the experts who warned that Iraq was not developing nuclear weapons. He ignored the experts who warned that the Iraqis would not be waving American flags and he needed more troops to prevent the nation going into chaos. The great Colin Powell resigned. We do not need another maverick, hip-shooting commander-in-chief.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It is a shame that Dick Cheney's aggressive message was so useful in helping Bush get elected. Sarah Palin is like a Cheney in skirts without the intellect. The world is tired of us talking piety while we ignore so many who are sleeping on the streets of New York. The world resents our attempts to forcefully tell other nations how to govern themselves. Sarah Palin's talk about us fighting the war of God is very damaging. . . .</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Looking for a smart government</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">. . . Since I've been a voting adult, I have heard the constant derogatory variations of labels put to Democrats by Republicans, such as &quot;tax and spend, bleeding-heart liberals.&quot; But in my lifetime it's been Republicans who have not been fiscally wise and Democrats -- like Bill Clinton nationally and Mark Warner locally -- who have balanced our budgets. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If Democrats are so &quot;elitist,&quot; how is it they are the party that has consistently stood up for blue-collar and middle-class families while Republicans have largely championed corporate America? . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And so, this fiscally conservative independent will vote Democratic once again. . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With an Obama administration, I'll feel assured that my civil rights and my rights to privacy won't be rewritten and that government will indeed get off my back when it comes to those cherished rights.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the end, it isn't about the outdated labels we can pin on one another, or what new labels we give ourselves and wear like sound bites (like maverick). Whether government is small or big isn't the pertinent concern. I want a government that is smart. I believe electing Obama is the first step in that direction.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">. . . [W]e have a choice between a maverick and a rational personality. Do we want a president who will react quickly and possibly with little thought of the consequences? Or do we want a president who will think through the issues and understand the consequences of his actions, but might not act quickly enough?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The issues confronting us today are so complex that I believe we need someone with the ability to handle that complexity and think well about the future of our country and its participation in the global community. We need a thinker more than a person who can react quickly, especially after we saw what happened with President Bush, who invaded Iraq without thinking about the consequences of his action. That is why I am voting for Barack Obama, and I urge you to do the same.</span></p>
