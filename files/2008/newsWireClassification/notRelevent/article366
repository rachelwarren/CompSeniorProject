  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Could the oh-so-close presidential polls be skewed because they don't account for many young voters who use cell phones only?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;That's the biggest bunch of horse . . . I've ever heard,&quot; says pollster Brad Coker, who operates the widely used Mason-Dixon Opinion Research poll.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> About six weeks before the presidential election, most polls in Virginia give one candidate or the other an edge of 2 to 4 percentage points. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Some supporters of Sen. Barack Obama, puzzled by why he can't mount a big lead over Sen. John McCain in a difficult environment for Republicans, say the pollsters are missing younger, pro-Obama voters who have cell phones only.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Even some pollsters raise another uncertainty about the plethora of Virginia polls - whether all of the respondents who say they back Obama will vote in November for the nation's first black major-party nominee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Nearly 250,000 first-time voters have registered in Virginia this year, and 42 percent are under the age of 25. The overall gain has pushed Virginia's voter rolls to 4.8 million people.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Coker said if the sample for a poll includes the number of young voters in proportion to the population, the absence of cell-phone users doesn't matter. He said exit polls taken during the 2004 presidential election showed no difference in voting behavior between landline and cell-phone users.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Polls are weighted to match the demographic composition of the electorate, Coker said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Pew Research Center's Scott Keeter, a former pollster at Virginia Commonwealth University, found that cell-only respondents are significantly more likely to support Obama. But he said they also are substantially less likely to be registered to vote and, if registered, less likely to go to the polls.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A Pew survey in June found that Obama held a 48 percent to 40 percent advantage over McCain among cell-phone users and a 46 percent to 41 percent advantage among landline users.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Gallup organization, one of the oldest and most respected polls, says it does account for cell-phone users. About 15 percent of households now use cell phones only.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Residents of those households tend to be younger, more minorities and more transient, the Gallup organization's Web site says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Those would be more likely to be Obama supporters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Since Jan. 2, Gallup has been including cell phone-only households in all of its telephone surveys, the Web site says. The most recent national Gallup poll, taken Friday, shows Obama leading by 5 percentage points.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Coker said the Obama campaign should be more worried about the so-called &quot;Wilder effect&quot; or &quot;Bradley effect.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The phenomenon was named for Virginia's L. Douglas Wilder and California's Tom Bradley, black office holders who saw substantial poll leads disappear on Election Day. This resulted in a theory that some voters are embarrassed to tell pollsters that they will not support a black candidate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In 1982, Bradley, the mayor of Los Angeles, led in the polls but lost California's election for governor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Two days before Virginia's 1989 election for governor, Wilder led his Republican opponent, J. Marshall Coleman, by 15 percentage points, according to one poll. Wilder won the election, but it was so close there was a recount.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In an interview last week, Wilder, now Richmond's mayor and an Obama backer, said the public polls were wrong in 1989. Wilder said his own campaign's internal polling showed the contest was much closer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He said he expects only minor slippage for Obama, &quot;de minimus&quot; in Wilder's words.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> If there is slippage, it would be among independents, who already are more reluctant than partisans to tell their views, Coker said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Quentin Kidd, who directs a poll at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, said many pollsters have dismissed the Wilder effect this year, because Obama did well among whites in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Virginia's Feb. 12 Democratic primary, Obama won handily with 63.6 percent of the vote. Obama outperformed his tally in all of the public polls leading up to the primary.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But Kidd said he still expects some slippage for Obama in the South on Nov. 4.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I know most people will say they want to vote for the better candidate, but when they get in the voting booth, they might think otherwise,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Kidd pointed to another polling obstacle. Polling on weekends, particularly on Sundays, tends to miss likely Republican voters, he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Two Virginia polls released Wednesday showed dramatically different results, pointing to the importance of how pollsters estimate turnout.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain led Obama 53.8 percent to 46.2 percent in a Christopher Newport poll. But in a survey by Public Policy Polling, Obama led McCain 48 percent to 46 percent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Tom Jensen, communications director for Public Policy Polling, says Christopher Newport underestimated the turnout of blacks and young voters in Virginia, so it undercounted Obama's support.</span></p>
