  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sarah Palin is at least as qualified as Tim Kaine</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So far, most letters I have read in this paper have been critical of Gov. Sarah Palin. You watch all of the news shows and it's the same thing. So I say to her critics, answer this:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A few weeks before Barack Obama chose his running mate, Gov. Tim Kaine was on his short list of candidates. Kaine was first elected to Richmond City Council in 1994 and served on the council until 1998. He served as mayor from 1998 to 2001, followed by four years as lieutenant governor, and then he was elected governor in 2005.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin was first elected to Wasilla, Alaska, City Council in 1992 and served on council until 1996. She then served as mayor from 1996 to 2002. She was chairwoman of an energy commission from 2003 to 2004 before being elected governor in 2006. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It looks to me that she has been in government service longer than Kaine and has only a few months less time in office as a governor than he. So if the Democrats said Kaine is qualified to be vice president, shouldn't they say that Palin is, too, based on their time in office?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">God isn't sending the troops out</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I have always found it offensive when political leaders indicate they are doing God's will when waging war.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wars may be justified, as was our action against the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan following Sept. 11, 2001. This was an appropriate United States reaction to a dastardly attack against us, but it is presumptuous to claim that our action was God's will. This is exactly the claim made by Islamic fundamental terrorists to justify their attacks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I feel that our war in Iraq -- based, at best, on faulty intelligence, more likely on Bush's advisers telling him what he wanted to hear -- was not just.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Others such as John McCain and Sarah Palin may disagree. However, for Palin to say of our troops going to Iraq that &quot;our national leaders are sending them out on a task that is from God&quot; is frightening.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain should run from smear ad</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I agree strongly with William J. FitzPatrick in his Sept. 7 letter &quot;A Swift-boat attack on Obama.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paid for by the &quot;American Issues Project&quot; (whomever they might be), this scurrilous television ad, an obvious promotion for John McCain, links Barack Obama to terrorism when Obama was only 8 years old.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain could and should stop this Karl Rove-inspired propaganda. Earlier, McCain promised straight talk. He must back his promise by distancing himself from this divisive sort of support. McCain must be an adult and rise above smearing, fear-inducing dirty politics if he hopes to be worthy of the country's highest office.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lately, McCain claims to focus on change and hope, both part of Obama's original message. Those goals seem unreachable if McCain clings to the tactics and policies of the last eight years -- especially if his campaign and his supporters continue to spread lies and allow defamation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Aren't we, as a nation, dedicated to being above such behavior?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Faith compels a vote for Obama</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My family has always voted Republican, until this year. What has changed our minds first and foremost is the war in Iraq.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">How do we as a Christian faith feel that we are justified in inflicting death and suffering on a group of people for any cause, especially a completely unjustifiable one?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When Sarah Palin stated in her speech that the Iraq war was &quot;God's task,&quot; it was the nail in the coffin for our family. The hypocrisy of these types of statements is the reason the Republican Party will not be the winning ticket in November.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The people of our still redeemable, great country cannot afford to have this type of leadership guarding our children and grandchildren from the world's unpredictable nature.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I love America and am no less patriotic than any other person in the U.S., and we will vote for Barack Obama proudly because we believe that his change is exactly what this country will and must have.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">News story abetted Goode's deception</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am disappointed that the article &quot;Goode, Perriello face off&quot; (Sept. 4 news story) cited the bad mathematics Rep. Virgil Goode used without letting readers know how Goode was manipulating the numbers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After Tom Perriello cited the statistic that Goode is ranked 60 out of 66 members of the House Appropriations Committee in terms of effectiveness, the congressman turned that ratio into 60 out of 430. Goode deliberately changed the numbers to put himself in a better light. It is as if he had a rank of 60th in the 5th District and then bragged that he was 60th in the whole state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This piece of data makes him an embarrassment to our district. The person we elect to represent the 5th District should be effective in Washington and make us proud. I believe Perriello will do exactly that.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We also need news reports that help readers sort fact from fiction so that we are not led astray by fabricated data.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Another Georgia, a similar invasion</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Even to the most casual student of history, the headlines of the past weeks must have seemed familiar. To simplify my point, I shall refer to Vladimir Putin as &quot;Lincoln Two.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">1. A young republic, Georgia, declares its independence from a larger and aggressive northern neighbor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">2. The Georgians seek only territorial integrity and to be left alone.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">3. Lincolns One and Two insist on maintaining troops within the border of their respective Georgias.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">4. Lincoln One creates a phony rationale (freeing of slaves), as does Lincoln Two (protecting Russian &quot;citizens&quot;).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">5. Georgia attempts to remove the aforementioned troops from its borders.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">6. Lincoln One and Lincoln Two respond by further invasion.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The simple truth is that government by the consent of the governed ended for this part of the country in 1865. We now enjoy the benefit of government at the point of a bayonet. Let's hope Lincoln Two's Georgia does not suffer the same fate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yes, my young, Yankee yobs, you may rest assured that if Lincoln Two remains in Georgia, the history books 140 years from now will tell of the valiant invasion by Russian heroes to free their downtrodden fellow citizens.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Want good roads? Expect to pay</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Everyone I know hates to have cash from their hard-earned money taken from them to pay taxes. Yet, those same people demand better roads, bridges and fewer potholes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We are all Americans who, as a whole, demand and expect good service from our government. We simply need to pay a reasonable amount of our income to get these benefits. Anyone who disagrees should be one of the first to crash on a collapsing bridge, or worse.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am not advocating pork for unnecessary projects just to get votes. However, I am stating that we must all pay our fair share to live in the best country on the face of our Earth.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Artist walked away for good reason</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The article on the controversy over Mary Tartaro's show at Roanoke College was a diversion from the real issue (&quot;Artist miffed that Olin won't exhibit dress,&quot; Sept. 5 Virginia story).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As the only other person who heard exactly what gallery director Talia Logan told Tartaro, I can confidently assure the public that my wife's actions were fully justified. Logan's decision to censor certain pieces was not at all a curatorial one, but an attempt to avoid the aggravation of possible controversy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am fairly certain that Logan herself did not find these works offensive, but acted on behalf of her assumption about her audience without allowing them to judge for themselves.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The public reasons Logan states for the removal of the pieces in question are not the real reasons. Tartaro's decision to pull her entire show was not a &quot;tantrum&quot; but a refusal to participate in a climate of fear.</span></p>
