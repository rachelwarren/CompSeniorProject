  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Oct. 5--An estimated 18,000 people crammed into a riverfront park yesterday to hear Sen. Barack Obama say he would fix an American health-care system that tends to work against those who need it most.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama, placing a new focus on health care amid the nation's economic turmoil, dismissed Sen. John McCain's plan as narrow, financially burdensome and more helpful to insurance companies than to the insured. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I'm not saying [McCain] doesn't care what people are going through,&quot; Obama told an enthusiastic crowd at Victory Landing Park. &quot;I'm saying he doesn't know.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama devoted more than 10 minutes of his speech to criticizing McCain's health-care plan, which would provide each family with a $5,000 tax credit and deregulate the insurance market in an effort to drive costs down through competition.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama said McCain's plan would take back its tax savings by taxing health-care benefits -- &quot;an old Washington bait-and-switch.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds called that &quot;a bald-faced lie.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;John McCain will improve the tax code so that middle-class paychecks aren't used to pay government bureaucrats, but instead will pay for the access to health care Americans deserve,&quot; Bounds said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A month before the Nov. 4 election, Obama used the Newport News event to kick off a new push on health care that will include four new television ads, four separate mailers targeted to swing-state voters, radio commercials and events in every battleground state, according to The Associated Press.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Tuesday, Elizabeth Edwards, wife of former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress Action Fund, will headline a news conference at the state Capitol to talk about how McCain's health-care plan would affect Virginia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Newport News yesterday, Obama said his mother died of ovarian cancer in a hospital bed while fighting with an insurance company that refused to pay for her treatments, saying she had a pre-existing condition. Health-care reform, he said, &quot;isn't political to me -- it's personal.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's rally was the third appearance of his presidential campaign in Hampton Roads, where a Times-Dispatch poll last week said the candidates are running even. The region could determine which candidate wins Virginia and its 13 electoral votes. Virginia has not backed a Democrat for president since 1964.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hundreds of people queued up before dawn for the midday event. Volunteers moved through the crowd registering new voters ahead of Monday's 5 p.m. deadline.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I just wanted to be part of this history,&quot; said April Hill of Newport News, who brought her son and daughter. An election with a black nominee &quot;is a beautiful thing to see in my lifetime and my kids' lifetime,&quot; said, Hill, who is black. &quot;In a way, it doesn't even matter if he wins. History is being made here.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama promised to confront drug companies about unfairly high prices and insurance companies about &quot;discriminating&quot; against people with cancer and other catastrophic illnesses. He said his health-care plan would help small businesses pay for costly treatments.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He said he would finance his plan by modernizing an old and ineffective health-records system and by ending some of the tax cuts for wealthy people that were pushed by President Bush.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama said deregulating the insurance market is as bad an idea as bank deregulation, which led to the current economic crisis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Doug Holtz-Eakin, McCain's senior policy adviser, said McCain's plan to offer a tax credit in exchange for taxing employer-paid health benefits would be a net plus for all but the most wealthy Americans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain has criticized Obama's plan as excessively costly and unworkable.</span></p>
