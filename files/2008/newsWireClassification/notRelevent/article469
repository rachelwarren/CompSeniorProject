  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pickens gets it: Clean energy will move us forward</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When an oilman and environmentalists agree, you know the momentum for real change is building. Yet that is just what is happening.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Denver the other week, Texas oil billionaire T. Boone Pickens and Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope talked about the Pickens Plan, which calls for huge increases in investment and production of wind power and using American natural gas as a transition.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a recent ad publicizing the plan, Pickens says the current debate over drilling &quot;misses the point.&quot; As a Sierra Club member, I concur. The current political emphasis on whether to open up more of the coastline to drilling is a distraction, a &quot;head fake.&quot; Pickens, who's made billions from oil, believes the Bush administration is wildly exaggerating how much oil can be found offshore and in Alaska.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The failed policies of the past won't move us forward or bring down fuel prices. True economic opportunity for all Americans is in clean energy technologies like wind and solar. Even Pickens understands that. The question is, when will our leaders in Washington? </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain has revealed lack of judgment</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain has said that he'd rather lose an election than lose a war. Apparently this same sense of integrity did not inform his choice of a running mate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After months of criticizing Barack Obama for lack of experience and running sleazy ads comparing him to vapid celebrities, McCain has chosen a running mate with no experience, and apparently used a vetting process less stringent than a celebrity would need to get a placement on a &quot;reality&quot; TV show.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rather than carefully considering who would be the best person for the job, McCain has made a rash and crass political calculation, betting that he can peel enough women supporters away from Obama to make the difference in this election. However, what his choice reveals to me is that he is erratic and has poor judgment.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That, along with his explosive temper and self-admitted superstitious nature, makes me think that he is exactly the wrong person to be leading the country at this time. The last thing we need in office after eight years of George W. Bush is another intellectually stunted cowboy with a penchant for bombastic rhetoric and no apparent regard for thoughtful decision-making.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin made her choice: ambition</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So much for the Republicans touting themselves as the party that best represents family values. In vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin's case, one should pity her family.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By accepting Sen. John McCain's invitation to join him on the Republican ticket, she has tossed her daughter, future son-in-law, husband and all her relatives to what Republicans might characterize as the media wolves for a chance to sit in the White House. Relevant or not, her family's private affairs and history are being blazoned abroad for all to see.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If she were an exemplar of honoring commitments to the family, Palin would have been sensitive to her young daughter's vulnerability and rejected the invitation to cast her lot with McCain; and further, if McCain and his advisers really were pro-family (and as they were fully aware of her daughter's circumstances), they would not have invited Palin to join him on the ticket.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tapping Palin was cynical and insulting</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am so angry at John McCain. His selection of Sarah Palin is an insult to those 18 million Hillary Clinton supporters he is clearly trying to entice to vote for him and to voters everywhere.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Not only does Palin not represent the values of Hillary Clinton, but her social values are so extreme that they shock the conscience of all but the fervent few who would bar abortion even in cases of rape or incest.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As if that were not enough, McCain's hasty and ill-advised choice speaks volumes about his disrespect for women across this nation. The very thought that I, or any other woman, would vote for him just because there is a woman on his ticket is an insult to women's ability and desire to examine the issues and vote for the person who best represents their interests.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain and Palin are not those people.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Further, the shabby process used to select Palin may be a good indicator of how he would choose other advisers and judges on whom our very lives may depend. That is cold comfort and speaks to McCain's poor judgment and cynicism.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ask pertinent questions before you vote</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am not running for office and am not expected to have all the answers. Nonetheless, I do have 10 questions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">How does a country win a war that it started based upon misinformation?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Does bad luck, being a maverick or being incompetent best explain a pilot who loses five airplanes?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Would an accelerating fuel tax over the past 30 years have reduced our dependence on foreign oil?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On what basis does a country impose its form of government on another country?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At what point does mixing government and religion create a theocracy?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What value should be placed on education in a global economy?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">How many wars have been started in the name of religion?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What are the consequences of having a $3 trillion annual budget with a $10 trillion debt?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">How can shock-and-awe war strategies effectively address a multicountry terrorist insurgent strategy?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Why debate whether there is global warming when the strategies to address it make sense either way?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I urge all voters to raise their own questions, seek answers and then decide for whom they should vote in November.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Elderly series grand; cartoon potshot not</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thank you for the wonderful series of articles in The Roanoke Times this year on caring for the elderly. I appreciate the well-written stories and unbiased writing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The Age of Uncertainty&quot; article featured on the front page Sunday, Aug. 17 (&quot;The costly years&quot;), was particularly well-written and very informative.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">However, many of the editorials that I see in The Times express the opposite position to the view that I hold. That's all right because we live in a country that values free speech and have a Constitution that supposedly guarantees the privilege to speak freely without fear of government censorship.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">However, the cartoon in the Sept. 4 paper goes too far. Abstinence-only teen maternity tops sold by the GOP! The obvious intent is to poke fun at the Republican vice presidential candidate and her teenage daughter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Self-righteousness is just as unbecoming on the left as it is on the right. Please continue to print wonderful articles like the series on the elderly population, but try to leave the ugly cartoons out of The Times.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Enough with warning about sin and damnation</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Enough is enough. I am tired of every day seeing another letter to the effect that homosexuals are sinning and going to hell. There are more important issues facing us today.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let's worry about Iraq, gas prices, health care or who is going to lead this country for the next four years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For all you people writing these letters telling the homosexuals that they are sinning, well, I hate to tell you that you too are a sinner and if you don't repent too, you will be neighbors with the homosexual in hell. The Bible that I read says that we have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God and that no sin is greater than the other.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">God says hate the sin, but love the sinner. So for all of you who think that you are a non-sinning person, I am praying for you.</span></p>
