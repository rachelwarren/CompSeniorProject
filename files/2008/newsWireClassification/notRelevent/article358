  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This time of year, as I watch college and pro football on an endless loop Saturdays and Sundays -- Toni, a.k.a. She Could Be The One III, slips me pancakes under the door of my study for sustenance, and the kids, whose names escape me at the moment, are restricted to the southeast end of the condo -- I've noticed that the business of America is selling everything but soap to captive American males.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">BlackBerry: &quot;Life on BlackBerry.&quot; I have enough trouble with life in L.A. -- I don't need high-tech complications.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">AT&amp;T: Bill Kurtis &quot;just found the Internet.&quot; Congratulations -- welcome to the 20th century. For his next trick, maybe he can find my career.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cadillac Escalade Hybrid: First of all, who do you know -- still living -- who owns a Cadillac? Secondly, if you're going to be a Cadillac Man, are you going hybrid? Please. A Cadillac has no cachet being environmentally correct -- with a Caddy, you're thinking greed, not green. If you're trying to make an impression, you want the gas-guzzling, road-hogging, lust-and-power '78 Cadillac Eldorado, my friends.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Cialis: &quot;Now for daily use.&quot; For daily use? I'll be honest with you: I've been an adult for quite a while now and I cannot recall a time in which sex was part of my daily routine.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">(Election-Season Column Intermission: The moment John McCain took Sarah Palin, Barack Obama should've countered with Phyllis George.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dodge: &quot;The all-new Dodge Journey.&quot; I'm glad it's &quot;all-new.&quot; I thought the engine and the cup holders might be used.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">PNC: &quot;Leading the way.&quot; Where? And with whom? Note: I have no idea what PNC is.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">C2 ING: &quot;Your future. Made easier.&quot; My past makes that impossible.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> John Hancock: &quot;The future is yours.&quot; No, it's my mortgage lender's. By the way, how come everyone is obsessing on my future?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ford: &quot;Drive one.&quot; I'd love to, except it's always in the shop being repaired.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Comcast: &quot;It's Comcastic!&quot; If we're going to make up words, I have one: &quot;It's crockcastic!&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chrysler Town &amp; Country: &quot;Everything you want in a minivan. Everything.&quot; You know, I really don't want people eating fondue and watching TV in my minivan. Speaking of which, exactly how much TV do we need to watch? I mean, are your kids so unruly, bored and restless that if they don't see &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot; on the seven-minute drive to soccer practice, they will revolt in the back seat?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Samsung: It's the official HDTV of the NFL and Norman Esiason is the pitchman. Frankly, I'm thinking transistor radio.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Coors Light: Coors Light + Brian Billick = Irritable Bowel Syndrome.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Budweiser: Beechwood aging, my butt.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bud Light Lime: Not in this lifetime.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">American Express: &quot;Are you a cardmember?&quot; No, I'm all cash all the time, baby.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Avodart: &quot;Shrink it.&quot; Nobody touches my prostate. Nobody.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mac: I love Macs. They don't have a slogan because they don't need one.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7"> Ask The Slouch </span><br /></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A. You know, someone like Tony Soprano -- he's running a mob family, it's a cutthroat business, he's responsible for whacking a couple people a week -- needs a shrink. Vince Young just needs better pass protection and a tighter spiral.</span></p>
