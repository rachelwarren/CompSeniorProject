  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The problem wasn't that John McCain said, &quot;The fundamentals of the economy are strong&quot; as Wall Street was imploding last week.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The problem was that he didn't stand by his own words.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Democrat Barack Obama instantly seized on the quote for a hard-hitting campaign ad. The seven words became Exhibit A in Obama's case that Republican McCain is wrong and out of touch. But, so what?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> If McCain believed what he said, he should have stuck to his position and defended it with some examples. That would have shown real straight talk. He could have claimed the banner of hope and optimism. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Even with economists willing to back him up, though, it wouldn't have been easy. In the continuous news cycle, complicated issues get boiled down to sound bites and slogans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain didn't need to remind people that during the primaries last year he acknowledged that economics isn't his strong suit. By not sticking to his words, McCain left the impression that he didn't know how bad the economic mess is or that he was just blowing political smoke - or both.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCAIN ALSO called for a 9/11-style commission to study what brought on the economic woes and how to prevent another catastrophe. Obama jumped on the idea as typical Washington-speak for not solving problems.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> To be sure, the nation's economic picture seems to darken by the day. Joblessness has soared, as have mortgage foreclosures. Banks are teetering, the government is in major bailout mode, and the financial markets appear to be in free fall. A Page One headline in The Wall Street Journal Thursday declared: &quot;Worst Crisis Since '30s, With No End Yet in Sight.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> How bad is it? So bad that the White House refused to say the fundamentals are strong. After saying for months that the economy is strong, press secretary Dana Perino wouldn't say it after McCain did, claiming to do so would put the president in the middle of the presidential race.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> For his part, the president canceled a trip to help raise money for GOP candidates to stay in the White House and monitor the economic situation. Translation: It would have looked bad for him to be glad-handing fellow Republicans when the financial world was spinning out of control. This is the Katrina lesson applied to the financial hurricane.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At this point in the campaign, McCain obviously didn't want a repeat of the storm that surrounded his former economic adviser, Phil Gramm, when he dismissed people worried about the economy as whiners.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But McCain hadn't insulted voters. Nor had he said the economy was a banana split with a cherry on top.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> After noting &quot;tremendous turmoil in our financial markets and on Wall Street,&quot; he said, &quot;People are frightened by these events. Our economy, I think still, the fundamentals of our economy are strong. But these are very, very difficult times.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Instead of standing firm, McCain did what Washington politicians do when something they say ricochets around the talk-filled universe. He waffled, and then he caved. First, said he meant to say that American workers are strong. And then he scurried away from his words entirely and declared the economy in &quot;a total crisis.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He also reversed himself on whether taxpayers should bail out the insurance giant AIG, first saying no, then yes. It was like watching him play both courts in a tennis match.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCAIN AND Obama both say more financial regulation is needed. That's been a consistent position for Obama. McCain is strongly for deregulation unless he's for more regulation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Interestingly, New York's billionaire independent mayor, Michael Bloomberg, did stand by McCain's remark.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;America's great strength is its diversity, its hard work, its good financial statements, its broad capital markets, its enormous natural resources,&quot; Bloomberg told a news conference Monday, Politico reported.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Bloomberg, who contemplated an independent run for president, hasn't endorsed either Obama or McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The mayor told an audience at Georgetown University Wednesday that what he looks for in a presidential candidate is intelligence and a pragmatic approach to problems.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He said the public chooses the person they believe is most honest and straightforward. That's hard to measure, Bloomberg said, so people vote their instincts.</span></p>
