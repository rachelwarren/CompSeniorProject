  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">America needs leaders who have known life's hardships</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I think I realize why America is having so many problems in our country and through the world. It is called lack of respect. All of the old politicians have been playing with those same old attitudes for too long. We deserve better and should demand better.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We need to start term limits. We need to stop the big corporations from getting tax breaks for the big money they pay to get the people they want in office. We need to demand that a &quot;none of the above&quot; slot be put on our voting ballots.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If we think the candidates are not good for America, we can find new candidates to run. There are many people walking the streets who could do a better job. This is because they have lived under the hardships caused by the rich and politicians running the country. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">These people never had to balance a budget, worry about where their next meal was coming from, the utilities being turned off or if they were going to be put out on the street. People who have never had any hard times in life don't understand the problems of many people in this country.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Whoever gave Sen. John McCain advice on attacking Sen. Barack Obama's Americanism also attacked all Hawaiians as not being American enough. That Obama was a minor and probably had no say in where his mom and grandparents chose to live is a point not in evidence in McCain's recent political ad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Did McCain forget about Obama's Kansas roots, or has McCain mentally banished that state from the Union, too? What poor advice and bad judgment.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Schools have opened a swimming gap</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: &quot;An aquatic center would make a big splash,&quot; Aug. 8 commentary:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As an instructor with Aquatic Adventures and a former teacher in the Roanoke city schools' swim program, my attention was drawn to the commentary from Chris John. His praise and recognition of the Roanoke Valley Aquatic Association and Salem YMCA were well deserved.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The RVAA has been a major player in the local aquatic program for decades. The Salem Y stepped up this year and helped to continue the outstanding tradition of the city/county meet. Regrettably, there was one error in his facts.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Roanoke City Public Schools, under the leadership of Kathy Tucker, implemented a learn-to-swim program that addressed the health and wellness of young children and provided an excellent opportunity for every elementary student. This year it was announced that the program would no longer be part of the system's instructional effort.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Whether because of budgetary constraints or because it was an obstruction on the path to standards of learning success, the school system has relinquished its role in this portion of our community's health. Let's hope others in our valley recognize the importance of aquatic activity and step up to meet this need.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Putin merely follows in U.S. footsteps</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Robert Kagan's &quot;Putin makes his move&quot; (Aug. 12 commentary) effortlessly meanders from the sublime to the ridiculous.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sublime is thinking that any nation wouldn't oppose having its neighbors join a historically antagonistic military alliance. Ridiculous is claiming that Russia's counterattack on Georgia marks the return of &quot;an almost 19th-century style of great-power competition&quot; for resources and influence and &quot;shocks our 21st-century sensibilities -- the use of military power to obtain geopolitical objectives.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Too late, Kagan. Our invasion and occupation of Iraq already did that.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: &quot;Homosexuality is a choice and a sin,&quot; Aug. 8 letter:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I have been praying for Eddie Shepherd Sr. every day since I read his letter. &quot;Homosexual&quot; does not appear anywhere in the King James Version of the Holy Bible.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am a reborn Christian who has been baptized. I am also faithfully attending Metropolitan Community Church in Roanoke. I have served in the U.S. Navy and now I serve God every chance I get. I am a happy homosexual, praising God and showing my kindness to all, such as God wants us all to do.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If Shepherd is so unhappy that he must put false words in the Bible, I invite him to come to my church where I will share some of my happiness and joy with him. I will pray for him.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hunting dogs shouldn't suffer</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hunting dogs suffer just like other dogs even if they are part of a &quot;proud Virginia tradition&quot; (&quot;Treatment of hunting dogs examined,&quot; Aug. 5 Virginia section). Many members of the Humane Society of the United States have contacted us after seeing mistreated and malnourished dogs year after year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Our members cite countless &quot;emaciated dogs . . . with ribs sticking out so far they collapse -- gasping for air.&quot; &quot;They're kenneled in small runs and undernourished . . . . They're quite literally skin and bones,&quot; said one member, while others said many dogs had untreated wounds and were covered with ticks and fleas.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Humane Society members have pulled dozens of dead or dying dogs off the road each year, while others describe hunting dogs who are abandoned.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The mistreatment of hunting dogs in Virginia is routinely dismissed by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries and must be taken seriously. We urge the Hunting with Hounds Stakeholder Advisory Committee to take steps to remedy this sad situation.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liberal press wouldn't pursue Edwards story</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re: &quot;Edwards goes public with affair,&quot; Aug. 9 news story:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thank goodness we have the National Enquirer to keep tabs and investigate rumors involving ultra-liberal political candidates. It appears our liberal presses, such as The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and Charlotte Observer, only have time to dig into the dirt on fundamentalist politicians and clergy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Without the Enquirer, Sen. John Edwards might again be a presidential candidate. He still claims to be &quot;99 percent honest.&quot; Sort of reminds me of &quot;it depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fathers are taking on the nicotine addiction</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Few will challenge angry parents protecting their young. They will fight to the death, and the motivation is love, not hate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mothers Against Drunk Driving is an example. That effort did more to expose and curb the rising tide of alcoholism than any other campaign up to that point. It caused legislators to take notice, change and enforce laws that previously were lax and ineffective. Many an alcoholic was forced to face his or her addiction and seek help.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fathers Against Nicotine, or FAN, is just such an effort, a newly organized Roanoke Valley group motivated by love and angrily determined to curb the worldwide pandemic of nicotine addiction. Rights must be usurped, liberties must be restricted and freedom governed when the actions of one so devastatingly affect others.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Self-righteous? Holier-than-thou? Controlling? You bet.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Suicide and homicide are individual choices, but they are not sane choices. The loving choice is to protest, intervene and cease to enable such destructive behavior. Whether you agree or not, this addiction has met its match.</span></p>
