  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Biden's gaffe</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Barack Obama's choice of Joe Biden as his running mate prompted a small wave of warnings about Biden's propensity for gaffes. But no one imagined even in a worse-case scenario such a spectacular bomb as telling donors Sunday to 'gird your loins' because a young President Obama will be tested by an international crisis just like young President John Kennedy was,&quot; New York Post columnist Kirsten Powers writes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Scary? You betcha! But somehow, not front-page news,&quot; the writer said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Again the media showed their incredible bias by giving scattered coverage of Biden's statements. There were a few exceptions. On MSNBC's 'Morning Joe,' co-host Mika Brzezinski flipped incredulously through the papers, expressing shock at the lack of coverage of Biden's remarks. Guest Dan Rather admitted that if [Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah] Palin had said it, the media would be going nuts. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;So what gives? The stock answer is: 'It's just Biden being Biden.' We all know how smart he is about foreign policy, so it's not the same as when Sarah Palin says something that seems off.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Yet, when Biden asserted incorrectly in the vice-presidential debate that the United States 'drove Hezbollah out of Lebanon,' nobody in the U.S. media shrieked. (It was, however, covered with derision in the Middle East.) Or when he confused his history by claiming FDR calmed the nation during the Depression by going on TV, the press didn't take it as evidence that he's clueless.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Powell and GOP</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Colin Powell's &quot;estrangement from the GOP predates the McCain campaign and goes back to his speech on Feb. 5, 2003, making the case in the United Nations for war against Iraq,&quot; Brendan Miniter writes at www.opinionjournal.com.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;At one point Dick Cheney poked Mr. Powell in the chest and told him: 'You've got high poll ratings; you can afford to lose a few points.' The rest is history: In the months after the invasion, when no stockpiled [weapons of mass destruction] were found in Iraq, Mr. Powell grew disenchanted with the White House and offered at least two dissenting public statements about WMD that drew a rebuke (including calls from Condoleezza Rice asking him how he was going to clean up the mess his comments created).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;When a special prosecutor was appointed to look into who leaked the name of CIA agent Valerie Plame, Mr. Powell never stepped forward with the leaker's name, even though he knew all along it was his own deputy, Richard Armitage. Instead, Mr. Powell allowed the special prosecutor to spend months questioning White House staffers and journalists, eventually leading to the indictment of Cheney aide Lewis Libby for obstruction and perjury.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Shortly after [President] Bush won re-election in 2004, Mr. Powell resigned and has spent much of the past year making noises about endorsing Mr. Obama, including praising the speech the Democratic presidential candidate gave on race in Philadelphia and defending his intention of holding presidential-level talks with Iran. When asked about Mr. Powell's endorsement, John McCain said [Tuesday] it 'doesn't come as a surprise.' Given the history, what's surprising is that it took Mr. Powell so long to leave the GOP.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">TERM-LIMIT VOTE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A judge Wednesday denied a request from two City Council members to block the council from voting on New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposal to change the term-limits law so he can run for a third consecutive term, the Associated Press reports.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Brooklyn council members Bill de Blasio and Letitia James filed a petition earlier in the day asking the court to stop a scheduled council vote to increase the number of terms the mayor and current council members may serve. The lawmakers contend allowing a third Bloomberg term would violate the city's conflict-of-interest law.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Judge Jacqueline Silbermann's ruling clears the way for a vote Thursday, although it could be appealed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The two council members' petition noted that the council would be voting on the extension of term limits for its own members, as well as for Mr. Bloomberg, who is pressing for the change. The petition named the city's Conflicts of Interest Board and the council as defendants.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The judge rejected the argument that the petitioners would be &quot;irreparably harmed&quot; by having to take part in a vote on extending term limits, saying they can vote no or abstain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Forget the ads</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann, the outspoken Minnesota freshman who created a political maelstrom last week by calling Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama's patriotism into question, received more bad news Tuesday when the National Republican Congressional Committee pulled its television advertising campaign for the first-term incumbent, a top Republican official said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The official wouldn't say how much the ad buy was worth.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mrs. Bachmann, while a guest on MSNBC's &quot;Hardball&quot; on Friday, said Mr. Obama &quot;may have anti-American views&quot; and that &quot;people that Barack Obama has been associating with are anti-American, by and large.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Tuesday, Mrs. Bachmann retreated from her statements, saying, &quot;I made a misstatement. I said a comment that I would take back,&quot; the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the newspaper said Mrs. Bachmann also accused &quot;Hardball&quot; host Chris Matthews of coaxing her to utter her comments.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I had never seen his show before,&quot; she said. &quot;I probably should have taken a look at what the show was like. ... A trap was laid, but I stepped into it&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Crowd inflation</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I only sometimes write about crowd size on this blog,&quot; reporter Christina Bellantoni writes at www.washingtontimes.com.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's a good barometer for enthusiasm, and big crowds help campaigns generate lovely optics, but it's hard to know the actual number of people who stream into an event,&quot; Ms. Bellantoni said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The Obama campaign provides traveling press with crowd counts along with a verifier (usually a police official) and the person's phone number. (The McCain campaign got in trouble last month for vastly inflating crowd counts and not giving verifiers.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The campaign told reporters Tuesday the Miami rally had '30,000+ inside with people lined up outside still trying to get in.' So I was surprised to hear Michelle Obama, in a video that was posted Wednesday morning but removed by the campaign sometime before 2 p.m., tell supporters she had just introduced her husband 'to a crowd of 50,000 here in the city.'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot; 'It's just phenomenal,' she said in the get-out-the-vote Web video. Thinking maybe 20,000 people had been turned away, I called the verifier sent by the campaign the day before. He told me the count was indeed 30,000 inside and a 'roughly 3,000 or 4,000 that didn't make it in.'&quot;</span></p>
