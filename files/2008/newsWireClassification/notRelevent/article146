  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the 2000 Republican primary in South Carolina, Sen. John McCain was a victim of Karl Rove, the win-at-all-costs political adviser to President Bush. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In 2008, McCain has become the foremost practitioner of Rovian politics, tossing his hard-won reputation as a straight-talking, honorable politician into the nearest trash can.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The latest, surest sign of McCain's descent into the gutter is his embrace of a tactic he denounced in 2000: sleazy robocalls aimed at tearing down his opponent with misleading attacks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thanks to Virginia's battleground state status, you may be lucky enough to receive several of these automated phone calls, like this one about Obama's &quot;relationship&quot; with William Ayers:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;You need to know that Barack Obama has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, whose organization bombed the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, a judge's home, and killed Americans.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That makes it sound like Obama was part of the Weather Underground with Ayers during the '60s, when the fact is that by the time Obama met him, Ayers was an education professor respected in Chicago circles by Republicans and Democrats alike. Their &quot;relationship&quot; didn't extend beyond service on a couple of boards -- a level of association that would damn dozens of upstanding Republicans who served in similar situations with Ayers over the years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Adding insult to his own injury, there have been reports that McCain hired the same firm for this robocall campaign that attacked him in 2000.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A couple of weeks ago, there was a brief sign that the McCain of 2000 had become disgusted with himself -- or at least what his relentlessly negative campaign had wrought.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After weeks of his campaign -- especially his designated pitbull in lipstick, Sarah Palin -- painting Obama as dangerous, unAmerican and radical, McCain stood up to the increasingly ugly crowds at his own rallies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He took the microphone back from a woman who called Obama &quot;an Arab,&quot; and corrected her and said that Obama is &quot;a decent, family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When he told another crowd that, despite what his campaign had been saying at rallies and in commercials, there was no reason to fear an Obama presidency, he was booed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But those moments were fleeting. Sunday, McCain angrily defended the robocalls, denying there was anything misleading about them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A man who tried to make honor and honesty his defining characteristics, McCain sacrificed his reputation in pursuit of the presidency. It is a tragedy that could only be compounded if he were rewarded with victory.</span></p>
