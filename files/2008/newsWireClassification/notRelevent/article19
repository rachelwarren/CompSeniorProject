  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Sarah Palin was a hockey mom, small-town mayor and rising Republican star in Alaska in 2003 when she ran afoul of her party's establishment over ethics reform and was cast into the political wilderness.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But she came charging back as an ethics crusader to win the governor's office in 2006, including a landslide primary victory over the incumbent GOP governor. She has remained popular even as she continued to take on such powerful figures as the oil companies and the leaders of her own state party.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Palin, 44, has been the Joan of Arc of Alaska politics, charging into battle against long odds on such big local issues as oil taxes and construction of a natural-gas pipeline - only to see her opposition crumble. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Just days after her 2006 primary victory, an FBI investigation into political corruption involving the oil industry and Republican legislators burst into view with surprise raids of legislative offices. As criminal indictments and convictions followed, Palin's outsider status helped her maintain high approval ratings.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In one-on-one settings, her relaxed, no-bull manner has contributed to her popularity.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* * *</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> She was born in Idaho and came to Alaska when she was 3 months old. She grew up in the town of Wasilla, an hour north of Anchorage, where her father, Chuck Heath, was a teacher and coach.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> One of her most formative experiences, she has said, was leading her high school basketball team to the 1982 state championship. Palin played point guard, and got the nickname from her teammates of &quot;Sarah the Barracuda.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Palin went on to study journalism and political science, graduating from the University of Idaho in 1987. Along the way, she competed in the Miss Alaska contest after being chosen Miss Wasilla 1984. In the Wasilla contest, she played the flute and also won the title of Miss Congeniality.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* * *</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> She grew up hunting with her father. Her favorite meal, she said during her gubernatorial race, is moose-meat stew after a day of snowmachining.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> She eloped in 1988 with her high school sweetheart, Todd Palin. He is a commercial fisherman, an oil-field worker, a member of the United Steelworkers, and an Alaska Native. His grandmother grew up in a traditional Yup'ik Eskimo house in Bristol Bay and accompanied Sarah in her race for governor as she sought support from Native voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Todd Palin has worked 18 years on Alaska's North Slope for BP, though he backed away from the job after his wife was elected governor. He also is a repeat winner of the Iron Dog snowmachine race from Anchorage to Nome and back along the Iditarod Trail.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Palin's clean image lately has taken a shot, however, over charges that she tried to use her office to get rid of an Alaska state trooper who had gone through a messy divorce with one of her sisters. Palin denied any involvement but has conceded a staff member made inappropriate calls. The legislature has hired a special investigator, with the strongest criticism coming from Republicans antagonized by Palin during the oil and gas battles of the past two years. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But at a time when state coffers are spilling over with new oil revenues, Palin has remained popular with voters. She recently pushed through a $1,200 per-person &quot;rebate&quot; to help with high fuel costs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sarah Heath Palin</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Feb. 11, 1964 - Born in Sandpoint, Idaho.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 1982 - Graduated from Wasilla High School in Wasilla, Alaska.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 1987 - Graduated with a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Idaho.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Aug. 29, 1988 - Married Todd Palin, with whom she would have five children.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 1992-96 - Entered public life, serving two terms on the Wasilla City Council.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 1996-2002 - Elected mayor of Wasilla City, Alaska, for two terms until term limits forced her from office.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 2002 - Lost her first statewide campaign for the GOP nomination for lieutenant governor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 2002 - Frank Murkowski left the Senate to become governor and named Palin chairwoman of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 2003 - Split with party leaders by battling Randy Ruedrich, the head of Alaska's Republican Party.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 2006 - Upset then-Gov. Murkowski in the Republican primary, then defeated former two-term Gov. Tony Knowles, a Democrat, in the general election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 2007 - Pressured lawmakers to get the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act passed, to build a natural-gas pipeline to deliver about 35 trillion cubic feet of North Slope natural gas to market.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Aug. 29, 2008 - Chosen as Sen. John McCain's vice-presidential running mate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">SOURCE: The Associated Press</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barack Obama, Democratic presidential nominee</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Palin's selection &quot;is one more indicator of this country moving forward. The fact that you've got a woman&quot; as the &quot;vice-presidential nominee</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">of one of the major parties, I think, is one more hit against that glass ceiling. She seems like a compelling person. Obviously a terrific story, personal story. And I'm sure that she will help make the case for the Republicans.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Certainly the choice of Palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the Democratic team, and while Palin is a fine person, her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">President Bush</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Governor Palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government. Governor Palin's success is due to her dedication to principle and her roll-up-your-sleeves work ethic and serves as a wonderful example of the spirit of America. By selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done, Senator McCain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming Washington.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Adrianne Marsh, spokeswoman for Obama</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Today, John McCain put the former mayor of a town of 9,000 with zero foreign-policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, former Democratic vice presidential nominee</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Governor Palin is an independent leader who has fought the special</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">interests on behalf of the people of Alaska. The McCain-Palin ticket will appeal to voters across party lines.&quot;</span></p>
