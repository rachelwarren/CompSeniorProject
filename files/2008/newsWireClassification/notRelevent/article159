  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Don't worry about 'racism'; just get out there and vote</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Debi Kelly Van Cleave (&quot;Racism will mar many people's votes in November,&quot; Sept. 27 letter) and Carol Ross (&quot;Racist attitudes do linger,&quot; Oct. 6 letter) condemn as &quot;racist&quot; those who will not vote for Barack Obama because he is black. This is indeed unfortunate, but then we are all imperfect.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In many of the primaries, Obama received more than 90 percent of the votes cast by blacks. I find this neither surprising nor disturbing. I feel certain there will be blacks voting for Obama who have never participated in a national election before, as there will be whites voting for Obama just to avoid being branded as &quot;racist.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I expect this dynamic to be a deciding factor in the Nov. 4 election, but I'm not going to call it &quot;racist.&quot; It's just normal for most of us to relate to people who are &quot;like us,&quot; whether it be race, national origin, job skills, hobbies, etc. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But let's not get our shorts in a bunch over this. I'm sure it can be demonstrated that the best men for the country were not elected in many past elections, the most recent being 2004. It is important that we all vote, and just hope for the best.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If Rep. Virgil Goode's mother were here, she would send him to his room for his slanderous political ad about Tom Perriello.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Perriello was born and raised in the 5th District. He was an Eagle Scout, no less. He works in our community at Habitat for Humanity, food banks and other charities, and pledges to work overtime for the citizens.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Goode has shaded his picture to look like he is coming from Afghanistan to get us. Shame on him and his political campaign for sinking so low.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We don't need another 'regular Joe'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sarah Palin wants to prove she's one of us. She describes herself as &quot;Joe Six-Pack Hockey Mom.&quot; The problem is that while she's working hard on identifying with us, she's not trying to find out what Americans are like and represent our opinions to the government.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sure, she's friendly in an early-morning talk-show kind of way, but I don't want Al Roker protecting my interests against Vladimir Putin. I want a person who's smart, shrewd and cool under pressure. That's Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My ideal candidate does not have to be just like me to represent me. It's fine if he's black and a Harvard law graduate, as long as he presents my opinions and viewpoints on the world stage.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the 2000 election, George W. Bush did a great job of taking on the persona of a &quot;regular Joe.&quot; What was the result? We got what we voted for -- the &quot;C student&quot; who had trouble articulating a vision for the country -- and we had a hot mess on our hands.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let's choose the guy who may not identify with us some of the time, but who best represents us all of the time. That's Obama.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The markets voted 'no confidence'</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wall Street has already cast its vote in the 2008 presidential election. The free market system absolutely responded to the predicted election of Barack Obama as spelling the death knell of the free market enterprise system.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Using free-market dollar votes, millions of individuals have cashed in their accumulated wealth before Obama and congressional minions can tax it away to finance their liberal social programs and destroy free market individual incentives.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By acting in their own best interest, these millions have virtually incinerated all the monetary gains accrued in the last 15 years, thereby denying Obama the financial resources for carrying out his promised agenda and its planned massive redistribution of wealth.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ironically, hedge fund managers and other &quot;short seller&quot; market manipulators who have financed Obama's campaign are also the same individuals and firms whose actions have exacerbated the decline. This stock market crash is a massive, clear &quot;no-confidence&quot; vote on Obama's prospective economic program and absence of a proven track record of doing, leading or managing anything of consequence.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Only the McCain-Palin team offers adequate planned incentives to restore confidence in our free enterprise system, reverse the decline and get us back on a viable road.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His means leave him homeless</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am a poor, homeless man. What most people don't know is that most homeless people today live in their cars and vans, not on the streets and not so visible.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With the recent economic downturn, more and more people are ending up like me. Even though I had good credit and could have continued to borrow to pay bills, my income and health wasn't good enough. I knew I couldn't borrow my way out of debt (like this country is trying to do today). I live within my means today, meager though they may be.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">People have the attitude that all homeless people have something wrong with them, like alcoholism, drug addiction or mental illness. There's help available for these problems.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The reason people are homeless is because they don't have homes. Contrary to popular belief, homeownership is not the American dream. Profit is. Perhaps this depression will show us the error of our ways.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In my homeless experience, I have found true charity. Not the kind that expects a return or reward -- just honest, humble unconditionally generous people. They are here, giving without taking away your grace and human dignity. God love you.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let the race card turn a losing hand</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wake up, Americans. Are you going to let the uneducated and racist voter keep us with the same Republican leaders who have put this wonderful country in the mess we have now? Do the right thing for our country. Don't cut off your nose to spite your face.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ITT helps others protect our lives</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obviously, Scott Cundiff has never had a family member serve in the military. If he had, or had ever done so himself, he would realize how important it is to be equipped with the latest technology (&quot;Turn down help from ITT's war machine,&quot; Oct. 4 letter).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ITT does not create or condone war, it creates equipment to protect our soldiers, our country and our freedom. The night vision technology not only benefits soldiers at war, but is used to secure our borders, protecting your life and your family's lives, and by law enforcement officers and in the medical field.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Maybe we should quit investing in advances to support our military so we then can be taken over by another country. Maybe then Cundiff would appreciate what ITT and other companies contribute to our safety and independence.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Or maybe we should send him to a country that could not care less about his rights and freedoms, since he is in need of a wake-up call.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thank God for companies like ITT whose workers take part in protecting my family and others -- they do more for their country in one day, I'm sure, than Cundiff has done his whole life.</span></p>
