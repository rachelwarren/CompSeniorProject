  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> One thing both Democrats and Republicans agreed about in their vastly different conventions: The American voter will not only decide but decide wisely. But does the electorate really know what it's talking about? Plenty of things are hurting American democracy -- gridlock, negative campaigning, special interests -- but one factor lies at the root of all the others, and nobody dares to discuss it. American voters, who are hiring the people who'll run a superpower democracy, are grossly ignorant. Here are a few particularly bogus claims about their supposed savvy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 1. Our voters are pretty smart. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You hear this one from politicians all the time, even John McCain, who promises straight talk, and Barack Obama, who claims that he's not a politician (by which he means that he'll tell people what they need to hear, not what they want to hear). But by every measure social scientists have devised, voters are spectacularly uninformed. They don't follow politics, and they don't know how their government works. According to an August 2006 Zogby poll, only two in five Americans know that we have three branches of government and can name them. A 2006 National Geographic poll showed that six in ten young people (aged 18 to 24) could not find Iraq on the map. The political scientists Michael Delli Carpini and Scott Keeter, surveying a wide variety of polls measuring knowledge of history, report that fewer than half of all Americans know who Karl Marx was or which war the Battle of Bunker Hill was fought in. Worse, they found that just 49 percent of Americans know that the only country ever to use a nuclear weapon in a war is their own.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">True, many voters can tell you who's ahead and who's behind in the horse race. But most of what they know about the candidates' positions on the issues -- and remember, our candidates are running to make policy, not talk about their biographies -- derives from what voters learn from stupid and often misleading 30-second commercials, according to Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 2. Bill O'Reilly's viewers are dumber than Jon Stewart's.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Liberals wish. Democrats like to think that voters who sympathize with their views are smarter than those who vote Republican. But a 2007 Pew survey found that the knowledge level of viewers of the right-wing, blustery &quot;The O'Reilly Factor&quot; and the left-wing, snarky &quot;The Daily Show&quot; is comparable, with about 54 percent of the shows' politicized viewers scoring in the &quot;high knowledge&quot; category.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So what about conservative talk-radio titan Rush Limbaugh's audience? Surely the ditto-heads are dumb, right? Actually, according to a survey by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, Rush's listeners are better educated and &quot;more knowledgeable about politics and social issues&quot; than the average voter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 3. If you just give Americans the facts, they'll be able to draw the right conclusions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Unfortunately, no. Many social scientists have long tried to downplay the ignorance of voters, arguing that the mental &quot;short cuts&quot; voters use to make up for their lack of information work pretty well. But the evidence from the past few years proves that a majority can easily be bamboozled.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Just before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, after months of unsubtle hinting from Bush administration officials, some 60 percent of Americans had come to believe that Iraq was behind the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, despite the absence of evidence for the claim, according to a series of surveys taken by the PIPA/Knowledge Networks poll. A year later, after the bipartisan, independent 9/11 Commission reported that Saddam Hussein had had nothing to do with al-Qaeda's assaults on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, 50 percent of Americans still insisted that he did. In other words, the public was bluntly given the data by a group of officials generally believed to be credible -- and it still didn't absorb the most basic facts about the most important event of their time.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> 4. Voters today are smarter than they used to be.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Actually, by most measures, voters today possess the same level of political knowledge as their parents and grandparents, and in some categories, they score lower. In the 1950s, only 10 percent of voters were incapable of citing any ways in which the two major parties differed, according to Thomas E. Patterson of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, who leads the Pew-backed Vanishing Voter Project. By the 1970s, that number had jumped to nearly 30 percent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here's what makes these numbers deplorable -- and, in fact, almost incomprehensible: Education levels are far higher today than they were half a century ago, when social scientists first began surveying voter knowledge about politics. (In 1940, six in ten Americans hadn't made it past the eighth grade.) The moral of this story: Schooling alone doesn't translate into better educated voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">5. Young voters are paying a lot of attention to the news.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Again, no. Despite all the hoopla about young voters -- the great hope of the future! -- only one news story in 2001 drew the attention of a majority of them: 9/11. Some 60 percent of young voters told Pew researchers that they were following news about the attack closely. (Er -- 40 percent weren't?) But none of the other stories that year seemed particularly interesting to them. Only 32 percent said that they followed the news about the anthrax attacks or the economy, then in recession. The capture of Kabul from the Taliban? Just 20 percent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Six years later, Pew again measured public knowledge of current events and found that the young (aged 18 to 29) &quot;know the least.&quot; A majority of young respondents scored in the &quot;low knowledge&quot; category -- the only demographic group to do so.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And some other statistics are even more alarming. How many young people read newspapers? Just 20 percent. (Worse, studies consistently show that people who do not pick up the newspaper-reading habit in their 20s rarely do so later.) But surely today's youth are getting their news from the Internet? Sorry. Only 11 percent of the young report that they regularly surf the Internet for news. Maybe Obama shouldn't be relying on savvy young voters after all.</span></p>
