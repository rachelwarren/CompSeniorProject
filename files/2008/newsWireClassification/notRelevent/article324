  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the dead of night in a small hideaway office in the deserted Capitol, a clandestine meeting takes place between two senators with one goal.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They grin at each other as they lift their celebratory shots of brutally cold Stolichnaya.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Here's to The One,&quot; they toast in unison. &quot;He's toast!&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Obama should have picked you, Hillary,&quot; John McCain tells her. &quot;It isn't fair, my friend. But it just makes it easier for me to whup him.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Don't worry, John, I've put it behind me,&quot; Hillary replies. &quot;I'm looking toward the future now, a future that looks very bright, once we send Twig Legs back to the back bench.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They chortle with delight.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;He's a bright young man, but he got ahead of himself,&quot; McCain says. &quot;He needs to be taught a lesson, and we're the ones to do it. Have you seen the new polls? Obama's dropped and we're even again. The Bullet's getting all the credit, but you and I know, Hillary, that it's these top-secret counseling sessions we're having. And thanks again for BlackBerrying me the Rick Warren questions while I was in the so-called cone of silence.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Oh, John, you know I love you and I'm happy to help,&quot; Hillary says. &quot;The themes you took from me are working great -- painting Obama as an elitist and out-of-touch celebrity, when we're rich celebrities, too. Turning his big rallies and pretty words into character flaws, charging him with playing the race card -- that one always cracks me up. And accusing the media, especially NBC, of playing favorites. It's so easy to get the press to navel-gaze; they're so insecure.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;They're all pinko Commies,&quot; McCain laughs. &quot;Especially since they deserted me for The Messiah. Seriously, Hill, that Paris Hilton-Britney Spears ad you came up with was brilliant. I owe you.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Looking pleased, Hillary expertly downs another shot. &quot;His secret fear is being seen as a dumb blonde,&quot; she says. &quot;He wants to take a shortcut to the top and pose on glossy magazine covers, but he doesn't want to be seen as a glib pretty boy.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain lifts his glass to her admiringly. &quot;If I do say so myself, while the rookie was surfing in Hawaii, I ate his pupus for lunch. Pictures of him pushing around a golf ball while I'm pushing around Putin. Priceless.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I have a little secret to tell you about that, John. Bill made it happen. He loves you so much. He called Putin and told him that if he invaded Georgia, he could count on being invited to the Clinton Global Initiative every year for the rest of his life.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Wow. Should I call him? I saw your husband's kind words about me in Las Vegas on Monday, saying I'd be just as good as Obama on climate change.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think he'd like that,&quot; Hillary smiles. &quot;He's still boiling at Obama. And you don't have to worry about my army of angry women. We've spread the word in the feminist underground -- as opposed to that wacky Obama Weather Underground -- that 'catharsis' is code for 'No surrender.' My gals know when I say 'We may have started on two separate paths but we're on one journey now' that Skinny's journey is to the nearest exit.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;But Obama's says he's finally ready to hit back,&quot; McCain says, frowning. &quot;He's starting a blistering TV campaign and attacking me for attacking his patriotism.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Now, John, you know that every time he tries to get tough, he quickly runs out of gas. Sometimes in debates, he'd be exhausted by the third question. He must use up all his energy in the gym. He doesn't have any stamina, and he certainly doesn't have our bloodlust. Besides, you can throw that Mark Penn stuff at him that I couldn't use in a Democratic primary about how he's not fundamentally American in his thinking and values. While he's up on his high-minded pedestal, you'll scoot past him in your Ferragamos.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;How can I ever thank you, my friend?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;You can announce that you won't be running for re-election because you'd be 76, and you can pick somebody really lame to run with, like your pal Lieberman. That means one term for you, and two for me.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's a deal,&quot; McCain says, sticking out his hand to shake on it. &quot;That was inspired to snatch his convention away -- makes him look so weak. Listen, why don't you stop in Sedona on the way to Denver? Wear a black wig and I'll spirit you up to the cabin for the night. I'll catch a catfish in the mill pond and grill it for you. It will be an adventure.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There's a knock on the door. Jesse Jackson sticks his head into the meeting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Is it over?&quot; he asks his co-conspirators.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Yes, he's over,&quot; they respond in unison.</span></p>
