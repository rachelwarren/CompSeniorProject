  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Democrat Barack Obama's allies warn that Republican John McCain's attacks on the Democrat's character will lead to the political equivalent of mutual assured destruction: Fire your big weapon at your own peril. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Several Obama surrogates said his supporters may start reminding voters of McCain's ties to Charles Keating, a convicted savings and loan owner whose actions two decades ago triggered a Senate ethics investigation that involved McCain as one of the &quot;Keating Five.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The warnings of massive retaliation came as McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, took on the role of attacker and said that Obama sees America as so imperfect &quot;that he's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> She was referring to an early Obama supporter, 1960s radical Bill Ayers, a founder of the Weather Underground whose members were blamed for several bombings when Obama was a child.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Yesterday, Obama unveiled a TV ad on the economy that paints McCain was &quot;erratic in a crisis.&quot; Some see that as a reminder of McCain's age, 72.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Democrats were well-synchronized yesterday, using the word &quot;erratic&quot; and Keating's name in nearly-matching sentences across the talk show circuit.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;This is going to be a month, I think, of character assassination,&quot; Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., an Obama supporter, said on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama, too, alluded to harsher tactics in a speech yesterday to thousands of people in Asheville, N.C.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain and his aides, Obama said, &quot;are gambling that he can distract you with smears rather than talk to you about substance.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Noting the nation's economic problems, Obama said: &quot;Yet instead of addressing these crises, Senator McCain's campaign has announced that they plan to turn the page on the discussion about our economy and spend the final weeks of this campaign launching Swift Boat-style attacks on me.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama has denounced Ayers' radical views and activities. However, Ayers hosted a small gathering for Obama in 1995, early in his political career. Obama and Ayers live in the same Chicago neighborhood and served on a charity board together, but there is no evidence they have palled around.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a Chicago Democrat and Obama supporter, warned against McCain's strategy. &quot;At 58, John McCain was associating with Charles Keating,&quot; he said. &quot;If we really want to talk who is associating with who, we will.&quot; In the late 1980s, McCain made what he has called &quot;the worst mistake of my life.&quot; He participated in two meetings with banking regulators on behalf of Keating, a friend, campaign contributor and S&amp;L financier who was later convicted of securities fraud.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Senate ethics committee investigated five senators' relationships with Keating. It cited McCain for a lesser role than the others, but faulted his &quot;poor judgment.&quot;</span></p>
