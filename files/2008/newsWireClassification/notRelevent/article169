  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A group of volunteers from the student body, coaches, parents and community helpers came to the Lord Botetourt BBQ shack on Oct. 11 to prepare a chicken fund raiser for James River athletic programs. On Friday, students in the school's work and family studies classes at James River washed and wrapped baking potatoes. Local businesses helped provide the chicken and fixin's at a reasonable cost.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The day began around 7:30 a.m. and ended about 7:30 p.m. The chicken barbecue was a sell-out; 800 chicken dinners left or were eaten on premises, at the VFW Hall, where the chicken was brought after it finished cooking at the LBHS pit. A steady stream of diners and carryout flowed in and out of the parking lot in the three-hour span. By all accounts, the event was a great success.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Members of the VFW, the Bolton family, Boy Scouts and community members came out to dedicate the Percy Bolton picnic pavilion at the VFW Hall Post 1841 on the Roanoke Road.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Percy Bolton loved to help veterans. He passed away a year ago this past June, but his memory has been honored by a picnic pavilion dedicated in his memory on Oct. 12. He was a VA hospital veteran for 39 years and he was post commander for 19 years. He also perfected the sauce and chicken barbecuing technique at the Lord Botetourt High School BBQ, shed cooking thousands of chickens over the years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With Bolton's family in attendance, the VFW led a ceremony that lasted about 45 minutes to honor his memory and included a sermonette by Rev. Carl Collins, a 94-year-old chaplain and veteran who also officiated over the dedication ceremony.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The eight tables under the pavilion were made with donations from area businesses. Boy Scout Troop 333, sponsored by the post, provided two Eagle Scouts, Michael Dant and Michael McCormack, and Eagle Scout candidate David Bordette, who along with community support and troop leaders built the picnic shelter.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Last month, accompanied by shelter animals, the League of Animal Protection asked the Botetourt County school board to sell the building it occupies and a small parcel of land to the group for $85,000. The nonprofit group had raised the funds for the purchase. The school board studied the matter and made the decision not to sell.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The LAP has been located in the old Botetourt County animal pound since the 1990s. The building and kennels sit on the acreage beside Central Academy middle school and is owned by the Botetourt County school division.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The reason for the offer came out in the September meeting. The LAP wanted to make shelter improvements to the building including adding a new bathroom.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Botetourt County School Board decided against selling the building and a slice of land to the LAP during closed session on Thursday, Oct. 9. When the Botetourt View spoke with Chairman Ruth Wallace, she said after talks with Sammy Oakey, a board member of the LA,P and shelter director Pat Shaver, that they felt it would be much easier to give LAP a perpetual lease that will automatically renew every 10 years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Shaver was circumspect over the decision.&quot;The school division has been good to us and we are very thankful. Our lease will continue to renew every 10 years for as long as we need it. We will go ahead and begin the renovations to the building.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">LBHS BOOSTERS TO RAISE FUNDS FOR CONSTRUCTION</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A baseball/softball committee plans to raise at least $124,000 to put up an enclosed batting cage and pitching metal building on the west side of the Lord Botetourt High School campus behind the baseball field. It took some convincing for the school board to approve the measure on Thursday Oct. 9. With the addition of a central office administrator to the building committee and assurances that at least $75,000 of the needed money is in the bank prior to a shovel of dirt being turned, the building was approved.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Economy woes and the size of the building were apparent concerns when the school board questioned LBHS assistant principal Tim Bane and booster club members about the project. The building will not need water and heat because the concession stand has water and bathroom facilities, but the school board will get the responsibility of another electric bill and upkeep upon completion. The metal building is 4,400 square feet and will hold batting cages and pitching runs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">BOTETOURT COUNTY SCHOOLS FULLY ACCREDITED</span></p>

He said the Virginia Department of Education Accepted the appeal of Central Academy's scores that had caused them not to pass the AYP in Science. Now all county schools have achieved the Annual Yearly Progress ( No Child Left Behind) benchmark.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Presidential pumpkins</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some kids are more creative than others in coming up with government extra credit projects at Lord Botetourt. Assistant principal Mike Ketron was impressed by the creativity of two seniors, Brittany Hambrick and Meghan Sealey, who carved jack o'lanterns that look like John McCain and Barack Obama. He saw to it that the pumpkins and their creators were photographed for the Botetourt View's Autumn Snapshot Contest. (For details, see the ad in this week's issue or go online to The Notebook on botetourtview.com.) The pair carved the pumpkins for extra credit in U.S. Government class.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The two girls got the patterns from the Internet. Here are the pumpkins lit up for the election!</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A number of the 35 members of the the YOVASO (Youth of VA Speak Out About Traffic Safety) Club at Lord Botetourt High School came out Oct. 11 to wash cars as a fundraiser to enable the group to get door prizes for activities.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The past few weeks have been busy competing in the &quot;Save Your Tailgate Challenge&quot;. The campaign is a competition between participating Virginia schools to increase safety belt educational and awareness activities at the high school level and to increase overall seat belt use among teenagers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The goal is to help students form a lifelong buckle-up habit through education and awareness. A few examples of activities that the students have been doing include seatbelt checks, banners and signs around the school, school announcements, seatbelt and traffic statistics information handed out at school and at the homecoming football game, car bash, car wash, chalkboard messages and much more. The club hopes to have all students and staff sign the buckle up petition to show their support for seat-belt usage.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Larry Carter and Steve Austin were honored at the Oct. 9 school board meeting for being selected to Regional VHSL Awards of Merit.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Carter, the retired Athletic Director at Lord Botetourt High School, won the Region II 2008 Regional Award of Merit for his athletic knowledge and assistance to not only his district, but also to others in the region. Carter was a popular teacher at the school as well.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Austin is a 1972 graduate of James River High School and he has spent over 30 years in volunteer service to the athletic programs there, he keeps statistics for the football team and as the PA announcer for gym sports has been a real asset to the school, said Sheila Proffit, athletic director. He won the Region C Regional Award of Merit. On behalf of the school board, Wallace presented certificates of recognition to the two honorees.</span></p>
