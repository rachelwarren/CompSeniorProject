  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">All the problems we have today stem from Congress</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We can solve our energy crisis immediately and cheaply by harnessing all the self-congratulatory hot air that will be coming out of Washington in the next few months.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The gusher of declarations of how Congress saved our bacon should sustain us for years. Their proclamations and assertions of bipartisan best and patriotic duty will warm the coldest foreclosed home.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Unfortunately, they are right. But they were doing their best to save their collective places at the trough.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This was not about Main Street. It was solely about political survival. The roots of every problem we have today can be traced to Congress, whether it's the economy, health care, Iraq, education or immigration. Either its cowardly inaction and deregulation, or its short-sighted restrictions and control have been the cause of the present situation. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We need more than cosmetic changes in Congress, more than simply voting out the old and inserting new pegs in the same old holes. We need a restructuring of how Congress operates. New rules.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Abolish the old system of seniority. Each committee chairman should be from the minority party. Or have a shared chairmanship. But in the end, we got what we deserved.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democrats caused the financial meltdown</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In my 77-plus years, I have never witnessed so few politicians detrimentally affecting so many citizens. The politicians and media would have us believe that the monetary crisis is all Wall Street's fault. However, the record is clear on how the Democratic Congress not only gave birth to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but nurtured their existence and was instrumental in their insolvency.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For their part, Democrats Maxine Waters of California, Gregory Meeks of New York, Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Chris Dodd of Connecticut, by supporting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, played a major role in the present monetary meltdown and should be held accountable, if not by Congress, at least by their constituents.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As an independent voter voting for the candidate rather than the party, I cannot, in all honesty, vote Democratic this time around.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Listen to Truman: Vote Democratic</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There they go again. Republican John McCain and his running mate are trying to divert the attention of the public from the abysmal condition of the economy by mounting vicious attacks against Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anyone who listens to Obama's plans can see that he means to cut taxes for 95 percent of the population and to use a sensible, measured approach to the problems facing our country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In his frenzy to divert the attention of the people from the condition of the United States, McCain lurches from one ill-considered idea to another. His real philosophy, which he shares with President Bush and the Republican Party, shines through in spite of him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Once the Republicans fool enough of the people in order to get their votes and squeeze into office, they set about destroying the safety nets put in place by FDR and other Democrats.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wake up, people! Harry Truman said, &quot;How many times do you have to be hit over the head before you figure out who's hitting you?&quot; Vote Democratic on Nov. 4.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The people snoozed, their economy loses</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The U.S. economy is in a financial quagmire created mostly by two mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. While this $700 billion debt is yet expanding, our political leaders are hunkered down in the &quot;valley of indecision&quot; seeking only recrimination rather than solution.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It is ironic how brave our congressional leadership can be giving away billions to the so-called poor, yet when impoverished borrowers by the tens of thousands would default on their loans, that generous bravado is now AWOL taking credit for the mortgage crisis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Debt Mountain has caved in on a na&iuml;ve, sleeping public, in a deep sleep closely akin to that of the present inept Congress. From the individual household to the Oval Office, this financial meltdown is about us, the snoozers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We citizens have allowed the politicians to play God and do our bidding as to who is more deserving to receive a home loan. Seldom mentioned by lenders to the borrower was an age-old, unwritten doctrine, &quot;You must show proof your earnings are sufficient to repay the loan.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Worse yet, many bankers were required by law to make loans to people who were for the most part penniless.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain is proven by time, sacrifice</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At this crucial time in American history, we have two candidates: one hardened, forged, by American tradition, sacrifice and maturity. John McCain could have returned to an easy life after unspeakable torture in a lost, humiliating war. Inspired by Ronald Reagan, he has chosen lifelong commitment to this nation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">America knows the character of John McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain stands for the highest office in the world opposed by an inexperienced man, untested by life, with neither accomplished record nor personal sacrifice, surrounded by emotional adulation. There are facts and associations to alarm.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Would Americans have a far-left liberal upon inauguration teamed with the known Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi, or the newly image-crafted centrist? Who is the real Barack Obama away from managed artifice? Does even Obama know?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Who is McCain? Americans and world leaders, friend and foe, do know. Unlike Obama, he has not morphed in the campaign. Not since Dwight Eisenhower have voters had the choice of an American servant who knows who he is, why he serves and what is required to lead forward the United States of America.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Questions she'd like to ask Obama</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After the lame, repetitious questions of the Oct. 7 debate, I have a few of my own.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Obama, why are you friends with people who hate America, the country you wish to govern? Do you support the plans of unrepentant terrorist Bill Ayers, your early supporter, to radicalize our children's education? Do you agree with your pastor of 20 years and spiritual mentor that America deserved what happened on 9/11?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You've repeatedly called your wife one of your closest advisers. Do you sympathize with her characterization of America as a &quot;downright mean country&quot; when so many of our soldiers have died for the freedoms of others around the world?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Obama, when you are through instituting your &quot;changes&quot; to the greatest nation in history, limiting gun rights and redistributing wealth and appointing liberal, activist radicals to the Supreme Court, will it be at all distinguishable from European-style socialism? Will I recognize this country that I love after four years in your hands?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Don't move DMV into pricey new digs</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Our governor and the Virginia General Assembly have really run off the road with this issue. Why do we need to spend so much money for a new DMV office in Roanoke? The rent on the current office is $150,000 a year. The rent for the proposed new office will run $416,562 a year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Are we not paying attention to Wall Street here at home in Virginia? Let's tell the DMV and the General Assembly we don't need more violations of taxpayers' hard-earned money. Let this be one of the first steps on the road of correcting our Virginia budget shortcomings.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Too many cats, too many mice . . .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I think I may have come up with a permanent solution to the latest crisis in Roanoke, but since I live in Radford, I guess no one thought to call me. It really might solve two problems.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Have the city manager's staff (read: city council) round up all the feral cats in town, have them fixed (as we say here) and turn them loose in the City Market Building. No more mice, and the cats have a place to hang out. As they say in the Visa ad: priceless.</span></p>
