  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republicans John McCain and Sarah Palin, on their way to Lancaster for an afternoon rally today, will portray themselves here as reformers who will &quot;drain the Washington swamp&quot; and fight special interests, aides and recent appearances suggest.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The GOP presidential nominee will renew his emphasis on his reputation as a maverick and call for more offshore drilling and support for nuclear power.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arriving here just five days after winning his party's nomination, McCain is expected to criticize Democratic opponent Barack Obama's position on the surge strategy in Iraq - another staple of his stump speech. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Running mate Palin, meantime, has launched a new line of attack on Obama and his use of congressional earmarks, money for projects that lawmakers try to get for their home districts and constituents - a theme she is likely to repeat here.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Just the other day our opponent brought up earmarks - and frankly I was surprised that he would even raise the subject at all,&quot; Palin said at a rally Monday in Missouri. &quot;I thought he wouldn't want to go there.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Local Republicans expect a capacity crowd - 6,500 to 7,000 supporters - to greet McCain and Palin in their first post-convention visit to Pennsylvania and Lancaster County.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The U.S. senator from Arizona and his surprise pick for vice president, the governor of Alaska, were to speak at a 3:30 p.m. rally at Franklin &amp; Marshall College's Alumni Sports &amp; Fitness Center.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The excitement surrounding this visit is proof of the enthusiasm for the McCain-Palin ticket among voters in Central Pennsylvania,&quot; said McCain spokesman Paul Lindsay.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;These are two mavericks who have a record of reform that they will bring to Washington in order to get our economy moving again and put government on the side of the people.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain and Palin were expected to fly into Lancaster Airport at 1:30 p.m. aboard the presidential nominee's campaign plane, &quot;Straight Talk Air.&quot; They were speaking before some 5,000 supporters at a rally in Lebanon, Ohio, late this morning.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;What we're going to do, what we have to do is take our message of reform - because Washington desperately needs reform - all across this nation to everyone in every party or no party at all,&quot; Palin said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We are committed to that reform. That's what John McCain, that's what I am all about. It's going to be small-town America getting us to where we need to get that reform,&quot; Palin said. &quot;It's with your help and with your vote we're going to Washington, and we're going to shake things up.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;John McCain doesn't walk with the Washington herd,&quot; she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin also talked at length about spending cuts she made as Alaska's governor, and how she took on the state's &quot;good-old-boys network.&quot; She also repeated her criticism of Obama for trying to win congressional earmarks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;So as we reformed the abuses of earmarks in our state, our opponent was requesting nearly $1 billion in earmarks,&quot; she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama hasn't asked for any earmarks this year. Last year, he asked for $311 million worth, about $25 for every Illinois resident. Alaska asked this year for earmarks totaling $198 million, about $295 for every Alaska citizen.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin has cut back on pork project requests. But, under her administration, Alaska is still by far the largest per-capita consumer of federal pet-project spending, according to news reports. The governor did reject plans to build the notorious &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot; after Congress had cut off its financing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin said in Ohio that &quot;I told Congress thanks but no thanks for that Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain, speaking after Palin this morning, said, &quot;I can't wait to introduce her to Washington, D.C., and the big spenders ... she'll take 'em on like she did in Alaska.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Change is coming, and real change is coming to Washington, D.C.,&quot; McCain said. &quot;You've got a team of mavericks.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As McCain and Palin make their way to the college, a group of community organizers from across the state was expected to gather outside the field house and criticize the GOP's attempts to minimize their work.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The group, led by former Green Party gubernatorial candidate Michael Morrill, will try to deliver a petition to the Republicans calling on them to &quot;stop their attacks on their chosen career,&quot; according to a statement, and asking for an apology for &quot;the demeaning attacks on the important work that we do to strengthen our communities and our great nation.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Several Republicans, speaking at the party's convention last week, ridiculed Barack Obama's work as a community organizer in Chicago two decades ago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democratic state Rep. Mike Sturla, of Lancaster, and other local Democrats held their own news conference late this morning to criticize the GOP ticket, just as Gov. Ed Rendell, city Mayor Rick Gray and U.S. Sen. Harris Wofford did here on Monday afternoon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rendell focused his attack on what he said are &quot;lies&quot; perpetuated by Republicans, including McCain and Palin, about Obama's tax plans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Speaker after speaker after speaker (at the Republican National Convention) created the impression in the American people's minds that Barack Obama was going to raise their taxes. Television ad after television ad, you can't hear a television ad without hearing Barack Obama's going to raise taxes,&quot; Rendell said.</span></p>
