  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Republican John McCain tried yesterday to create controversy about his presidential rival's connections to a Palestinian scholar and compared Barack Obama to George McGovern and Jimmy Carter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In radio interviews while campaigning in Florida, which has a large Jewish voting population, McCain accused the Los Angeles Times of bias for declining to release a video it obtained of Obama attending a 2003 going-away party in Chicago for Rashid Khalidi. Khalidi is a Palestinian-rights advocate and critic of Israel. He was leaving the University of Chicago for a job as a professor at Columbia University in New York. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At the party, which the Times wrote about last April, Obama praised Khalidi and vice versa. But Khalidi also told the Times in that story that he disagreed with Obama's pro-Israel views.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The International Republican Institute, under McCain's leadership in the 1990s, donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to a Palestinian research organization that Khalidi helped found.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Asked about Obama's plans to raise taxes on the wealthy and give most families a tax cut, McCain said: &quot;I won't call him a socialist.... That's what George McGovern wanted to do. That's what Jimmy Carter did, and we're not going to do it.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain repeatedly suggested in his radio interviews the presence at the Khalidi party of another controversial Obama acquaintance: Bill Ayers, a former member of the anti-Vietnam War group the Weather Underground.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It wasn't immediately clear whether Ayers attended the Khalidi event, McCain adviser Mark Salter acknowledged.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain said in Tampa that while current economic problems will pass, threats against the nation will not - and that Obama is not up to the task of protecting the United States.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Returning to the issue of national security, his central theme before the financial crisis erupted, McCain asked rhetorically whether Obama had the wisdom and judgment to be commander in chief.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain last night derided Obama's half-hour TV ad as a &quot;gauzy, feel-good commercial&quot; paid for with broken promises.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And one of his spokesmen, Tucker Bounds, circulated an e-mail saying, &quot;As anyone who has bought anything from an infomercial knows, the sales job is always better than the product. Buyer beware.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain ended his day by telling CNN's Larry King that racism will play virtually no role on Election Day because it will be trumped by the nation's economic problems.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain said people will vote &quot;for the best of reasons, not the worst of reasons.&quot; He said most people will vote based on who they want to lead the country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain also rejected a suggestion by talk show host Rush Limbaugh that Colin Powell's endorsement of Obama was because both men are black. Powell is a Republican and former secretary of state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Arizona senator said he was surprised at how controversial his vice presidential running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, has become. In many polls, she is disliked by as many as or more people than like her.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I got to tell you, every time I'm around her, I'm uplifted. This is a solid, dedicated, reformer. A fine governor,&quot; McCain said.</span></p>
