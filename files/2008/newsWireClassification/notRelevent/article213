  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Now that folksy is in, I don't mind admitting that the first line of Joe Biden's latest e-mail reminded me of my grandmother.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;The McCain campaign is on the ropes,&quot; Biden wrote Wednesday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Don't count your chickens before they hatch,&quot; my grandmother used to say. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Since Aesop wrote fables, people have known that it's dangerous to assume they'll have something before it's in their hands. That's especially true for presidential campaigns with three weeks to go until Election Day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And yet, it's hard to fault Barack Obama and running mate Biden for a burst of confidence this close to the finish line. John McCain's campaign legs do look shaky.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Many pundits are rushing to declare the presidential election over. Some are even talking about an Obama landslide. That's because polls show Obama with a widening lead over John McCain nationally and Obama gaining ground in key states. Other polls show that people trust Obama more than McCain to fix the devastated economy. The stars seem to be aligning in Obama's favor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Political scientist Larry Sabato said Thursday that for the first time it appears that Obama has the necessary 270 electoral votes to win, with more on the way.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Sabato left little room for a turnabout. &quot;It is always theoretically possible that the final presidential debate or another intervening 'big event' domestically or in foreign affairs could give McCain an electoral shot in the arm, so that he can make up some or all of the lost ground,&quot; he wrote in his &quot;Crystal Ball&quot; newsletter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Yet,&quot; Sabato concluded, &quot;time is growing short for major upheavals.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> BUT IF THE 2000 election taught us anything, it's that it's not over until the Supreme Court says it's over.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Besides, this isn't the first time McCain had been declared dead. One year before he accepted the Republican presidential nomination, he was written off.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It's always risky to assume pollsters know the voters' minds, especially this year. Besides, what's the harm in waiting for people to vote and have their votes counted before anointing the winner?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> After all, an October surprise could still alter the presidential race. So far, what's got everybody's attention is the stock market's shocking plunge, despite the many emergency measures aimed at quieting investor fears.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The current economic anxiety redounds to Obama's benefit, because people think he's better able to deal with the crisis, pollsters say. Plus, Obama's storied cool demeanor is serving him well, while McCain can't get his economic footing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> AT THE SECOND debate, McCain tried to put himself on the side of ordinary Americans by saying he would have the federal government buy bad home mortgages to help people stay in their homes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The McCain campaign initially indicated that the government would buy the mortgages at a discount, which would save the taxpayers money. The next day, though, the campaign said that was a mistake, and that the government would actually pay the existing face value of the loans. This is a huge boon for the banking industry and it means higher costs for taxpayers, who, of course, are already footing the bailout bills.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama seized on the issue and said that McCain wanted to &quot;massively overpay&quot; for the mortgages. He put up a campaign ad, arguing that the country can't afford &quot;more of the same&quot; on the economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> IN A PAGE from Republican presidential campaigns gone by, McCain's chief strategy seems to be to try to scare people off Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Who is the real Sen. Obama?&quot; McCain asks at rallies. He and Sarah Palin have tied Obama to Vietnam Era-radical William Ayers and other unsavory characters. They impugn Obama's honesty as well as his policies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The problem with the personal attacks, Michelle Obama told Jon Stewart on &quot;The Daily Show,&quot; is that Obama has been on the campaign trail for 20 months. He survived a bitter primary campaign in which his competitors threw out many of the same questions, and he won anyway.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Besides, does McCain really want to remind voters about his friendship with political donor Charles Keating Jr? That led to McCain's being one of the senators implicated in the Keating Five scandal during the collapse of the savings and loan industry.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> So, yes, Biden shouldn't count his chickens before they hatch. And McCain should remember something else my grandmother said: &quot;People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.&quot;</span></p>
