  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">NASHVILLE, Tenn.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Who does America want at the helm in a time of crisis, an erratic gambler or a dangerous radical? o That's the stark choice being portrayed by Barack Obama and John McCain as they prepare for their second debate tonight - each is looking to frame the other in the darkest possible terms heading into the final month of the campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama, having opened a lead and looking to seal the deal, heads into the debate portraying himself as the steady hand of calm leadership and slamming McCain as a knee-jerk hothead ill- suited to handle the nation's crises, economic or otherwise. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain, looking to stop Obama's momentum, is hammering his rival's ties to controversial characters in Chicago as signs of his radical and unpredictable ways.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As both take aim, their shots are underscored by the continuing turmoil in the markets and fresh warnings Monday that the economy is in for tough times ahead despite Friday's approval of a $700 billion bank bailout.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Indeed, the economy is likely to dominate the questions posed to the two men tonight. The 90-minute debate will feature questions from a live audience in a town hall format moderated by NBC's Tom Brokaw.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;In difficult times, people want a sense of calm reassurance,&quot; said Dennis Goldford, a political scientist at Drake University in Iowa. &quot;Obama, as he did in the first debate, is going to try to come across as calm and reassuring. He's going to hit the economy hard and emphasize that McCain is erratic.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the days and hours leading up to the debate, Obama was striving to portray McCain as a reckless leader who would make impulsive, poorly reasoned moves with the country's future.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Erratic in a crisis,&quot; a new Obama&nbsp;ad says of McCain. &quot;Out of touch.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Sen. McCain and his operatives are gambling that he can distract you,&quot; Obama said Sunday, using the word &quot;gambling&quot; as a red flag to draw some connection between McCain's fondness for casino betting and his alleged style of leadership.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's campaign also launched a new attack Monday on McCain's role in the Keating Five savings-and-loan scandal, named for the head of a failed S&amp;L and the five lawmakers accused of improperly helping him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A Senate Ethics Committee inquiry ultimately cleared McCain while rebuking him for &quot;poor judgment.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Monday, Obama said McCain is trying to shift attention from the troubled economy because his advisers fear it could cause him to lose the election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I've got news for the McCain campaign: The American people are losing right now,&quot; he said. &quot;They're losing their jobs. They're losing their health care. They're losing their homes. They're losing their savings. I cannot imagine anything more important to talk about.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain goes into the debate trailing in national polls and in surveys of many battleground states.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;McCain has to try to convince voters Obama is a risky choice,&quot; said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Polling Institute at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While Obama accuses McCain of being reckless, McCain is slamming Obama on taxes, and his running mate Sarah Palin is raising issues of character.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Monday, McCain called Obama a liar as he leveled his harshest criticism yet.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Speaking about the financial crisis, McCain took offense at Obama's accusation that McCain opposed regulation that would have prevented the credit crunch. &quot;I guess he believes if a lie is big enough and repeated often enough it will be believed,&quot; McCain said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Arizona senator, a veteran of more than two decades in Congress, told his audience that while he is a known quantity, the same cannot be said about Obama, who is midway through his first term as a senator from Illinois.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;You need to know who you're putting in the White House - where the candidate came from and what he or she believes,&quot; McCain said. &quot;And you need to know now, before it is time to choose.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin spent the days leading up to the debate ripping Obama for his past ties to 1960s radical William Ayers, who has refused to apologize for his role in a group that bombed U.S. buildings to protest the Vietnam War. He's now a Chicago college professor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Monday, Palin embarked on a discussion of Obama's relationship with his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In an interview with conservative New York Times columnist William Kristol published Monday, the Alaska governor said there should be more discussion about Wright, Obama's pastor of 20 years at Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago. The Democratic candidate denounced Wright and severed ties with the church last spring after videotapes surfaced showing Wright making anti-American and anti-Semitic comments from the pulpit.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I don't know why that association isn't discussed more,&quot; Palin said, &quot;because those were appalling things that that pastor had said about our great country.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In April, McCain condemned the North Carolina Republican Party for an ad that called Obama &quot;too extreme&quot; because Wright was his pastor.</span></p>
