  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain doesn't have all the skills needed to be president</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I admit upfront that I am not a John McCain for president supporter. I respect him, but I just cannot get behind most of his policy positions. McCain's selection of Gov. Sarah Palin, however, as his vice presidential running mate has taken my concerns about his candidacy to a different level.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I no longer just question McCain's policies, I also seriously question his judgment. And I know my questioning his judgment is not limited to me and other Democrats. Many Republicans are also scratching their heads and asking themselves, &quot;What was he thinking?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I'm all for mavericks and those who think outside of the box. They are often the people who keep things moving forward in a progressive way, so stagnation and the status quo don't block healthy change. McCain's decision to choose Palin as his running mate, however, is not the act of such a person. It is a decision done more for ideological reasons and appearances than for the welfare and security of this nation. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain does not exhibit the sound judgment of a candidate with the necessary skills to lead the United States in dealing with the enormous challenges of the 21st century.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain chose well -- for Obama</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thank you, John McCain. Thank you for making the biggest mistake of your political life in choosing someone with a r&eacute;sum&eacute; the size of a pamphlet to be your running mate just because she is a woman.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You've all but handed Barack Obama the White House on a silver platter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As a woman, I am insulted that you think my vote is so easily won. Believe it or not, I vote according to the issues that are important to me, not according to the gender of the candidate. Who would be comfortable with her being next in line for the presidency?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You had your pick of combat veterans, senators and seasoned politicians with years of experience. Yet you picked the first-term governor of a state with fewer than 1 million people.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In doing so, you have obliterated one of your biggest arguments against Obama, which was that he didn't have the experience to lead the country. Try pulling that now that you've chosen someone as your vice president whose main responsibility has been leading the PTA.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thank you, McCain. We'll be laughing all the way to the Oval Office.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Blame Bush policies, not their execution</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Even dyed-in-the-wool Republicans have soured on George W. Bush. But they plan to vote for John McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It seems the mess in which we find ourselves -- mired in foreign wars, foreclosures and bailouts, towering national debt and trade unbalance, astronomical oil prices and a recession scheduled to begin on Inauguration Day -- is not the result of Bush's policies. These were good policies. Unfortunately, they were incompetently executed by a callow moron whom we were misled into electing, twice.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If we put McCain in there,&quot; say my GOP friends, &quot;he'll get it right.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain, obsessed with Vietnam, has clung to this kind of thinking like a Teddy bear. It was a good and righteous war. If we had only stuck with it, we would have emerged victorious. It was Johnson's fault. The Democratic president lost the support of the American people. That pesky Tet offensive? It was a Viet Cong defeat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now we have the chance to do it over again, with a heroic Navy pilot at the controls.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I'm sorry. It's the policies, stupid! You can execute them right, or you can do it wrong. The result will be the same: a continuing disaster.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rasoul is trying to inform voters</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">How ironic that The Roanoke Times criticizes Sam Rasoul for trying to inform voters about the issues in the race for Virginia's 6th Congressional District (&quot;Rasoul will debate himself on YouTube,&quot; Aug. 28 editorial).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ironic, but not surprising, given your lack of coverage of the campaigns, especially compared to your daily coverage of the presidential campaigns and several-times-weekly reporting on the U.S. Senate campaign in Virginia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Every voter in the 6th District has a larger percentage of the vote in the congressional campaign than in the other two races, making your reporting inversely proportional to the impact each voter has.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If the newspaper won't inform the public, it should at least refrain from chastising a candidate who attempts to do your job for you. Maybe it is that competition that worries you more than the need to inform your readers on the issues.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's nomination was pricey propaganda</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barack Hussein Obama's coronation at the toga party in the Rocky Mountain Greek temple epitomizes the Hollywood slick marketing of liberal progressive Democrats throughout this country in the elections of 2008.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This excessively expensive, wasteful, monstrous extravaganza continues the media-created Obamamania package that is designed to mislead American people to turn over our future to a bunch of socialist elitists who promise to regulate our economy and destroy incentives for upward mobility and the American Dream.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">However well-intended, this candidate is a front man offering feel-good solutions that have historically proven to be mirages. They are founded upon the discredited communist dogma of &quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs,&quot; under which Obama and his bureaucratic hench-people will determine your and my needs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The millions spent promoting this scam would have been better spent on the country's poorest in education, health services, housing and other life-supporting essentials. Instead, those who funded this spectacle will have great needs that will require payback and handouts. And from where will the money come? From your and my higher taxes and redistributions from our defense.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That is the change that Obama promises.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Put the rail yard in Pulaski County</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I oppose the site of a Norfolk Southern intermodal rail yard in Montgomery County. This is beautiful farmland, and we should preserve it for its proper use. Pulaski County should be the site because it can be located in an area that does not involve farmland.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I encourage everyone to write the following person to reconsider Pulaski County: Robin C. Chapman, Manager, Public Relations, Norfolk Southern Corp., Three Commercial Place, Norfolk, VA 22309.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Drug testing has gone too far</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In competitive sports, there has been a shift from one extreme to another. Athletes are being subjected to multiple tests and harassment. They are too comprehensive, picking up anything from cough medicine, herbal remedies, cortisone and supplements to ADHD medicine.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The worst part is that these tests are interpreted subjectively. They have never been calibrated for false positive ratio. Moreover, no baselines in body chemistry have been established. For example, a positive in synthetic testosterone in men could be just a boost in natural testosterone.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Therefore, it is possible that innocent people, such as perhaps Justin Gatlin and Floyd Landis, will be falsely punished and labeled. It is also likely that a positive may be accidentally acquired. Don't athletes have the right to repair their bodies just like everyone else?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Such cases as Ben Johnson, whose yellowish eyes and bulging veins were a giveaway, or Chinese and Soviet-bloc women, whose masculinity was blatant, show the need for testing. However, testing should be limited to basic anabolic steroids in men and testosterone in women. Unless it's therapeutic, protracted drug use usually hinders rather than enhances performances.</span></p>
