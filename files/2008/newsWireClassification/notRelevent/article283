  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WASHINGTON</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The House of Representatives approved the $700 billion Wall Street bailout Friday, setting in motion the biggest government intervention in the financial system since the Great Depression . President Bush quickly signed the bill.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Treasury Department officials vowed to move swiftly to use sweeping new powers to try to stabilize markets and ease deepening fears about the economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The vote took place amid fears that the financial turmoil was paralyzing sources of credit vital to businesses, governments and consumers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The House's 263-171 vote was a sharp reversal from Monday, when the chamber rejected a similar bill and the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 777 points. Lawmakers from both parties described Friday's vote, coming a month before they face re-election, as among the most gut-wrenching of their careers. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I may lose my race over this,&quot; said Rep. Sue Myrick, R-N.C., who voted for the bill Friday after opposing it earlier in the week. &quot;But that's OK, because I believe in my heart I'm doing the right thing.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Proponents sought to portray the measure as important to ordinary Americans even as some made clear their contempt for Wall Street's recklessness.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Those greedy pigs on Wall Street don't deserve help from hardworking Americans,&quot; said Rep. Lee Terry, R-Neb., another vote convert. &quot;But allowing them to fail will cause so many other businesses ... to lose access to credit, lose business.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Before Monday's vote, Congress had been deluged with calls and e-mails from constituents opposed to the bailout plan, but Monday's stark market drop was greeted by public outrage and led to four days of heavy lobbying for the proposal. Senate leaders added tax breaks and other sweeteners to the measure and passed it Wednesday. On Friday, the bill won 58 new yes votes in the House, clinching passage.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We have acted boldly to help prevent the crisis on Wall Street from becoming a crisis in communities across our country,&quot; Bush said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nonetheless, markets closed down Friday .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The 451-page Emergency Economic Stabilization Act grants the Treasury secretary unprecedented authority to buy as much as $700 billion of troubled assets from ailing financial institutions in an effort to stave off more bankruptcies and provide cash for new loans to ease the credit market freeze.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lawmakers demanded numerous changes to the Treasury Department's original three-page proposal, including limits on how much company executives can be paid if their companies sell assets to the government. Congress also added an oversight board to supervise the program, raised the cap on bank deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to $250,000 from $100,000, and required steps to help homeowners avoid foreclosure.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sweeteners added an estimated $150 billion in costs, including one provision that shields 24 million taxpayers from the Alternative Minimum Tax. The new law also has tax relief provisions for disaster victims; research and development tax credits; a hybrid car tax credit; and tax breaks for teachers who spend their own money on school supplies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Many House members said they were reluctant to help an unpopular financial sector and to approve new federal spending but felt they had no choice.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Nobody in East Tennessee hates the fact more than me that I'm going to vote yes,&quot; said Rep. Zack Wamp, a Republican who came to favor the bill after helping defeat it in Monday's 228-205 vote. &quot;Things are really bad, and we don't have any choice.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I am just as angry and frustrated as many of those who have called my office,&quot; said Rep. Jerry McNerney, D-Calif., who voted yes both times. &quot;But I voted for it because my constituents' 401(k)s, their life savings, and the ability to take out car, home and student loans hang in the balance.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Preparing for the political fallout, Rep. Jim Marshall, D-Ga., has begun airing a TV ad in his district in which he declares: &quot;I don't like this rescue plan any more than you do. ... But I'm not going to stand by and let this crisis undermine our economy and damage the financial future of everyone in America.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Overall, Democrats in the House favored the bill 172-63 in Friday's vote; Republicans voted 108-91 against it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Monday's vote, Democrats voted 140-95 in favor; Republicans voted 133-65 against. Between the two votes, 33 Democrats switched their votes to yes, while one Democrat changed his vote from yes to no. Twenty-five Republicans switched to yes, and one other Republican voted yes Friday after missing Monday's vote.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The presidential candidates - Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain - took part in a broad-based effort to lobby lawmakers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">To demonstrate their concern for &quot;Main Street,&quot; the House approved a separate measure to extend unemployment benefits. That bill needs Senate approval.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Despite the political shift in favor of the bill, opponents remained steadfast. They included a coalition of liberals and conservatives.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This is not a time for panic,&quot; said Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif. &quot;Why do we need to give $700 billion to one man to play hedge-fund god from the gilded offices of the United States Treasury?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rep. Paul Hodes, D-N.H., said that despite improvements, the bill focused &quot;too much on Wall Street.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With lawmakers now heading home for the fall campaign, Congress will wait until next year to consider tougher regulations on financial institutions. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said lawmakers next year will &quot;do some serious surgery on the financial structure.&quot;<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">HOW THEY VOTED</span><br /></p>

In all, 91 Republicans joined 172 Democrats to support the measure, while 108 Republicans and 63 Democrats voted &quot;no.&quot;</span></p>
