  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Drunk-blogging</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We've mentioned a couple of times in this space the blog Get Drunk and Vote for McCain. But it's not the only conservative political site that might not win the MADD seal of approval.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Stephen Green, the self-described Vodka Pundit (http://vodkapundit.com), &quot;liveblogged&quot; last week's debate between Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain. Only he did it with a twist (of lemon or lime?); he &quot;drunkblogged&quot; it at Pajamas Media (http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/drunkblogging-tonights-mccain-obama-bout/)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Take a shot every time McCain uses any variation on the word 'crony.' Pajamas Media, its affiliates, employees and advertisers cannot be held responsible for any alcohol poisoning. Closed course, professional driver,&quot; Mr. Green wrote. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At 7:56 p.m. (the post used Mountain time), he wrote, &quot;You know how bad this debate is? I'm skipping my third martini and going straight to a double vodka rocks. Maybe a triple.&quot; But two minutes later came this sober-sounding lulu, citing an answer from Mr. Obama: &quot;Health insurance 'is a right.' We were endowed by our Creator with a really sweet no-co-pay plan from Aetna, and maybe some free speech. At least I think that's what Jefferson wrote.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His quick assessment: a McCain victory but &quot;not by nearly enough to matter.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gay overreach</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gay bloggers last week faced up to the suddenly real possibility that voters in the solidly blue state (California) would amend their constitution to define marriage as the union of a man and a woman, overturning a state Supreme Court decision.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">B. Daniel Blatt of West Hollywood, who blogs under the persona &quot;Gay Patriot West&quot; at Gay Patriot (http://www.gaypatriot .net/), attributed the recent polling turnaround on Proposition 8 to an ad by the amendment's backers framing the issue as one of popular sovereignty, overreaching judges and arrogant lawmakers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The repetition of San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom's exclamation that gay marriage would happen 'whether you like it or not' combined with the inclusion of the line that 'four judges ignored four million voters' makes it appear that the initiative merely restrains an overzealous judiciary and restores sovereignty to the people. People don't like courts resolving controversial social issues.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Blatt, who founded the Northern Virginia Log Cabin Republicans chapter, also lamented last week's Connecticut Supreme Court decision declaring gay marriage a right in that state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;My sense is this couldn't come at a better time for gay marriage opponents. Whenever a state court acts against the will of the people who, in this case, through their elected representatives, had actually already passed landmark civil unions legislation, it increases popular support for initiatives banning gay marriage.&quot; He predicts that the Connecticut decision &quot;may well have sealed the deal for Proposition 8 in California and not the way those who cheer the decision today would like.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Christianists</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The Catholic Left, which ostensibly advocates compassion and justice in the name of Jesus Christ, does not like Sarah Palin, and finds fault with her unwed 17-year-old daughter's pregnancy, and even accuses her of apostasy,&quot; reports a miffed Joseph D'Hippolito last week at the American Thinker blog (http://www.americanthinker .com/)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In September, Michael Sean Winters picked up a Los Angeles Times report that Mrs. Palin was baptized in the Catholic Church. Her parents soon after went to Alaska and began taking their children to Wasilla Assembly of God, the Pentecostal church where a 12-year-old Sarah Palin was &quot;rebaptized.&quot; This, Mr. Winters said at the America magazine blog In All Things (http://www. americamagazine.org/blog/blog.cfm?blog_id=2), makes Mrs. Palin an apostate under Catholic teaching.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The claim was roundly denounced at the America site - all but a couple of the 23 comments called the &quot;apostasy&quot; charge ridiculous, noting among other things that Mrs. Palin was not raised a Catholic, that she has never made any formal repudiation of Catholicism, that a 12-year-old can hardly be fully accountable in the face of her parents (Mr. Winters wrongly called her a &quot;teenager&quot; ), that Pentecostalism is not a &quot;total repudiation of the Christian faith&quot; , and that Mr. Winters was comparing the young Sarah's actions with current defiance of church teaching by such adult Democrats.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. D'Hippolito went hardest on the last point - that liberal Catholics were just seeking &quot;to provide pseudo-theological cover for Catholic liberals who wish to vote for the Democratic ticket of Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden. Obama supports legalized abortion while Biden, a Catholic, opposes the Magisterium's teaching on abortion.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. D'Hippolito went on to &quot;fisk&quot; another anti-Palin September commentary from a liberal Catholic. Garry Wills wrote in the New York Times that the Alaska governor is unfit for the vice presidential spot because &quot;she was [among other things] ... a mother of an unwed and pregnant 17-year-old&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;What does an unwed daughter's pregnancy have to do with any candidate's qualifications and fitness for office? Moreover, why do liberals who criticize conservatives for obsessing about sexual matters in politics suddenly display the same obsession?&quot; Mr. D'Hippolito wrote, noting that when President Clinton was investigated for perjury and obstruction of justice surrounding the Paula Jones sexual-harassment suit, Mr. Wills went ad hominem on Special Prosecutor Kenneth W. Starr.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Assassin chic</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What side of the political spectrum made a cliche of the title phrase mentioned in the next sentence?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a post titled &quot;No Justice, No Peace?&quot; Glenn Reynolds at Instapundit (http://www.pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/) takes aim at the liberal media's latest round of caterwauling, noting that &quot;we've had nearly 8 years of lefty assassination fantasies about George W. Bush, and Bill Ayers' bombing campaign is explained away as a consequence of him having just felt so strongly about social justice, but a few people yell things at McCain rallies and suddenly it's a sign that anger is out of control in American politics? It's nice of McCain to try to tamp that down ... but, please, can we also note the staggering level of hypocrisy here? (And that's before we get to the Obama campaign's thuggish tactics aimed at silencing critics)&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In another post, Mr. Reynolds began to scratch the iceberg of all the liberal assassination fantasies about Mr. Bush, which &quot;various people, oddly, deny that such existed. Try Death of a President by Gabriel Range, or Nicholson Baker's novel, Checkpoint, just to start. Similar Obama assassination fantasies, should they appear, won't get this kid-glove treatment from Big Media, I suspect. 'It is not the first time a novelist has chosen fiction to express their point of view about American society or politics. Upton Sinclair did it. So did John Steinbeck. Nick Baker does it with more nerve and fewer pages.' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Updates reminded readers of the play &quot;I'm Going to Kill the President&quot; , which Salon called &quot;one of the most amusing plays currently running in New York ... a madcap farce about terrorism</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">and apathy in John Ashcroft's America whose performance may or may not be a federal offens &quot; And a frame capture from CBS' &quot; The Late Late Show with Craig Kilbor &quot; showing a picture of Mr. Bush and the caption &quot; Snipers Wanted.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Reynolds also linked to an example of current liberal anger, detailed by Jim Hoft at Gateway Pundit (www.gatewaypundit.blogspot.com). And to the media response.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;All week we've heard about how angry and mean the Republicans are because of 4 or 5 hecklers at the McCain-Palin rallies,&quot; wrote Mr. Hoft. &quot;Tonight: Leftists at the Philadelphia Flyers game booed Sarah Palin, her daughter Willow, and her 6 year-old daughter Piper as they went on the ice to drop the first puck of the season.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After showing a video clip, Mr. Hoft mockingly wonders aloud: &quot;Surely, the liberal media who have been all over the entire 'angry' GOP this week ... will condemn these leftist thugs for attacking a 6 year-old little girl? The New York Times is upset of course:With Sarah Palin.&quot;</span></p>
