  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Remedial Civics for registrars</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When I visited my local registrar, I requested a list of the presidential electors. The whole staff was baffled. I had to show them on their own guide ballot that we will not be voting for any presidential candidates, but rather electors. I explained that the electors would meet in their state capitols on the third Wednesday in December to cast their votes for president. Those ballots will be sent to the president of the U.S. Senate to be opened and counted in January. I wanted to see a list of each candidate's electors. Nobody knew, nor seemed to care! Where are the lists, if the registrars don't have them?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;ODU parties storm through neighborhoods,&quot; op-ed, Sept. 21, spoke of the irresponsible behavior of some Old Dominion University students in the Larchmont section of the city, west of Hampton Boulevard. I would like to add to this story.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I live on the east side of Hampton Boulevard, behind the Ted Constant Convocation Center. While every year there is a problem house or two, hosting too many parties and leaving a wake of destruction, this year's students have brought with them an unprecedented amount of trash.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The problem is not just a house or two but seems to stretch for entire blocks. These students are indifferent to community standards and decency. The neighborhood is awash in cigarette butts, broken beer bottles, aluminum cans, party cups and other assorted debris. With the recent rash of robberies, I can only think of the adage, &quot;Filth breeds pestilence.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Murdered vs. killed</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There are times when it is simply more appropriate to state that a person has been &quot;murdered&quot; in the line of duty, rather than &quot;killed,&quot; as is more typically invoked. Soldiers and sailors engaged in combat are subject to being &quot;killed&quot; in the line of duty, and it's a powerfully sad day every time it happens.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In stark contrast, on Aug. 7, Virginia Beach police detective Michael Phillips was murdered, while performing his job, by a drug-dealing thug. Let me be clear for anyone who is confused: The drug dealer purposefully fired multiple gunshots into the victim at point-blank range with the intent of ending his life.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Unfortunately, the drug dealer succeeded in murdering the detective. This is not a lecture on grammar or a debate on synonyms, but certain situations demand bluntly accurate language. Keep this in mind as the family and friends of the murdered officer watch the murderer file legal appeals for the next 25 years, at taxpayer expense, of course.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Raise the bar with McCain</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's amazing to me that we, as Americans, act surprised to find that our economy is failing, our educational system is faltering and our leadership for the future is lacking. Why are we surprised? We not only allowed this to happen; we brought it on ourselves.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We lowered the bar for obtaining credit; we lowered the bar for obtaining an education; and now, we are lowering the bar for obtaining a president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We have had presidents who pushed the bar down themselves in regard to honesty, integrity, faithfulness and morality. As Americans, we are about to take it down another notch for drug use.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We have had one president who admitted he used marijuana (&quot;but didn't inhale&quot;) and one president who was alleged to have used cocaine (&quot;when I was young and irresponsible&quot;), but, to the best of my knowledge, never have we had a presidential nominee who admitted he had committed a felony crime such as cocaine use, until now.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Admission of prior cocaine use bars one from employment in the commercial nuclear power industry. It bars one from employment in the federal government or military working in, with or around nuclear material. These rules are in place because cocaine users (present or past) are not trusted in positions of responsibility. So how can we elect a president who will have his finger on the world's nuclear button who admits to having used cocaine? By lowering the bar, that's how.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Where can we find a president who has a stellar past, who went above and beyond the call of duty, who can bring dignity, honor and morality to the White House? We can find that in John McCain. Has he always been right? No. Is he everything we always wanted in a president? No. Does he have what it takes to guide us through the tumultuous years ahead? Absolutely.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain spent time listening to talk that he didn't believe in, not 20 years in a church pew, but five years in a POW cell. McCain spent 22 years as a naval officer shooting bullets at our enemies, not two years as a community antagonist shooting staples in telephone poles. McCain spent 22 years as a U.S. senator voting on controversial bills, not eight years as a state senator voting &quot;present&quot; to avoid confrontations. The choice is clear in the upcoming election. Do we raise the bar back up to where it should be, or do we lower it yet again?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">U.S. needs energy bridge</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re &quot;Democrats will let drilling ban lapse,&quot; front page, Sept. 24:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Eighteen billion barrels of oil beneath the Outer Continental Shelf, and we don't have to pay Saudi Arabia, Venezuela or Russia a penny for any of it. Yet Rep. Bobby Scott and Democratic leaders in Congress don't think it is worth the effort to get it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Compare that to the bipartisan group, which Rep. Thelma Drake joined, that favors drilling for the oil and gas along with legislation that would have provided federal investments for inland shale and wind, solar and hydrogen.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Experts agree that changing our energy use away from fossil fuel products in the amount needed, and with acceptable prices, is at least 15 to 20 years in the future. In the meantime, we are stuck with gasoline cars and trucks, home heating oil furnaces and coal-burning generating plants. We need to move to the future, but we need a bridge to get there. Let us not make the mistake we made after the energy crisis in the 1970s.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Racial excuse-making</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re &quot;Proud American,&quot; letter, Oct. 3: Although I've never experienced the racial discrimination and life experiences of the letter writer, neither has Michelle Obama. While I have empathy for anyone who has been historically denied opportunity or even civil treatment as a matter of public policy or law, you can't legislate against stupidity or what people feel in their hearts. The civil rights movement has changed the law and public policy, but for many who never lived under the pre-Civil Rights Act conditions of segregation, the color of their skin is an all-consuming excuse for everything that isn't right in America.</span></p>
