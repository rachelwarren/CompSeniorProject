  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">TAMPA, Fla.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barack Obama radiated confidence and John McCain displayed the grit of an underdog Monday as the presidential rivals reached for the finish line of a two-year marathon with a burst of campaigning across battlegrounds from the Atlantic Coast to Arizona.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We are one day away from change in America,&quot; said Obama, a Democrat who, if he wins, would become the nation's first black president - a dream not nearly as distant on election eve as it once was. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain, too, promised to turn the page of the era of George W. Bush, and he warned about his opponent's intentions. &quot;Sen. Obama is in the far left lane&quot; of politics, he said. &quot;He's more liberal than a guy who calls himself a socialist , and that's not easy.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republican running mate Sarah Palin was even more pointed as she campaigned in Ohio. &quot;Now is not the time to experiment with socialism,&quot; she said. &quot;Our opponent's plan is just for bigger government.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Late-season attacks aside, Obama led in virtually all the pre-election polls in a race where economic concerns dominated and the war in Iraq was pushed - however temporarily - into the background.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While the overall number of early votes was unknown, statistics showed more than 29 million ballots cast in 30 states and suggested an advantage for Obama. Democrats voted in larger numbers than Republicans in North Carolina, Colorado, Florida and Iowa, all of which went for President Bush in 2004.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democrats also anticipated gains in the House and in the Senate, although Republicans battled to hold their losses to a minimum and a significant number of races were rated as tossups in the campaign's final hours.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By their near-non stop attention to states that voted Republican in 2004, both Obama and McCain acknowledged the Democrats' advantage in the presidential race.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The two rivals both began their days in Florida, a traditionally Republican state with 27 electoral votes where polls make it close.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The front-runner also choked up on the campaign's final day as he told a crowd in North Carolina of the death of his grandmother from cancer. Madelyn Payne Dunham was 86.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;She died peacefully in her sleep with my sister at her side,&quot; Obama said of the woman who had played a large role in his upbringing. &quot;And so there is great joy as well as tears.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain and his wife issued a statement of condolence.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">One day before the election, no battleground state was left unattended.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But Virginia, where no Democrat has won in 40 years , and Ohio, where no Republican president has ever lost, seemed most coveted. Together, they account for 33 electoral votes that McCain can scarcely do without.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democratic volunteers in Maryland, a state viewed as safe for Obama, called voters in next-door Virginia, where McCain trailed in the polls. The Democratic presidential candidate's visit to Virginia during the day was his 11th since he clinched the nomination.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Several hundred miles away in Ohio - the state that sealed Bush's second term in 2004 - voters waited as long as three hours in line to cast ballots in Columbus, part of heavily contested Franklin County. Poll workers handed out bottles of water to sustain them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lori Huffman, 38, a supervisor at UPS Inc., took the day off to vote early for McCain. &quot;It's exciting, isn't it?&quot; she asked, gesturing toward the long line of waiting voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This is happening all over the state, from Cleveland to Dayton,&quot; said Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat trying to deliver his state to Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama hoped so, after more than a year building an elaborate get-out-the-vote operation, first for the primary campaign, now for the general election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Democrat flew from Florida to North Carolina to Virginia, all states that went Republican in 2004, before heading home to Chicago on election eve.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Twenty-one months after he launched his campaign, he allowed, &quot;You know. I feel pretty peaceful ... I gotta say.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On a syndicated radio program, the &quot;Russ Parr Morning Show,&quot; he said, &quot;The question is going to be who wants it more,&quot; he said. &quot;And I hope that our supporters want it bad because I think the country needs it.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If wanting it were all that mattered, the race would be a toss up.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain, behind in the polls, set out on a grueling run through several traditionally Republican states that he has failed to secure. Florida, Virginia, Indiana, New Mexico and Nevada were on his itinerary, as was Pennsylvania, the only state that voted Democratic in 2004 where he still nursed hopes. His last appearance of the long day, past midnight, was a home state rally in Prescott, Ariz. Obama has been running television commercials in Arizona in the campaign's final days.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The surrogate campaigners included Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democrats and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney for the Republicans. Both lost races for their party's presidential nomination earlier in the year, and both could be expected to try again if their ticket loses the White House.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Not so, President Bush. The man who won the White House twice was out of public view .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin was racing through five Bush states Monday - Ohio, Missouri, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada - in an effort to boost conservative turnout for McCain. The Alaska governor has been a popular draw for many GOP base voters .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe Biden, Obama's running mate, campaigned in Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We are on the cusp of a new brand of leadership,&quot; he assured supporters.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">underdog eyes comeback</span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. John McCain is behind in the polls, and Republicans are battling to minimize their losses in the congressional races. McCain stopped at several traditionally Republican states that he has failed to secure, such as Florida, Virginia, Indiana, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Arizona. President Bush stayed out of public view in an effort to help McCain. front-runner exudes confidence</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Barack Obama led in nearly all the pre-election polls. Statistics showed more than 29 million ballots cast in 30 states and suggested an advantage for Obama. Democrats voted in larger numbers than Republicans in North Carolina, Colorado, Florida and Iowa, all of which went for President Bush in 2004. Obama flew to Florida, North Carolina and, finally, Chicago on election eve.</span></p>
