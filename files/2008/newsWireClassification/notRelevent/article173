  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WASHINGTON</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The real winner&quot; of Wednesday night's debate, John McCain said Thursday at a campaign stop in Downingtown, Pa., &quot;was Joe the Plumber.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That might depend on the definition of &quot;winner.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe the Plumber, a. k. a. Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher of Holland, Ohio, is suddenly (sort of) a household name, featured in a McCain&nbsp;ad, sought after by network news anchors and newspaper reporters. McCain would like to meet him in person this weekend, but Wurzelbacher's got a date on the Mike Huckabee Show and might not have the time. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On the other hand:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The emergence of Joe has allowed the state of Ohio to locate the man it says owes nearly $1,200 in back taxes. His motives for confronting Sen. Barack Obama at a campaign stop in his neighborhood earlier this week are the subject of intense Internet speculation. The city of Toledo is preparing a letter to his employer seeking to determine if he is violating city codes, and the plumber's union is on his tail.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Joe the Plumber really isn't a plumber,&quot; said Thomas Joseph, business manager of UA Local 50 of the Plumbers, Steamfitters and Service Mechanics Union, whose national membership has endorsed Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wurzelbacher, 34, had taken tentative steps onto the national stage after talking to Obama on Sunday as the Democrat toured his suburban neighborhood outside Toledo. Wurzelbacher told Obama that he wants to buy the plumbing company he works for, and that his potential income of more than $250,000 would make him eligible for increased taxes under Obama's proposals.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Your new tax plan is going to tax me more, isn't it?&quot; Wurzelbacher asked.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's answer to that and a question about the flat tax - that Obama thought it better to &quot;spread the wealth around&quot; - captured the attention of conservative media and the McCain campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe the Plumber quickly became a metaphor for the middle class. Between them, McCain and Obama mentioned him more than two dozen times.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The result was an avalanche of attention - CBS anchor Katie Couric on the phone, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; awaiting an interview, reporters in the driveway of his modest home - which the well-spoken Wurzelbacher handled with aplomb and a bit of amazement.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I'm completely flabbergasted with this whole thing,&quot; he said, noting his concern that he was mentioned more often than Iraq.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The morning showed that the spotlight can be unwelcome. Reporters quickly found that Wurzelbacher owes the state of Ohio $1,182 in back taxes, leading sharp-tongued liberal commentators to say he was not so much concerned about rising taxes as paying taxes at all.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A spokeswoman for the state said it was possible he might not have known about the lien.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wurzelbacher acknowledged to reporters that he does not have a plumber's license, but said he did not need one to do residential work with the two-man Newell Heating and Plumbing Co., which does have a license.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">David Golis, a manager in the city of Toledo's office of building inspections, said that is incorrect.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We were just discussing that we will send a letter to the owner of Newell reminding him&quot; of the city's requirement that all who do plumbing work be licensed or in apprentice or journeyman programs, Golis said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Union manager Joseph said that Wurzelbacher applied for an apprentice program in 2003, but never completed the work.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wurzelbacher admitted to reporters that the goal of buying the business was more aspirational than firm. He said his income was &quot;not even close&quot; to the levels at which Obama's tax increases would kick in.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Wurzelbacher indicated Thursday that he was a fan of the military and McCain - but wouldn't say who will get his vote.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He is registered as a Republican, the county elections board said, because he voted in the GOP primary in March.</span></p>
