  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Barack Obama's campaign is providing more details about who would pay higher taxes if he becomes president, in an attempt to beat back charges that he intends to increase the tax burden on the middle class.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After sending conflicting signals earlier in the campaign, Mr. Obama has attempted to nail down the details of his tax policies before he formally accepts the Democratic Party's presidential nomination Thursday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, has charged in a recent campaign ad that Mr. Obama would raise taxes on Americans making just $42,000 per year. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Barack Obama has voted in support of higher taxes 94 times in just three years,&quot; said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, chief economic adviser to Mr. McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Regardless of how Mr. Obama voted as a senator, his presidential campaign minces no words in declaring whose taxes would not increase after he enters the Oval Office.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Any and all charges that Obama would raise [tax] rates on capital gains, dividends, income, savings and so on for the approximately 98 percent of American families making less than $250,000 are simply not true,&quot; Jason Furman, economic policy director of the Obama campaign, told The Washington Times.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Since last year, before the first primary votes were cast in January, Mr. Obama has pledged to reinstate the Clinton-era wage-and-salary income-tax rates of 36 percent and 39.6 percent for families earning more than $250,000. Today's top income-tax rate is 35 percent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Earlier this year, Mr. Obama indicated that today's top capital-gains tax rate of 15 percent might increase to as much as 28 percent - the rate that prevailed after Congress and President Reagan reformed the tax system in 1986.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">President Clinton and a Republican Congress agreed to lower the 28 percent capital-gains rate to 20 percent in 1997, and President Bush and a Republican Congress further lowered it to 15 percent in 2003. Mr. McCain voted against the 2003 tax cut, but wants to retain it today.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When Mr. Obama promised to eliminate the Bush tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000, some analysts expected him to raise the top dividend tax rate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Last week, Mr. Furman and Austan Goolsbee, another Obama economic adviser, announced that the top tax rate for both capital gains and dividends would be 20 percent. That rate would apply only to individuals and couples earning more than $200,000 and $250,000, respectively. Below those levels, capital gains and dividends would continue to be taxed at a top rate of 15 percent, Mr. Furman said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama also has sent different signals on Social Security taxes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If we kept the payroll tax exactly the same but applied it to all earnings and not just the first [$102,000], we could virtually eliminate the entire Social Security shortfall,&quot; Mr. Obama wrote in an op-ed published in Iowa's Quad-City Times in September. Currently, only the first $102,000 of a worker's wage-and-salary income is subject to the Social Security payroll tax of 12.4 percent, which is split between employee and employer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama's op-ed led Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign to charge that he wanted to raise Social Security taxes on middle-class families, a charge his campaign denied.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In June, Mr. Obama floated the idea of imposing Social Security payroll taxes on incomes above $250,000 - without specifying what the tax rates would be.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama campaign now says that it is considering levying Social Security taxes &quot;in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent&quot; on wages above $250,000. But the increase would not take place for at least a decade. Policy-makers have historically phased in changes in Social Security, Mr. Furman said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;A cash infusion 10 years from now makes sense,&quot; said Roberton Williams, a principal research associate for the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington. Implementing the Social Security tax increase earlier would enable Congress and the president to spend the extra funds on other programs, he explained.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Mr. Obama has repeatedly shifted his position on taxes to support his political situation,&quot; said Mr. Holtz-Eakin, Mr. McCain's economic adviser. &quot;It is a fundamental credibility issue.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;In Iowa, he was going to fix Social Security by eliminating the payroll cap. Now it is a 2-to-4 percent tax above $250,000 10 years from now. I have no doubt after the election he would ... revert to his 2007 position on Social Security,&quot; Mr Holtz-Eakin told The Washington Times.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In addition to reinstating the top income-tax rate of 39.6 percent, Mr. Obama would restore two provisions that limited personal exemptions and itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers. Restoring those items, which the 2001 tax cut eliminated, would add 4.5 percentage points to the top 39.6 percent tax rate, according to Robert Carroll, vice president for economic policy at the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based think tank.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Moreover, since 1993, a Medicare payroll tax of 2.9 percent has applied to all wages, lifting the effective top tax rate by nearly three more percentage points.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;When Mr. Obama's full package of upper-income tax increases goes into effect, the top marginal tax rate would be nearly 50 percent, a incentive-destroying level we haven't seen since 1986,&quot; said Mr. Carroll, who served in the Bush administration as deputy assistant secretary at the Treasury Department.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Furman, the Obama campaign adviser, thinks Mr. Carroll's 4.5 percentage-point estimate is too high, but he does not deny that the top marginal tax rate would rise by a significant amount in an Obama presidency.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;What the McCain campaign doesn't tell you is that, according to the Tax Policy Center, middle-class families will get at least a three-times-larger tax cut under the Obama plan than under Senator McCain's,&quot; Mr. Furman said.</span></p>
