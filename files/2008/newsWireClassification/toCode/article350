  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">MADISON, Wis. -- A radio ad unveiled by Barack Obama's campaign invokes a signature American product -- Harley-Davidson motorcycles -- to criticize John McCain's economic policies. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad blasts the Arizona senator for his long opposition to provisions that require government agencies to buy American-made goods. McCain has repeatedly said those provisions can't ensure taxpayers the best deal and restrict free trade.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad takes aim at McCain for opposing such a measure in a 2005 homeland security bill that required the Secret Service to purchase American-made motorcycles. Harley-Davidson is the market-leading U.S. motorcycle company.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad features a clip of McCain speaking to thousands of motorcyclists in Sturgis, S.D., last week. McCain noted Obama's recent speech to an estimated 200,000 people in Berlin and then said, &quot;I'll take the roar of 50,000 Harleys any day!&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;But when it comes to his record, American-made motorcycles like Harleys don't matter to John McCain,&quot; a narrator says. &quot;Back in Washington, McCain opposed a requirement that the government buy American-made motorcycles. And he said all Buy American provisions were quote 'disgraceful.'&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For Wisconsin audience: Obama campaign spokesman Phil Walzak said the ad was running on radio stations in Milwaukee and was the first of the general election campaign tailored to a Wisconsin audience.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This ad uses an American icon and a Milwaukee institution to demonstrate some of the differences in this campaign,&quot; he said. &quot;Sen. Obama believes that taxpayer dollars should be used to support American jobs and American companies.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad comes as Obama's double-digit lead in Wisconsin appears to be shrinking. The Democrat's most recent visit to the state was in June, while his Republican rival stopped here most recently in Racine two weeks ago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's reaction: McCain's campaign stood by his 2005 description of the motorcycle provision on the Senate floor as &quot;gross examples of protectionist trade policy&quot; that cost taxpayers more money by restricting competition.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a budget watchdog group, said McCain's position does not mean he's against buying American. Critics who suggest otherwise &quot;don't think American companies can produce the best, most cost-effective products,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Anybody who has ridden a Harley can say clearly they can compete&quot; with foreign firms for government business, he said.</span></p>
