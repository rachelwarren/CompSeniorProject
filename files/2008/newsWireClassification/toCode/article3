  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By JAMES KIRCHICK</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A FEW WEEKS ago, news emerged that the co-founder of the Web site Manhunt.net had contributed $2,300 to the presidential campaign of John McCain. Uproar ensued.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Haven't heard of Manhunt?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Unless you're a gay man, that's to be expected. It's one of the most popular gay Web sites in the world, with 1 million registered members in the United States alone and 400,000 unique visitors a month. As its name implies, it's a site where many gay men go to find casual sexual encounters. Manhunt and sites like it have revolutionized one formative aspect of gay culture, taking what was once a public activity to the privacy of one's home.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Except that the Internet, as Jonathan Crutchley recently discovered, isn't really private. A successful real-estate developer, he founded Manhunt with his life partner, Larry Basile, in 2001. He ran into trouble when Out, a gay magazine, published an article about the Web site in its current issue. The article, in passing, referred to Crutchley -- who until last week was chairman of the board at Manhunt -- as a &quot;liberal Republican.&quot; That tidbit apparently shocked gay blogger Andy Towle, who within seconds found Crutchley's donation to McCain on a contributor database and posted the news on his Web site. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The shaming and condemnation of Crutchley was swift .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Let's show MANHUNT what we in the gay community think of members of our community who support politicians who vote against the interests of the community,&quot; read one anonymous comment. &quot;Delete your MANHUNT profile!&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michelangelo Signorile, a gay liberal radio host, labeled Crutchley &quot;asinine&quot; simply for supporting McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rarely do you come across a candidate who shares each and every one of your views, and Crutchley's support for McCain wasn't any different from a donor willing to disagree with his politicians. &quot;I believe McCain will be a better commander in chief than Obama, who also opposes gay marriage,&quot; Crutchley wrote on a Web site that covers the online personal ad industry. &quot;If we have an experienced, seasoned person defending the country in this dangerous age, we will be able to argue about the gay agenda later.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That explanation might not please every gay activist, but it is a feeling shared by many gay people. According to exit polls, about 25 percent of gay voters chose George W. Bush in the last two presidential elections (the actual number is likely higher, seeing that many gays do not identify themselves as such to pollsters).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The fact that Crutchley is a Republican ought not to come as much of a surprise then, especially considering he's a self-made millionaire. And he's hardly a radical right-winger. &quot;I'm a Massachusetts Republican,&quot; he wrote, &quot;which is about the same as being an Alabama Democrat.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Just how poisonous Crutchley's politics can be in a gay milieu can be deduced from the speed with which he stepped down as chairman -- at &quot;the request of the board,&quot; according to Basile.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The hue and cry over Crutchley's politics is all too familiar. Why can't gay activists countenance the idea of a &quot;Massachusetts Republican&quot;? Liberal intolerance. In the minds of too many on the left, gay people (like women and ethnic minorities) have to be liberal and support Democrat s. To do otherwise -- that is, to have opinions on issues (even issues utterly unrelated to gay rights) that don't follow the left-wing line -- is to be a traitor to the gay &quot;community.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For too long, many gay-rights activists have acted as if throwing temper tantrums will magically bring about their political agenda. But labeling everyone with whom they don't agree a &quot;bigot&quot; does not help the worthy cause of gay equality.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The truth is that civil rights for gays can't come about without the help of Republicans. And this means that gay people -- and straight supporters of gay equality -- need to stand with, not silence, people who are working to change the GOP from within.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gayness is a sexual orientation, not a political one. Aside from their sexuality, gay people are no different from heterosexuals. There are gay people of all races, income levels, occupations, body types and, yes, political beliefs. Gay liberals are always crowing about the importance of &quot;diversity&quot; and lauding its importance on matters of race and gender. Too bad diversity doesn't count when it comes to politics.</span></p>
