  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">TNT will debut a new crime thriller series from Dean Devlin (&quot;Independence Day,&quot; &quot;The Librarian&quot;) called &quot;Blank Slate&quot; on Sept. 9.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The next week, TNT will telecast the series finale.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's a very, very short series.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As in: two minutes per episode. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Five of these episodes will air during TNT telecasts of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; reruns on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. TNT has ordered 20 episodes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Among the show's stars: two Acura cars, the TSX and the RL, which will be heavily featured in almost every episode. In promos, TNT will say things such as &quot;stay tuned to 'Blank Slate' presented by Acura.&quot; The episodes of &quot;Blank Slate Presented by Acura&quot; will air during the commercial breaks in the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; reruns, a network spokeswoman told The TV Column.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Where I come from, these are called &quot;ads.&quot; &quot;Fancy-schmancy ads&quot; is the technical phrase, I think. Kind of like those old Taster's Choice commercials with the hot young coffee-craving chick and her hot young coffee-supplying guy neighbor (hot steamy relationship ensued). Except with a much bigger budget. And about 90-seconds longer per episode. And, of course, with two Acura cars. And no coffee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Here's one bit of good news. You know those annoying pop-up ads that, um, pop up on the screen when you're trying to watch prime-time series on TNT? TNT will absolutely not clutter up episodes of &quot;Blank Slate&quot; with any stinkin' pop-up ads. Might block the view of the Acura TSX.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Acura couldn't be happier about the new &quot;micro-series,&quot; noting the show's story line -- SPOILER ALERT -- &quot;integrates the advanced intuitive technologies of the Acura TSX and RL, while showcasing the car's sleek and modern design,&quot; according to Susie Rossick, Acura advertising manager.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Written and directed by John Harrison of &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Tales From the Crypt&quot; fame, &quot;Blank Slate&quot; is about one Anne Huston, who wakes up in an &quot;execution chamber&quot; after being accused of killing a federal agent. She is suffering from amnesia, which makes her &quot;the perfect candidate&quot; to become the guinea pig for a new FBI program in which memories of recent murder victims are implanted into living people, who are then given Acura TSXes to drive -- RLs for the weekends. You and I know they'd save a lot of time and money if they just kidnapped Barry Sonnenfeld's pie-making guy, who can bring murder victims back to life temporarily and ask them whodunnit, but try explaining that to the FBI.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In their first broadcast since having Michelle Obama as guest co-host, The Ladies of &quot;The View&quot; made-for-TV-marveled over all the attention they received in the media from that visit with the wife of the Democratic presidential candidate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Everywhere you looked all weekend, up until really this morning, there was Michelle on our show,&quot; Whoopi Goldberg gushed faux incredulously.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Whoopi insisted the timing of Obama's visit had nothing to do with efforts to fix her public image, as some reporters suggested.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It had nothing to do with changing over who she was. . . . We have been talking to this woman since December about coming on to 'The View,' &quot; Whoopi said on yesterday's show.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It happened also because it was just the time where there were all of these articles about 'Is she going to be a help?' 'Is she not?' 'What is she going to be like?' 'Do we really know her?' I mean, it just, it was the perfect timing,&quot; added sometime-journalist Barbara Walters, who showed up for the discussion on a purple bed, carried by four ginormous gladiators.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In fairness, the show was being broadcast live from Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;And, don't forget, you know, Cindy McCain was our guest co-host in April,&quot; Whoopi added. &quot;Now, did you guys think the media covered her period?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Her appearance?&quot; Whoopi added, clarifying her double-entendre so as to avoid any pesky &quot;Cindy McCain Menopausal, 'The View' Reveals&quot; blogger headlines along the lines of those &quot;Michelle Obama Says Her Husband Is 'Kind and Pathetic' &quot; headlines that plagued the show after the wannabe first lady told The Ladies her husband is &quot;kind, empathetic.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Too late.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;She doesn't have her period anymore,&quot; Joy Behar deadpanned in re the Republican candidate's wife.</span></p>
