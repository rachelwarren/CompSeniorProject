  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When your famous face is exploited in a TV ad about high gas prices, what's a princess with a bottomless bank account to do? Lounging poolside in a skimpy swimsuit, she thanks &quot;that wrinkly white-haired guy&quot; for his endorsement. Hilton's ad calls McCain &quot;the oldest celebrity in the world ... old enough to remember when dancing was a sin. ...&quot; &quot;I want America to know I'm, like, totally ready to lead,&quot; she said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hilton's platform -- which sounds halfway sensible -- combines McCain's plan for offshore oil drilling with Obama's emphasis on manufacturing hybrid vehicles.

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Efficiency Vermont is a program that helps individual citizens and small businesses find ways to conserve. It offers advice and how-to on everything from mundane questions such as light bulbs to highly complex subjects such as building design. ...</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Efficiency Vermont is funded by a surcharge on utility bills. Tax-averse lawmakers in Virginia might blanche at that idea. But it's worth remembering inefficiency also carries a surcharge -- less apparent, but no less real.</span></p>
