  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Sophia McCrimmon has backed Sen. Barack Obama since she was little.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In addition to domestic issues, his plans for Iraq and Afghanistan align with hers - all things she talks about when she knocks on doors in Hanover County.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Her favorites are undecided voters. Generally, they are more receptive to someone asking what issues concern them when it's coming from a 9-year-old.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I think he's going to help change the world and I think he's going to make America a better place, and I think he's going to change the war in Iraq,&quot; she said of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Sophia discussed her politics over watermelon and a blueberry bagel yesterday morning at a kickoff event for Virginia Women for Obama, Families for Change. The gathering was held in Richmond's Byrd Park; others took place throughout the day in the cities of Charlottesville, Alexandria, Hampton and Fairfax.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The campaign hopes the network will assist in mobilizing support around the state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* * *</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Virginia first lady Anne Holton headlined the Richmond gathering, highlighting Obama's stances on several issues of import to women and families, including earned-income tax credits, pay equity and paid sick leave.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;In all of these issues, there's a stark contrast between Senator Obama and his opponent,&quot; she said, referring to Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Holton's husband, Gov. Timothy M. Kaine, is being mentioned as a possible running mate for Obama. Holton politely skirted a question about the buzz yesterday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As a mother of three and a former judge, Holton leveled with the crowd of about 100 - a majority of which was female - about the juggling act required to do it all.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I've never worked in a job where I didn't have a paid sick leave, but that's a privilege,&quot; she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Across the country, many working in retail and service industries do not get paid sick days.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;That's criminal that folks have to choose between going to work sick so as to make the money to pay the rent versus being able to take care of themselves,&quot; she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama would require employers to provide seven paid sick days per year. McCain has said it should &quot;be subject to negotiations between management and labor,&quot; according to The Associated Press.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* * *</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In introducing Holton yesterday, Del. Jennifer L. McClellan, D-Richmond, said every issue is a women's issue. She remarked that the Obama campaign has generated more excitement than she has seen before and that it's not just about celebrity.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> She was referring to a television ad the McCain camp released that shows images of Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Obama and asks, &quot;He's the biggest celebrity in the world, but is he ready to lead?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> McClellan said of Obama, &quot;I've seen him interact with people. He really connects with people in a way that Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, quite frankly, don't.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama has drawn many young voters into the political process, such as Sarah Brooks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;He has so much optimism, he's young and it's cool because I'm a young person, too,&quot; said the 21-year-old who hopes to join the Peace Corps soon. &quot;It's neat to be able to relate to someone on that level.&quot;</span></p>
