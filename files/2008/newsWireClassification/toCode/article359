  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As a white American born, raised and educated in the deep South, I have been watching the presidential contest closely, especially in view of its historic inclusion of the first black candidate from a major party. Just recently, the role race will play became absolutely clear to me. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I viewed for the first time the John McCain TV ad that was explained by Mr. McCain as questioning Barack Obama's substance. It purported that Mr. Obama is basically just a celebrity with no substance. To emphasize this, the ad pictures two celebrities who are vapid and troubled people. But did Mr. McCain select two celebrities who might to any degree be compared to Mr. Obama, such as Tiger Woods, Will Smith or some other black &quot;celebrity&quot;? No, instead the ad pictures two young white girls!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As a Southerner, I thought that sent a clear message. The ad showed the pictures of the two white girls and then faded into the picture of Mr. Obama. Could the message to Southern whites have been clearer? The message being, here are these two pretty white girls whom we must protect from the big, black man Obama! Pure unadulterated &quot;race-baiting&quot;! That is the exact type of messages I saw repeatedly as I grew up in the pre- and post-civil rights law days in the Deep South. They were messages of fear and hatred.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So I now know who introduced race and played the race card -- it was John McCain, and in an overtly racist and bigoted manner at that! It is clear to me whom I will not vote for as I seek a united America -- united being the only way we can overcome the serious problems of the 21st century. I will not vote for John McCain.</span></p>
