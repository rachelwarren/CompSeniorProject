  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Pennsylvania, Democrat Barack Obama has opened up a big, early lead over Republican John McCain - in the number of local offices. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama has 24, McCain has three, not counting an additional seven that serve all Republican candidates. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Whether this gap ultimately makes any difference as to who wins Pennsylvania's 21 electoral votes Nov. 4 remains to be seen. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But Obama's strategists say the offices are part of a highly structured, volunteer-heavy plan to help carry a state that is must-win for Obama and high on McCain's wish list. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a conference call with reporters yesterday, Craig Schirmer, who is running Obama's Pennsylvania campaign, laid out a plan to create more than 700 neighborhood teams to cover the state. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The teams will engage in canvassing, house meetings, church visits, phone banks, and the recruitment of additional volunteers. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Schirmer said 247 of the teams are in place, with captains committed to spending 10 to 20 hours per week on campaign work for the duration. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama campaign also plans to go after the roughly one million Pennsylvanians of voting age who have not registered. Already this year, statewide voter registration is up a net of 215,000, with Democratic registration up 317,000. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Schirmer called the overall blueprint a combination of &quot;new technology and old-style organizing principles.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The McCain campaign promises strong outreach efforts of its own; in 2004, the campaign to reelect President Bush made highly effective use of local supporters in their voter-contact efforts, taking care to see that targeted voters heard from neighbors with similar interests. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And through his own campaign schedule, McCain has made clear that he places a premium on taking Pennsylvania out of the Democratic column. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain has come to the state four times since the middle of June and has maintained a large and sustained presence through television commercials. His strategists see opportunities to make inroads in the socially conservative, older and nominally Democratic counties in northeastern and Western Pennsylvania. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;You're just starting to see the tip of the iceberg,&quot; McCain's state campaign manager, Ted Christian, said of visits by the candidate and surrogates. &quot;I think he'll open his own post office box here. This state is of the utmost importance to the senator.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Polls show Obama ahead in Pennsylvania, with the most recent survey giving him a six-point lead. The Democrats have won the state in the last four presidential elections, although John Kerry's margin of victory four years ago was only 2.5 percentage points. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gov. Rendell, who backed Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primaries, described himself as &quot;confident . . . but not overconfident&quot; that Obama would win the state, calling McCain &quot;as appealing a Republican candidate as they've run in the last 20-odd years.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain has one area office, in Blue Bell, Montgomery County. More are expected. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama has eight: three in Montgomery County, two in Delaware County, and one each in Bucks County, Chester County and Center City. </span></p>
