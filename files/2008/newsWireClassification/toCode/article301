  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Presumptive Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama pulled in almost $22 million from donors in May as he finished the primary battle, demonstrating his ability to raise cash one day after he announced he was declining public funds and would instead privately finance his general election campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Illinois senator's campaign filed a report Friday with the Federal Election Commission showing the figures, bringing his total haul to date to $294 million. He spent $26.8 million in May as he fought Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in six Democratic contests, losing three.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At the start of June, Mr. Obama had $43 million in cash on hand, the report showed. He can freely spend his primary election donations until the nominating convention.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The $22 million figure - almost all of which was for use in the Democratic primaries and can be spent through the late-August convention - was less than Mr. Obama's best months but equal to the best month of presumptive Republican nominee Sen. John McCain. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Thursday, the Arizona senator announced he had raised $21 million in May and began this month with $31.5 million in the bank.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The campaigns sparred over Mr. Obama's broken promise to participate in the public-financing system in the general election as long as his Republican opponent did.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama also promised to &quot;aggressively pursue&quot; a deal with the eventual Republican nominee on public financing compromise and said later that he would meet personally with Mr. McCain on the subject. He did neither.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Friday he defended his decision to skip the $84 million in public funds available through the system Congress set up in 1974 to curb the influence of wealthy donors, reiterating his belief the &quot;broken&quot; system is being exploited by Republicans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He said his campaign does not take money from political action committees or federal registered lobbyists and has extended those rules to the Democratic National Committee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Ninety percent of our contributions are from small donors, and what we have done is to create a system that allows us to free ourselves from dependence on special interests and from lobbyists,&quot; he said. &quot;That stands in contrast to Senator McCain's operations, right now, where he says he's in the system and yet a huge proportion of his money is raised from special interests, from lobbyists. I don't think that's a recipe for reform.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain senior adviser Steve Schmidt wrote a memo to reporters Friday arguing the Democrat's decision proves he is willing to go back on his word.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He said much of Mr. Obama's &quot;rapid ascent&quot; can be &quot;traced to the power of Barack Obama's spoken and written words.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Because of his rapid ascent and the relative lack of record from which the American people can judge, the words that Barack Obama uses deserve a level of scrutiny befitting the importance that he places on them. But when examined closely, more often than not these words are empty of any meaning in the light of his record and reality,&quot; Mr. Schmidt said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Under scrutiny, it becomes &quot;increasingly difficult for those of us with the responsibility of following this year's election closely to discern what Obama truly believes at his core on the issues of great importance to the American people,&quot; Mr. Schmidt said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Confronted with quotes from Republicans who say he is a hypocrite, Mr. Obama turned the criticism back at Mr. McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;He was all over the map on public financing,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;He said he would consider opting out ... later when his campaign had collapsed for a while, he said he's definitely in&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama also defended himself Friday in a USA Today op-ed piece.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;What's more, Sen. McCain has, in fact, been running a privately financed general election campaign since February, using private money raised during the primary to attack me and target battleground states,&quot; Mr. Obama wrote. &quot;By the time he accepts his party's nomination, Sen. McCain will have run a privately funded general election campaign for seven months.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In tandem with the private financing announcement Thursday, Obama campaign manager David Plouffe solicited donations in a new appeal to get 50,000 people to make a donation by Independence Day. The campaign upped the goal to 75,000 after cracking 52,000 on Friday, less than 24 hours after the appeal went out.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In his e-mail Mr. Plouffe singled out 527 group Freedom's Watch, telling supporters the group &quot;has said it will spend as much as $250 million under Karl Rove's direction to attack and defeat Barack Obama.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;To compete, Barack has put his faith in ordinary people giving only what they can afford. That's been the strategy of this campaign from the beginning, and more than 1,500,000 supporters like you have gotten us this far,&quot; Mr. Plouffe said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He did not mention that liberal-leaning MoveOn.org will spend more than $30 million on Mr. Obama's behalf to attack Mr. McCain and already is running a tough ad about the Iraq war.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Also, neither Mr. Plouffe nor Mr. Obama noted that in the 2004 electoral cycle, according to the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute, &quot;Democratic-oriented groups received nearly four times as much 527 money as Republican-oriented ones ... $321 million to $84 million&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama aides on Friday acknowledged that fact, but singled out the widely-covered Swift Boat Veterans for Truth as the most effective so-called 527 group for its pro-Republican attacks on Sen. John Kerry.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama met Friday in Chicago with the nation's Democratic governors to outline his vision for the country, telling them they &quot;deserve and need a partner in the White House.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We are going to be working on these issues for many years to come,&quot; he told them. &quot;My hope is we can hit the ground running in January of '09 ... and be ready to govern when the time comes&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He singled out governors who supported his primary opponent, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, to praise their efforts on foreclosures and alternative energy: &quot;You've all proved that our states are still the laboratories of our democracy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;You've seen what happens when the federal government bails out investment banks on Wall Street, but doesn't do enough to help the thousands of Americans who are losing their homes to this foreclosure crisis every day,&quot; he said. &quot;You've seen what happens when $10 billion a month in Iraq takes away money that could be used to fix roads and bridges, to secure levees and dams.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At a fundraiser Friday in Jacksonville, Fla., Mr. Obama quipped to high-dollar donors he could preview the Republican attacks for the fall:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We know what kind of campaign they're going to run. They're going to try to make you afraid. They're going to try to make you afraid of me,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;[TFI]'He's young and inexperienced and he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black? He's got a feisty wife.' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His joke drew cheers and he continued: &quot;We know the strategy because they've already shown their cards. Ultimately, I think the American people recognize that old stuff hasn't moved us forward. That old stuff just divides us.&quot;</span></p>
