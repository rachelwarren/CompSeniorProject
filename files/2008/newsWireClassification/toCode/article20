  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Vandals prove that they aren't very good at coexisting</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Wednesday morning, I received a phone call that our church had been vandalized.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The large white rock, the emblem of our church, had been repainted. The motto &quot;Jesus Saves&quot; had been whited out, and the &quot;coexist&quot; symbol had been spray painted over it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As I spent a morning that was already full painting over this mess, I wondered what the perpetrators' motivation was. If they really believed in the necessity for peaceful coexistence, they betrayed their own principles by trespassing and damaging private property. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It isn't the Christians who will not coexist. We don't damage property, intrude into other people's space or force our message where it is not welcome.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Christians recognize each person has a God-given right to live their life as they choose, understanding they will be held responsible to God for their choices. Not only is it not desirable, but it is not possible to force our beliefs on others.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Freedom of conscience is a Christian concept not found in any other major religion. The message on our rock, &quot;Jesus Saves,&quot; is God does not reject sinners -- he lovingly paid for our redemption while we were in the midst of rebellion.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ads should be green, and not get in the way</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I agree with Joshua Bernick's letter regarding those glossy inserts in the newspaper, (&quot;Go from glossy to green on inserts,&quot; Aug. 25). I understand the need to advertise, but businesses such as Macy's, Sears, Best Buy and Circuit City, to name a few, should do so in an environmentally friendly way.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Another type of advertising I find objectionable is the flaps along the comic section in Sunday's paper. One must remove the flap in order to enjoy that section, and usually the comics end up getting torn off along with the advertisement.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Bible is clear on murder and homosexuality. To have an abortion is to stop a life from being born.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On the subject of homosexuality the Bible calls it shameful, unrighteousness and wicked.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">How can anyone who calls themselves a Christian vote for a candidate who is for both of these issues? Someday we will all stand before God to give an account.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">U.S. should adopt national health care</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">National health care for the U.S. is long overdue. All of Europe and virtually every other democratic nation have evolved to this higher ideal.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Opponents insist there will be new problems. But that is no argument at all, for there always are with change.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The point is, for 50 million Americans the improvement will be like night versus day. To use an analogy, other democracies understand its citizens comprise a family. As such, they extend guarantees to every member.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Even the youngest children, who contribute nothing to the upkeep of the home, are extended basic minimums.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Many Americans earn millions of dollars each year, and they do it with our help, directly or indirectly. In light of this, simple fairness dictates that the wealthy should pay a higher percentage of taxes so that regular citizen can live without fear of poverty caused by the cost of a serious illness.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The U.S. is the only democracy on Earth whose top leaders have voted themselves free health care but not those they govern.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Our politicians, elected the parents of our national family, so to speak, have betrayed our trust, having cared for themselves while abandoning their guardianship of the children.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While the media has its sensationalized, never-ending love affair with the DNC, and the McCain vs. Madonna, Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, the world is closer to the brink of WW III, and no one seems to notice.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Middle East is ready to implode, and Russia and U.S. tensions are at an all-time high since the Cold War.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The threatening military rhetoric has reached the heightened level that deserves more attention from the media and the presidential candidates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Instead, the media are more concerned with Michelle Obama's &quot;body language&quot; and whether or not Clinton and Obama have truly mended their relationship, and Madonna's unflattering use of McCain in a video.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Please, for the sake of our nation, and our world, stop this &quot;glam-fest&quot; and get back to business. I don't care about who is more &quot;Hollywood,&quot; or who has the best oratorical talent, or who is too old.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The U.S. has been on way too long of a holidday as we've enjoyed the theatrics of the presidential race. Wake up, America, and demand more from our media and politicians before the world, as we know it, explodes.</span></p>
