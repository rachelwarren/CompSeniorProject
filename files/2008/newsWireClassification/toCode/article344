  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republican presidential hopeful John McCain likely will stop in Lancaster County today after a town-hall event in York County, an anonymous Republican official said Monday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">However, just where and when McCain will make the stop remains unknown. And a number of local Republican leaders say they're in the dark, too. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I know it was something they were looking to do, but when and where they're going to do it, they haven't told me,&quot; said Dave Dumeyer, chairman of the Lancaster County Republican Committee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain spokesman Paul Lindsay would only confirm the town-hall meeting scheduled for 11:45 a.m. today at the Toyota Center at the York Fairgrounds. McCain is on a two-day tour of Pennsylvania with former Gov. Tom Ridge.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After speaking in York and making any stops in Lancaster, McCain will depart from Lancaster Airport in Manheim Township, according to Frank Orban III, McCain's co-chair in Lancaster.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Meanwhile, acting on a hunch that McCain will make a Lancaster appearance, members of Lancaster Coalition for Peace and Justice and Lancaster Students for a Democratic Society plan to protest in Penn Square today at 3:30 p.m.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Local Democrats gathered Monday morning with state Democratic Party spokesman Abe Amoros to unveil a new Web ad by the Democratic National Committee aimed at countering McCain's tour of Pennsylvania.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad features 40 seconds of ominous piano and string music while twice playing a clip of McCain in a New Orleans town-hall meeting last April in which he said, &quot;I'm not going to keep (all jobs) in America.&quot; He was responding to a question from an audience member about how he would retain American jobs and make the country &quot;more self-sufficient.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad also features text messages slamming McCain and his campaign adviser, Rick Davis, whose firm once lobbied Congress on behalf of DHL Express, a global packaging company looking to buy Airborne Express and move 8,000 jobs out of southeastern Ohio.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think it's a little scary myself, but it's an effective ad,&quot; Amoros said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Blair Latoff, spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said McCain was being blunt with voters in the video and suggested Democrats were just playing politics.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The DNC and Barack Obama are more intent on politicizing job losses than they are seeking solutions to improve our challenging economic times,&quot; Latoff said. &quot;Maybe Barack Obama should take John McCain's lead and meet with the hardworking individuals who risk losing their jobs.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Also Monday, Gov. Ed Rendell, in a conference call with the media set up by the Obama campaign, targeted McCain's record in the Senate, specifically mentioning votes the Arizona senator made to give American companies tax breaks for creating jobs abroad, to provide government subsidies to laid-off workers who lost jobs due to trade agreements and to give oil companies billions of dollars in tax breaks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;He would do nothing to shorten the gap between America's poorest, more challenged citizens and America's richest citizens,&quot; Rendell said.</span></p>
