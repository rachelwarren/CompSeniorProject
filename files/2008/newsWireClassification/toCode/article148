  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Federal agents may take a traveler's laptop computer or other electronic device to an off-site location for an unspecified period of time without any suspicion of wrongdoing, as part of border search policies the Department of Homeland Security recently disclosed.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">-- The Washington Post, Aug. 1 </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;WHATCHA got there, Mitchell?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Another laptop, Wilson. The fellow carrying it was bellyaching about the airline charging seven bucks for a blanket and a pillow. So I nabbed him.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Sounds like he's a potential menace to the homeland. Good work. Finding anything interesting on his computer?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Well, I turned up an e-mail cleverly hidden in a folder marked 'spam.' It's from the son of a deposed Nigerian prince asking for help wiring $21 million to a U.S. bank account.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Aaah, so he's associating with Nigerians, is he? Interesting, interesting. Remind me: Are the Nigerians for or against us in the war on terror?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Against, I think. Or maybe for. To tell you the truth, I have an awful hard time keeping track.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Me, too. You'd better copy the e-mail. I don't like the sound of it. Anything else?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;A video with Paris Hilton in it.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Wonderful! We'll detain him on obscenity charges.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Actually, sir, it's a copy of John McCain's recent commercial mocking Barack Obama's popularity.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Celebrity. Not popularity. There's a big difference. What else did you find?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Something that looks like an office pool on potential vice presidential picks by Obama and McCain.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;What are the choices?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Well, for Obama, there's Tim Kaine.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Never heard of him.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;And Joe Biden.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Heard TOO much. What a windbag.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;For McCain, there's Eric Cantor.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Eddie Cantor? Didn't he die ages ago? &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Uh-uh. Eric. A congressman, apparently.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Never heard of him either. Who else for McCain?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Dick Cheney.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Really? Hmm. Interesting.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Yeah. But, you know, I sort of figured Cheney would keep running things no matter who wins in November.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We can only hope. Anything else?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Well, there's an e-mail on the fellow's laptop from his second-cousin's mother-in-law's hairdresser's daughter's boyfriend's stepbrother whose mechanic's wife's childhood friend's aunt's middle son Jack's youngest boy Adam is serving in Iraq.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;And what's the e-mail say?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Well, according to the second-cousin's mother-in-law's hairdresser's daughter's boyfriend's stepbrother's mechanic's wife's childhood friend's aunt's middle son ... uh ... middle son ... &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Jack.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Right. Jack's youngest boy Adam saw Obama slap a soldier for accidentally walking between him and a CNN camera.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Wow. That's a celebrity for you.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Think it's true?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Oh, for crying out loud, Mitchell, it's an eyewitness account! Forward that e-mail to me, and I'll send it to everyone in my address book. We have to spread the news.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;You're right. We can't trust the lamestream media to report stories like this.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Exactly. Anything else?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;That's about it.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Excellent work. Let's secure the laptop as evidence and put the owner on a flight to Guantanamo.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Already scheduled.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Great. Oh, and Mitchell?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Yes, Wilson?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Be sure the fellow gets a free pillow and blanket for his flight. I don't want to hear any bellyaching about civil liberties. We've got a war on terror to fight.&quot;</span></p>
