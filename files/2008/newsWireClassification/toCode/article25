  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> On the way to Election Day 2008, the following has happened:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The best way to distract attention from your opponent's big day? Leak your own really, really big news sloooowly. Reporters covering the final days of Barack Obama's nominating convention kept getting diverted by -- Hey, what's that smell? Is that fresh meat? It was reminiscent of July, when sources &quot;close to Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign&quot; told columnist Robert Novak that the Arizona senator might choose his running mate -- just as Obama was drawing oodles of press attention for that big trip abroad. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&Acirc;&middot; Thursday morning, on the day Obama was to accept his party's nomination, the Drudge Report posted this about McCain's veep pick: SOURCE: NAME MAY LEAK AT 6 PM ET . . . WITH SOME SORT OF CONFIRMATION AT 8 PM.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&Acirc;&middot; During a radio interview that aired in the morning, McCain was pressed on his decision. He joked that he was considering that guy from the Quaker Oatmeal ads, Wilford Brimley. &quot;He's older than I am, so that might work,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&Acirc;&middot; Meanwhile, a McCain spokeswoman told MSNBC that the campaign would be airing &quot;a historic ad&quot; on Thursday evening. Whoa! What would it say? &quot;It's going to be very exciting,&quot; spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker said. &quot;I think that a lot of people are going to focus on it.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&Acirc;&middot; And then the campaign released the ad, which involves McCain looking into the camera while soft, uplifting music plays. &quot;Senator Obama, this is truly a good day for America,&quot; McCain says. &quot;I wanted to stop and say, 'Congratulations.' &quot;</span></p>
