  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">FAIRFAX</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Barack Obama looked Thursday to exploit the gender gap that has become critical to Democratic political success since the 1990s: wooing female voters in a key Virginia battleground and casting his Republican presidential rival as indifferent to the faltering national economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hours after reports that former Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, a key adviser to GOP candidate Sen. John McCain, called Americans &quot;a nation of whiners&quot; concerning the economy, Obama struck back with gusto. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain &quot;doesn't seem to see the problem,&quot; the Democrat said to roars of approval from 2,500 supporters at a Fairfax County school.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This economic downturn is not in your head,&quot; he added. &quot;When people are out there losing their homes and property values are declining, that's not just a figment of your imagination. And it isn't whining to ask government to come in and give families some relief.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Questions about Gramm's remarks dogged McCain on Thursday as he insisted he doesn't share Gramm's views.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a 25-minute speech and a town hall forum that followed it in Fairfax, Obama hailed women as &quot;the backbone of our middle class&quot; and accused McCain of opposing legislative efforts to help women pursue claims of workplace discrimination .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After a Supreme Court decision last spring on pay discrimination, Obama supported and McCain voted against a bill designed to make it easier for women to sue their employers in such cases. McCain said then that he supports &quot;pay equity&quot; but that the bill &quot;opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama also called for guaranteed sick leave and expanded family leave benefits for male and female workers, beefed-up early childhood education programs, and annual increases in the federal minimum wage.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama said the federal government can provide that aid without increasing the federal deficit, in part by rolling back tax cuts approved early in the Bush administration.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His plan will increase tax bills only for families bringing home more than $250,000 annually, he said .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republicans have been working hard to cast Obama as a tax-loving big spender. Hours after his Fairfax rally, Susan Allen, the wife of former Gov. and U.S. Sen. George Allen, issued a statement asserting that &quot;the promises Barack Obama is making today in Virginia are promises he can only keep by raising our taxes.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A radio commercial playing on Washington area stations before Obama's appearance Thursday featured a teacher who accused Obama of voting &quot;to raise taxes on folks earning as little as $32,000.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">FactCheck.org, a nonpartisan watchdog group, has challenged that claim.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama voted in March for a budget resolution that urged a return to tax brackets that were in effect before 2001, the group said, but that resolution would only have affected single taxpayers earning more than $41,500 and couples bringing in more than $83,000.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And whatever Obama supported earlier, FactCheck noted, his current economic plan would provide taxpayers earning $32,000 with a $502 annual tax cut.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's appearance at Robinson Secondary School in Burke, an affluent suburban community, followed another female-targeted event in New York with Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, his defeated rival for the Democratic nomination.</span></p>
