  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paris Hilton to the rescue. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The presidential campaign was starting to sound silly, what with John McCain's&nbsp;ad comparing rival Barack Obama's celebrity to the hotel heiress'. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When your famous face is exploited in a TV ad about high gas prices, what's a princess with a bottomless bank account to do? Hilton responded with her own </span><span class="c10">campaign</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;ad video. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lounging poolside in a swimsuit that wouldn't cover one of Gov. Rendell's thighs, she thanks &quot;that wrinkly white-haired guy&quot; for his endorsement. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hilton's ad calls McCain &quot;the oldest celebrity in the world . . . old enough to remember when dancing was a sin.&quot; (Fact check: Abe Vigoda is way older.) &quot;I want America to know I'm, like, totally ready to lead,&quot; she said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hilton's platform - which sounds halfway sensible - combines McCain's plan for offshore oil drilling with Obama's emphasis on manufacturing hybrid vehicles. And repaint the White House a nice shade of pink. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hilton gave a needed tweak to a campaign drifting into petty sideshows. Her image may be shallower than a kiddie pool, but at least she understands the power of self-deprecating humor. Poking fun at himself was a McCain strength before he began behaving like a jilted suitor. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What's scary is that the most memorable ad of the presidential campaign so far belongs to a &quot;candidate&quot; best known for late-night partying and turning a chihuahua into a fashion accessory. Surely all those highly paid consultants in her rivals' campaigns can find a way to knock the wafer-thin heiress off message. </span></p>
