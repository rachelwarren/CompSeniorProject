  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Where does Uncle Sam come up with huge sums of money during a financial emergency? Like the rest of us, the government taps its reserves and borrows if it needs more. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The federal government has pledged eye-popping amounts - more than $600 billion in the past year - to bail out, or help bail out, huge names in American finance.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Now the credit crisis is starting to tax even the Federal Reserve's deep resources.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Yesterday, the central bank took the unprecedented step of asking the Treasury Department to sell debt on behalf of the Fed. The first of those auctions raised $40 billion, and two more to raise an additional $60 billion are scheduled for today.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Analysts said these auctions don't mean the Fed, the bank that backs up the U.S. banking system, is strapped for money. Instead, it represents a Fed effort to better manage its own holdings of Treasury securities.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It uses those securities to control interest rates by buying or selling the securities to banks, thus raising and lowering the amount of money banks have to lend and influencing the price of that money.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> While the Fed has access to its fat piggy bank to help prop up financial companies, the Treasury Department will have to whip out the credit card for the support it is pledging to mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Treasury will have to borrow the money because it doesn't have the deep reserves that the Fed does. The country is running a huge budget deficit this year and is projected to run an even bigger one next year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Those deficits will present a major challenge for the next president. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank, estimates that the candidates' spending priorities and promises for tax cuts will cost $4.2 trillion over the next decade in the case of John McCain and $2.9 trillion in the case of Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Bush administration is projecting that the deficit for the new budget year, which begins Oct. 1, will surge to a record $482 billion. And that doesn't include any costs for bailing out Fannie and Freddie.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Uncle Sam's rescue</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Four recent actions cost $600+ billion of taxpayer money.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* Up to $200 billion combined was made available to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, giving the government a nearly 80 percent stake in the mortgage finance companies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* AIG gets $85 billion, two-year loan. The U.S. has the right to a nearly 80 percent stake in one of the world's largest insurers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* Fed's $29 billion loan helps JPMorgan take over Bear Stearns.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* Up to $300 billion in refinanced mortgages for troubled borrowers can be insured by the Federal Housing Administration in a program starting Oct. 1.</span></p>
