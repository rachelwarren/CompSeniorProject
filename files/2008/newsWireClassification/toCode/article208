  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The national presidential conventions are coming so late that the vice presidential choices may not be known in time to comply with Virginia law.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Acting on a request from the Republican National Committee, the State Board of Elections took steps yesterday to rectify this. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Current law says the chairmen of the state's two major political parties must file a certification of the people expected to be nominated for president and vice president at the two national conventions 74 days before the election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> That would be Aug. 22. The Democratic National Convention in Denver is Aug. 25-Aug. 28, while the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis is Sept. 1-4.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> While political observers expect Barack Obama and John McCain to name their running mates before Aug. 22, there is no guarantee they will do so.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The State Board of Elections approved a rules change yesterday that would allow the state party chairmen to state that the vice presidential candidate was &quot;unknown&quot; as of Aug. 22.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> James Alcorn, an election specialist with the State Board, explained that the first notice from the state party chairmen was more of &quot;a heads-up&quot; anyway. The second notice must be given by Sept. 5, 60 days before the Nov. 4 election. The vice presidential candidates will have been nominated by then.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Nancy Rodrigues, secretary of the election board, criticized both parties yesterday for scheduling the conventions so late - a month after the nominating conventions four years ago. The first day of the Republican convention in St. Paul, Minn., will be on Labor Day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> She said ballots will have to be printed for 134 Virginia localities, with about 1,000 different arrangements. In addition to the presidential race, there are contests for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives as well as local elections, she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Absentee ballots must be on hand 45 days before the election, she added.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Democratic National Convention will be in Denver.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Political commentator Larry Sabato said the Democrats scheduled the late August convention to push the Republicans into Labor Day. By tradition, the party of the president goes last.</span></p>
