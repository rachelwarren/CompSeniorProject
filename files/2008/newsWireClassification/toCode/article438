  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Misguided</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The cable news channel {MSNBC} has dumped two of its high-profile yakkers -- Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews -- from the anchor seats of its political coverage. David Gregory, a legitimate news broadcaster, will lead the political coverage going forward. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Liberal bloggers are upset by the move, arguing that MSNBC caved in to pressure from John McCain's campaign and the right wing. Criticizing the media has been a cheap but effective tool by the McCain camp -- but on this score MSNBC has no one to blame but itself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The short-lived Olbermann-Matthews anchor duo was a misguided ploy designed to boost ratings. The experiment backfired when the coverage veered off into on-air spats between the anchors that began to sound more like talk radio. The move left the cable network open to valid criticism of having a liberal bias.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hostility</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's been seven years since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, and many young American Muslims are convinced that much of American society views them with growing hostility. They're right.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A 2007 Zogby poll discovered that 76 percent of young Arab-Americans report experiencing discrimination. A CNN poll from the same year found that 53 percent of Americans believe conflict between Islam and Christianity is &quot;inevitable,&quot; up from 45 percent in 2003.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">These hardening attitudes affect the job opportunities of American Muslims. ... And profiling continues to be a problem.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Engage Cuba</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">{Cuba's} economy is in a shambles. Fidel Castro, the personification of its nationalism, is dying. The country is seemingly adrift. And now, bleeding from Hurricane Ike -- the second major hurricane to hit within a week.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It could offer a remarkable moment in the United States' relationship with Cuba. An opportunity for goodwill to start nudging aside decades of failed policies. Policies such as the embargo have blocked not just dollars, but American ideas and ideals, from the island for more than four and a half decades.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What's the pig deal?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On a day when the Congressional Budget Office warned of looming deficits and a grim economic outlook, when the stock market faltered even in the wake of the government's rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, when President Bush discussed the road ahead in Iraq and Afghanistan, on what did the campaign of Sen. John McCain spend its energy? A conference call to denounce Sen. Barack Obama for using the phrase &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; and a new television ad accusing the Democrat of wanting to teach kindergartners about sex before they learn to read.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama's supposedly offending remark was not only not offensive -- it also was not directed at Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. &quot;The other side, suddenly, they're saying 'we're for change too,'\&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;You can put lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With a woman on the ticket, apparently all references to cosmetics -- or pork of the non-bridge variety, for that matter -- are forbidden.</span></p>
