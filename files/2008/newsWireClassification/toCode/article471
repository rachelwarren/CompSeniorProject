  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republican U.S. Senate candidate James S. Gilmore III's new TV ad tries to latch on to the momentum of the GOP presidential ticket by aligning the former Virginia governor with the policies of Sen. John McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad also seeks to tie Democratic candidate Mark R. Warner to Sen. Barack Obama (Ill.), the Democratic presidential nominee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But Warner, also a former governor, picked up endorsements Monday from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Fraternal Order of Police, two groups that traditionally support GOP candidates. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;People know my record of independence,&quot; Warner said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gilmore sees an opportunity to jump start his campaign by tying his run to the enthusiasm among Republicans over McCain's selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We need Jim Gilmore in the U.S. Senate, and so does John McCain,&quot; states a narrator in the ad, who adds that McCain and Gilmore are &quot;veterans who will keep America safe, keep taxes low and bring down gas prices.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad, which is being paid for by the Virginia Republican Party and includes footage of McCain-Gilmore signs, is the most visible example to date that Virginia's Senate race is becoming entwined in the state's newfound status as a battleground in the presidential race.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Although recent polls indicate that Obama and McCain (Ariz.) are locked in a close race in Virginia, Warner has consistently held a double-digit lead over Gilmore. Warner also had more than $5 million in the bank as of June 30, compared with Gilmore's $116,000.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gilmore suffered another setback last week when Del. Robert G. Marshall, the Prince William County antiabortion activist who ran for the GOP nomination for Senate in June, said he will not endorse his former rival. Marshall accused Gilmore of running a nasty campaign during their nomination fight.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">To counteract those and other doubts about Gilmore, Del. Jeffrey M. Frederick (Prince William), chairman of the Virginia Republican Party, said the state party would step up its efforts to tie Warner to Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The more people learn about Mark Warner, the less they like him,&quot; Frederick said. &quot;The fact is, he is a liberal who makes campaign promises he doesn't keep.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gilmore will join McCain and Palin at a rally Wednesday in Fairfax County. Obama will hold a town hall meeting today in southwestern Virginia, but Warner will not attend because he has a previously scheduled fundraiser.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At a news conference in Richmond on Monday, Warner called Gilmore's ad linking him to Obama &quot;tired old partisan politics.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think Senator Obama is the right choice, but I also know I have a lot of McCain-Warner supporters,&quot; said Warner, whose campaign will respond to Gilmore's ad with one of its own.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Quentin Kidd, a political science professor at Christopher Newport University, said Gilmore is smart to try to link himself to McCain, saying it is his &quot;only chance&quot; to improve his standing in the polls.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Palin's selection has really energized the Republican base, and Gilmore is essentially trying to capture that momentum,&quot; said Kidd, who thinks that McCain improved his standing in Virginia by selecting Palin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But Warner is also determined to win over Republican voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He was surrounded by a dozen police officers Monday when he picked up the endorsement of the Virginia chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, which is supporting McCain in the presidential race. Warner's campaign noted that Monday's event marked the first time in more than 20 years that the Virginia FOP has endorsed a Democratic candidate in a U.S. Senate race.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We are looking at this [Senate race] as being completely different than the national presidential race,&quot; said Lt. Thomas E. Stiles of the Chesterfield County police, past president of the Virginia FOP.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He credited Warner with helping to fund pay raises for law enforcement officials when he was governor from 1998 to 2002. &quot;We are looking for someone who can take care of Virginians,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In making its endorsement, the Chamber of Commerce referred to Warner as a &quot;champion for the people of Virginia and an invaluable leader on important business issues.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But there are risks in Warner's efforts to build a broad coalition that spans ideological lines. On Monday, Warner declined to take a firm position on whether he supports the Employee Free Choice Act, which would make it easier for unions to organize work sites.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Warner did not offer a clear opinion when reporters asked about his stance on allowing police officers to collectively bargain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I want to bring both sides together,&quot; Warner said.</span></p>
