  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By now, it's nearly impossible to have missed the fact that Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (Del.), the Democratic vice presidential nominee, is such a homebody and regular guy that he rides Amtrak between Washington and Delaware every day when Congress is in session.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But Biden isn't just one of the passenger rail system's most famous commuters -- he is also one of its biggest supporters in the Senate. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;He's right up there,&quot; said David Johnson, deputy director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers. &quot;I'd say in the top five [in the Senate] for sure. I can definitely say he's the biggest user.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amtrak is critical to Delaware's economy -- the state is the only one with no commercial air service -- so all three of its members of Congress are strong backers of government funding for rail. Fellow Delaware Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D) actually may play a bigger legislative role than Biden does, because Carper serves on the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But Biden certainly has done enough to win the hearts of Amtrak's supporters, even earning a &quot;Champion of the Rails&quot; award from Amtrak's president in 2001.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Senator Biden's voting record is very clear in support of Amtrak,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;Both his votes and his words have backed that up over the years, and we are certainly pleased that he was selected to be the vice presidential candidate.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Biden even has a family connection to Amtrak. His younger son, Hunter, is a lobbyist and the vice chairman of Amtrak's board of directors, having been nominated to a five-year term on the board by President Bush in 2006. (Biden's older son, Beau, is the Delaware attorney general and is viewed by some as a potential successor to his father, should the senator make it to the White House.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe Biden is an original co-sponsor of the Amtrak reauthorization bill, known as the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007, versions of which have passed both chambers and are now awaiting a conference committee. He also is a regular signatory to letters calling for increased funding for the rail service, a perennial target for cuts by conservatives and other critics, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amtrak's federal subsidy, which topped $1.3 billion for fiscal 2008, has frequently drawn complaints from budget hawks who argue that the rail system is inefficient and should not continue to operate on little-used routes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In its fiscal 2009 budget request, the Bush administration proposed what it called &quot;a significant but necessary cut&quot; of more than $500 million from the system's budget. The White House said the suggested reduction &quot;reflects that Amtrak has taken few steps to align its business with the traveling public's demand for intercity rail service and that it consequently continues to hemorrhage taxpayer funds.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Johnson said an Obama-Biden victory wouldn't necessarily translate into an avalanche of federal funds for Amtrak. He noted that Al Gore was a big booster of passenger rail when he was in Congress &quot;and yet some of the biggest cuts in service came during the Clinton-Gore administration.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;As Jerry Maguire said, 'Show me the money,' &quot; Johnson said.</span></p>
