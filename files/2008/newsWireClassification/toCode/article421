  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In last Saturday's column, Charles Krauthammer bemoaned Barack Obama's morphing of positions (including that oh-so-important lapel pin dust-up), and it struck me as an incredible example of chutzpah for a McCain supporter to make such complaints (&quot;A Morphing Obama Keeps Us Guessing About His True Beliefs,&quot; July 5). </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I recently read a list itemizing more than 40 documented changes of position by Sen. John McCain since he began his run for the presidency. Some switched in the course of a day and one position reversed over the course of a television commercial break.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">All candidates &quot;adjust&quot; their positions somewhat when they transform from primaries to general elections, but it is Sen. McCain who is setting new records for pandering and hypocrisy this election cycle. It seems the &quot;Straight Talk Express&quot; is something of a misnomer.</span></p>
