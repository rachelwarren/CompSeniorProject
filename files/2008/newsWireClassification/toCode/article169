  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Al Gore got it right when he said, &quot;I don't remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gore's summary: &quot;Our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse, gasoline prices are increasing dramatically, and so are electricity rates. Jobs are being outsourced. Home mortgages are in trouble. Banks, automobile companies, and other institutions we depend upon are under growing pressure. Distinguished senior business leaders are telling us that this is just the beginning unless we find the courage to make some major changes quickly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;The climate crisis, in particular, is getting a lot worse - much more quickly than predicted,&quot; he said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gore isn't running for anything, and he says he's not interested in returning to politics, which is probably good. Not that it's going out on a limb to describe the myriad problems facing the country. Nearly eight in 10 people think the country is on the wrong track, according to the latest AP-Ipsos poll.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But politicians shy away from saying the country's problems are so complex and interrelated that they demand a big solution, that people will have to change their ways, and that time's up for the oil industry.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> GORE SAID all three in his energy speech in Washington July 17, when he challenged Americans to produce 100 percent of our electricity needs from renewable energy and carbon-free sources within 10 years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;We're borrowing money from China to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet. Every bit of that's got to change,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It's hard to disagree. President Bush has said we must end our addiction to oil. But when Al Gore says things like that, he inspires some and infuriates others. Some love the fact that he's willing to propose major change while others think that the former senator, vice president, and presidential candidate should sit down and shut up.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> There's also the envy factor. How could Al Gore rise from the ashes of the 2000 election to win both the Nobel Prize and an Academy Award? As for his idea to wean the United States off oil, some dismissed it as impractical at best, if not pure fantasy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> After Gore's speech, the two men who are actively seeking the presidency took time out from telling us what's wrong with each other to endorse Gore's idea to pursue wind, solar, and biofuels as sources of electricity.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> John McCain said if Gore says it's doable, he believes it is. Barack Obama praised Gore's proposal as a strategy that will create millions of new jobs and help the environment.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Then it was back to the daily slugfest. What's striking is how little discussion we are having about fixes for the problems we face. It's a presidential election year in which you'd think the contest was to find the candidate with the cleverest ad or the one whose aim is better at lobbing verbal grenades.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;OBAMA AND McCain both insist they want change in Washington, but on the campaign trail they rarely offer specifics. Their plans are available online. But what you hear day after day is Obama complaining that McCain is really George W. Bush in disguise, and that McCain is running for a third Bush term with George W. Bush's policies and Karl Rove's politics. Obama calls the Republican economic policies &quot;reckless.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;What's the bigger risk,&quot; Obama asks, &quot;choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain's new ad claims Obama is &quot;the biggest celebrity in the world. But is he ready to lead?&quot; It's part of McCain's strategy to depict Obama as inexperienced and out of touch with ordinary Americans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> We're hearing little from either campaign about where these men would lead the country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Interestingly, one of the knocks against Gore and his energy speech was that he was consciously emulating JFK's challenge to put a man on the moon. But if 80 percent of people think the country needs a new direction, what's so bad about that?</span></p>
