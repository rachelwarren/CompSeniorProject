  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It's no coincidence that Barack Obama did his preparation for this week's presidential debate in North Carolina's western mountains. Or that on the day of the debate, Michelle Obama was rallying voters on the state's Atlantic Coast. Or that the Democratic nominee spent the morning after the first presidential debate in the state. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> John McCain? Voters here haven't seen him in six months.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> North Carolina hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter and was on nobody's list of battleground states a year ago. But now, public polls and an avalanche of Democratic voter registrations indicate North Carolina is no longer a safe Republican state. And McCain's efforts to win its 15 electoral votes don't match Obama's full-court press.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I am surprised - and I think you've got to give it to Obama,&quot; said longtime North Carolina GOP operative Ballard Everett. &quot;He ramped up in North Carolina early, he's moved out there and kept those troops working hard.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Yesterday, Obama began airing a new TV ad in North Carolina that blamed McCain for the loss of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The ad - &quot;Mills&quot; - highlights a North Carolina yarn company forced to close 17 plants in the state and lay off 2,600 workers after several major trade deals - which McCain supported - allowed the company's customers to import cheaper yarn.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama and his troops have a lot of history to overcome: President Bush twice won North Carolina by double-digit margins, and White House candidates from both parties have largely ignored the state since 1992.</span></p>
