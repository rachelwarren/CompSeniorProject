  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">EVERYBODY KNOWS the very first rule in picking a vice presidential nominee is to do no harm. Really, you can choose anybody. How dumb would you feel if it turned into an embarrassment? This is why the careful, modern candidate sets up a screening system.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But how dumb would you feel if you got into trouble over your selection for the vice presidential screener? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barack Obama is having the first post-primary crisis . James Johnson, who resigned Wednesday as the leader of the Obama vice presidential selection committee, is an old Washington hand who had helped Walter Mondale and John Kerry with the same task. His aura of experience was apparently not diminished one whit by the fact that both the candidates he assisted lost, and that one of them ran into embarrassing controversies over his running mate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The immediate cause of Johnson's downfall was a charge that he had been given a sweet deal on three home loans by the head of Countrywide Financial Corp., which Obama had criticized for its role in the subprime lending crisis. Since Countrywide seems to hold the mortgage on every house in the United States, it is also disliked by many, many Americans on general principles.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So far, not so bad. As Obama pointed out, you cannot really expect a presidential candidate to set up a committee to vet the people who are going to be on the vetting committee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But there's all this other stuff. Johnson is the former head of Fannie Mae, which under his direction, according to regulators, engaged in accounting practices that were, at best, sloppy. At the same time, he sat on the boards of five corporations, where he appeared to serve as cheerleader for the theory that corporate executives deserve to be paid obscene amounts of money.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">How does someone go up to Obama, who once sponsored a bill to curb excessive executive compensation, and say, &quot;You know the vice presidential search committee? For chairman, how about Jim Johnson? Remember the guy who tried to give the head of UnitedHealth Group $1.4 billion in stock options?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When Johnson quit Wednesday, the McCain headquarters issued a statement saying that the fact he had been selected in the first place raised &quot;serious questions about Barack Obama's judgment.&quot; This does not seem like a great avenue of attack for a campaign in which a large chunk of the top staff was recently dismissed for being lobbyists.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Perhaps in an attempt to differentiate the cases, the McCain spokesman said: &quot;America can't afford a president who flip-flops on key questions in the course of 24 hours.&quot; Under a McCain presidency, the bleeding would presumably go on for weeks and weeks before the inevitable occurred.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Although McCain has, so far, not demonstrated that he can manage anything more challenging than a backyard barbecue, that still does not make the Johnson situation look any better.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The head of the vice presidential vetting committee is not a job for which there are a limited number of qualified candidates. You could appoint a hero firefighter or a nun to be the public face of the search. You hire experts to do the background checks. You would want your own trusted advisers sitting in on the interviews. The other two committee members, Caroline Kennedy and a former deputy attorney general, could have managed on their own.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But no, we have to have a seasoned wise man whose high standing among the movers and shakers of the nation's business and political elite seemed to hinge on the fact that he feels every single one of them deserves more money.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gentle spirits may decide that it's a good thing the Obama campaign is getting this sort of thing out of the way early. Crueler ones may note that at least they can't blame this one on Hillary Clinton.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Just before the final primaries, I was in South Dakota talking to George McGovern, who is the gold standard when it comes to disastrous vice presidential selections. If Obama ever asked him for advice, McGovern said, he'd tell him to avoid exhaustion.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I got that advice from Barry Goldwater. He said watch out for fatigue. That's when you make mistakes,&quot; McGovern added.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">One ridiculous decision doesn't mean Obama won't be a good candidate, but it does suggest he needs to take a long nap.</span></p>
