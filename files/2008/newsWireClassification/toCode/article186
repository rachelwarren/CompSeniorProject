  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> John McCain accused Barack Obama of playing politics with race yesterday, raising the issue after the first black candidate with a serious chance of winning the White House claimed Republicans will try to scare voters by saying he &quot;doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Until now, the subject of race has been almost taboo in the campaign, at least in public.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I'm disappointed that Senator Obama would say the things he's saying,&quot; McCain told reporters in Racine, Wis. The Arizona senator said he agreed with campaign manager Rick Davis' statement earlier that &quot;Barack Obama has played the race card, and he played it from the bottom of the deck. It's divisive, negative, shameful and wrong.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In turn, Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said, &quot;We weren't suggesting in any way he's using race as an issue&quot; but that McCain &quot;is using the same old low-road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A day earlier, Obama argued that President Bush and McCain have little to offer voters so Republicans will resort to a strategy of fear to keep the White House.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;What they're going to try to do is make you scared of me,&quot; Obama said. &quot;You know, he's not patriotic enough, he's got a funny name, you know, he doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills&quot; - white men.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama long has talked about his physical appearance in speeches, but McCain advisers argue he crossed a significant line by accusing the GOP of scare tactics and alluding to his own race in the same breath.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The back-and-forth was the latest spike in a contest that's grown increasingly negative.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Opening a new front Wednesday, the GOP campaign rolled out a commercial that uses pictures of 20-something stars Britney Spears and Paris Hilton to suggest that Obama is little more than a media darling who is unqualified to be president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama's campaign countered with its own ad that called McCain's charges &quot;baloney&quot; and &quot;baseless.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Cedar Rapids, Iowa, yesterday, Obama steered clear of race as he chided McCain, saying: &quot;So far, all we've been hearing about is Paris Hilton. I do have to ask my opponent: 'Is that the best you can do? Is that what this election is really all about?' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain expressed pride in the ad while campaigning in Wisconsin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Moments later McCain praised his rival when an 18-year-old woman criticized Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I just have to say, Obama terrifies me,&quot; she said. &quot;I just want to say I think you should call him on every shot. Don't let him get away with a single . . . we can't afford it.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I respect and admire Senator Obama. We just have stark differences,&quot; McCain replied.</span></p>
