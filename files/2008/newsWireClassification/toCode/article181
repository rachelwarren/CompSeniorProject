  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Post asked some experts for their take on a turbulent week in politics. The conversation continues on washingtonpost.com.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ED ROGERS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Former deputy assistant to President Bush and chairman of the BGR Group</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain's celebrity ad was effective. It wasn't uncontroversial and it didn't please all the political scientists, but it sure got noticed, and it made Barack Obama overreact. Questions about Obama's desire for celebrity status will linger. He now has to be very careful about intersecting with Hollywood, pop culture and entertainment. Lee Atwater said the worst thing you can do in American politics is play to your negative stereotype. Well, Obama's negative stereotype now includes the idea that he may be a little too glitzy. (Speaking of negative stereotypes, when Obama was talking about the pictures of presidents on dollar bills, was he introducing the presumptuous notion that his face belongs on American currency? I wonder whom he thinks he should replace.) </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There are signs that Obama is beginning to believe all the hype. So, thinking he would have media cooperation, he tried to preemptively accuse McCain of attacking him because of his race. He forced it, and it didn't work. Bottom line: If McCain had the celebrity ad to do over again, would he do it? Answer: Yes. If Obama had it to do over again, would he talk about race and presidents' pictures on the money in our wallets? Answer: No.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain broke through this week and helped himself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">CARTER ESKEW</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Chief strategist for Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I once asked a famous commercial advertiser why he didn't attack his big rival, a competing laundry detergent -- say that it &quot;ruins your washing machine!&quot; or &quot;causes hives!&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His answer: &quot;Because I might gain temporary market advantage, but I'd devalue the whole category. Sooner or later, people would stop buying soap.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That may be the main difference between political and commercial marketing: The political marketer is all about temporary advantage -- the field of politics be damned.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We've seen that familiar dynamic this week in the presidential race. John McCain's team has decided, given the gale forces against his candidacy, that he must destroy his opponent. Nine out of 10 political strategists, when faced with his playing field, would probably take this route. Barack Obama is struggling with a more complex strategic question: How does he counter the mud and not tarnish his own brand? A casual attempt this week to flick McCain's charges off his shoulder dragged Obama into a silly and distracting discussion of race. The ghosts of losers past must haunt his team -- will Obama be Swift-boated if he doesn't strike back hard?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">BENJAMIN GINSBERG</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Partner at Patton Boggs and a veteran of three Republican presidential campaigns</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Given the intensity of the subjects -- race, age, hubris and temperament -- this week has the potential to help define the campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For the short term, the McCain campaign succeeded in changing the subject from Obama's triumphant overseas tour. But one good week does not mean victory. Over the next 12 weeks, the McCain campaign needs to reinforce its message, making certain that voters retain the image of Paris-Britney-Obama in one vacuous celebrity breath. They cannot let voters instead remember the Obama counterattack superimposing &quot;old politics&quot; on McCain's picture.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The injection of race into the campaign (whether by Obama's unforced error or by McCain's rapid opportunistic response) can be a game changer. The challenge for the McCain campaign (look what happened to Bill Clinton at the hands of the Obama campaign) is to make certain that this is understood as a smart and strategic inoculation, not a cranky response to an agenda that the McCain camp saw slipping out of control.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WILLIAM A. GALSTON</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Senior fellow at the Brookings Institution</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama campaign needs to think harder about how to respond. The remark about presidents' faces on our currency was a sloppy unforced error, as the campaign quickly recognized, but also symptomatic of a larger problem. On the one hand, Barack Obama cannot afford to let potentially damaging charges go unanswered, as Michael Dukakis did in 1988. On the other, if he gets sucked into the daily back-and-forth of negative campaigning, he will erode what has made him distinctive and attractive. Besides, he seems uncomfortable in that role. It's not an easy call, but on balance, he's probably better advised to stay on the high road while leaving it to surrogates and, if necessary, advertising to answer charges. Getting a vice presidential choice into the fray earlier rather than later would be useful.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the overriding imperative is to drive home the message that put Ronald Reagan over the top: While I stand for dramatic change, I'm a safe choice for president. There's nothing Obama can do about his youth, his paucity of experience as conventionally defined, his newness on the national stage or the color of his skin. But he can help the people get more comfortable with him, in part by relentlessly talking about people's problems in terms they can understand and in settings that emphasize intimacy rather than distance. The message people hear must be, &quot;John McCain thinks this election is about me; I think it's about you. And in all the respects that matter, I'm one of you.&quot; But that message will be credible only if Obama doesn't convey the impression, which he sometimes does, that he, too, thinks the election is about him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">EDWARD J. ROLLINS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Head of Ronald Reagan's 1984 reelection campaign and Mike Huckabee's campaign chairman this year</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">An ad man's dream.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In addition to Obama being compared to the &quot;silly girls,&quot; you also heard he's going to raise your taxes and make us more dependent on foreign oil. That's the good news for those on the McCain team. The bad news is they may be diminishing their own great brand: &quot;Straight Talker, John McCain!&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After being attacked in the primaries by Mitt Romney's relentless negative ads, John McCain refused to respond in kind. The Manchester Union Leader praised him and said McCain has &quot;conviction&quot; and that &quot;Granite Staters want a candidate who will look them in the eye and tell them the truth.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I get disturbed when I hear McCain operatives say this campaign is all about Obama and that they have to define the Democrat as &quot;not ready to lead.&quot; This race is also about John McCain. Is he ready to lead? Is he willing to have the courage to move the country in a new direction? The first test will be whether he has the courage to run an honest, &quot;uplifting&quot; campaign. Or will we be going to have more &quot;negative tactics&quot; from the Rove junior varsity.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We need to demand that each candidate look us in the eye and tell us how he gets us out of the mess we're in and the direction in which he will take the country. If they spend their TV millions doing that, the country will be well served. And, finally, the news media need to be covering the race, not rerunning political commercials.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">TAD DEVINE</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Principal consultant to Al Gore in 2000 and adviser to the John Kerry campaign in 2004</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The celebrity ad and the other attacks are the harbingers of what will inevitably be an incredibly nasty campaign. Will they work? Perhaps. But I believe that Obama will prove to be a more elusive target than previous Democratic nominees, stretching back to George McGovern, who were subjected to the Republican attack machine.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That's because Obama's narrative is not one of an elitist, and his rise from a single-mother home almost to the summit of power is obviously the result of talent and hard work, not favoritism and privilege.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's campaign still must find a way to talk about race -- the central fact of this election -- without appearing to be injecting it into the political dialogue. And the campaign needs to resist the suggestion that it should have opened up a horse-race lead in an election in which no one will soon move the 15 percent who are hanging out as soft or uncommitted.</span></p>
