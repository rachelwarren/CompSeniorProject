  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Barack Obama kept the nation waiting Friday as rumors swirled around his choice for a running mate, while his campaign stayed on the offense, criticizing Sen. John McCain as a rich and confused elitist.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama is expected to name his vice-presidential nominee Saturday before a planned afternoon rally in Springfield, Ill., where he announced his candidacy in February 2007.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Virginia Gov. Tom Kaine spread word he had been ruled out, and Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana was told he was not Mr. Obama's choice, according to party officials, the Associated Press reported. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Kaine said Mr. Obama had telephoned him as another leading contender, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, maintained an unusually low profile. Mr. Biden spent the day at his home in Delaware, huddled with friends and family.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As speculation about which name would come via text message, Team Obama pushed a second day of negative attacks against the Republican rival, who was not able to tell a reporter this week how many homes he owns.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Call it 'country club economics,' &quot; a new Obama&nbsp;ad accuses. &quot;How many houses does he own? John McCain says he can't even remember any more. Well, it's seven.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad shows Mr. McCain riding in a golf cart with former President George H.W. Bush during a recent fundraiser in Kennebunkport, Maine, and contrasts that with images of people struggling to pay the bills.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Democratic National Committee joined in, using language that portrayed Mr. McCain, 71, as senile. &quot;McCain loses track of his homes as Americans lose theirs,&quot; a DNC release blasted.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The McCain camp released its own new ad blasting Mr. Obama as proposing tax increases.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Celebrities don't have to worry about family budgets, but we sure do,&quot; an announcer states. &quot;He's ready to raise your taxes, but not ready to lead.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Beyond the ad wars, the vice presidential speculation dominated political conversation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In Chicago, Mr. Obama, who could be seen in the back seat of a black sport utility vehicle, was spirited into the Park Hyatt Hotel through a side-street ramp marked &quot;private&quot; that accessed an underground garage.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Illinois senator spent about five hours Friday afternoon bunkered in the hotel in the swanky Streeterville neighborhood. The campaign said he was working on his nomination acceptance speech for Thursday at the Denver convention.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The conspicuous presence of Secret Service agents and TV news crews caused a stir in the neighborhood, dotted with high-rise condominiums, upscale boutiques and four-star hotels and restaurants.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I knew something was going on,&quot; said the bartender at the Pippin's Tavern across a side street from the Park Hyatt, when she learned why men in dark suits with earpieces were loitering around the service entrance and private garage entrance to the hotel.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;What is he doing in there?&quot; she asked, echoing the thoughts of reporters staking out the hotel.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">News networks were in a frenzy all day over a possible running-mate announcement, with camera crews staked out in front of the top contenders' homes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But a dark horse emerged when aides confirmed to the Associated Press that Rep. Chet Edwards, who represents President Bush's congressional district in Texas, had submitted vetting papers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A Democratic official close to Bill Richardson said the New Mexico governor was told he had been passed over.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius rounded out the roster of likely contenders - a list that did not take into account any surprises that Mr. Obama might harbor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;No, no, no, no, no, no, no, nooooo,&quot; Mrs. Sebelius told reporters who asked for her latest thoughts on the months-long search, the Associated Press reported.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Wolfson, a former spokesman for Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, said on Fox News that the one-time Democratic front-runner was not vetted for the vice presidential spot.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;She was never asked for any documents,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mrs. Clinton, who has been campaigning for her former rival, demurred when asked about being Mr. Obama's running mate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I am not in that arena,&quot; she told reporters. &quot;That's for him to decide. This is his decision, and I expect him to make it however he believes is best for him and for our country.&quot;</span></p>
