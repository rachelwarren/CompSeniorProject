  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If he wins in November, John McCain would be the oldest person ever elected U.S. president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While age will be a factor in the race, Frank Fryburg believes McCain's age - he turns 72 in August - will help him get elected. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In fact, Fryburg said, some of us consider him a pretty young fellow.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fryburg, a spry 82, has led the county Republicans' Senior Coalition since 2000. He was recently named coordinator for the county Republicans' fall campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fryburg has worked to establish a network of Republican volunteers in the county's retirement homes. They won't have a hard sell, he believes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's experience as a long-serving U.S. senator and former naval officer and prisoner of war will resonate with older people.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I think the senior population will be strongly behind McCain, Fryburg said this morning.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And younger people will also support McCain once they understand and appreciate his credentials, Fryburg predicted. He compared the Arizona senator to his rival. Democrat Barack Obama is 46 and in his first term in the U.S. Senate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I think we have to get the young people to understand that he is a great talker, but there is very little there of substance, Fryburg said of Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain will have his own campaign here, headed by County Commissioner Scott Martin. State Attorney General Tom Corbett also has a local campaign committee, led by county Treasurer Craig Ebersole. While those committees each will have a core group of volunteers, they will benefit from pooling resources.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fryburg said that's where he comes in.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As the GOP campaign coordinator, Fryburg said, he will work with the chairmen of the individual candidate campaigns to coordinate resources, such as staffing information booths at the various local fairs, running phone banks or distributing campaign literature door to door.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I think we'll be very effective, he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fryburg, a former Manheim Township commissioner, is the area chairman of the Manheim Township Republicans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A Brethren Village resident, Fryburg spent a career working for RCA. He still works 25 to 30 hours a week for United Refrigeration Inc.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I don't consider McCain, at 71, that old and worn out yet, Fryburg said of the younger man.</span></p>
