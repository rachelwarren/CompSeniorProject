  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Senate scandal</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The Countrywide Financial sweetheart-loan scandal continues to grow, spreading to senators and other Beltway potentates. We are about to find out if Congress' passion for investigating business ethics extends to conflicts of interest and cash that involve fellow members,&quot; the Wall Street Journal says in an editorial.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Take Sen. Kent Conrad, the North Dakota Democrat whose office issued a Friday statement saying that 'I never met Angelo Mozilo.' What he did not say then but admitted under later questioning by a Journal reporter is that, although he may not have had a face-to-face meeting with the Countrywide CEO, Mr. Conrad had called Mr. Mozilo and asked for a loan. The result was a discounted loan on his million-dollar beach house and a separate commercial loan of a type that residential lender Countrywide did not even offer to other customers, regardless of the rate,&quot; the Journal said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;So after calling the CEO of a company with various matters before the Senate, asking for a loan and then receiving at least two sweetheart deals, Mr. Conrad now says: 'I did not think for one moment - and no one ever suggested to me - that I was getting preferential treatment.' Lawyers will immediately wonder if this isn't a version of the 'ostrich defense,' which judges describe during jury instruction as willful blindness or deliberate ignorance. For what other reason, besides preferential treatment, would one call the CEO of the mortgage company? Does Mr. Conrad call August Busch IV when he wants to buy a six-pack?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both agree</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;What do Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman John Ensign have in common?&quot; Human Events political editor John Gizzi asks at www.human events.com.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The answer is that both agree, at least for now, that the Democratic Party will increase its present 51-to-49 seat advantage in the U.S. Senate after elections this November,&quot; Mr. Gizzi said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;In back-to-back meetings hosted by the Christian Science Monitor in Washington last week, the chairman of the DNC and head of the campaign arm for Senate Republicans differed only in the number of seats they anticipated Democrats will have after the '08 elections. Dean told a Monitor breakfast on Wednesday, June 11, that he expected 'we'll pick up from five to seven seats' in the Senate. At a Monitor lunch the next day, Nevada Sen. Ensign told reporters that for his party to lose no more than three seats this fall 'would be a terrific night for us. I don't want to slip below the four-seat loss.' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hillary's stature</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The whys and wherefores of the collapse of Hillary Clinton's campaign are already achingly familiar. The more interesting question is what Hillary achieved in spite of losing, and maybe even because of it,&quot; New York magazine's John Heilemann writes at nymag.com.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The rapidly congealing conventional wisdom is that the answer is worse than nothing: Her legacy has been tarnished, her status degraded, and her reputation diminished by the brass-knuckle brawl she waged against [Sen. Barack] Obama. But arguments can be made that, by historical standards, Clinton's treatment of Obama wasn't all that rough; that, far from weakening him for his tussle with John McCain, she made him appreciably stronger; that by fighting until the end, she helped gin up a fever-pitch level of engagement among Democrats that will redound to the party's benefit this fall, rather than undermining it,&quot; Mr. Heilemann said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;What strikes me as inarguable is that Hillary is today a more resonant, consequential and potent figure than she has ever been before. No longer merely a political persona, she has been elevated to a rarefied plane in our cultural consciousness. With her back against the wall, she both found her groove and let loose her raging id, turning herself into a character at once awful and wonderful, confounding and inspiring - thus enlarging herself to the point where she became iconic. She is bigger now than any woman in the country. Certainly, she is bigger than her husband. And although in the end she may wind up being dwarfed by Obama, for the moment she is something he is not: fully, poignantly human.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Losing issue</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot; 'Climate change is never going to rise to the status of a top-tier political issue' is how one top climate-policy expert recently described the political lay of the land to me,&quot; James Pethokoukis writes in a blog at www.usnews.com.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Just take a look at the results of a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. The top issue for voters (27 percent) was job creation and economic growth. Right behind was the war in Iraq (24 percent). Then came energy and gas prices (18 percent). Far down the list were the environment and global warming, at a minuscule 4 percent,&quot; Mr. Pethokoukis said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;So despite all the media attention on global warming as an existential threat to humanity, it still scores a bit below illegal immigration in the hierarchy of voter concerns.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;And there lies an opportunity for John McCain to turn the issues of energy and the environment to his advantage in his race against Barack Obama.&quot;</span></p>
