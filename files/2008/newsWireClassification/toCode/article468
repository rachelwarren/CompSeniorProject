  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Former Gov. and U.S. Senate candidate Jim Gilmore has his first campaign television ad on the air, attacking Democratic rival Mark Warner on taxes and linking him to presidential nominee Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad, which began airing over the weekend, aligns Gilmore with Republican presidential nominee John McCain, depicting them as a tandem that will hold down taxes and reduce gas prices. The 30-second spot, paid for by the state Republican Party, is airing in all Virginia media markets except Northern Virginia, according to Gilmore's campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad opens with footage from a debate during the 2001 governor's race in which Warner declared: &quot;I will not raise your taxes.&quot; As governor in 2004, Warner pushed a tax increase through the Republican-run General Assembly, saying it was essential to shoring up the state's finances. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Gilmore ad states that Warner &quot;broke his word ... and gave us the largest tax increase in Virginia history.&quot; It also shows images of Warner campaigning with Obama, and accuses the Democrat of &quot;talking even higher taxes, bigger spending and limiting domestic oil production.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Warner said Monday that the ad misrepresents his positions. He also accused Gilmore of understating the severity of the budget problems Warner inherited after Gilmore left the governor's office. Warner leads Gilmore in public opinion polls and has an enormous funding advantage that allowed him to begin television advertising in June.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gilmore has tried to make taxes and gasoline prices central issues in the campaign, calling for immediate steps to expand offshore oil drilling and allowing drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Warner has said he supports lifting a federal moratorium on offshore drilling and allowing coastal states to decide whether to allow it. But Warner said drilling must be part of a broader energy strategy that includes expanding the use of alternative energy sources and new vehicle technologies, among other things.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Warner picked up endorsements Monday from the Fraternal Order of Police of Virginia and from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Warner traveled to Richmond to receive the Virginia FOP endorsement, which he did not get in his 2001 run for governor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thomas Stiles, the organization's immediate past president, said Warner &quot;worked with us in a responsible and honest way as he grappled with the revenue shortfalls that Virginia faced when he took office in 2002.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tom Perriello, Democratic candidate in the 5th Congressional District, called for U.S. Rep. Virgil Goode to cancel what Perriello called an &quot;inappropriate&quot; fundraiser scheduled for Thursday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Perriello said the fundraiser for Goode, R-Rocky Mount, hosted by the leading Van Scoyoc Associates political action committee in Washington is inappropriate to have on the anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This is typical pay to play,&quot; said Jessica Barba, Perriello's communication director. &quot;You give me the federal max to my campaign, and I'll get you what you want&quot; from the Appropriations Committee, on which Goode sits.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Goode shrugged off Perriello's request as typical campaign season politics. Goode said the fundraiser luncheon, scheduled from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. Thursday, will not interfere with other events he plans to attend commemorating the attacks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Two individuals, Thomas Lankford and Jan Schoonmaker, lobby for defense contractors and universities respectively as part of Van Scoyoc. Their most recent contributions to Goode: $500 and $250, respectively, according to campaign finance data.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Goode said he knows the company as a lobbyist for Virginia Tech.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Perriello said the fundraiser and contributions are another example of something that &quot;makes sense in Washington but not in Southside Virginia. The best way to celebrate [Sept. 11] is making sure we're doing everything we can to the protect troops. ... Having events with corporate lobbyists in Washington isn't the way to go.&quot;</span></p>
