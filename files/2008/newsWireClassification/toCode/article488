  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">New characters are on stage. Scripts have been revised with a fall audience in mind.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And now that the back-to-back political conventions are over, the longest-running presidential campaign in memory enters its home stretch - finally - with the promise of new drama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The dynamics are notably different today from just a couple of weeks ago, when Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama were still only their parties' presumptive nominees. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Gov. Sarah Palin as McCain's running mate changes the story line significantly, a decided curve for a Democratic team unprepared for the hockey-mom-as-attack-dog scenario.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain is signaling a shift in his &quot;we're more experienced&quot; theme by naming a vice presidential candidate who still features the PTA on her r&eacute;sum&eacute;.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And there's no accounting for how Democrat Joseph R. Biden Jr. could shake things up as Obama's recently added sidekick, a smart and quirky character with as much propensity to upstage as to stick his foot in his mouth.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> With two months, four debates (one of them pitting Palin against Biden) and miles to go before its conclusion, the real show starts today.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Coming out of his nominating convention in Denver, Obama has already benefited from what pollsters call &quot;the bounce&quot; - roughly a 5-point gain in opinion polls after four days of televised convention coverage and only modest attention paid to his opponent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The typical gain coming out of the convention is somewhere between 5 and 7 points, though, and the comparable results aren't in yet in the wake of McCain's acceptance speech.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The buzz from the conventions, the dynamism of the new running mates - none of it matters if the candidates themselves can't sell their stories.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Vice presidents are picked for a reason. Biden was picked to fill a hole in Obama's r&eacute;sum&eacute;,&quot; said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia. &quot;Palin was picked in order to do something John McCain has never been able to do, and that's excite the Republican base.... They can fill the holes in the dike, but the dike has to hold as a whole.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In one stroke this week, McCain fired up the conservatives of his party while also reaching out to independent and centrist Democrats who may be tempted to stray from Obama. The right wing of the GOP has been ecstatic over the choice of Palin, who grew up in a traditional Pentecostal church, hunts with guns and opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Palin's down-home bona fides - before becoming governor of Alaska, she was a small-town mayor - are bait for a significant school of voters who never took to Obama in the primary season.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And that brings the narrative to a resurgent character, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. Long a part of the Obama strategy for courting the contingent of voters who followed her in the primary, Clinton became even more crucial to the mix the minute Palin joined the Republican ticket.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;It's going to be a race for those disaffected white blue-collar workers and their families, with all their angst over whether they can pay the mortgage,&quot; said Tom Whalen, a Boston University political scientist and author. &quot;Hillary better hit the campaign trail for the Democrats, or Palin is going to steal their thunder on those important issues.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The fundraising machines are going full-bore, as are the ad makers. The campaign caravans are heading out to the battleground states. The entire campaign has now been collapsed to nine intense weeks until Nov. 4.</span></p>
