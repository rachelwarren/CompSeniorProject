  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Last night I suffered the same dilemma so many women do. Gentlemen, do not put the paper down or flip over to the sports section. I read the sports section first. I do not rush to the paper to find out how to make a perfect corn muffin. If the powers that be wanted you to make the perfect corn muffin, they wouldn't have invented the perfect corn muffin mix.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Last week we had the Olympic trials for swimming and track and field. We had Wimbledon, which gave us the most incredible Gentlemen's Final in the history of tennis. Once all of those important events were over, we had the beginning of the Tour de France. I had little time to think of anything about home and lifestyle and it will be unlikely that I will tune into the 6,000 speeches from our presidential candidates until the Olympics have doused that inspirational torch. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For a woman working at home, I am quite busy and have little time to ponder the all-too-feminine burning question of &quot;What should I wear tonight?&quot; The Olympic trialists don't care. Tiger Woods doesn't care. The incredible athletes in their Wimbledon whites don't care and I am sure the cyclists don't even have time to look at the adoring crowds on the byways of Brittany and beyond.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But there are times that one must put away the important events of the day and greet people who have no idea what the peloton is to bike racing. Then you're forced to ask the question, &quot;What should I wear tonight?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You may be too young to remember a nickel or dime back defense, but you certainly have asked your spouse, &quot;What should I wear tonight?&quot; Men's choices are limited. They have the narrow range of long pants, shorts, collared shirt and long- sleeved shirt, blazer, suit, sweater or tuxedo.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yet, men ask and we, obviously being the weaker sex, reply, &quot;Honey, does this look right?&quot; And he answers, &quot;You look fine.&quot; I could be dressed as the Travelocity gnome and he would still say, &quot;You look fine.&quot; I never ask, &quot;Do I look fat in this dress?&quot; My eyes may be growing dim, but I still know the answer to that loaded question.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yet there I was staring into my closet and asking the question that Eve probably asked Adam after the biting of the apple: &quot;Honey, what fig leaf should I wear tonight?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I expected no answer, but I did stare into the deep, dark recesses of my closet only to discover that I am totally out of fashion. I am not with it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am not a fashionista. I wasn't even sure what a fashionista was and so I looked it up. According to Miriam Webster, a fashionista is a designer, promoter or follower of the latest fashions. The word was coined in 1993. I make it a point not to use language that was coined after the birth of my daughter and that was far before 1993.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A political ad was on the screen as I looked up the word. It was for Barack Obama. He is not a fashionista. His fashion is a bit on the boring side, as is that of John McCain. The American people lost a true fashionista when Hillary Clinton shed her pantsuits. I wonder what she's wearing tonight.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Why am I not a fashionista? I know that Madonna is one. I don't own any of her CDs. I did see her in the movie &quot;Evita&quot; and she wasn't bad, although I saw Patti LuPone on Broadway, and Madonna wasn't even a close fourth, but she has her style. I could never emulate it. I couldn't figure out how to make a bra out of funnels.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I didn't look all that bad the other night in a crisp skirt and tasteful blouse, but I was hardly a fashionista.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The reclusive polygamous sect raided in Texas is now trying to put its own marketing spin on their way of life. They made the news for weeks and now they must feel that some payback is in order. They are marketing a clothing line complete with long johns, long-sleeved, high-collared dresses, proper blouses and lose-fitting pants. These folks aren't as tied to the 19th century as their attire may make you think they are. They have their own Website. While they are promoting a &quot;Princess Line&quot; straight out of &quot;Little House on the Prairie,&quot; they are hip enough to offer it in eight colors. The Website reportedly says that the clothing offered is for children and teenagers and meets all the qualifications for modesty and neatness. Each piece is said to be made with care. Just try and get your teenagers to wear this style.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Maybe I will log on to their Website. Who knows, I may be the next fashionista.</span></p>
