  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Regarding the Aug. 4 Ruth Ann Dailey column stating that &quot;the Democrats are playing &quot;the racist card&quot; (&quot;Race Card? What About the 'Racist Card'?&quot;), a closer look may be in order. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While talk radio and the Internet are not under the control of either party or candidate, they certainly have become vicious &quot;allies&quot; of the Republican candidate. An endless loop of blatant lies about race and religion relentlessly circulate to the detriment of the voter who might be seeking the truth. You can fault Barack Obama only for not being specific regarding the source of such racist innuendos and lies. He would not be &quot;without evidence to support the charge.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Subliminal messages conveyed by the juxtaposition of Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, various towers and an African-American man have been a common mechanism of destructive political campaigns for decades.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">David Gergen, an adviser to one Democratic and three Republican presidents, got it right last weekend. He said, &quot;I think the McCain campaign has been scrupulous about not directly saying it, but it's the subtext of this campaign. Everybody knows that. There are certain kinds of signals. As a native of the South, I can tell you, when you see this Charlton Heston ad, 'The One,' that's code for, 'he's uppity, he ought to stay in his place.' ... When McCain comes out and starts talking about affirmative action, 'I'm against quotas,' we get what that's about.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the upcoming debates, if Barack Obama is aggressive and brilliant will he be called &quot;uppity&quot;? Conversely, would he be weak and unpresidential if he were &quot;to stay in his place&quot;?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anyone who believes race is not a potential make-or-break issue in this presidential race is delusional.</span></p>
