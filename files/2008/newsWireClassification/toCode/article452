  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barack Obama's people have been especially dismissive of a recent Wall Street Journal report that one of their own had received special loans from Countrywide Financial Corp. with the help of the firm's chief executive, Angelo Mozilo. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama aides are calling the story about Jim Johnson, who serves on a three-person panel that is vetting running-mate possibilities for Obama, overblown and irrelevant - which is sufficient reason for reasonable people to be suspicious.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Records show that Johnson has received more than $7 million in loans from Countrywide, which has sustained billions in losses due in large part to subprime loans the company made to unqualified borrowers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Journal story details the special relationship between Countrywide's Mozilo and Johnson, a former CEO of the Federal National Mortgage Association, also known as Fannie Mae, which is the biggest buyer of Countrywide's mortgages.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Johnson was among a group of Countrywide borrowers known internally as Friends of Angelo (Mozilo) or FoA.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While CEO of Fannie Mae from 1991-1998, Johnson worked closely with Mozilo and, at one point, named him chairman of Fannie Mae's national advisory council.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A 1999 article in the American Banker described the two men as having a close friendship, and as recently as 2003 Johnson praised Mozilo for his leadership of Countrywide, telling Business Week, By strengthening servicing in good times, Countrywide has done a brilliant job of insulating itself for the down cycle.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama campaign deems irrelevant Johnson's association with Mozilo and Countrywide, even though it was at one time critical of Hillary Clinton for employing Mark Penn, whose firm, Burson Marsteller, once represented Countrywide.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Washington Post reported in March that Obama aides said Clinton is in no position to stiffen oversight after taking contributions from mortgage industry lobbyists, including funds from representatives of Countrywide, which has been at the center of the mortgage meltdown.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The charge from the Obama campaign that Clinton was being hypocritical rings hollow, now that we know of Johnson's ties to Countrywide.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama campaign's connection to the subprime-loan mess goes even deeper. The family of Penny Pritzker, Obama's national finance chair, co-owned a failed bank that specialized in subprime lending.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Then there is the sweetheart real estate deal that Obama received from millionaire developer Tony Rezko, who was recently convicted in federal court of using his clout as a top adviser and fundraiser to Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich to demand kickbacks and win government contracts.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama people think Johnson's connection to Countrywide's Mozelo is overblown. They are entitled to their opinion, but others feel differently. John McCain, for one.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There is nothing overblown and irrelevant' about millions of Americans facing foreclosure and Barack Obama entrusting his most important decision as a presidential candidate to a man who has accepted millions in special loans from a subprime mortgage lender, says McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The American people should be concerned about a man whose judgment may be clouded by such favorable treatment.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We are not just talking about Johnson. We are talking about Obama, too.</span></p>
