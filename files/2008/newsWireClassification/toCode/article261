  <p class="c5"><span class="c7"> GOP ATTACK ADS </span><br /><br /><span class="c7">Republicans Look for Edge On Environmental Issues </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Republican National Committee began running ads over the weekend that question Sen. Barack Obama's commitment to energy reform, the first major ad buy by either party in the presidential race. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Record gas prices, a climate in crisis,&quot; says the ad's narrator. &quot;John McCain says solve it now.&quot; The spot then details McCain's &quot;balanced&quot; plan on energy and notes that the senator from Arizona is &quot;pushing his own party to face climate change.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama, it accuses, says nothing but no when it comes to addressing the energy problems the country is facing. &quot;He just says no to lower gas taxes . . . no to nuclear . . . no to more production,&quot; says the narrator before concluding: &quot;No new solutions. Barack Obama: Just the party line.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ads are running in four key battleground states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio. They were produced by a newly formed independent-expenditure arm of the RNC run by Brad Todd, a GOP media consultant.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The advertising effort is an attempt to exploit a rare -- and significant -- financial edge for Republicans. At the end of May, the RNC had $53.5 million in the bank while the Democratic National Committee had just $3.9 million.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With Obama opting out of public financing for the general election and his team taking over the DNC, that financial gap won't exist for long, so Republicans are exploiting it as quickly as they can.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The initial Obama response? A stunned skepticism. &quot;What we need to solve our energy crisis is an honest debate about the choices before us, not more attack ads that mislead voters about the facts,&quot; said Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> -- Chris Cillizza <br /><br /></span><span class="c7">NO LONGER A FAN </span><br /><br /><span class="c7">Kerry Critical of McCain's Calls on the War in Iraq </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) might have flirted in 2004 with the idea of enlisting his Republican colleague John McCain as his running mate, but he sounded distinctly less enthusiastic about the senator yesterday on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kerry, who is a strong supporter of Sen. Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said that McCain &quot;has proven that he has been wrong about every judgment he's made about the war.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Wrong about the Iraqis paying for the reconstruction, wrong about whether or not the oil would pay for it, wrong about Sunni and Shia violence through the years, wrong about the willingness of the Iraqis to stand up for themselves,&quot; Kerry added.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said that Kerry was ignoring the facts on the ground in Iraq.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The truth is Barack Obama buckled to liberal supporters and opposed the McCain-backed 'surge' strategy that's working today, and despite our troops' gains in Iraq, he still maintains his partisan commitment to begin immediate withdrawal of American forces if he's elected,&quot; Bounds wrote in an e-mail. &quot;Only John Kerry would think that demonstrates good judgment.&quot;</span></p>
