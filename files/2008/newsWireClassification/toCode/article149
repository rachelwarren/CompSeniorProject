  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">NEW YORK</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pop culture sure moves quickly. Just last week, Paris Hilton was so 20 minutes ago. And Sen. John McCain was drawing snickers from pop culture aficionados for choosing her and another relative has-been, Britney Spears, in his attack ad against Sen. Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But now, with Hilton's cheeky video riposte to the McCain&nbsp;ad thrusting her back into our collective consciousness, she's current again. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And so the head spins: Does that mean John McCain is now cutting edge?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In her video, posted on the comedy site Funny or Die, the hotel heiress says, &quot;Hey, America, I'm Paris Hilton, and I'm a celebrity, too.&quot; Since that &quot;wrinkly white-haired guy&quot; put her in one of his ads, she says, lounging in a leopard-print swimsuit with keyhole cutouts and metallic pumps, &quot;I guess that means I'm running for president.&quot; She fuses McCain's and Obama's energy talking points into her own succinct hybrid proposal, then announces she's off to find a VP.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Not that she had the last word. &quot;Paris Hilton might not be as big a celebrity as Barack Obama, but she obviously has a better energy plan,&quot; McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Politicians have long used pop culture references to bring a little spark to their campaigns, and it's a risky business. When you hit it just right, it can work wonders. But you'd better make sure you're up to date. Otherwise, a campaign can be accused of being, well, so 20 minutes ago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Which is what pop culture scholars and humorists have been saying about whoever dreamed up McCain's Paris-Britney ad, which, you'll recall, juxtaposed images of the two with footage of Obama feted by adoring crowds in Berlin, suggesting Obama's celebrity was of the same inconsequential nature.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paris Hilton and Britney Spears? &quot;Circa 2003!&quot; quipped Daniel Kurtzman, editor of the About.com political humor page. Marty Kaplan, a media analyst and a former Democratic speechwriter, imagined the ad had been dreamed up &quot;by some aging boomer at the campaign, late at night, surrounded by old issues of People.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Political satirist Andy Borowitz, meanwhile, could only note that this was the same candidate who calls his opponent &quot;Dr. No&quot; - a reference to Obama's response to McCain's energy proposals. &quot;A 1962 James Bond movie - the kids today oughtta love that!&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In seriousness, many have pointed out that McCain's&nbsp;ad, and a second one using Charlton Heston's Moses to mock Obama's soaring rhetoric, amount to a clever trick: turning what are some of Obama's greatest strengths into negatives.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And whether the presumed Republican nominee will benefit in the polls, he's certainly gotten attention. The Project for Excellence in Journalism, which measures media coverage of the candidates, said he managed to virtually tie Obama in press attention the week of July 28-Aug. 3, for the first time since the kickoff of the general election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pop culture references in campaigns haven't always involved celebrities. Walter Mondale in a 1984 debate took the inventive step of channeling a well-known commercial. Of rival Democrat Gary Hart's policies, he asked: &quot;Where's the beef?&quot; It was, of course, the slogan of the classic Wendy's ad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But arguably the most famous pop culture reference in a campaign - exquisite in its succinctness - was Richard Nixon's 1968 four-word appearance on &quot;Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In,&quot; intoning the show's catch phrase, &quot;Sock it to me?&quot; (Nixon added the question mark.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He defeated Hubert Humphrey, whom producers apparently couldn't get.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">pop culture</span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad Sen. John McCain's campaign created an attack ad likening Sen. Barack Obama's celebrity to that of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Responses Pop culture aficionados say the ad is outdated.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a video posted on the comedy site Funny or Die, Paris Hilton says, since that &quot;wrinkly white-haired guy&quot; put her in one of his ads, &quot;I guess that means I'm running for president.&quot;</span></p>
