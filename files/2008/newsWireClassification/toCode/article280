  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Can an &quot;Obamlet&quot; with &quot;Baraccoli&quot; be a useful tool to win the presidential election? Sen. Barack Obama's team hopes so.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Saturday, more than 4,000 people hosted Unite for Change house parties - some with cutesy food names - in honor of the presumptive Democratic nominee, an effort to build the campaign's grass-roots supporters into a force that can't be stopped in November.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's part of the multifaceted &quot;persuasion army&quot; Team Obama hopes to build to do much of its work in the final days of the election, convincing neighbors block by block why the Democrat should be president. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;You'll start planning how to build this movement across the country in the weeks and months ahead,&quot; the campaign instructs supporters for the do-it-yourself political parties. &quot;We're counting on you to keep it going through November.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">From the garlic capital of the world in Gilroy, Calif., to Levittown, Pa., Obama supporters reached out to their friends and neighbors - especially ones who aren't yet registered voters or who backed Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton during the Democratic primaries and caucuses.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ersula Cosby, an Obama voter from the Philadelphia suburb, organized her neighborhood party with a focus on Clinton backers because she recognized &quot;there were some hard feelings&quot; that lingered after the state's hotly contested April primary.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's great to address that issue on a local, personal level. It's better to hear it coming from your good friend, as opposed to being told by the party what you have to do,&quot; said Ms. Cosby, a lawyer who is new to grass-roots politics. One guest was a Clinton backer who will vote for Mr. Obama but acknowledged she needs to &quot;convince a lot of my friends&quot; to follow suit.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The campaign aims to duplicate those efforts across the country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;A human being talking to one human being as a swing voter trying to figure out what to do in this election is a very powerful thing,&quot; Obama campaign manager David Plouffe told reporters last week.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He said it's a sort of &quot;persuasion army&quot; that will help voters &quot;sort through&quot; political news and ads.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alastair Rami of Northwest Washington offered a brunch menu with &quot;Baraccoli Obamlets&quot; to woo &quot;Hillary Clinton supporters and independents and anyone else who hasn't yet made up their mind.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Whether you're an old political pro, someone just getting involved for the first time, or someone who just likes a free brunch and stimulating political discussion, swing on by,&quot; he touted on his MyBarackObama page.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama Web site allows supporters to network and find local events from sign-making to wine tasting on behalf of the candidate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">From a grass-roots organizing standpoint, the site for Sen. John McCain offers little more than press releases and the presumptive Republican nominee's schedule.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Members who sign up for the McCain network receive a welcome e-mail from the candidate suggesting two ways to get involved - a donation, and through the &quot;online action center&quot; to &quot;help spread John McCain's message to your family, friends, neighbors and co-workers.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the Republican does not provide as many outlets for doing so - a voter who signs up to be part of the Virginia team comes to a page with the latest McCain&nbsp;ad and his national schedule, not a Virginia-specific grass-roots page.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By comparison, the Obama Virginia page on Sunday offered a commonwealth-specific blog, four voter-registration events for that day and also presented five regional Virginia groups voters can join to network with fellow fans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Plouffe said he thinks the Democrats can &quot;exploit&quot; the &quot;enthusiasm gap&quot; showcased by many polls that indicate more people are &quot;very&quot; excited about Mr. Obama than feel the same way about Mr. McCain. A recent poll pegged the &quot;very enthusiastic&quot; figure at 40 percent for the Democrat and just 13 percent for the Republican.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He also noted the campaign is confident it can expand the electoral map because of its grass-roots support.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If we want to go try and register people in a community on the weekend, we can do that by asking people to show up somewhere,&quot; he said, adding the McCain enthusiasm numbers suggest his percentage of willing volunteers must be &quot;pretty low.&quot;</span></p>
