  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republican Arlen Specter and Democrat Joe Lieberman made a surprise visit to the York Expo Center to campaign for fellow Sen. John McCain, who today wraps up his two-day Pennsylvania campaign swing. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Greeted warmly by the crowd of about 3,000 McCain supporters, Specter told the crowd that &quot;we have a very high calling&quot; in the state. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This election may very well be decided by Pennsylvania,&quot; Specter said. He added that he believes McCain's reputation as an independent could win over Keystone State voters. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The campaign of Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, seeking to undercut McCain's support in the traditionally conservative central part of the state, released a 60-second radio spot accusing McCain of backing policies that hurt American workers. With a Harley-Davidson motorcycle engine roaring in the background, the ad says McCain called a law that would have required the U.S. government to buy American-made motorcycles &quot;disgraceful.&quot; The York Harley-Davidson factory recently cut 300 jobs, according to the campaign. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain, of Arizona, appeared at the Sturgis motorcycle rally in South Dakota last week. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;John McCain should be ashamed of himself, not just for voting against protecting an American company like Harley-Davidson, but then for going in front of a group of motorcyclists in Sturgis and pretending to be one of them,&quot; Lancaster Mayor Rick Gray, a motorcycle owner and Obama supporter, said in a statement announcing the ad.&nbsp;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Specter accused the four collar counties surrounding Philadelphia of not pulling their weight in recent elections, where many voters in the traditionally Republican areas have crossed party lines to vote for Democrats. Voters there have &quot;been derelict in not polling&quot; for Republicans, Specter said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;John McCain has the ability to carry the Southeast,&quot; Specter said. &quot;Combine that with the steadfastness of the 'T' (the traditionally conservative region encompassing central, northeast and northwest Pennsylvania), and he will be the next president of the United States.&quot; </span></p>
