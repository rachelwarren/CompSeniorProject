  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain may have created his own housing crisis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hours after a report that the Republican presidential nominee-in-waiting didn't know how many homes he and his multimillionaire wife own, Democratic rival Barack Obama launched a national TV ad and a series of campaign stops aimed at portraying McCain as wealthy and out of touch. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With the economy the top issue in the race, Obama sought to turn McCain's gaffe into one of those symbolic moments that stick in voters' minds.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Think John Kerry sailboarding or the first President Bush wowed by a grocery store checkout scanner, Michael Dukakis riding in a tank or Gerald Ford eating a tamale with the husk still on.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think - I'll have my staff get to you,&quot; McCain told Politico when asked Wednesday how many houses he owns. &quot;It's condominiums where - I'll have them get to you.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Later, the McCain campaign told Politico that McCain and his wife, Cindy, have at least four in three states - Arizona, California and Virginia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Property records reviewed by media show McCain and his family appear to own at least eight homes: A ranch and two condos in Arizona; three condos in Coronado, Calif.; a condo in La Jolla, Calif.; and another in Arlington, Va.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Last week McCain cracked that being rich in the United States meant earning at least $5 million a year. His latest comments gave Democrats an opportunity to suggest that McCain cannot relate to ordinary voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both sides are trying cast the other as too rich to understand the working class .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's tax returns showed a total income of $405,409 in 2007. According to her 2006 tax returns, Cindy McCain had a total income of $6 million. She has not released her 2007 returns, which she files separately from her husband.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama and his wife, Michelle, reported making $4.2 million in 2007.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Underscoring how seriously the McCain campaign takes the house controversy, the Republican National Committee responded with a Web site highlighting Obama's ties to Chicago businessman Antonin &quot;Tony&quot; Rezko, a friend and contributor who was convicted in June on more than a dozen felonies in a corruption scandal.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">more election news</span><br /></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">also Thursday</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">CENTENNIAL, Colo. | Threatening letters containing an unidentified white powder were sent to John McCain campaign offices in Colorado and New Hampshire on Thursday, officials said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">No injuries were reported.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At least 19 people were examined at hospitals or were quarantined outside the office in Centennial, Colo., a Denver suburb. The office was evacuated, and authorities were trying to determine whether the powder was hazardous.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A McCain campaign aide said the Manchester, N.H., office had been evacuated and the staffers underwent medical examinations. Barack Obama speaks in Chesapeake, Hampton Roads</span></p>
