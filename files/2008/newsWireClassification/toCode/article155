  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Editor's note: Our Aug. 3 editorial &quot;Campaign is no place for religious bigotry,&quot; about Mitt Romney, John McCain and the evangelical vote, is generating considerable reader response on our Web site. We publish some of these unedited comments.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hey Wash. Times. Newspaper articles are not a place for Religious Bigotry either - against evangelicals. </span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Romney was free to send his delegates anywhere he wanted to after he dropped out just as Huckabee had the right to send his delegates anywhere he wanted when he dropped out.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Romney dropped out when he realized he had no chance and immediately pledged his support to McCain (something he, ironically, has been heavily criticized for doing by Huckabee supporters in comments section over the last few days) while Huckabee stayed in the race far past the date when he was a viable candidate costing McCain additional moneys to campaign against him and, to my knowledge, has been lukewarm, at best, in helping McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I seriously doubt either Huckabee or Romney will be the VP candidate, but, if McCain picked anyone over Huckabee who could blame him? Huckabee has done precious little to support McCain's efforts at getting elected.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As countless people have stated in these forums over the last few days, the evangelical vote is split. If Huckabee has done little in support of McCain and can't guarantee the evangelical vote, why should McCain pick him for VP?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As a black person and a Mormon, I have watched this year's campaign with some bemusement. McCain is already getting the &quot;I won't vote for a black guy vote.&quot; The &quot;I won't vote for a Mormon vote,&quot; while it overlaps somewhat with the other, is much larger. If McCain picks Romney, He will definitely lose. That's the reality of the very bigoted life in these United States.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As an evangelical, I would support Romney or Huckabee as McCain's VP pick. McCain himself is the real problem. I will be voting for him anyway, since I have come to realize that since there are only two choices a stiff necked refusal to accept the lesser of evils will assure that we get the greater of evils. Now , what about the old fashioned bigotry of the WT editorial staff, who profess to know the heats of evangelicals and judge them to be bad?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Maxom</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As a conservative Presbyterian deeply involved in moving the church of which I am a member from the super liberal PCUSA to the much more conservative EPC, I feel my evangelical credentials are not suspect and I agree with the WT editorial position. Romney is a fine man with a distinguished record in both the private and public sector. His personal morals are consistent with those who call themselves evangelicals. This is not a perfect world and you you will find no perfect candidate. Staying home and allowing Barack Obama (the exact opposite of what evangelicals want) to be elected is what gives evangelicals the reputation of being bull headed and stupid.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">sjoiii</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Who the hell are you to accuse me or anyone else of bigotry? Are you some kind of mind reader? Since when does not being interested in a political candidate put you in the same category as the Ku Klux Klan? Since when does a politician or some Editor have the right to publicly slander you, your religion and your constitutional right to vote for whomever you want for whatever your reason?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This has been covered already, even on this very site just last week. Is there no end to your love of fueling the fire? Or is this the only way you get readers to visit your site?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It is only a very small bigoted minority of evangelical Christians that are causing trouble by behaving as bullies. I am an evangelical who voted for Romney, as did my Baptist sister and a number of folks I know.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sadly, I have encountered many hateful anti-Mormon evangelicals on various blogs. This small rabid bigoted group reminds me of the liberals. Liberals are a small segment of the Democratic party, yet they are bullies that demand that all moderates abide by their agenda. These extreme groups, whether extreme right or extreme left never seem to learn that mainstream society will not vote them into the White House. How many elections have the Dems lost due to nominating liberal candidates?!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This huckabee-loving anti-Mormon group could learn a lot from the Dems as to what happens when a small rabid group tries to dictate how our nation will be governed. It is way past time for the bigots to get a clue!!!</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I live in the bible belt (upstate SC) and there were a lot of evangelical Christians and evangelical leaders for Romney at first but then found out about his record and also did not like his attack ad. They all now say they were wrong for not supporting Huckabee. This fact has been on the news and in the papers. Romney has way less support now then he did when he was running.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Don't blame it on evangelical Christians - they supported him at first but now back Huckabee for VP.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">winwinaround</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As a Mormon, I can verify that Mormons have never had any qualms whatsoever about voting for an Evangelical. We do disagree on some religious issues, but agree on others. There are some Evangelicals that will be more inclined to emphasize our points of agreement including some fairly significant social beliefs - and there will be some Evangelicals that will want to point out our differences. I do not feel inclined at all to say what Evangelicals should call themselves. Let them call themselves Christians, Followers, Disciples, Theists, whatever they would like. It is how they live their lives that is most important to me. Except for a small minority of bad apples that are present in every religion (including my own), Evangelicals are a good community of people clearly trying to live right.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ugh, I wish the media would just ignore both Romney and Huckabee. Even though I supported the latter during the primaries, I really hope McCain can get either Condi Rice or Colin Powell on board as VP. Both are strong on defense and very accomplished and well, let's be honest, black. Fight fire with fire, I say.</span></p>
