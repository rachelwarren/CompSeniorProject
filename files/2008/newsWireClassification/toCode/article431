  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">NEW YORK</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin on Friday defended the nearly $200&nbsp;million in federal pet projects she sought as Alaska governor this year even as her running mate, Sen. John McCain, told a television audience she had never requested it. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin, in the second part of an ABC News interview, was confronted about her claims that she was opposed to federal earmarks, even though her request for such spending projects for 2009 was the highest per-capita sum in the nation , and that she opposed the $398&nbsp;million Bridge to Nowhere linking Ketchikan to an island with 50 residents and an airport.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin turned against the bridge project only after Congress had pulled money for it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin told ABC's Charles Gibson that since she took office, the state had &quot;drastically&quot; reduced its efforts to secure earmarks and would continue to do so while she was governor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On the Bridge to Nowhere, Palin said she had supported a link from the mainland to the airport but not necessarily the costly bridge project.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin's comments came after McCain appeared on ABC's &quot;The View,&quot; where he claimed erroneously that his running mate hadn't sought money for federal pet projects.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Not as governor she didn't,&quot; McCain said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The GOP hopeful also stood by two campaign commercials - one which said Obama favored sex education for kindergarten students and another that suggested Obama had called Palin a pig.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama, as an Illinois state senator, voted for legislation that would teach age-appropriate sex education to kindergartners, including information on rejecting advances by sexual predators. And while Obama told a campaign rally this week that McCain's policies were like &quot;putting lipstick on a pig,&quot; he never used the phrase in connection with Palin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;They're not lies,&quot; McCain said, insisting that Obama &quot;chooses his words very carefully&quot; and should never have made the lipstick remark.</span></p>
