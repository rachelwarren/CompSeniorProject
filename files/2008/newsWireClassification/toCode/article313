  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton has scheduled her first appearance with Sen. Barack Obama since the end of the Democratic nomination fight, a joint meeting with some of her top contributors next week at the Mayflower Hotel, officials from both camps confirmed yesterday. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clinton h as not appeared in public since endorsing her rival on June 7, going on vacation after that. But her finance director, Jonathan Mantz, has reportedly been working overtime to arrange the introduction of some of Clinton's fundraisers to Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mantz informed donors about the June 26 get-together in e-mails and urged them to attend.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A day after hiring Patti Solis Doyle, who was fired from Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign in February, Sen. Barack Obama praised her as a &quot;terrific, experienced campaign hand.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama sparked fury from some Clinton insiders when he tapped Solis Doyle to serve as chief of staff to his as-yet-unpicked running mate. Her selection strongly suggests that Obama is not considering Clinton for the ticket, a move that one Clinton donor on Monday called a &quot;slap in the face.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Talking to reporters on his plane, Obama said he has known Solis Doyle for years and organized with her brother in Chicago. &quot;I've known the family for a very long time,&quot; Obama said. &quot;I think that she will bring not only a set of skills that we're going to need as we put together our ticket, but she's going to be a terrific adviser and offer insight and judgment that will help us win in November.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a stark new ad by the liberal antiwar group MoveOn.org, a woman confronts Sen. John McCain about a possible lengthy U.S. troop commitment in Iraq by clutching her baby son and declaring, &quot;You can't have him.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad is slated to debut today and run for a week in the general-election swing states of Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan, with an additional run on CNN and MSNBC funded by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The initial investment is expected to reach $543,000, a MoveOn spokesman said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain has refused to commit to any Iraq withdrawal plan, and has speculated that U.S. troops could remain in the country for decades, similar to the ongoing American military presence in South Korea.</span></p>
