  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He's a Bible student with a knack for numbers, and he's now the Lancaster County Republican Committee's new executive director.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He's 23-year-old Bill Coder of Lancaster, who's taking over a position left vacant since May, when Andrew Heath left to work with Anne Beiler of Auntie Anne's Pretzels. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The local Republican Party announced Coder's hiring Monday morning.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bill has a very high level of enthusiasm for the job, Lancaster GOP Chairman Dave Dumeyer said. He's worked in areas having to deal with financial services, and I think that will have a payoff to help us continue to find ways to raise money.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And with a presidential election less than 100 days away, Coder said one of his first jobs will be firing up core Republican voters for GOP nominee John McCain, even the younger ones who may be leaning toward Democrat Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In my current role as chairman of the (Lancaster) Young Republicans, I know for a fact firsthand the youth is excited about Senator McCain, also, Coder said, pointing to McCain's platform on higher education as an example of the Arizona senator's appeal to younger voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain has proposed an unspecified expansion of federal and state lender-of-last-resort education programs as he expects the credit crunch will make private loans harder to obtain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We need a president and a party that's going to be proactive in finding positive solutions, Coder said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Coder previously worked for Union National Community Bank as a personal financial specialist.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His involvement with the local GOP is extensive, having served as chairman of the Lancaster County Young Republicans, co-chair of the GOP Voter Registration Committee, an at-large executive board member of the Pennsylvania Federation of Young Republicans and a Lancaster city committeeman.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As if Coder's schedule wasn't full enough, he's married and a senior at Lancaster Bible College with a dual major in Bible and pastoral studies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I thought he's always been upbeat, and I like that about him, Dumeyer said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Coder's duties as executive director will be to assist Dumeyer in fundraising activities, running day-to-day operations at GOP headquarters along Columbia Avenue and providing support for the area Republican committees. Coder would not say if he planned to remain as chairman of the Lancaster Young Republicans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">No doubt about it, it's a hard job, Coder said. It's a job that's going to require 150 percent of your time and effort. But working as a financial specialist with Union National, it's given me insight in the business end of things.</span></p>
