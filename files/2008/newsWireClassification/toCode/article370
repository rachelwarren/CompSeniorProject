  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The campaign of Sen. Barack Obama released a TV spot claiming Arizona Sen. John McCain's campaign got $2 million from &quot;Big Oil&quot; while McCain proposed &quot;another $4 billion in tax breaks&quot; for the industry.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The truth is that McCain's campaign has received $1.33 million from individuals employed in the oil and gas industry, not $2 million. Obama himself has received nearly $400,000, according to the most authoritative figures available. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">FactCheck.Org finds the $2 million figure based on a mistaken calculation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Further, McCain is not proposing new tax breaks specifically targeted to the oil industry. He's proposing a general reduction in the corporate income tax rate, which Democrats figure would benefit the five largest oil and gas companies by $3.8 billion.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The core claim of the Obama&nbsp;ad is that McCain accepted $2 million in campaign contributions from &quot;Big Oil&quot; and is &quot;in the pocket&quot; of the industry.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's certainly true that McCain gets far more money from donors in the oil and gas industry than Obama does. And there's no question that McCain's recent support for expanding offshore drilling is a position that the industry favors.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the $2 million figure is inflated. According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics which both campaigns cite as authoritative from time to time McCain had received $1,332,033 from persons in the oil and gas industry (both directly and through company-sponsored political action committees), not $2.1 million as the Obama campaign claims.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Those are the most recent and authoritative figures available and are based on reports on file at the Federal Election Commission as of July 28.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama campaign said it cobbled together its $2.1 million figure by adding one total from a report in The Washington Post, which said oil and gas donors gave $1.1 million to McCain in June, and an older total from CRP, which put the McCain campaign's total at just over $1 million through May 30.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But that turns out to be adding apples to oranges, and it does not give an accurate figure for money that went directly to &quot;John McCain's campaign,&quot; as the ad puts it. Much of the money given in June went to a joint fundraising venture of the McCain campaign, the Republican National Committee and several state GOP committees, an unknown portion of which was passed through to the McCain campaign itself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We judge the $1.3 million figure from the Center for Responsive Politics, which includes any money transferred to McCain's campaign, to be the most authoritative tally of oil and gas donations to the campaign. And we conclude that the $2 million figure in Obama's&nbsp;ad is the result of counting some donations raised during June that actually went elsewhere.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It bears repeating, as we've reminded readers before, that oil companies themselves don't make donations. It's illegal under federal law for corporations to donate directly to candidates and has been since 1918.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad refers to donations from executives and employees of oil companies, given either directly or through company-sponsored political action committees, or PACs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both candidates accept donations from individual employees of oil companies. In fact, when Obama claimed in an ad last March that &quot;I don't take money from oil companies,&quot; we criticized him for being a little too slick. The CRP puts Obama's total from oil and gas donors at $394,465.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Based on CRP's figures, McCain's oil and gas donations account for just 0.9 cents out of every $100 he's raised. Obama's oil and gas total comes to 0.1 cents per $100. That's a significant difference between the two candidates, and it's clear that the industry is favoring McCain with its donations. Whether that puts him &quot;in the pocket&quot; of the industry is a judgment we'll leave to our readers.&quot;</span></p>
