  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The head of Illinois Democratic Sen. Barack Obama's vice-presidential selection committee resigned yesterday, saying he had done nothing improper in accepting special home loans from a company that is at the center of the subprime mortgage crisis, but didn't want the controversy to hurt Mr. Obama's election chances. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">James A. Johnson &quot;did not want to distract in any way from the very important task of gathering information about my vice-presidential nominee, so he has made a decision to step aside that I accept,&quot; Mr. Obama said in a statement. The senator said he was grateful for Mr. Johnson's guidance, and he expressed confidence that the selection process Mr. Johnson set in motion would proceed without him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama campaign had no immediate word on whether Mr. Johnson would be replaced with another unpaid adviser to head the vetting process for a running mate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Two others also tapped to look at potential running mates were expected to stay on. They are Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of former President John F. Kennedy, and Eric Holder, a former deputy attorney general under former President Bill Clinton.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Johnson is a former chairman of Fannie Mae, the quasi-public mortgage guarantee organization, and a Washington insider, having served previously as chairman of the Kennedy Center and The Brookings Institution, a center-left policy organization. Known for his discretion, he also had vetted potential running mates for Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kerry in 2004 and assisted Walter Mondale's vice-presidential search two decades earlier.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Critics had pointed to Mr. Johnson's insider reputation as a contradiction for Mr. Obama, who promises to change &quot;politics as usual&quot; and to look outside Washington for solutions. That argument had found little traction until a Wall Street Journal report Saturday that Mr. Johnson was among a group of friends of the Countrywide Financial Corp. chief executive officer who had received below-market-rate home mortgages.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arizona Sen. John McCain, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, and the Republican National Committee seized on the story, saying Mr. Obama was a hypocrite for criticizing Countrywide's practices publicly, then tapping advisers who benefited from the company's practices. Democrats have criticized Mr. McCain for lobbyists' involvement in his campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama, when asked about the controversy Tuesday, stood by Mr. Johnson, saying, &quot;I am not vetting my VP search committee for their mortgages,&quot; and that to know everything about everyone tangentially connected to his campaign, &quot;I would have to hire a vetter to vet the vetters.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Obama also had dismissed the criticism as a &quot;game&quot; by his opponents, and said it was an important distinction that Mr. Johnson was serving in an unpaid campaign position, as opposed to a government job that had an impact on policy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republicans responded to news of Mr. Johnson's departure by turning up the heat on others connected to Mr. Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They noted that the vice-presidential panel's Mr. Holder had been involved in Mr. Clinton's controversial pardon of financier Marc Rich, who had been indicted for evading more than $48 million in taxes and charged with 51 counts of tax fraud as well as running illegal oil deals with Iran during the 1979-1980 hostage crisis.</span></p>
