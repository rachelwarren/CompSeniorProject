  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democrat Tom Perriello hopes to boost his name recognition with the first television ads promoting his bid for Virginia's 5th Congressional District seat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He might also teach people to pronounce his name.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Perriello, who is challenging incumbent Republican Virgil Goode of Rocky Mount, has hit the airwaves with a pair of ads that have fun with the difficulty many people have pronouncing his name. The 30-second spots feature supporters throughout the district touting aspects of Perriello's campaign, but mangling the candidate's name.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Perriello, from Albemarle County, appears at the end of each ad along with an on-screen graphic displaying the phonetic spelling of his name (perry-L-O). </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I approved this message because how you pronounce my name isn't what's important; knowing what it stands for is,&quot; Perriello says in the ads, which are airing in the Charlottesville and Roanoke/Lynchburg markets.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Perriello is mounting a well-funded challenge to Goode, a six-term incumbent with high name recognition throughout the district. But many voters have a tough time with the Democrat's name, said Jessica Barba, Perriello's communications director.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We all joke about it,&quot; she said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The initial ads are intended to introduce Perriello to voters as the campaign season shifts into high gear, but Perriello also plans to air more issue-oriented ads as the election approaches, Barba said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Goode campaign manager Tucker Watkins said the incumbent won't begin buying television time &quot;until we need to.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;A majority of the voters know the good job Congressman Goode's been doing in his time in Congress and will continue to do,&quot; Watkins said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe McCain takes stump in Va. for his brother John</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Surrogates for Republican presidential candidate John McCain -- including the candidate's brother -- will campaign in Salem and Blacksburg today.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joe McCain will join prominent state and local Republicans to rally support for the GOP presidential ticket, beginning with an 8 a.m. Salem Republican Committee breakfast at the Salem Civic Center. Attorney General Bob McDonnell, U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Roanoke County, state House Majority Leader Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, and state Sen. Ralph Smith, R-Botetourt County, are scheduled to join Joe McCain at the breakfast.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The same group will greet voters at the Olde Salem Days festival beginning at 10 a.m. McDonnell and Joe McCain later will participate in a voter outreach and registration drive outside Lane Stadium before the start of the Virginia Tech-Georgia Tech football game.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Virginia has emerged as a battleground in this election, even though Republican candidates have carried the state in the past 10 presidential elections.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democrat Barack Obama made appearances in Russell County and Norfolk this week, while John McCain campaigned with his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, in Fairfax.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republican activists have said enthusiasm for McCain's candidacy has spiked since Palin joined the ticket. But Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said Friday that Virginia's 13 electoral votes remain instrumental to the Democrat's strategy for winning the election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Plouffe predicted Obama would benefit from aggressive grass-roots and voter registration efforts in Virginia and said he expects a close contest in the state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We think we have great ability to get new voters interested and registered and increase turnout,&quot; Plouffe said in a conference call with reporters from Virginia and North Carolina.</span></p>
