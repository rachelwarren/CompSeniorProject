  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In late winter of 2007, Sen. Barack Obama proposed a novel approach to the 2008 presidential election. The offer? Each party's candidate would rely solely on public financing in the presidential election. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. John McCain agreed to abide by the proposal, which was approved by the Federal Election Commission.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's pledge received a good deal of media coverage - McCain and Obama in deal on public financing,'' read The New York Times headline on March 2, 2007.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alas, while McCain is standing by that promise, Obama is not. Last Thursday, Obama announced he was rejecting public financing and would instead solicit money from donors to finance his campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It is worth noting the promises were made in the beginning of the campaign when McCain's campaign was beginning to sputter and when Obama trailed Sen. Hillary Clinton by a margin of nearly 2-to-1.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It also is worth noting that Obama has raised a huge warchest - nearly half of which has come from small donors whose contributions are $200 or less. And his prowess at raising funds is seen as a way to offset whatever attacks may be aimed at him by groups such as the Swiftboat Veterans for Truth that torpedoed Sen. John Kerry's presidential run in 2004.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The public financing system limits the amount of money campaigns can spend in return for the public money. It was established as a way to reduce the influence of private donations in the political process.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That's important. Since Watergate, every party nominee has used some portion of public funds. Until now.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's decision is disappointing. He has run for office as the agent of change. He has vowed to operate differently from past politicians, and to change Washington. Yet, last week, he reneged on his own public-funding proposal.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain has flip-flopped on a host of issues as well, from drilling off U.S. coasts to making permanent federal tax cuts. But as for accepting public funds for the campaign ahead, he has agreed to stay within the system and has won plaudits for doing so. And when it comes to combatting negative ads, he, too, faces challenges such as the ads now being run by MoveOn.org, as noted in Nicholas Kristof's column on this page.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Although Obama's reasons for eschewing public funding are understandable given his fund-raising prowess and the fight ahead, flip-flopping on a measure he proposed is bound to be used against him in the campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What's worse, Obama's catch-phrase Change we can believe in,'' doesn't carry the same magic it did before he opted out of the public funding system.</span></p>
