  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nobody's perfect is an adage as true for politicians as it is for the rest of us. Perhaps truer. It's true for a presumptuous Barack Obama, for a prickly John McCain, for a glib Joe Biden. And it's true for the newest member of the presidential quartet, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nobody outside Alaska knew Palin before she took an Ohio stage Friday. So in the days since McCain introduced her as his vice presidential nominee, her scant imperfections have been emerging fast, making her party's supporters furious.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The media doesn't understand life membership in the NRA; they don't understand getting up at 3 a.m. to hunt a moose; they don't understand eating a mooseburger; they don't understand being married to a guy who likes to snowmobile for fun,&quot; Florida Rep. Adam Putnam told the Politico Web site. &quot;I am not surprised that they don't get it. But Americans get it.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What Americans don't get, actually, is why guys like Putnam perpetuate a notion that candidates must be somehow flawless, and that those who don't acknowledge that perfection have ulterior motives.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lives are messy things, filled with our own bad judgment and character flaws, with spouses who do things we wish they didn't, with kids who make mistakes, with friends who turn out to be rogues or worse.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Few of us, thankfully, have Bill O'Reilly blustering about those blunders each night or have DailyKos posters spreading rumors about our children. Few of us have snoops checking our resumes for accuracy and adequacy, but each of us has gossips and tattlers trying to do their own mischief.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lasting damage comes only if such people are allowed to succeed -- if they turn mistakes into defining characteristics. If they succeed in distracting us from what matters. So far, at least, not one of the four people at the top of the nation's presidential ballot has an incapacitating scandal in his or her past. None of them is so deficient as to be disqualified.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That's unlikely to quell the chatter about Palin's brief membership, last century, in a secessionist Alaska political party; or Obama's connection with a one-time violent radical years ago; or the circumstances surrounding McCain's marriages; or Biden's appropriation, decades ago, of another politician's words.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Too many commercials, after all, can be bought and sold around America's prurient fascination with such things. But they come to the detriment of the real and necessary debate over issues of actual importance: the flagging economy, the dysfunctional health insurance system, the war in Iraq, energy independence.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Instead, over the next week, endless hours will be spent measuring each one against an impossible yardstick for personal rectitude. Are we now a nation that demands people without blemish -- of deed or character? Our flaws, after all, make us interesting, so why shouldn't they make politicians worth having a beer with, to use the standard of the last few presidential elections. Mistakes are simply part of life.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If we do our jobs as human beings, we learn from them. We move on. We grow. We get better. If we let them, so do our politicians.</span></p>
