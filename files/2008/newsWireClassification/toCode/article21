  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Terry McAuliffe for gov?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe reportedly is thinking about running for governor of Virginia next year. So far, Del. Brian Moran of Alexandria and Sen. Creigh Deeds of Bath County also are looking for the Democratic nomination. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The political blog Wonkette looks forward to the McAuliffe campaign and has a pointed response (http://tinyurl.com.ezproxy.wesleyan.edu/63czv8) to the mocking from likely Republican candidate Bob McDonnell's spokesman: &quot;Terry McAuliffe doesn't know Norton from Norfolk. If he runs, remind me to send him a Virginia state map.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What do you think? Does McAuliffe have what Virginia needs? Did you even know he lives in McLean?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The McCain campaign can't get its talking points on the Biden pick straight.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In an e-mail sent shortly after the Biden announcement, McCain's campaign manager said Biden said, &quot;There has been no harsher critic of Sen. Obama's lack of readiness to serve than his new running-mate, Sen. Joe Biden.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But in an ad released later the same day, the McCain campaign says that Obama didn't pick Hillary because she was such a harsh critic. &quot;The truth hurt,&quot; the ad says, &quot;and Obama didn't like it.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yeah, he didn't like it so much, he picked his harshest critic to run with him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I guess attacks don't need to be coherent to be effective.</span></p>
