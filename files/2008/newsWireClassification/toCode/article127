  <p class="c5"><span class="c7"> A 2009 VACATION? </span><br /><br /><span class="c7">McCain Hints Ridge Would Stay Backstage </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ERIE, Pa. -- Sen. John McCain began a two-day Pennsylvania swing Monday, accompanied by Tom Ridge, but there were conflicting signs about how serious a vice presidential contender the former governor and onetime homeland security secretary might be.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some reporters initially received a copy of the day's schedule with a cryptic notation about Ridge and the No. 2 spot. The schedules were quickly retrieved, with the explanation that the note was just a reminder to McCain and his staff that reporters were likely to ask about the topic. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Later in the morning, the candidate himself talked about Ridge -- but not exactly in terms that gave the impression that the Pennsylvanian would be right down the hall in a McCain administration.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Asked by a questioner at an event at GE Transportation's Erie plant what McCain would focus on during his first 90 days as president, he said he'd &quot;call Tom Ridge to Washington from wherever he's vacationing&quot; and put him to work.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's plant tour allowed him to touch on twin themes of energy and globalization. GE chairman and chief executive Jeff Immelt, who introduced McCain, said about half of the more energy-efficient locomotives built at the plant would be exported.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As the McCain campaign headed to Harrisburg, the plane departed from Tom Ridge Field.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barack Obama interrupted a family vacation Monday to address the exploding conflict between Russia and Georgia , saying he had spoken to Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili to convey &quot;my deep regret over the loss of life and the suffering of the people of Georgia.&quot; Like John McCain, Obama called for &quot;active international engagement&quot; to address the dispute, &quot;including a high-level and neutral international mediator, and a genuine international peacekeeping force -- not simply Russian troops.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But the Democratic candidate's brief public appearance was an aberration in an otherwise quiet week on the island where Obama spent much of his childhood. The Honolulu Star-Bulletin ran photos of the senator walking in the surf with Chicago friend Marty Nesbitt and waving to onlookers after a golf outing. It reported that he had jogged barefoot on Kailua Beach and, with his wife and daughters, delivered a gift basket to his grandmother. According to the paper, Obama is staying in a private beachfront home.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He sketched out his plans at a 4,000-person rally on the first day: &quot;I'm going to get a plate lunch. I might go to Zippy's. I might go to Rainbow Drive-In. I haven't decided yet. Get some Zip Min. I'm going to go get some shave ice. I'm going to go body surfing at an undisclosed location. I'm going to see my tutu -- my grandma -- and I'm going to watch my girls play on the beach, and once in a while I might go into the water. But mostly I'm going to watch them.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Obama's presence caused a stir everywhere he showed up,&quot; the paper reported, but one prominent resident wasn't impressed -- Hawaii Gov. Linda Lingle (R). &quot;This is not 'American Idol,' &quot; the McCain supporter said of the choice facing voters this year, according to the article. &quot;This is making an important decision on who should lead our nation.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hitting back at attacks from the McCain campaign labeling him a &quot;celebrity,&quot; the Obama campaign began airing a new ad, &quot;Embrace,&quot; on national cable TV Monday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;For decades, he's been Washington's biggest celebrity,&quot; the ad's announcer says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;And as Washington embraced him, John McCain hugged right back. The lobbyists -- running his low-road campaign. The money -- billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies, but almost nothing for families like yours.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain is seen with David Letterman, Jay Leno and the ladies of &quot;The View.&quot; But he is also seen embracing President Bush several times -- images consistent with previous Obama and Democratic-funded advertising.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The new ad comes as some Democrats have worried that the Obama campaign has not responded strongly enough to McCain's recent attacks, both in ads and on the stump.</span></p>
