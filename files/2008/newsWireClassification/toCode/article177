  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Philadelphia Daily News </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What so engages us about caricatures?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> People love to look at them because it's a kind of magic to have a few lines represent someone and people know who it is. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What's your process? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I'm too disorganized to have a process. I do try to get a lot of photographs. Whenever the candidates are on [TV] for a speech, I try to sketch from that -- just so I keep looking at them. . . . Cartoonists are the creators and keepers of our treasured national stereotypes and we have to earn that right. So it's a good idea to keep my eyes open.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Your Obama -- difficult?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He's pretty easy. He's got a clearly shaped face and he's got great eyebrows and a great mouth and he's a lean, skinny guy. He came prepackaged!</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And how's your McCain coming along?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Oddly -- and I will charitably call him middle-aged -- middle-aged white men are a pain in the neck to draw because they're so pale. When they get white eyebrows and white hair and no discernible features, that gets difficult.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Size up, if you will, the best of the also-rans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I like drawing Hillary. It's not exactly a policy discussion here, but she has great eyebrows, great cheeks and a good face-shape. . . . I also liked Romney. He looks like a 1950s actor in a Sani-Flush ad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> So anything you won't do, in terms of caricature?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> I don't need to make caricatures so ugly that they're warped. . . . I was never fond of that Hillary-as-a-witch kind of thinking. . . . And black faces are still sensitive, but decreasingly so. Cartoonists are drawing an individual face, not a race.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As a cartoonist, whom would you rather draw for four more years</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I pledge to draw the person who the American people choose to give me. I will be happy and grateful for their choice. But I hope whoever it is will not [again cause] me to have to draw zippers.</span></p>
