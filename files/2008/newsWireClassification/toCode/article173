  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thank you for your editorial &quot;Campaign is no place for religious bigotry&quot; (Sunday). Also your other political campaign news. I wanted to deny myself the aggravation of reading the political news this morning. I tried to avoid reading the irrational blabber of the presidential candidates. Their irresponsible statements increased my decision not to vote for anyone in the forthcoming election. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In spite of the superior intelligence of both candidates, both allow their political manipulator-advisers to stir the election campaign toward scare tactics, racial politics, distrust and anger. Instead of making argumentative remarks, why not discuss openly the economy, the war, education, energy problems and other issues of importance to our country? What we see and read is senseless chatter dominating the news. It is not too late to change the course. Let Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama meet face to face and discuss the real issues facing our country instead of OK'ing the stupid daily commercials on TV, attacking and hurting each other.</span></p>
