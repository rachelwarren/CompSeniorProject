  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The day his son was born -- June 29, 2007 --was one of the happiest of Bret Baier's life. One day later, the Fox News White House correspondent discovered that the baby had five life-threatening congenital heart defects. His father-in-law turned to him and said, &quot;You've found your cause.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Francis Baier is now a bouncing 13-mouth-old with a mighty grateful family: Children's National Medical Center announced yesterday that Baier, his wife, Amy, and in-laws Paul and Barbara Hills have donated $1 million to the hospital. &quot;It's our family's gift,&quot; Baier told us. &quot;We're fortunate to be in the position to give back to a place that has done so much for us.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In his short life, Paul Baier has had two open-heart surgeries and two angioplasties. The first eight-hour operation, when he was just 12 days old, was performed by world-renowned pediatric cardiologist Richard Jonas, who called it one of the most complicated of his career.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Baiers spent more than two months at the center, which persuaded them to make children's heart research and technology the focus of their philanthropy. &quot;One out of 100 kids has some kind of heart defect,&quot; said Baier. Part of the $1 million donation goes to establish a high-tech media room that will allow doctors to consult from all over the world; the balance will support Jonas's research on preventing brain damage during surgery.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The baby is now a toddler: walking, running, dunking the roll of toilet paper in the bowl and throwing it at the wall. &quot;He is awesome,&quot; said his dad. &quot;He is all boy. He gets into everything. . . . We are incredibly grateful.&quot;<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">News and notes on the path to the 2008 nominations:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&Acirc;&middot; If you're going to make fun of a vapid famous-for-being-famous heiress, it's always a good idea to check the donor roster first. The Hilton family looks pretty devoted to John McCain, whose new &quot;Celeb&quot; ad kinda picks on sweet young Paris while mocking Barack Obama, reports our colleague Garance Franke-Ruta. Parents Rick and Kathy Hilton have maxed out with $4,600 in individual contributions to McCain, and granddad William Barron Hilton has given him $2,300 -- plus $35,000 or so to the National Republican Senatorial Committee since 2006. Way to lose your Hilton Honors status!<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">THE SOURCE QUOTE </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;If you notice, since Britney started wearing clothes and behaving; Paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore, thank God; and, evidently, Lindsay Lohan has gone gay, we don't seem to have much of an issue.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">-- Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton explaining why he opposes new legislation to penalize celebrity photographers. Bratton interrupted his morning workout and jumped into a live interview on L.A.'s KNBC-TV yesterday to &quot;set the record straight&quot;: The paparazzo frenzy, he said, was primarily caused by recovering bad girls Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Lohan and is under control.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">LOVE, ETC. </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&Acirc;&middot; Playing hardball: Alex Rodriguez, who said yesterday that his alleged &quot;extramarital affairs and other marital misconduct&quot; were &quot;immaterial and impertinent&quot; to a divorce settlement. In court documents, the New York Yankee responded to wife Cynthia's divorce petition by admitting that their marriage was &quot;irretrievably broken&quot; but that she was entitled only to the amount set in their 2002 prenup, plus child support for their two kids. No extra $$$$ for his late-night chats with . . . say, Madonna.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&Acirc;&middot; Number One: OK! magazine ranks D.C. tops in &quot;Best 10 States to Nab a Single Guy.&quot; Confused about our lack of actual statehood, the celebrity tab also asserts that &quot;cultured men abound&quot; in our fair metropolis. Maryland came in seventh; Virginia is apparently not for single lovers and was shut out.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">THIS JUST IN . . . </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&Acirc;&middot; Luke Russert has a new gig: at-large correspondent for NBC, the network announced yesterday. The 22-year-old son of the late Tim Russert won kudos for his poise and eloquence at his dad's funeral in June; he'll cover youth issues at the GOP and Dem national conventions and the general election for NBC's &quot;Nightly News,&quot; &quot;Today&quot; and MSNBC. The Boston College grad currently co-hosts a sports show on XM satellite radio with James Carville.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">NOTE TO OUR READERS </span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Reliable Source -- pale, exhausted and so-not-ready -- is off for two weeks of sunny beaches, fruity drinks and trashy novels. We'll return Aug. 19; meanwhile, send your tips and sightings to reliablesource@washpost.com</span></p>
