  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> WEST LAFAYTETTE, Ind. -- Barack Obama promoted his proposals to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to countries unfriendly to the United States and to address other security threats at a campaign event in this traditionally Republican state. The Democratic candidate is targeting GOP strongholds early in the general-election battle.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Only a few days before a planned trip abroad to highlight his foreign policy credentials, Obama led a roundtable discussion that included Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana and former Georgia senator Sam Nunn on the campus of Purdue University. Nunn has long worked on nonproliferation issues, and Bayh has served for years on the Senate Armed Services Committee. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The senator from Illinois called for a renewed effort to secure nuclear weapons materials over the next four years from places such as the former Soviet Union. He also proposed convening a U.N. summit on the spread of nuclear terrorism and vowed to aim for a &quot;nuclear-free world&quot; by stopping the development of nuclear weapons.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama also suggested appointing a &quot;national cyber-adviser&quot; who would report to the president on computer security issues.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We've had the debate about terrorism dominate so much of our politics over the last eight years, and rightfully so,&quot; he said. &quot;What this panel emphasizes is -- because a small group of individuals has the capacity to create great havoc -- it is important we don't approach this as an either-or proposition but a 'both'-'and' proposition. Yes, we must hunt down terrorists, but we also have to deal with the weapons they might use and take them out of circulation.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's campaign last week started running an ad touting his work on nuclear nonproliferation issues that noted his alliance in this cause with Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), a popular politician in his home state. The commercial is running in the 18 states that the Obama campaign is now targeting with advertising, which include traditional swing states such as Ohio but also Indiana, Montana, Alaska and North Dakota, which have long voted Republican in presidential elections.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The campaign also plans to start running another ad touting his national security credentials Thursday on national cable channels. &quot;Forty years ago it was missile silos and the Cold War. Today it's cyber-attacks, loose nukes, oil money funding terrorism,&quot; the ad's announcer says. &quot;Barack Obama understands our changing world.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> CINCINNATI -- John McCain called for wide-ranging education reforms Wednesday in a speech before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a group that he said &quot;means more to me than any other,&quot; despite his history of opposition to many of its policies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain, who has received a grade of F from the NAACP for his votes in each of the past four Congresses, acknowledged that he may not win the votes of the group's members in his race against Obama. McCain apologized for skipping the NAACP's convention last year, saying he &quot;was a bit distracted at the time dealing with what reporters uncharitably described as an implosion in my campaign.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Accompanied by former Maryland lieutenant governor Michael Steele, who is black, McCain said: &quot;I am a candidate for president who seeks your vote and hopes to earn it. But whether or not I win your support, I need your goodwill and counsel.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain faces an uphill battle in winning over black voters, given that he faces the first-ever African American nominee from a major political party. In a Washington Post-ABC poll released this week, black registered voters backed Obama over McCain by 94 percent to 2 percent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Republican candidate focused his remarks on the issue of education, saying he would push for federal vouchers for private schools, greater leeway in teaching certification and an expansion of charter schools.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;You know better than I do how different the challenges are today for those who champion the cause of equal opportunity in America. Equal access to public education has been gained. But what is the value of access to a failing school?&quot; he said, prompting applause.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain suggested that by changing the way schools pay teachers, they could promote greater academic achievement. &quot;We will pay bonuses to teachers who take on the challenge of working in our most troubled schools, because we need their fine minds and good hearts to help turn those schools around,&quot; he said. &quot;We will award bonuses as well to our highest-achieving teachers. And no longer will we measure teacher achievement by conformity to process. We will measure it by the success of their students.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And while he has blasted Obama several times this week for his stance on immigration and the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, McCain lavished praise upon his rival this morning. &quot;Don't tell him I said this, but he is an impressive fellow in many ways,&quot; McCain said. &quot;He has inspired a great many Americans, some of whom had wrongly believed that a political campaign could hold no purpose or meaning for them.&quot;</span></p>
