  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Register 100 Virginia voters, presumably those who will vote Democratic, and win a chance to get face time with Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That sort of campaign activity is rarely seen before Labor Day in Virginia and never in presidential elections. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But with Virginia in the new role of swing state, it's a sign of changing times that Obama and Republican John McCain are fighting it out in Virginia's July heat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Not only are were both presidential campaigns airing more television ads before Independence Day than they usually run in the Old Dominion in October, they're already at the point of running point-counterpoint attack radio ads.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Already, Virginians have seen more of Obama and McCain than they saw of major party candidates in any race in at least a generation. Both of them made a pitch Thursday in the state's richest trove of swing voters, the Washington, D.C. suburbs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Even the anonymous but crucial work of door-to-door voter contact enjoys more panache this summer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Richmond Mayor Doug Wilder, who became the nation's first elected black governor in 1990, inaugurated the Democratic voter registration effort Friday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama goal is to register 151,000 new voters by the Oct. 6 deadline. It's a follow-up on the 23,500 new registrations in the two weeks before the deadline for the February primary, most of them young first-time voters smitten with Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The incentive for volunteers to hit the streets in the summer swelter to register voters is the chance to meet the Democratic nominee. Sign up 100 or more for Obama's campaign and you're eligible for a lottery to select five volunteers who get to schmooze with the Illinois senator, said campaign spokesman Kevin Griffis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republicans know the value of door-knocking. Legions of organized loyalists walking neighborhoods were been important in keeping Virginia voting Republican in every presidential race since 1968.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We've always done what they're doing, but I guess not with all the advertising and glitz,&quot; said Del. Chris Saxman, R-Staunton and one of four Virginia co-chairmen for McCain's campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;A lot of this goes on anyway. Maybe it just seems new because we're getting presidential campaign visits when previously we had not,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain and Obama have ads dueling on statewide television. They've largely been ads in which each candidate defines himself on his own terms.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But it's already bare-knuckle on the radio. A Republican National Committee radio ad accuses Obama of supporting a bill to boost taxes on people who make as little as $32,000 a year. An Obama campaign rebuttal ad cries foul and and ties McCain to unpopular GOP icons: &quot;Bush, McCain, Karl Rove that's how those guys work,&quot; a woman mews in the 60-second radio spot.</span></p>
