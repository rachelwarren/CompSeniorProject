  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Aug. 28--Virginia Gov. Timothy M. Kaine unloaded some red-meat rhetoric yesterday as he prepared to make the biggest speech of his political career tonight before 75,000 people and a national television audience.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kaine called a new attack ad by a John McCain supporter &quot;slimy&quot; and had the Virginia delegation in stitches by poking fun at McCain's inability to recall the number of homes he owns.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;How many homes do you have? Good God!&quot; he exclaimed. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's wife, heiress to a beer distributorship founded by her father, is independently wealthy and owns seven homes, the McCain campaign has said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kaine declined to say what he will talk about tonight in his speech at Invesco Field, sometime before Barack Obama accepts the Democratic presidential nomination. Former Vice President Al Gore also is scheduled to speak before Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kaine, speaking from Denver on a conference call with Virginia reporters, said he had not had any conversations with the Obama campaign about the tone of his address, whether it should be &quot;too hot, too cold, or just right.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some Democrats were critical of former Gov. Mark R. Warner's keynote address, saying it was too subdued in its criticism of McCain. Warner emphasized a bipartisan approach to governing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I think Mark was true to himself last night,&quot; Kaine said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kaine was anything but bipartisan yesterday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We've got to draw a sharp contrast with the other side, not with words, but with deeds,&quot; he told Virginia Democrats at a breakfast meeting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kaine said Virginia Republicans spend so much time fighting among themselves that &quot;they are our best allies sometimes.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democrats need to &quot;knock down the silly rumors and negativity that comes from the other side,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We go on the offense about that message of change -- that we need a better economy, that four more years of spiraling deficits and job loss and increasing energy and food costs and more home foreclosures is not what we need.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kaine addressed the Texas delegation in Aurora, Colo., early in the morning before the Virginia breakfast. He was joined there by his wife, Anne Holton, son, Nat, and his mother and father, who had driven from Kansas City, Mo.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The conference call was meant to rebut a new TV ad running in Virginia that attempts to associate Obama with William Ayers, a former radical activist.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Senator McCain is squandering his career in public service with these kinds of slimy operators,&quot; Kaine said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad, appearing in Richmond, Roanoke and Norfolk, was financed by a group called the American Issues Project. One of its financiers is a Texas billionaire who helped finance the 2004 Swift Boat attacks ads against Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic presidential nominee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ayers was a member of the Weather Underground, a radical organization that claimed responsibility for a dozen bombings between 1970 and 1974. He now is a college professor and helped Obama get started in politics.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kaine suggested that McCain had turned to &quot;the merchants of the negative&quot; because he didn't want to talk about the issues.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This shows a disrespect for the electorate -- a belief that they are dumb and can be manipulated,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kaine said he was looking forward to his moment in the sun.</span></p>
