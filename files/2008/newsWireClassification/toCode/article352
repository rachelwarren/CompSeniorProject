  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">JOHN McCain's campaign is attempting to divert the real issues involved in the ongoing battle for the White House.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They are saying Obama and his camp are playing the race card. This is what right-wing Republicans do best. They use diversionary tactics to keep the masses distracted from focusing on the reasons why we're in the economic catastrophe we're now facing. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The administration lets corporations like Exxon/Mobil raise gas prices so they can achieve the biggest quarterly profits in history. The working men and women of America again take it on the chin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's a sad day when we have to make a choice over filling our gas tanks or filling our families' bellies. It is crucial that we stay focused on the real issues like the state of the economy and the fight for good jobs, and the health-care crisis.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Unlike Obama, McCain has not produced any commercials that are deceitful. In Obama's first campaign ad, the </span><span class="c10">Wall Street Journal</span><span class="c2"> noted (June 26), &quot;Obama claims credit for having extended health care for wounded troops, citing the 2008 defense authorization. That bill passes 93-3, but Mr. Obama was one of only six senators who didn't show up to vote.&quot; In his next commercial, Obama lauded his support for welfare reform when in fact he opposed it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John Edwards was considered egocentric when he decided he deserved to be president even though he decided not to run for re-election after his one term in the Senate. But he did finish his term. Obama had served a mere 142 days in the U.S. Senate when he started an &quot;exploratory committee&quot; for a run for the presidency. </span></p>
