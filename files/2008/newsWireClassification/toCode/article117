  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I DO HOPE John McCain still has Phil Gramm's number. He owes the former Texas senator an apology and maybe even a guest spot in his next &quot;Hot Chicks Dig Obama&quot; campaign commercial.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's been a month now since McCain's campaign gave its co-chairman the bum's rush for indelicately describing America as &quot;a nation of whiners&quot; who constantly grouse about how bad the economy is.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;You've heard of mental depression,&quot; Gramm explained, slowly enough for all of us who don't have a doctorate in economics to understand. &quot;This is a mental recession.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain, who was presumably preoccupied with the early stages of formulating his innovative Barack-Obama-is-too-popular-to-win campaign strategy, chose not to defend his old friend.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Instead, McCain declared that, by golly, the U.S. economy really is &quot;in shambles.&quot; And, as a point of clarification, he added, &quot;Phil Gramm does not speak for me. I speak for me.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Well, it turns out old Phil was right, sort of. The economy's not so bad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The truth is, our stomachs are plump, our faces are smeared with chocolate, our lungs are filled with the satisfying cloud of toxic smoke, and all of us -- more or less -- are blotto.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Consider the evidence, from a recent Associated Press report:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* Cadbury PLC, the world's biggest confectionery company, reported a 7.3 percent boost in sales in the first half of the year. The sugar buzz extended to Hershey Co., which posted second-quarter increases in sales and profits.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* Cigarette peddler Philip Morris International saw a 23 percent increase in earnings in the second quarter, and first-half profits were up 15 percent at British American Tobacco, too.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., the biggest brewer in the United States and maker of Budweiser, reported second-quarter profits. News was also good at Diageo PLC, the world's biggest producer and distributor of spirits, including familiar brands such as Johnnie Walker whiskey and Guinness stout.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yes, it's true that these particular consumer products generally tend to fare well, even in bad times.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And yes, according to The AP, these so-called &quot;sin stocks&quot; benefited from increased sales in growing markets such as China and India. But it's clear we Americans are holding our own, too, thank you very much.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So let's set aside, for the moment, all this whining about job losses, foreclosures, mortgage lender bailouts and Iraqi interest earnings.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let's hoist a few, take a long drag on a cigarette and accentuate the positive.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Instead of wallowing in a mental recession, let's wallow in a little chocolate fondue, shall we?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I probably should note that all the &quot;sin stocks&quot; aren't thriving. The gambling and porn industries, it appears, have taken a hit.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But that's nothing a few congressional subsidies -- say, in the form of the &quot;What's Good for Vegas is Good for America Act&quot; -- cannot remedy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So make that call, Sen. McCain. Tell Gramm you're sorry. And give the man a prominent role in your next ad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Maybe something along the lines of &quot;Hot Drunken Chicks With a Sweet Tooth and a Nagging Cough Dig Obama&quot;?</span></p>
