  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain and the Republican National Committee started August with a hefty $96 million, strongly positioned to compete with prolific fundraiser Barack Obama and the Democrats. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republicans have been trying to even out the financial playing field after trailing Democrats in fundraising for most of the election cycle.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain has been a subpar fundraiser and has lagged the more adept Obama in monthly campaign tallies. But the RNC, with big-draw President Bush helping, has trounced its Democratic counterpart in collections. That has helped McCain and the GOP stay competitive financially with Obama and the Democratic National Committee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The July numbers reflect how far McCain and the Republicans have come.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain raised $27 million in July, his largest one-month fundraising haul since clinching the GOP presidential nomination, and had $21 million available to spend The RNC brought in nearly $26 million and had $75 million on hand to compete with the Democrats.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain, himself now has 600,000 donors, while the party said it had reached 1 million.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By comparison, Obama alone recently surpassed 2 million contributors, giving him a larger pool of donors to hit up for money again. He and the DNC have not yet disclosed their monthly takes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Our fundraising continues to be very healthy,&quot; Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, said , noting that July was the fifth straight month that McCain has improved his cash flow.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Despite lackluster fund&shy;raising earlier , the campaign's improved situation has let the GOP nominee-in-waiting keep pace with his Democratic riva in advertising, including $6 million in the ultra-expensive Olympics and three straight months of multimillions in 11 battleground states.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's&nbsp;ad budget for August is expected to exceed $20&nbsp;million. By the convention in early September, Davis said, McCain is on track to spend $60&nbsp;million on TV ads.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">flush with funds</span><br /></p>
