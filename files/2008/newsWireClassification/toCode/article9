  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Vacant argument</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So Sen. John McCain doesn't know how many houses he owns. Could you imagine asking John Kennedy how many houses he owned? What does that matter? Could we please deal with the important issues?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Surge vindicates McCain</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">No one understands peace and appreciates democracy more than someone who has fought for them. Sen. John McCain did that, and he will do what must be done in the future to ensure everyone has the opportunity to enjoy them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When he led the fight for the surge in Iraq -- a politically risky move at the time -- Sen. Barack Obama argued for withdrawal, actions that would have denied the Iraqi people a chance for a lasting peace and a democratic form of government. Indeed, the surge proved to be the correct strategy: The number of casualties is at its lowest since the war began. And yet Sen. Obama still refuses to concede that his call for retreat was wrong. Sen. McCain, meanwhile, has been vindicated. His leadership, judgment and foresight on this issue were prescient.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Obama is not qualified to be this great country's next commander in chief.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bearing false witness</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My ancestors were some of the original settlers in Dickenson County. There isn't a Fleming, Sparks, McPeek or Mullins that I am not related to. I am a white Christian woman. My ancestors helped start the Republican Party, and my first presidential vote went to a Republican.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am voting for Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am appalled and ashamed at the continuing ignorance and prejudice regarding both Muslims and Obama. If you are going to vote against Obama, at least do so based on fact, not the lies and swill put out by the Republican Party. Republicans should be ashamed of themselves. Christians do not bear false witness.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As this election season progresses, something disturbing is unfolding. I fear that government has done its job too well. The sights and sounds of the primaries and conventions are showing that an alarming number of people regard their political favorites as saviors or liberators.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Groups of people crying, fainting or ranting with out-of-control rage over politicians? When did government and its politicians replace our confidence in our ability to control our well-being? After all, if you look at reality, the massive failing of both has created many of our problems. To think that politicians can save us is troubling.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Itchy finger</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It is absolutely disgusting to see the McCarthy-like TV ads from the McCain campaign accepted by the local network stations. Even Fox refused to show them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Too often, John McCain warns us about the dangers of an Obama administration. Now it's time to look at how dangerous a candidate McCain is.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Most important for the nation is his super-hawk position. Two years ago, in an interview with Newsweek, he repeatedly spoke about &quot;the next war,&quot; almost as if he were desiring it. Would we be in Georgia now if he were president?</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The new McCain</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As a Virginia Beach resident who once admired and voted for John McCain, I am heartsick at the course of what should have been a clean campaign in which both candidates offered new directions and relief from the disaster of the Bush administration.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Instead, McCain has embraced one failed Bush program after another; and his campaign is employing McCarthy-style smear tactics against Barack Obama of the sort that Bush once used to defeat McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Failing to denounce those destructive policies and guttersnipe tactics, McCain has lost my support and deserves to lose the election.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hillary in waiting</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hillary Clinton has been an angel all through her defeat and now at the Democratic Convention. This shows her sportsmanship, right? No. She sees Obama as most of us do -- an inexperienced, unknown and radically liberal candidate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With Obama at the helm, along with a Democrat Congress, this country will experience excruciating changes, socially and economically. Hillary knows this. She has written off this election, as she knows 2012 is hers for the taking; we will be so sick of Obama that she will be a shoo-in.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain may not be the best choice for our country, but he sure beats the alternative. If America votes in Obama, I just hope there is enough left in 2012 to salvage.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's friends</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Currently a local TV station is airing a political ad about Barack Obama's connection to Bill Ayers and the Weather Underground. This ad is sponsored by the American Issues Project, a nonprofit organization (read Swift Boat attack). Barack Obama was eight years old when Ayers and the Weathermen were active, and any attempt to connect him to events of almost 40 years ago is absurd.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ayers is now a professor at the University of Illinois in Chicago, where I am sure he was vetted.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He and Obama served on the board of a Chicago antipoverty charity. This &quot;guilt by association&quot; is McCarthyism at its worst, and one wonders why a TV station, which professes to having high standards, would run such trash.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If people want to know what's what, go to FactCheck.org. Or call the local TV station and complain. Or do both. Maybe then we can get rid of this scurrilous type of political assassination.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tears of joy</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re &quot;Barack Obama makes history,&quot; front page, Aug. 28:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The headline should have read: &quot;The country makes history.&quot; The tears of Del. Moe Spencer from Washington, shown with the article, were not just tears of joy but, I strongly believe, tears of pride in his country.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Having come from attack dogs and billy clubs to the events in Denver, I, though white, am sure millions of others shared those tears with him.</span></p>
