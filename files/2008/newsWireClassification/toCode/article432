  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democrat Barack Obama pushed his campaign Friday to a new level of counter-punching &quot;on the issues that matter.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The changes come as national polls find Sen. John McCain and his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, pulling ahead of Obama and Sen. Joe Biden, prompting some Democrats to implore them to fight back harder and Obama's camp to pledge &quot;speed and ferocity&quot; in that effort. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;You know, I'm not going to be making up lies about John McCain,&quot; the Illinois senator told undecided voters in Dover. But he dipped into history, citing the oft-repeated phrase: &quot;If you don't stop lying about me, I'm going to have to start telling the truth about you.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama has called Palin a &quot;phenomenon&quot; and acknowledged she's given her ticket a boost. But his aides say McCain is vulnerable to new criticisms, saying he has stretched the truth in recent comments and ads and that Palin was shaky on foreign policy in an ABC News interview.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Today is the first day of the rest of the campaign,&quot; Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said in a statement Friday. &quot;We will respond with speed and ferocity to John McCain's attacks and we will take the fight to him, but we will do it on the big issues that matter to the American people.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The newest Obama TV ad shows McCain at a hearing in the early 1980s wearing giant glasses and an out-of-style suit. Other images include a disco ball, a clunky phone, an outdated computer and a Rubik's Cube. &quot;Things have changed in the last 26 years,&quot; the announcer says, &quot;but McCain hasn't.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad closes with a photo of McCain standing with President Bush. &quot;After one president who was out of touch,&quot; the announcer says, &quot;we just can't afford more of the same.&quot;<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">more news</span><br /></p>
