  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Did Sen. Barack Obama really call Gov. Sarah Palin a pig, as an ad by Sen. John McCain leads people to believe? </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;No,&quot; McCain said Monday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Republican presidential nominee defended the ad anyway, saying Obama &quot;chooses his words very carefully.&quot; The implication: Obama was slyly up to something when he said McCain's call for change in Washington is &quot;lipstick on a pig,&quot; days after Palin made a lipstick joke at the Republican convention.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;He's very eloquent,&quot; McCain told The Associated Press and Florida newspapers in an interview, and &quot;it was the wrong thing to say.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A day earlier, hard-nosed Republican tactician Karl Rove, a former adviser to President Bush, said some of McCain's ads were not truthful and both sides should cool the attacks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain said of Obama's comment: &quot;I didn't like it. So we responded. I think the American people will judge as to whether he and others have treated Gov . Palin fairly or not.&quot; But he said he won't let attacks go unanswered.</span></p>
