  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We are not getting much straight talk from John McCain these days, but we expect more from The Post. The July 30 front-page headline &quot;McCain Charge Against Obama Lacks Evidence&quot; was so understated that it may actually feed the distortions. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When McCain carefully add the words &quot;according to reports&quot; to charges that Barack Obama canceled a trip to see injured solders because he could not bring along the media, it suggests that the charges have not been substantiated. When McCain staffers cannot produce the reports, it suggests that they are telling lies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A more accurate headline would have been &quot;McCain Uses Troops in Fabrications About Obama.&quot;</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When I read Michael D. Shear and Dan Balz's front-page article about the John McCain campaign ad, it occurred to me that The Post could recoup some of its plummeting ad revenue by laying off the reporters and simply printing Barack Obama campaign press releases. They would be cheaper, better written and less biased.</span></p>
