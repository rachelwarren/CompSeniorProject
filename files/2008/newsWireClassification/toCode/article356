  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">People either old enough to know such things or those young enough to still have hope like to bombard you with statistics about why you should vote in the presidential election this November.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Their rhetoric doesn't seem to vary much, usually just a reference to John F. Kennedy's 1960 defeat of Richard Nixon, or maybe an urging about how important it is to &quot;rock the vote.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Senators John McCain and Barack Obama both have amassed impressive credentials over the years, something commercials will surely remind us about in the next few months, but we're at the point of just treading water until the two debate. In the past few weeks, Obama has name-dropped Lil' Wayne (as a talented rapper, no less) and McCain joked about his opponent being &quot;Dr. No&quot; for not drilling in ANWR (that particular Bond reference is nearly 50 years old).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What matters here is that none of these things do. I love politics and look forward as much as the next guy to a new commander in chief who doesn't leave his final G8 summit by saying &quot;Goodbye from the world's biggest polluter&quot; with an alleged fist-pump. I mean, I even read the insufferable Charles Krauthammer. But when these candidates give speeches or answer questions about establishing a national language or how a &quot;gas tax holiday&quot; is a &quot;good&quot; idea, know that it's all silly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That's why I think it's OK most people don't vote. For example, I go to college, so I am shouted at daily to sign a petition, donate some money or register to vote. I am registered and do plan on casting my ballot for the first time come November, but I realize it bears little importance in the grand scheme of things.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For all the harassing others do of uninformed and uninterested potential voters, it doesn't change the fact that our voices are rarely heard. To suggest in a nihilistic sense that few politicians care and the Electoral College is an antiquated idea is probably true, but not really my point. There's no gain for anyone by pushing someone who is apathetic toward voting. If differentiating between the candidates is difficult, something admittedly possible in 2004 but not so this year, then why subject yourself to looking for a voting booth?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This is not to say politics can't be fun; the movies &quot;Predator&quot; and &quot;Stuart Saves His Family&quot; prove some of the many races are. Two stars from &quot;Predator,&quot; a movie about running through the jungle and shooting numerous rounds at an alien, have been elected governors in the United States. Jessie Ventura of Minnesota and Arnold Schwarzenegger from California were probably not the most qualified to do the job, but definitely the most intimidating. And now Sonny Landham, who had also appeared in the film, is aiming to represent Kentucky in the Senate. If elected, he would work alongside fellow Kentuckian Senator Jim Bunning, famous for throwing a perfect game with the Phillies as well as all that comes with being very Republican.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A little more notorious is Al Franken, who played hapless loser Stuart Smalley on &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; The Harvard graduate is running for Senate in Minnesota, and seems to have a decent shot. Bill O'Reilly hates him, and that's important to many Democrats. He is not funny, but neither was Rick Santorum, so it hardly matters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yep, this is a strange election. You should take part in history if you want to; or just go to class, work and nap on a Tuesday night. Both are equally American, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.</span></p>
