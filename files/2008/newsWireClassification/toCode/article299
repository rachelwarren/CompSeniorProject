  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On this day in 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the G.I. Bill to provide World War II veterans with money for education, unemployment compensation plus home and business loans. Three years later, vets made up half of the nation's college enrollment, according to the History Channel.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The old Depression-era work ethic was very much intact in those days. Only 20 percent of the funds set aside for unemployment was ever doled out. Meanwhile, 20 million veterans and dependents used the education benefits and 14 million home loans were guaranteed for a total federal investment of $67 billion. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Those who took advantage of the G.I. Bill included former Presidents George H.W. Bush and Gerald Ford, former Vice President Al Gore and entertainers Johnny Cash, Ed McMahon, Paul Newman and Clint Eastwood.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The entire presidential election hinges on whether the public perception is that we are a nation at war. If they feel that we are, John McCain stands to win as the safer bet than Barack Obama. If Americans are more concerned with gas prices, I don't see how McCain avoids being stigmatized as the old dude who is obsessed with staying in Iraq,&quot; writes Philip Klein in The American Spectator.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I have to be greeted properly. Fist bump, please.&quot; - Michelle Obama, to her five co-hostesses on ABC's &quot;The View.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I'm all for recycling, but it's better applied to paper and plastic than to the failed policies of the 1970s.&quot; - Sen. John McCain, speaking about Sen. Barack Obama's energy policies during a campaign stop in Houston.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Today, seven out of 10 American citizens between the ages of 17 and 24 who are walking the streets of America cannot qualify for entry into our services without some form of a waiver, and that is a national crisis. If somebody has 'a little stain on their shirt' and they want to raise their hand and come serve their country in a time of war - knowing not if, but when they are going to deploy in harm's way - where would you rather them be?&quot; - Army Lt. Gen. David P. Valcourt, chief of staff of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, at the 2008 Joint Warfighting Conference.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Al Gore is a hypocrite and a fraud when it comes to his commitment to the environment, judging by his home energy consumption.&quot; - Drew Johnson, president of the Tennessee Center for Policy Research, on his study that found Mr. Gore's home burned 213,210 kilowatt-hours of electricity a year, enough to power 232 average American households for a month.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;When they do use power, it's green power.&quot; - Gore spokeswoman Kalee Kreider, telling The Tennessean that the Gores' utility bills have dropped 40 percent since their home was fitted with solar panels and other &quot;green&quot; energy systems.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">52 percent of Americans overall say Congress is doing a &quot;poor job.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">65 percent of conservative voters and 35 percent of liberal voters say lawmakers are doing a poor job.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">73 percent think members of Congress are more interested in furthering their own political careers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">64 percent say Congress has &quot;done nothing&quot; to improve life in the U.S.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">41 percent say Congress is &quot;somewhat likely&quot; to address serious problems facing the nation in the next six months. 30 percent say &quot;most&quot; lawmakers are corrupt.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Source: Rasmussen Reports survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted June 15 with a margin of error of three percentage points.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Security candidates: Domestic arguments exhausted, Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama rattle their swords in fitting fashion.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bin Laden watch: The gutsy quest to find the man behind 9/11 could prove a popularity boost for either party.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Inside the Cabinet: Names of potential appointees bandied about like major league sports trades by pundits.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Michelle and Barack: She gets sweeter, he gets steely and valiant.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Remember, we still have almost five months before Election Day dawns - which means continuing sturm und drang across the media landscape.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Whether for reasons of expediency or laziness, the press usually ends up defining Presidential candidates by one or two go-to adjectives. Once established, these adjectives end up framing much of the ensuing debate, often at the expense of more substantive conversation: Can George W. Bush both be compassionate and a conservative? Is John Kerry really a flip-flopper? When shorthand becomes longhand, a lot gets lost in the transcription,&quot; writes Justin Peters of the Columbia Journalism Review.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We very much hope that 'historic' doesn't become the default adjective used to describe Barack Obama and his Presidential campaign. (Or, if you like, his 'crusade.') By prefacing any mention of the Obama campaign with words like these, the press effectively turns Obama into a symbol instead of a candidate. The conversation becomes less about his policies and more about his place in history, the coverage becomes less about events and more about emotions, and, before you know it, everybody's caught up in crusades of hope, faith, and other treacly cliches.&quot;</span></p>
