  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Former Sens. John Edwards and Sam Nunn are on a list of potential running mates for Democrat Barack Obama, a congresswoman said yesterday, one day after she met with members of Obama's team vetting possible candidates. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, D-Mich., who leads the Congressional Black Caucus, said members of her caucus asked her to forward the names of Edwards and Nunn when she met Wednesday with Obama's vice presidential search team. The vetting team, Caroline Kennedy and Eric Holder, indicated the two were on the list.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Kilpatrick said she made several suggestions during the 45-minute meeting, including former Vice President Al Gore, Pennsylvania Rep. John P. Murtha, and Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland. Gore endorsed Obama in Detroit on Monday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> She declined to say which names were put forth by Kennedy and Holder.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Nunn would bring national security credentials to the ticket, having served as the longtime Senate Armed Services Committee chairman. The Georgian is a member of Obama's foreign policy advisory group.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But Nunn has not been in office for more than a decade, so he is not well-known nationally. He is a conservative Democrat who supported school prayer and opposed gays in the military. Nunn will turn 70 in September.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Criticism for Myanmar: Cindy McCain harshly criticized Myanmar's military junta yesterday while vowing to make improving human rights there a priority if she becomes America's first lady.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The wife of presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain said Myanmar's leaders don't value human life.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;It's just a terrible group of people that rule the country, and the frightening part is that their own people are dying of disease and starvation and everything else, and it doesn't matter,&quot; she said during a trip to Vietnam, where she has worked with a charity that helps children born with facial deformities.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama's family values: Obama sought to reintroduce himself to voters - and address some of his political vulnerabilities - in his first television ad of the general-election campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The 60-second commercial is set to air in 18 states, including Virginia. The ad, called &quot;Country I Love,&quot; is a biographical portrait that stresses his mother's family's roots.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I was raised by a single mom and my grandparents,&quot; Obama says. &quot;We didn't have much money, but they taught me values straight from the Kansas heartland where they grew up.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama apology: The candidate apologized personally to two Detroit-area women who were barred from sitting behind him - and in front of TV cameras - during a campaign rally earlier this week because they wore Islamic headscarves.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He said the actions by campaign volunteers &quot;were unacceptable and in no way reflect any policy of my campaign.&quot;</span></p>
