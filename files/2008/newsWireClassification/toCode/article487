  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain, a POW turned political rebel, vowed last night to vanquish the &quot;constant partisan rancor&quot; plaguing the nation as he launched his fall campaign for the White House. &quot;Change is coming&quot; to Washington, he promised the Republican National Convention.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again,&quot; McCain said in remarks prepared for the prime-time address. &quot;I have that record and the scars to prove it. Senator Obama does not,&quot; he said of his rival for the White House, Sen. Barack Obama. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain also invoked the five years he spent in a North Vietnamese prison. &quot;I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else's,&quot; he said. &quot;I was never the same again. I wasn't my own man anymore. I was my country's.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain's speech was the highlight of the final night of the party convention, but before he took the podium, delegates unanimously awarded the vice presidential nomination to Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. She is the first female ticketmate in Republican history.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain, 72 and campaigning to become the oldest first-term president in history, faced a delicate assignment as he formally accepted his party's presidential nomination: presenting his credentials as a reformer willing to take on his own party and stressing his independence from an unpopular President Bush - all without breaking faith with his Republican base.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He and Palin were departing their convention city immediately after the Arizona senator's acceptance speech, bound for Wisconsin and an early start on the final weeks of the White House campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Palin has been the object of intense scrutiny since McCain tapped her as his running mate last week. &quot;I'm very proud to have introduced our next vice president to the country,&quot; he said. &quot;But I can't wait until I introduce her to Washington.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The last night of the McCain-Palin convention also marked the end of an intensive stretch of politics with the potential to reshape the race. Democrats held their own convention last week in Denver, nominating Delaware Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. as running mate for Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The polls indicate a close race between McCain and Obama, at 47 a generation younger than his Republican opponent, with the outcome likely to be decided in scattered swing states in the industrial Midwest and the Southwest.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Earlier yesterday, Cindy McCain recommended her husband to the nation. &quot;If Americans want straight talk and the plain truth they should take a good close look at John McCain ... a man tested and true ... who's never wavered in his devotion to our country,&quot; she said in prepared remarks. She called him &quot;a man who's served in Washington without ever becoming a Washington insider.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Outside the hall, more than 100 demonstrators calling for an end to the Iraq war were arrested earlier in the day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Palin affair report &quot;vicious lie&quot;: McCain's campaign is denying a National Enquirer report that vice presidential candidate Palin had an extramarital affair. &quot;It's a vicious lie,&quot; spokesman Steve Schmidt said. The campaign is considering legal action, the senior adviser added.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The National Enquirer wrote in its edition dated Sept. 15 that Palin had an affair with a business associate of her husband, Todd Palin. He discovered the infidelity and dissolved the business, the article said. It attributed the allegation only to &quot;an enemy&quot; of the Alaska governor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Millions watch Palin: More than 40 million people tuned in to the Republican convention Wednesday to hear vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin introduce herself to voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> That audience rivaled the one for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama last week. Nielsen Media Research estimated 37.2 million people watched Palin on either ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel or MSNBC. PBS estimated it had four million viewers for the speech. Last week Obama had 38.4 million viewers on the commercial networks, also topping 40 million with PBS and C-SPAN added in.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Those are bigger audiences than the &quot;American Idol&quot; finale or Academy Awards.</span></p>
