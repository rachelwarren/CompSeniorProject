  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Below is an excerpt from &quot;On Faith,&quot; an Internet feature sponsored by The Washington Post and Newsweek. Each week, more than 50 figures from the world of faith engage in a conversation about an aspect of religion. This week's includes a posting by Jacques Berlinerblau. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am vacationing off the coast of Sicily where Internet access is rather spotty (and where no sane person spends much time online anyway). But once I experienced John McCain's &quot;The One&quot; attack ad, I immediately put down my octopus-hunting harpoon and started taking notes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By the time Charlton Heston began doing his Moses shtick, I realized I was in the presence of one of the biggest Faith and Values stories of the campaign. So please permit me a few reflections as I sip my Malvasia (BTW: How's the weather in D.C.?):</span></p>

He effortlessly delivers soaring monologues filled with scriptural allusions. Rendered in churchly cadences, his rhetoric mongers hope and electoral good will far and wide.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The McCain people, I surmise, would like to put a stop to that. With this commercial they try to condition voters (and the media?) to roll their eyes every time Obama &quot;goes there.&quot; Thanks to &quot;The One,&quot; an image of a goofy Obama/Charlton/Moses casting a spell over the sea and swarms of liberal dupes will pop into the heads of Obama's auditors when his rhetoric gets too highfalutin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The next time he enthuses about faith on the campaign trail, he will be looking out of the corner of his eye.</span></p>
