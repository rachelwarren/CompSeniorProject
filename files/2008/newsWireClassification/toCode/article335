  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arecent presidential campaign ad for Sen. Barack Obama features video of Sen. John McCain walking toward the camera with a group of people in power suits, as the narrator says, &quot;the lobbyists, running his low road campaign.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">None of the people pictured are lobbyists, however.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad also repeats a misleading claim that McCain favors &quot;billions in tax breaks for big oil and drug companies.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But McCain's tax policy doesn't target those industries. He calls for lowering the corporate tax rate for all companies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's campaign has been very forthright about criticizing John McCain for having lobbyists work for his campaign. But the new Obama TV ad, released Monday, gives a false picture -- quite literally -- of who exactly they are. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But none of the folks pictured are even former lobbyists. And two are Secret Service agents.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Washington Times' noted the discrepancy in the ad identifying those pictured as, from left to right, &quot;an unidentified Secret Service agent, eBay executive Meg Whitman, McCain, another Secret Service agent, traveling press aide Brooke Buchanan and Greg Wendt, a San Francisco Democrat and volunteer adviser who travels with McCain.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The McCain campaign confirms that those are the identities of the people pictured. Granted these smartly dressed folks may well fit the bill at a Hollywood casting call for &quot;lobbyists.&quot; But they're not lobbyists in real life.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Whitman is well known as the recently retired eBay CEO with a lengthy business career. She's a campaign co-chair. Wendt's career has been in mutual fund management. Both are McCain fundraisers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad's narrator says: &quot;For decades, he's been Washington's biggest celebrity. And as Washington has embraced him, John McCain hugged right back.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The lobbyists, running his low road campaign. The money, billions in tax breaks for big oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours. Lurching to the right then the left, the old Washington dance, whatever it takes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain: a Washington celebrity playing the same old Washington games.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama campaign justifies the ad's statement that &quot;the lobbyists&quot; are running McCain's campaign by citing various press reports about McCain campaign manager Rick Davis, who is a former telecommunications lobbyist; senior adviser Charlie Black, who was chairman of the lobbying firm BKSH &amp; Associates and who recently stepped down to work for McCain; and several other McCain advisers that have worked as lobbyists.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain said in February that while lobbyists serve as his advisers, &quot;they're honorable people, and I'm proud to have them as part of my team,&quot; as reported by the Associated Press.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In May, the McCain camp announced a new conflict-of-interest policy saying that no one working for the campaign could be a currently registered lobbyist. There are now former lobbyists in the campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When we asked the Obama camp about its use of an image lacking any actual lobbyists, former or otherwise, spokesman Tommy Vietor told us, &quot;I think everyone knows which lobbyists are running his campaign.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If so, everyone should also know they're not pictured in this ad.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad also expands upon a misleading claim we've written about before. It says that McCain supports &quot;billions in tax breaks for big oil and drug companies.&quot; (Last week, the claim was only about oil companies.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Either way, McCain's proposal is actually to lower the corporate tax rate for all companies, not just those in unpopular industries.</span></p>
