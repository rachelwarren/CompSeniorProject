  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama spoke to a crowd of voters yesterday in Fairfax, and his Republican rival, Sen. John McCain, held a teleconference with Northern Virginia voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> If Julie Strasberg had her way, it would have been Hillary Rodham Clinton, not Obama, speaking to a large crowd of female voters. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Strasberg backed Clinton until she ended her bid last month to become the first female president. But while some of Clinton's legions of female supporters have been reluctant to switch allegiance, Strasberg is not among them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;He's speaking out for issues that are near and dear to women's hearts,&quot; said Strasberg, 43, a lifelong Democrat and freelance editor from Fairfax.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As Obama looks to the general election, he is reaching out to women, many of whom supported the woman he bested in the bitter Democratic primary fight.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;We take for granted that women are the backbone of our family,&quot; Obama told a crowd of about 2,800 supporters - both men and women -at Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In the speech, he detailed several proposals aimed at making life easier for working women and families, including the expansion of child-care tax credits and increased investment in early childhood education.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> He also said he would expand family- and medical-leave programs and require employers to offer seven days of paid sick leave.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Although Virginia has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, Obama and McCain are investing time and money in the state. Polls show a tight race for Virginia's 13 electoral votes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In June, Obama kicked off his general-election campaign in Bristol and Prince William County, a sign he was placing great importance on the state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;It's wonderful to be back in Virginia,&quot; Obama said yesterday. &quot;We did well in the primaries in Virginia, and we're going to do well in the general election in Virginia.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* * *</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain's campaign also targeted women and Northern Virginia voters yesterday, holding a news conference in Fairfax to defend his record on women's issues.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Susan Allen, a former first lady of Virginia, called McCain an experienced leader who understands the economic challenges Americans face. She said &quot;the promises Barack Obama is making today in Virginia are promises he can only keep by raising our taxes.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Republican National Committee aired an ad in the Washington area to coincide with Obama's visit, criticizing the Illinois senator for voting to tax low-income families.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Last night, McCain took part in a teleconference town-hall meeting with Northern Virginia voters. McCain took the call in St. Paul, Minn., and was introduced by his wife, Cindy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A recent college graduate asked the Arizona senator how he could answer Obama supporters who call him &quot;Bush 2.&quot; McCain referred to Obama as a liberal who reminds him of &quot;Carter 2,&quot; a reference to former President Jimmy Carter.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain touted himself as a fighter of pork-barrel and big-government spending who would bring the spending policies of President Bush under control. He did not mention Bush by name.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Although the questions appeared to be prepared in advance, McCain received one call from a woman in Centreville who was washing her dishes.</span></p>
