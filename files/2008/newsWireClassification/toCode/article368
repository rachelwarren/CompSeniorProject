  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paris Hilton wants American voters to know she's &quot;totally ready&quot; to lead the country, even though she'll have to wait a few years to run for president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The socialite and pop personality has fired back at Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain's use of her image in an ad comparing the worldwide celebrity of his Democratic presidential rival, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, with that of the Hilton Hotel chain heiress.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Tongue in cheek, Ms. Hilton tweaks both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama in the video done for the comedy Web site funnyordie.com. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I'm a celebrity too, only I'm not from the olden days, and I'm not promising change like that other guy -- I'm just hot,&quot; Ms. Hilton, sitting poolside and clad in a leopard-print swim suit, says in her video.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;But then, that wrinkly, white-haired guy used me in his campaign ad, which I guess means I'm running for president. So thanks for the endorsement, white-haired dude.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She later presents her own energy proposal, a hybrid of Mr. McCain's offshore oil drilling plan and Mr. Obama's incentives for new energy technology. &quot;Energy crisis solved! I'll see you at the debates,&quot; she says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. McCain's&nbsp;ad, which raised the ire of the Obama campaign, juxtaposed pictures of the crowd that the Democratic senator drew for a speech in Berlin with images of Ms. Hilton and another celebrity icon, singer Britney Spears. The narrator asked whether Mr. Obama was &quot;ready to lead.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Hilton ad turns that same line against Mr. McCain, while also getting in a jab at the Republican senator's age, 71: &quot;He's the oldest celebrity in the world, like super-old -- old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket,&quot; the narrator says at the start. &quot;But is he ready to lead?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Meanwhile, the video airs images of Mr. McCain with, among others, Yoda from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie series. &quot;I want America to know that I'm, like, totally ready to lead,&quot; Ms. Hilton announces.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She actually won't be ready until the 2016 election. Now 27, she doesn't meet the constitutional requirement that the president be at least 35 years old.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In a statement, McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds responded by saying of Ms. Hilton's video, &quot;Paris Hilton might not be as big a celebrity as Barack Obama, but she obviously has a better energy plan.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. McCain is continuing to press the fame theme in attacking Mr. Obama. In an ad the campaign released yesterday, an announcer calls Mr. Obama &quot;the biggest celebrity in the world.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Ms. Hilton's mother, Kathy Hilton, criticized the original McCain&nbsp;ad, writing Aug. 3 on a liberal-leaning website, huffingtonpost.com, that it was &quot;a complete waste of the money John McCain's contributors have donated to his campaign.&quot; Federal Election Commission records show that Kathleen Hilton and her husband, Richard, have donated $4,600, the maximum allowable individual contributions, to Mr. McCain's White House bid.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The comparison between Ms. Hilton and Mr. Obama isn't original with the GOP contender. In December 2004 at the annual Gridiron Club dinner in Washington, Mr. Obama made light of the attention he was getting then and compared himself to Ms. Hilton.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Andy Warhol said we all get our 15 minutes of fame,&quot; Mr. Obama said after he won a Senate seat, according to a Washington Post account. &quot;I mean, I'm so overexposed, I'm making Paris Hilton look like a recluse.&quot;</span></p>
