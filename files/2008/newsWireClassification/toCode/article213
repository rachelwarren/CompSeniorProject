  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Presidential rivals John McCain and Barack Obama are clashing over Iraq in a duel for the veterans' vote in defense-rich Virginia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At news conferences across the state, both campaigns yesterday announced endorsements from retired military officials. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Virginia Veterans for McCain is led by Paul Galanti of Richmond, a Navy aviator held prisoner in North Vietnam with McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Thomas Beres of Leesburg, an Air Force pilot who fought in the first Iraq war, is the head of Virginia Veterans for Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Virginia Beach, retired Navy Adm. Hank Griffin, a McCain backer, said Obama &quot;would weaken our security and put peace further out of reach&quot; in Iraq and Afghanistan.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Retired Army Brig. Gen. David McGinnis of Williamsburg, an Obama ally, said in Arlington County that McCain would keep U.S. forces in Iraq indefinitely. &quot;His plan is George Bush's plan,&quot; said McGinnis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The exchange is another sign that Virginia, which usually tips Republican in presidential years, may be in play in 2008.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The state is home to major defense installations, including the Pentagon and the Norfolk Naval Base, and has among the highest concentrations of military veterans in the nation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> About 800,000 veterans live in Virginia. Veterans account for 18 percent to 27 percent of the populations of six Virginia cities with 100,000 or more residents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Obama campaign also attacked McCain for a new television commercial - pegged to Obama's trip to Afghanistan and Iraq - that says the Democrat, who opposed the war, is changing his positions &quot;to help himself to become president.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The candidates also clashed over gas prices. With a recent poll showing that 73 percent of Americans favor offshore drilling, McCain started a new television ad blaming Obama for rising prices at the pump. The commercial is running in 11 battleground states but in Virginia is aimed at the Democratic-leaning suburbs of Washington.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Republican candidates across the country are blaming Democratic opposition to drilling for the higher fuel prices.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The GOP U.S. Senate nominee in Virginia, former Gov. Jim Gilmore, spent most of an hourlong debate Saturday trying to link his Democratic foe, former Gov. Mark R. Warner, to higher prices.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The McCain&nbsp;commercial asks, &quot;Who can you thank for rising prices at the pump?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A crowd in the background chants, &quot;Obama, Obama, Obama!&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama opposes drilling offshore and in an Alaska wildlife refuge. McCain is against drilling in Alaska but supports state-approved coastal exploration.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Some analysts say that even if drilling is allowed, it will be five to 10 years before oil can be produced. Gilmore said Saturday that easing restrictions on drilling will drive down prices pushed up by energy speculation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama this month ran a commercial calling McCain &quot;part of the problem&quot; of high gas prices.</span></p>
