  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I was sitting in my doctor's office recently and flipping through a Newsweek magazine that was older than my physician. (The lead story was that the president and his cabinet were fearful that Adolf Hitler might invade Poland.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Anyway, while I was reading about President Roosevelt's worries, my mind turned to my write-in presidential campaign. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">More specifically, I thought about our economy, which can best be described by using a technical term coined by the great economist John Maynard Keynes: lousy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let's face it. Our electronics industry is in the toilet. About the only electronic thing we still make in the United States is The Clapper. Everything else is made in Japan, China or India. We don't even make the best cars anymore.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">About the only thing we still hand-manufacture in this country is the Auntie Anne's soft pretzel.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">During my administration all this will change, for I vow to make America the world's greatest producer of adjustable baseball caps.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This is a great idea. It will work. And I'll explain it to you just as soon as you stop laughing and get up off the floor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">You finished now? Thank you.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Look around. Adjustable baseball caps are everywhere. Everybody is wearing them, except actual baseball players, so I'm surprised nobody thought of it before now, especially our recent presidents, most of whom have been seen wearing them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Every year, millions and millions of adjustable baseball caps are sold in this country, and not one that I've seen was American-made. So my plan is quite simple: We close our ports to overseas shipments, mobilize American industry and start cranking out those suckers in record numbers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After all, we've met challenges before.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">During World War II, Hitler and his henchmen laughed when Roosevelt said America would produce 1,000 warplanes a week. (I read that in another issue of Newsweek in my doctor's office.) We exceeded that goal, and where is Hitler today? Unemployed, to say the least.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So if we gear up as a nation and energize those many thousands of workers whose high-tech jobs were outsourced to Mexico, we can produce enough adjustable baseball caps to blow both Taiwan and Hong Kong, our major competitors, out of the water.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Let Japan keep making its electronics; our recovery will stun the world, and every Japanese employee at Sony will be wearing an adjustable baseball cap made in the USA.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We'll erase the national debt by the end of my first term.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Of course, this all needs to be done tactfully. Besides producing caps with logos such as Let me tell you about my grandkids, we'll customize. But we will not demean ourselves by making silly caps with protruding things like moose antlers, or with battery-powered clocks embedded in them. That's stupid. Every time the wearer wants to know what time it is, he'd have to remove his hat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">My recovery plan is flawless, with one major exception - marketing it to women. They don't seem to have the same infatuation with adjustable baseball caps that we men do. It probably has something to do with their natural instincts for fashion and good taste. So we'll have to find some way to overcome that, possibly through surgery.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Implementing this idea will be tough, but I'm sure my commerce secretary can handle it. That's why I will select Billy Mays - the guy on TV who advertises things such as the Hercules Hook. He could sell space heaters in hell, and he's just the one to help spur our economy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So vote for me, for while Barack Obama promises change and John McCain promises the same-old same-old, with me, I promise endless surprises.</span></p>
