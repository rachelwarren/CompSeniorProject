  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WASHINGTON</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain's campaign people are said to be suffering hurt feelings over Barack Obama's comment that McCain's policies are like lipstick on a pig.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Earlier this week, Obama was said to be upset on behalf of the middle class when McCain joked that a rich person is one who makes $5 million.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When a candidate or his war room demands an apology from the other side, you know they are having a good day, experts say. It is the Outrage Machine in motion, leveraging the whole sorry mess into a fundraising opportunity. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The bad news is, some of this stuff resonates,&quot; said Eric Dezenhall, a damage-control specialist. &quot;The good news is, it's only a matter of minutes before we move on to the next outrage.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The current outrage arose Tuesday when Obama used a couple of metaphors to describe how he believed McCain would carry on like President Bush. &quot;You can put lipstick on a pig,&quot; he said. &quot;It's still a pig. You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change. It's still going to stink after eight years.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, was nowhere in sight in the speech .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But because Palin is a woman and made a lipstick joke at the Republican convention, the McCain campaign took the Democrat's lipstick remark as a sexist smear.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The McCain campaign quickly created an Internet ad juxtaposing Palin's joke with Obama's crack.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Never mind that McCain had described Hillary Rodham Clinton's health plan as lipstick on a pig last year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama appeared outraged at the McCain campaign's outrage.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;What their campaign has done this morning is the same game that has made people sick and tired of politics in this country,&quot; Obama said Wednesday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Some experts agreed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;While we're concerned about lipstick on pigs - and pigs don't vote and have no constituency - we are missing the point,&quot; said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, co-author of a new book, &quot;Presidents Creating the Presidency,&quot; about presidential use of rhetoric.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said the expression is a common one. &quot;The inference in that speech was ... that John McCain was dressing up old ideas,&quot; she said. &quot;The use of 'lipstick on a pig' was a colloquial, commonplace way of saying this.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At the same time, she said, Obama can be faulted for &quot;priming&quot; voters about the age of his senior rival for the White House by talking about wrapping an &quot;old fish&quot; in paper called change.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama is also getting a lot of mileage over McCain's answer to a question at Saddleback Church about what constitutes a rich person. &quot;Some of the richest people I've ever known in my life are the most unhappy,&quot; McCain began. &quot;I think that rich should be defined by a home, a good job, an education. ...&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Then McCain quipped, &quot;How about $5 million?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">All campaigns, Dezenhall says, are populated by operatives &quot;with an active investment in perpetuating a faux pas or a crisis.&quot; That's how offhand comments get twisted into frontal assaults. And it may not matter whether or not a campaign has the facts right when it makes an accusation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What counts, he says, is whether the charge is plausible and plays to type - that McCain is a rich, out-of-touch Republican, for example, or that &quot;Obama is not from America but from an offshore boutique that doesn't value Middle America.&quot;</span></p>
