  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sep. 11--During her barn-burner of an acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin said, &quot;We suspended the state fuel tax and championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress. I told the Congress, 'Thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere. If our state wanted to build a bridge, we were going to build it ourselves.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The &quot;thanks, but no thanks&quot; line got a lot of applause, and Sen. John McCain and Palin have done much to paint themselves as reformers opposed to earmarks and other wasteful spending. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yet the facts simply don't back that up in Palin's case. Palin supported the Bridge to Nowhere when she ran for governor in 2006 and only killed it after Congress made it clear the state would have to pay much of the cost itself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Not only that, but Alaska didn't give the money back. Congress removed the earmark, but let Alaska keep the cash.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Even after the bridge project died, Palin authorized the state to go ahead and spend about $25 million in federal funds on a road to where the bridge would have been -- because otherwise Alaska would have had to give that money back.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In addition, as mayor of the tiny town of Wasilla, she hired a lobbyist who secured more than $27 million in federal earmarks. Some of those earmarks were on &quot;pork lists&quot; put together by McCain to criticize wasteful spending.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As governor of Alaska, Palin has not been shy about asking for pork, either.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This year, even as the federal government faced record budget deficits while Alaska's coffers overflowed with oil revenue, she asked for nearly $200 million in earmarks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Does this sound like a maverick taking on wasteful spending?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin can be forgiven for initially attempting to put the best possible spin on the Bridge to Nowhere. But what should not be forgotten is that McCain continued to put out ads claiming she said &quot;no thanks&quot; to the bridge even after the truth had come out. Palin continued to make the claim at campaign appearances, too.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That's simply shameless, and an insult to the intelligence of America's voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But McCain seems to have run out of shame. How else to explain allowing his campaign to cast Obama's &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; remark as some sort of sexist attack -- when McCain himself used the same phrase to belittle Hillary Clinton's health care plan.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">How else to explain the absolutely shameless McCain&nbsp;ad that makes the false claim that Obama supported comprehensive sex ed for kindergartners.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain likes to consider himself a straight-talker. If he wants to rebuild that reputation, he needs to quit running false ads and standing idly by while his running mate spouts outright lies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Facts matter, and the facts simply do not support the notion that Palin has been any kind of fighter against earmarks. On the contrary, she has been slopping at the trough.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And, no, the use of that very common metaphor is by no means meant to liken Palin to a pig -- except in her unending appetite for Washington pork.</span></p>
