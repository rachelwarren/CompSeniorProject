  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The next time your phone rings, don't be surprised if John McCain's on the line. And if you watch television for more than 10 minutes at a stretch, there's a good chance you'll see Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After decades in which Virginians were all but forgotten by presidential candidates, voters here are getting the kind of political attention typically reserved for voters in swing states such as Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, campaign aides and analysts said this week. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And more of the same is on the way.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Unless polls show one ticket pulling away, the next eight weeks are likely to see a steady stream of personal appearances in Hampton Roads and across the state by the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees and their running mates, Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., and Gov. Sarah Palin, R-Alaska, plus a fusillade of television ads, robo-calls, and e-mail and snail-mail appeals.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Local television ad purchases in Hampton Roads passed the $1 million mark before Labor Day, the traditional campaign kickoff time, according to records kept by local stations. That volume is unprecedented, said Cindi Dove, general sales manager at local CBS affiliate WTKR.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Biden was in Virginia Beach on Thursday. Palin, McCain's surprise choice for vice president , will visit the resort city on Sept. 18.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As the Republican National Convention ended Thursday , aides to the candidates also hinted at plans for additional visits later this month by both Obama and McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's clear we've designated Virginia as a battleground state. ... You're going to see a full-court press in every facet of this campaign,&quot; said Kevin Griffis, a spokesman for the Obama campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama volunteers in Virginia knocked on 120,000 doors last weekend to distribute campaign literature, Griffis said, and hosted 1,000 parties to watch the candidate accept the Democratic nomination.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republicans are busy, too. Along with Palin's planned trip to Virginia Beach, she is likely to show up repeatedly elsewhere around Hampton Roads and in the suburbs of both Richmond and Washington, said Gerry Scimeca, communications director for the state GOP.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In recent statewide races, Democrats have rolled up huge margins in the sprawling D.C. suburbs and have carried or run close to Republicans in former GOP strongholds such as Virginia Beach. Scimeca said self- described hockey mom Palin's ability to combine family and career should help her appeal to thousands of suburban women doing the same thing .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin also will be used to rally Christian conservatives, a key constituency for the party in Virginia, said Mark Rozell, a political scientist at George Mason University in Fairfax.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Many of those voters have &quot;absolutely no enthusiasm&quot; for McCain, Rozell said. The Arizonan dismissed television evangelists, including broadcaster Pat Robertson of Virginia Beach, as &quot;agents of intolerance&quot; in 2000, but Palin seems to have energized them, Rozell added.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin's small-town background presents yet another challenge to Democrats in rural areas. Party leaders such as Gov. Timothy M. Kaine, Sen. Jim Webb and Senate candidate Mark Warner have worked hard to make inroads, but Obama ran weakly in those areas during the state's presidential primary.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We've got to be careful how we talk about her,&quot; said Dave &quot;Mudcat&quot; Saunders, a veteran Democratic strategist from southwest Virginia. Suggestions that Palin's experience as a small-town mayor hasn't prepared her for national office aren't likely to be well-received across the state's southside and southwest, he said.</span></p>
