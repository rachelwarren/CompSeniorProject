  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's choice of Palin bemuses me, since earlier this summer on CNBC, she asked, &quot;What exactly is it that the vice president does?&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In his recent letter, Christopher Brooks wrote, &quot;Having been a mayor and a governor (commander-in-chief of the National Guard of a state with a Russian border), she has more executive experience than Obama, who has never even run a Dairy Queen.&quot; His comparison of the two is laughable.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After graduating with honors from Harvard Law School, Obama taught constitutional law for 11 years and has served in the Illinois and U.S. senates for a total of 13 years. His foreign relations work spans the subjects of nuclear disarmament, genocide and global poverty.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin was mayor of Wasilla, a town smaller than Lititz, for six years. Lancaster's Mayor Gray leads a population nearly nine times this size.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I don't think any of Pennsylvania's small-town mayors would have the hubris to claim they are prepared to be president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Palin has been governor of Alaska, whose population is smaller than Lancaster and Berks counties combined, for 20 months.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Every governor is commander-in- chief of the state's National Guard - none has the power of national deployment. This ritual role denotes leadership experience no more than Alaska's proximity to the Russian wilderness bestows foreign-policy experience.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain failed to choose a VP with the experience to lead our country, should the need arise.</span></p>
