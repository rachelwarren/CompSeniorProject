  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> John McCain's campaign suggested yesterday that rival Barack Obama snubbed Hillary Rodham Clinton as his running mate because of her criticism during the battle for the Democratic nomination. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> While McCain had no public schedule yesterday, he told CBS News that Biden was a &quot;wise selection&quot; who will be formidable. But the Arizona senator was critical of the Obama-Biden ticket on foreign policy, citing disagreements with Biden's decision to vote against the first Gulf War as well as his position that Iraq should be divided &quot;into three different countries.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama's campaign dismissed the claim about snubbing Clinton.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Campaigning in the battleground state of Wisconsin, Obama said he was &quot;absolutely convinced&quot; fellow senator Biden was right for the job.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;He's got the passion to lift up middle-class Americans, he hasn't forgotten his working-class roots, he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up,&quot; Obama told reporters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Previewing the week ahead, he said he hoped convention viewers would conclude, &quot; 'He's sort of like us. He comes from a middle-class background, went to school on scholarships. He and his wife had to figure out child care and how to start a college fund for their kids.' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama was also planning campaign stops in Iowa, Missouri and Montana before the nomination becomes his Thursday in Denver.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Since Biden's selection on Saturday, the McCain campaign has come out with two campaign ads addressing the Democratic candidate's choice.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The latest, released by the campaign early yesterday, features clips of Clinton during the primary battle saying critical things about Obama, including, &quot;Senator Obama's campaign has become increasingly negative.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A voiceover announcer says, &quot;She won millions of votes but isn't on the ticket. Why? For speaking the truth.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Clinton spokeswoman Kathleen Strand said the New York senator's &quot;support of Barack Obama is clear. She has said repeatedly that Barack Obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country, getting us out of Iraq and expanding access to health care. John McCain doesn't. It's interesting how those remarks didn't make it into his ad.&quot;</span></p>
