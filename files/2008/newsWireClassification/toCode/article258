  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Using the now-famous footage of Sen. John McCain hugging President Bush, Sen. Barack Obama launched new ads in four battleground states, arguing that the Arizona Republican represents more of the same on energy policy. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;On gas prices, John McCain is part of the problem,&quot; says the ad's narrator, adding that McCain voted with the current president 95 percent of the time -- echoing an attack used to great effect against Republican incumbents during the 2006 midterm elections.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama, according to the ad, will &quot;make energy independence an urgent priority&quot; with a &quot;real plan&quot; and &quot;new energy.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad is a response to a commercial begun this week by the Republican National Committee's independent expenditure arm that casts Obama as a rubber stamp for the Democratic party line on energy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;He just says no to lower gas taxes. . . . No to nuclear. . . . No to more production,&quot; the narrator says before concluding: &quot;No new solutions. Barack Obama: Just the party line.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both ads are running in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Barack Obama today launched the first attack ad from either campaign in this election, which follows a string of calculating position changes proving that Barack Obama's commitment to a new type of politics is officially over,&quot; McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said.</span></p>
