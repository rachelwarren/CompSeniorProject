  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said yesterday that the financial crisis that has pounded the country - coupled with higher inflation - is taking a toll on the economy and poses a major challenge to Fed policymakers as they try to restore stability.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Although we have seen improved functioning in some markets, the financial storm that reached gale force&quot; around this time last year &quot;has not yet subsided, and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment,&quot; Bernanke said in a speech to a high-profile economics conference here. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> While Bernanke welcomed the recent drops in oil and other commodities' prices, and believes inflation will moderate this year and next, the Fed chief also warned that the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Fed, he said, would monitor the situation closely and will &quot;act as necessary&quot; to make sure that inflation doesn't get out of hand.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The current financial and economic environment is one of the most challenging to Fed policymakers &quot;in memory,&quot; he acknowledged.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Given those dueling economic cross-currents - weak economic growth and higher inflation - many economists believe the Fed will leave rates where they are at its next meeting on Sept. 16, and probably through the rest of this year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;They won't act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy,&quot; said Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Decision Economics Inc.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Many fear the economy will hit a rough patch later this year as the bracing effect of the government's tax-rebate checks fades.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The economy is the top concern for voters and of keen interest to presidential contenders Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain, who are gearing up for their party's conventions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Financial and credit problems are expected to smolder into next year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And, the unemployment rate, which jumped to a four-year high of 5.7 percent in July, is expected to keep rising.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The bulk of Bernanke's speech dealt with the need to bolster oversight of the nation's financial system to make it better able to withstand future shocks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> To that end, Bernanke recommended that regulators work on ways to assess the health of the entire financial system, rather than the condition of individual banks, Wall Street investment firms or other financial companies - as is currently the focus.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered,&quot; he said. &quot;Some caution is in order, however, as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise.&quot; He added that &quot;stress tests&quot; for a range of financial firms might also be helpful.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Fed has taken unprecedented steps over the past year to battle the nation's worst credit and financial crises in decades.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> To brace the wobbly economy, the central bank has slashed its key interest rate by 3.25 percentage points, the most aggressive rate-cutting campaign in decades. Those rate cuts aggravated inflation, though.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Fed also has taken some debatable action to stabilize the shaky financial system and to get credit - the economy's lifeblood - flowing more freely.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Fed agreed in March to let investment houses draw emergency loans directly from the central bank, and last month extended that option to Fannie and Freddie. For years, such lending privileges were extended only to commercial banks. </span></p>
