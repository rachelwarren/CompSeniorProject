  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Would you bring an 8-foot-tall burning torch to a political rally? What about drinking John McCain-brand juice?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Those gestures may sound odd today, but burning torches were one of the first examples of American campaign memorabilia in the 1800s. And presidential nominees in the 1960s had their names emblazoned on juice cans, including Barry Goldwater's &quot;gold water&quot; - &quot;the right drink for the conservative taste.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It wasn't all witch-hunting and thirst-quenching; there was plenty of potty humor, too. In fact, early American campaign memorabilia make today's wry slogans on T-shirts look tame. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Some trinkets were signs of the times never to be seen again - the McKinley parasol, the Eisenhower cigarette pack and the Kennedy paper dress. Others have evolved. The political button may have gotten its start as coat buttons like the ones made to commemorate Washington's inauguration in 1789, said Sara Henry, deputy director and chief curator of the Museum of the City of New York.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;This brass button says 'Long live the president,' and this one has his initials in the middle,&quot; she said, pointing to the encased artifacts. The buttons are part of the exhibit &quot;Campaigning for President: New York and the American Election,&quot; which is open at the museum through Election Day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">***************</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But it was not until the middle of the 19th century when all white men got the vote - as opposed to just landowners - that political parties used memorabilia to &quot;sell&quot; candidates to the masses, Henry said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Tall torches adorned with photos of candidates were passed out during rallies and parades to light the dark streets. Paper lanterns decorated with a candidate's picture, a rare item because most burned, were also used for campaigning.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> William Henry Harrison, elected in 1840, is said to be the first candidate to actively campaign for president, said Larry Bird, curator of the Division of Politics and Reform at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. In addition to torch poles topped with his signature log cabin, the campaign made domestic items such as women's brushes and sewing boxes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> There was plenty of negative campaigning, too. One of the earliest examples at the New York exhibit is the Grover Cleveland and Allen Thurman chamber pot from 1888.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;You do see a lot of potty humor in American politics,&quot; Henry said. &quot;We haven't included a lot of it in the exhibit because much of it is just so juvenile.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> William Jennings Bryan, a candidate known for his long speeches, was frequently represented by a coffin along with the phrase &quot;Talked to death.&quot; And then there's the McKinley doll. The porcelain and cloth doll, when held upright, is William McKinley. When turned upside down, it's an African-American baby, referring to the accusation he fathered an illegitimate black child.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In 1944, a poster impugned vice presidential candidate Harry Truman by drawing him in a Ku Klux Klan outfit. More functional items are the Reagan slippers, the comb to &quot;comb Nixon out of your hair&quot; and the Kerry flip-flops.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The post-World War II era was the heyday of memorabilia, Bird said. &quot;I like Ike&quot; nylon stockings were created at a time when women started to expose more of their legs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In the '60s came the quirky juices such as Goldwater's and the Lyndon Johnson juice can - &quot;a drink for health care.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;It was political but also social,&quot; Bird said. &quot;That's what's changed.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When campaigning on television became standard, the focus began to shift. Buttons got bigger, presumably to play to the TV cameras. Candidates spent more money on commercials than tchotchkes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> It's impossible to know which products from today's campaigns will be collector's items, although society may decide that the Barack Obama thong was a bad idea. But Bird says despite all the changes, the underlying purpose always remains the same: to feel a part of it all.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;There's a need for people who want to participate to have material with which to express themselves,&quot; he said.</span></p>
