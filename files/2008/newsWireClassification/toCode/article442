  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Real Truth About Obama Inc., an advocacy group, will find out today whether it can pursue its anti-Obama agenda.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> U.S. District Court Judge James Spencer said he probably would rule late today on whether to issue a preliminary injunction to block the Federal Election Commission from enforcing regulations against the group. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Richmond-based organization wants to broadcast a radio ad and an online audio ad condemning Obama's views on abortion.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In the ads an Obama-like voice supports change, then says: &quot;One thing I would not change about America is abortion on demand, for any reason, at any time during pregnancy, as many times as a woman wants one.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> One of the ads was to run on the radio program of conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The group said it also plans to create a Web site with digital postcards setting out Obama's policy positions on abortion.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Coincidentally, some of the restrictions the group wants to lift are contained in the McCain-Feingold bill, named after Arizona Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee who might benefit from the anti-Obama advocacy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> State Corporation Commission records show that the Real Truth group is headed by James K. Disney, a Richmond resident. It was formed July 24.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> James Bopp Jr., a First Amendment lawyer representing the Real Truth group, said it is so late in the campaign season that the group would be &quot;irreparably harmed&quot; if not allowed to collect money and publish ads.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But David Kolker, a lawyer representing the FEC, said no harm can be proved. He said the issues advocacy that the group proposes approaches advocating the defeat of a specific candidate, Obama, which McCain-Feingold prohibits for third-party groups.</span></p>
