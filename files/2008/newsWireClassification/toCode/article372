  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In an effort to cast himself as independent of the influence of money on politics, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama often highlights the campaign contributions of $200 or less that have amounted to fully half of the $340 million the Democratic presidential contender has collected so far.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But records show that one-third of his record-breaking haul has come from donations of $1,000 or more -- a total of $112 million, more than Arizona Sen. John McCain, Mr. Obama's Republican opponent, or New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, his chief rival in their party's primaries, raised in contributions of that size. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Behind those larger donations is a phalanx of more than 500 Obama &quot;bundlers,&quot; fundraisers who have each collected contributions totaling $50,000 or more. Many of the bundlers come from industries with critical interests in Washington. Nearly three dozen of the bundlers have raised more than $500,000 each, including more than a half-dozen who have passed the $1 million mark and one or two who have exceeded $2 million, according to interviews with fundraisers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While his campaign has cited its volume of small donations as a rationale for his decision to opt out of public financing for the general election, Mr. Obama has worked to build a network of big-dollar supporters from the time he began contemplating a run for the U.S. Senate. He tapped into well-connected Chicagoans prior to the 2004 Senate race, and, once elected, set out nationwide to cultivate some of his party's most influential money collectors.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He courted them with the savvy of a veteran politician, through phone calls, meals and one-on-one meetings; he wrote thank-you cards and remembered birthdays; he sent them autographed copies of his book and doted on their children.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His efforts have put Mr. Obama's major donors on a pace that almost rivals the $147 million raised by President Bush's network of Pioneers and Rangers in contributions of $1,000 or larger during the 2004 primary season.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Given his decision not to accept public financing, Mr. Obama is counting on his bundlers to help him raise $300 million for his general-election campaign and another $180 million for the Democratic National Committee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Analysis of campaign finance records shows that about two-thirds of his bundlers are concentrated in four major industries: law, securities and investments, real estate and entertainment. Lawyers make up the largest group, numbering roughly 130, with many of them working for firms that also have lobbying arms. At least 100 Obama bundlers are top executives or brokers for investment businesses: Nearly two dozen work for financial titans like Lehman Bros., Goldman Sachs or Citigroup. About 40 others are in real estate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The biggest fundraisers include people like technology executive Julius Genachowski, a former Federal Communications Commission senior official; Robert Wolf, president and chief operating officer of UBS Investment Bank; James A. Torrey, a New York hedge fund investor; and Charles H. Rivkin, chief executive of an animation studio in Los Angeles.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The care and feeding that top Obama fundraisers have received underscores their significance to his campaign. Members of his National Finance Committee who raise at least $250,000 are being rewarded with trips to the party's national convention in Denver.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Many fundraisers sit on the campaign's policy working groups, getting a chance to weigh in on policy positions and speeches. Mr. Genachowski, a Harvard Law School classmate of Mr. Obama, leads the technology working group. Fundraisers from private equity and hedge funds sit on Mr. Obama's economic policy group.</span></p>
