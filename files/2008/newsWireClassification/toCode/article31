  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cash, a free place to stay and Allman Brothers tickets are just a few of the proposed swaps offered online by people scrambling to get into Invesco Field to hear Sen. Barack Obama's big acceptance speech Thursday night. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Offers advertised on Craigslist.org ranged from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars for tickets.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Hi There. I'm a card-carrying Democrat looking for 2 tickets to see an amazing moment in history tonight, willing to pay you in cash for your tickets,&quot; one poster wrote.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But another ad-writer was put off by the deal-making: &quot;Pretty disgusting of people to sell FREE tickets to make $$ for themselves - have a heart and get a backbone.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama, Britney share set dressers</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Talk about your need to vet. Apparently, the Greek-themed set where Sen. Barack Obama will formally accept his party's nomination was built by the same company that created the stage for pop tart Britney Spears' most recent tour.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The New York Post reported that RDA Entertainment built both clients' sets - though Mr. Obama's setup is much more elaborate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republicans were already poking fun at the &quot;Barackopolis,&quot; and this adds more fuel to the fire. And of course it comes on top of the kerfuffle between Republican candidate Sen. John McCain and Mr. Obama over who is a bigger celebrity and who has more gravitas.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Biden son absent from Obama call-out</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">When newly nominated Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama surprised the Pepsi Center crowd Wednesday night to thank Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his extended family, at least one prominent Biden name was not mentioned. (No, not the little grandson waving to the crowd as grandpa picked him up.)</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I want everybody to now understand why I am so proud to have Joe Biden, and Jill Biden, and Beau Biden and Mama Biden and the whole Biden family with me,&quot; Mr. Obama told a crowd of cheering delegates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But there was no mention of Hunter Biden, the power lobbyist who has drawn questions on the Obama-Biden ticket's outsider status and anti-lobby stance.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As reported by The Washington Times, Hunter Biden has lobbied on behalf of the University of Delaware and worked for credit-card giant MBNA, his father's largest campaign contributor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sheehan plane crashes party</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hours before Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama was set to deliver his acceptance speech, Cindy Sheehan delivered a concise message over the Denver skies, visible from the Pepsi Center on Thursday: &quot;Peace now.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The antiwar stalwart hired an airborne messenger after raising $5,000 via an Internet appeal, asking for donations to write those words &quot;at the height of the convention over the Mile High City in letters a mile high.&quot;</span></p>
