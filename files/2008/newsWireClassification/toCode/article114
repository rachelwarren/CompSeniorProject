  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Singer-songwriter Jackson Browne is suing John McCain for using Browne's song &quot;Running on Empty&quot; in a campaign ad . </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Browne, one of rock music's most famous activists for liberal causes, said he is incensed that the presumptive Republican presidential candidate has been using &quot;Running on Empty&quot; in campaign commercials, according to the singer-songwriter's attorney.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Browne filed a copyright infringement suit against McCain and the Republican National Committee on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles seeking a permanent injunction against use of the song or any Browne composition , as well as damages.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said the ad is not a McCain campaign ad but one put together by the Ohio Republican Party.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Browne's attorney, Lawrence Y. Iser, said the suit is not politically motivated. &quot;It's a copyright infringement lawsuit ... but the fact that Senator McCain has used this song in a hit piece on Barack Obama is anathema to Jackson.&quot;</span></p>
