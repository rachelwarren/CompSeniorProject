  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It was inevitable. Hillary Clinton is back, and she's John McCain's new, not-so-secret weapon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The McCain campaign unveiled Thursday the first and, his aides promised, not the last campaign ad touting Clinton's own words against</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barack Obama during the bitter primary season. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The &quot;Maverick&quot; ad, posted on McCain's campaign Web site, features half a dozen prominent Democrats, including Obama, making admiring comments about McCain. Clinton's comparison of the two men is the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I know Sen. McCain has a lifetime of experience to bring to the White House. And Sen. Obama has a speech he gave in 2002,&quot; Clinton said, referring to Obama's speech against the war in Iraq.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The Democratic National Committee rushed out a response ad - &quot;Maverick No More&quot; - featuring many of the same Democrats, including Clinton, saying that McCain has changed and now mirrors President Bush. The Democrats' ad ends with Bush endorsing McCain in the Rose Garden and shaking hands.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Ronald Reagan's Eleventh Commandment - &quot;Thou shalt not speak ill of any Republican&quot; - never caught on with Democrats. Clinton wasn't intentionally giving McCain campaign fodder, but everybody knew her words would haunt the Democrats.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And it could get better for McCain. Clinton also wants to give her supporters a cathartic experience at the Democratic National Convention.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> SHE SAYS SHE wants them to have a voice and vent their feelings. She isn't ruling out putting her name in nomination for president at the convention. And, talking with her supporters, she leaves open the possibility she could still be Obama's running mate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I know from just what I'm hearing that there's incredible pent-up desire. And I think that people want to feel like, 'OK, it's a catharsis, we're here, we did it, and then everybody get behind Sen. Obama.' That is what most people believe is the best way to go,&quot; she said at a California fundraiser last week. The video is posted on YouTube.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama understandably is less than enthralled with the notion of convention as catharsis. He probably hoped after all the talk of unity that Democrats would go to Denver unified behind him. The point of the four-day confab is to spotlight the party's presidential nominee and put him forward to voters for the fall campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The last thing Obama or Democrats who want to win in November need is a series of images in the news (and in future McCain ads) of disappointed and angry Clinton supporters getting in touch with their true feelings about the man who defeated their woman for president.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Here's Obama on his campaign plane Thursday, trying to tamp down some of the psychobabble: &quot;I don't think we're looking for catharsis. I think what we're looking for is energy and excitement.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Clinton and Obama put out a joint statement that they're working together to make sure her supporters are respected at the convention. He has offered her a prime-time speech Tuesday night, Aug. 26, on the 88th anniversary of women's suffrage.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But she says she's negotiating with the Obama campaign about her convention role. Presumably that includes her husband, who is still working through his issues. Bill Clinton can't quite say Obama is qualified.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> KATE SNOW of ABC News asked the former president in an interview during his Africa trip if Obama was qualified to be president. Clinton sidestepped, making the accurate but beside-the-point observation that the Constitution sets the qualifications for president, and the people decide their preference.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;You could argue that nobody's ever qualified to be president,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama, Clinton said, is running a good campaign. Obama can inspire, motivate, and energize. He's &quot;smart as a whip,&quot; Clinton said, and, damning with faint praise, &quot;There's nothing he can't learn.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Clinton allowed that he'd had a lot to learn when he became president. This hardly is the man Obama needs to have whispering into his vice president's ear.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama is taking a week off for vacation in Hawaii, which is good timing for him. After the wall-to-wall news coverage of all things Obama, it was only a matter of time until voters rebelled. The Pew Research Center reports that nearly half the people - 48 percent - surveyed say they've been hearing too much about Obama lately. And that was in early August.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In his ABC News interview, Clinton insisted that he was enjoying his post-presidency and wasn't panting to go back to the White House.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;You have to live in the moment,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Sound advice, but it's hard for Bill and Hillary Clinton to accept that this isn't their moment.</span></p>
