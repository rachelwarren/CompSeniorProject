  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I am a John McCain supporter, but this latest attack on Barack Obama is just ridiculous (&quot;McCain Says He's Going Humorous, Not Negative,&quot; Aug. 2). To compare Mr. Obama to Britney Spears or Paris Hilton makes the McCain campaign look like a bunch of college students who think they can say any derogatory thing they want whether it's true or not -- whether it even makes sense.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I want to hear about the issues; make commercials that make John McCain look good, not ones that try (ineffectively) to ridicule Barack Obama. Stop it! Act like professionals! </span></p>
