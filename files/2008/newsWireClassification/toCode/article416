  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Who would have thunk it -- a short Jewish mayor of a big city who mangles names and other facts in a way that prompts eye-rolling and embarrassed chuckles.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In another era in our own city, we'd be talking about Mayor Sophie Masloff, who turned Bruce Springsteen into &quot;Bruce Bedspring&quot; and The Who into &quot;The How.&quot; But today, The Morning File toasts New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who offers further proof that when you're rich and powerful, you can sound as ridiculous as you want.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Associated Press notes that Mr. Bloomberg has referred to that fabulous old Central Park concert by &quot;Simon and Garfinkle.&quot; He has called the former manager of the New York Yankees &quot;Joe Torres.&quot; The good-looking country music singer coming to New York was, by his pronunciation, &quot;Shanaga Twain.&quot; If he has to avoid involvement in city decisions that overlap with his business interests, he tells people he must &quot;recluse&quot; himself. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Bloomberg's aides usually just exchange knowing glances after one of their boss's public bungles,&quot; the AP wrote. &quot;If it's particularly embarrassing, they bend over their BlackBerries and pretend not to have noticed.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The mayor's spokesman -- who did not refer to his boss as Mayor Boombox -- says simply that &quot;New Yorkers judge him by what he does, not what he says.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">IRANIANS MIGHT THINK MCCAIN BOMBED</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">President George W. Bush has been mocked repeatedly for mis-speaking, with authors compiling entire books based on statements of his such as: &quot;I know how hard it is to put food on your family.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's dangerous for our public servants and candidates to speak without a script, but also more telling. For instance, we learn what kind of sense of humor they have -- or don't. The Morning File, of course, values the Kennedyesque off-the-cuff rejoinder much more than the scripted one-liner.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain at least takes a stab at wry ad libs, though his success is debatable. At Primanti Brothers in the Strip District last week, he was asked by a reporter to comment on the increase in U.S. exports of cigarettes, among other products, to Iran.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Maybe that's a way of killing them,&quot; he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The comment drew some laughs, and Mr. McCain quickly sought to make clear that he was, in fact, joking. These things have a way of getting twisted around by the slimy media, after all.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Still, that type of humor -- bound to just slay the Iranians -- reminded some of how he parodied the Beach Boys song &quot;Barbara Ann&quot; previously, in reference to our Middle East rival. He jokingly sang &quot;Bomb bomb bomb, bomb bomb Iran&quot; to the melody. Ha ha ha.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">OBAMA RELATED TO CHENEY? THAT'S FUNNY</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There's less evidence of Barack Obama trying to be funny in impromptu ways. He's apparently either more serious or careful. Though he had time to prepare it, he did get off a good one-liner on &quot;The Tonight Show With Jay Leno&quot; last year, when the host asked about genealogical assertions that he and Dick Cheney are eighth cousins.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I don't want to be invited to the family hunting party,&quot; Mr. Obama said, smiling.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">THAT CHURCHILL: WHAT A SCREAM</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">College of Charleston communications professor Chris Lamb recently compiled a book, &quot;I'll Be Sober in the Morning,&quot; based on &quot;great political comebacks, putdowns and ripostes.&quot; It is heavy on the humor of Winston Churchill.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For instance, the British statesman's political rival, Nancy Astor, once snapped at him, &quot;Winston, if you were my husband, I'd put poison in your coffee.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Churchill's response: &quot;If you were my wife, Nancy, I'd drink it.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">NOW THERE'S A RINGING ENDORSEMENT</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Lamb's book has just one Pennsylvania reference, but it doesn't reflect any great wit by a Keystone state politician. Instead, former Gov. Robert Casey is the butt of the humor, and he told the joke on himself.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Scranton-bred Democrat was campaigning for re-election as governor in 1990 in Oil City, far from his power base. He approached a gas station attendant with the standard, &quot;Hi, I'm running for governor&quot; introduction, and asked for his vote.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The man said sure, he'd vote for him. But when Mr. Casey asked why, the attendant explained, &quot;Anybody would be better than the guy that's in there now.&quot;</span></p>
