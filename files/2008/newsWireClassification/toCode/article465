  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A conservative group that claims its ads would tell &quot;the real truth&quot; about Barack Obama's abortion views should learn Thursday whether it will be subject to federal election restrictions on fundraising and advertising. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">U.S District Judge James Spencer pledged a swift ruling after hearing arguments Wednesday on The Real Truth About Obama Inc.'s motion for a preliminary injunction that would free it from regulations governing political action committees, or PACs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The group's lawyer, James Bopp Jr. of Terre Haute, Ind., told Spencer that numerous courts have held that the type of &quot;issue advocacy&quot; planned by his client is exempt from Federal Election Commission restrictions because it would not expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;This is campaign finance law. This is not 'we get to regulate whatever you say in a democracy' law,&quot; Bopp said during a nearly hourlong hearing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">David Kolker, an attorney for the FEC, said the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that restrictions can be applied to activities that are &quot;the functional equivalent of express advocacy.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He also said the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proving they would suffer irreparable harm if an injunction is not issued.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bopp, a member of the Republican National Committee who was an adviser to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, disagreed. He said the group cannot solicit funds or begin its project because of the threat of hefty fines or criminal prosecution. According to Bopp, the organization has already received one unsolicited $10,000 donation, which is double the legal limit for an individual contribution to a PAC.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The hearing was conducted the same day that both Obama and Republican John McCain campaigned in Virginia, which hasn't backed a Democrat for president since 1964 but is viewed as an important battleground state this year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Real Truth About Obama, formed by anti-abortion activists, wants to run ads on its Web site and on the Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity talk shows in key states during the &quot;electioneering communication&quot; blackout period 60 days before the general election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad features an Obama-like voice saying he would make taxpayers pay for all abortions, ensure minors' abortions are concealed from their parents, appoint more liberal Supreme Court justices and legalize the late-term procedure that abortion opponents call &quot;partial-birth&quot; abortion.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's campaign has declined to respond to the organization's proposed ad. Obama supports abortion rights.</span></p>
