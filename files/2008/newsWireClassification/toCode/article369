  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Is Barack Obama a &quot;celebrity&quot; along with being the Democratic nominee-presumptive? Count on it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Is his Republican counterpart John McCain taking advantage of his opponent's more-than-a-politician paparazzi appeal? You bet. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That sub-layer of attack ads will, alas, be with us until the votes are counted in November.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">As for Paris Hilton -- she of fame-for-whatever -- joining the YouTube-driven campaign fray that more resembles a People magazine promotion than a political campaign, all bets are off.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both campaigns, desperate to find an escape route from attack ads (both had, if memory serves, promised a high-minded, non-personal campaign), now seem to have settled on a common issue of contention: energy -- more specific, oil.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama claims, wrongly, that McCain is in the pocket of &quot;Big Oil.&quot; McCain claims, wrongly, that Obama plans an increased tax on electric power.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both are barking up the right tree, but backwards. Before anyone takes on &quot;Big Oil&quot; for &quot;obscene&quot; profits, consider: 98.5 percent of shares in publicly traded oil industry companies are held in asset management groups such as pension and mutual funds.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That means money in the bank -- or at least in their retirement fund for millions upset at the price of gasoline and diesel fuel. A quick check of one's retirement plan can be eye-opening, even as you're filling your gas tank.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What to do about fuel prices? The to-drill or not-to-drill question seems to have worn out its welcome for both campaigns.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain wants offshore drilling to resume, but not drilling in the ANWR wildlife reserve.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama, at first recoiling from the more-drilling concept, this week says it might be part of an overall plan to ease dependence on foreign oil. But he wants the main drive to be on renewable energy resources and dramatically hiking research funding to that end.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With Olympic fever in the air, both campaigns are tip-toeing around serious foreign policy disputes, even as host country China continues to muzzle dissidents and restrict global reporting on the games.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Instead it's regroup time on both sides with the Democratic National Convention set to convene in Denver Aug. 25 and the Republicans' gathering set for the following week in Minneapolis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Time now for the &quot;softer&quot; political murmurings about who will be the nominees' choices for No. 2 spots on the ticket and the spot-feeding of speculations from both sides.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That's a welcome calm just before the post-convention storm, sure to hit with a vengeance.</span></p>
