  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain chided his Democratic rival on Wednesday for getting &quot;a little testy&quot; as Barack Obama sharpened his tone amid a tightening White House race .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I honor his service. I don't honor his policies. I don't honor his politics,&quot; Obama said, taking on his GOP opponent with renewed vigor while some Democrats fret that their candidate has not been aggressive enough.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both candidates also unveiled fresh attack advertisements ahead of their back-to-back national conventions. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Trying anew to tie McCain to the unpopular President Bush, Obama's TV commercial asks: &quot;Can we really afford more of the same?&quot; It slams McCain's tax plan as a giveaway for big corporations and oil companies.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain's radio ad claims: &quot;Celebrities like to spend their millions. Barack Obama is no different. Only it's your money he wants to spend.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democrats are questioning whether Obama has a second act beyond his message of change and wondering whether he can throw an effective punch against a Republican Party willing to play hardball.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republicans, in turn, are emboldened by improving poll numbers that show McCain starting to close a summer-long Obama edge.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Pew Research Center's latest survey found Obama at 46 percent and McCain at 43 percent, tighter than the 8-percentage-point gap two months ago. The survey found that McCain has solidified his base of support, particularly among whites, men, Republicans and evangelicals. Conversely, Obama has made few gains, but has retained his overwhelming advantage among blacks and younger voters, while also leading among women.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">spending</span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain spent $32 million in July, with nearly $2 of every $3 devoted to advertising, according to financial reports filed Wednesday to the Federal Election Commission. He reported raising more than $26 million during the month. He began August with more than $21 million in the bank.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">His aggressive media strategy - he spent nearly $19 million to produce and place advertising spots - kept him on the air as much as Democratic rival Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The deadline for filing July financial reports is midnight Wednesday. Obama had not yet submitted his at press time, but the campaign announced last weekend that he had raised more than $51 million in July.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">GOP convention</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Socially moderate former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former Democratic vice presidential nominee Joseph Lieberman will have featured speaking roles at next month's Republican National Convention, party officials announced Wednesday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Giuliani, who once thought he would be the one accepting the GOP nomination, will deliver the keynote address on the Tuesday night of convention week. The mayor ended his campaign without winning a single delegate. But he remains a popular figure among Republicans, and is thought to appeal to Democrats and independents. Lieberman, who ran with Democrat Al Gore in 2000, supports his former party enough to give it control of the Senate, but is an ardent backer of McCain, a longtime friend and colleague. His address on the opening night of the convention is intended to signal McCain's independence. -- From wire reports</span></p>
