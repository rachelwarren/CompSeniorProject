  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Arizona Sen. John McCain and the Republican National Committee started August with a hefty $96 million, financially flush and strongly positioned to compete with his presidential rival, prolific fundraiser and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and the Democrats. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Republicans have been trying to even out the financial playing field after trailing Democrats in overall fundraising for most of the election cycle.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. McCain has been a subpar fundraiser and has lagged the much-more adept Mr. Obama in monthly campaign tallies. But the RNC, with big-draw President Bush helping, has trounced its Democratic counterpart in collections. That has helped Mr. McCain and the GOP stay competitive financially with Mr. Obama and the Democratic National Committee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The July numbers reflect how far Mr. McCain and the Republicans have come.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. McCain raised $27 million in July, his largest one-month fundraising haul since clinching the GOP presidential nomination, and had $21 million available to spend, while the RNC brought in nearly $26 million, and had $75 million on hand to compete with the Democrats.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. McCain, himself, now has 600,000 donors, while the party announced that it had reached 1 million.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">By comparison, Mr. Obama alone recently surpassed 2 million contributors, giving him a larger pool of donors to hit up for money again. He and the DNC have not yet disclosed their monthly takes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Our fundraising continues to be very healthy,&quot; Rick Davis, Mr. McCain's campaign manager, said in a conference call with reporters, noting that July was the fifth-straight month that Mr. McCain has improved his cash flow.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Despite lackluster fundraising earlier this year, the campaign's improved money situation has allowed the GOP nominee-in-waiting to keep pace with -- if not exceed -- his Democratic rival in advertising, including $6 million during the ultra-expensive Olympics and three straight months of multimillions for commercials in 11 battleground states.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. McCain's overall advertising budget for August is expected to exceed $20 million, and, by the convention in early September, Mr. Davis said Mr. McCain is on track to spend some $60 million on TV expenditures.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He released a new TV ad yesterday in key states that criticizes Mr. Obama on taxes. &quot;Celebrity? Yes. Ready to lead? No,&quot; the ad says, with the Democrats' name chanted in the background and pictures of him before adoring crowds. The commercial claims that &quot;Obama's new taxes could break your family budget,&quot; mean &quot;higher prices at the pump&quot; and are a &quot;recipe for economic disaster.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan responded: &quot;This ad is just more of the same old, false and discredited attacks that Senator McCain knows aren't true.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">For the general election, Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama are operating under different financial scenarios of their own choosing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. McCain has agreed to accept $84 million in public financing for the general election and the spending restraints that come with it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Though the party committee can raise and spend as much as it wants to help him, the taxpayer money is the only cash that Mr. McCain can spend after accepting his party's nomination at the convention next month.</span></p>
