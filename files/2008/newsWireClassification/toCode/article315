  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Strong support in the Tidewater area won't be enough to win Virginia, John McCain acknowledged yesterday. He said he still has &quot;a lot of work to do&quot; to keep Virginia in the Republican column this fall. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I do not take it lightly,&quot; the likely Republican presidential nominee said of Virginia and its 13 electoral votes. &quot;I watched the results of recent elections in this state, so I do have a lot of work to do,&quot; he added at a news conference.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Democrats have won the past two elections for governor and unseated a Republican for a Senate seat in 2006.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But the last Democratic presidential candidate to win the state was President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A McCain strategy memo released online last week counted Virginia as one of 17 &quot;solidly Republican&quot; states. But University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato called that laughable.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;That is a pure bluff. Nobody buys it,&quot; he said. &quot;They are thinking in terms of a 2004 electorate. They are going to get a very different and larger electorate in 2008.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The biggest changes, Sabato said, will be a huge black turnout and lopsided fundraising in favor of Sen. Barack Obama, the probable Democratic nominee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Big Obama&nbsp;ad buys in Virginia could force McCain to come back to the state more often than he would like, Sabato said.</span></p>
