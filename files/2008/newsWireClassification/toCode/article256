  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Jul. 9--The presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain began a television advertisement in Virginia and nine other battleground states yesterday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad refers to McCain's captivity in North Vietnam for 5 1/2 years during the Vietnam War. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It also shows the Arizona Republican on Capitol Hill and describes him as a maverick who put the country before his political party.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A spokesman for McCain's Democratic rival, Sen. Barack Obama, said the ad shows McCain is worried about carrying Virginia, which hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 44 years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Trey Walker, regional campaign manager for McCain, said, &quot;Senator McCain always intended to run a very strong campaign in Virginia.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The latest poll showed Obama with a slight lead in Virginia.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama has run two TV ads in Virginia already.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Four years ago, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry advertised in Virginia early but pulled out of the state in early October.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">President Bush, who did not spend any money on media in Virginia, won the state by almost 8 percentage points in 2004.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">While the McCain campaign declined to divulge its media strategy, Democrats monitoring ad buys said the McCain&nbsp;ad is running on broadcast TV in the Richmond, Roanoke, Norfolk and Tri-Cities areas. It also is on national cable TV.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad also is running in Iowa, Michigan, Colorado, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">All are expected to be closely contested states.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Its closing line: &quot;Don't 'hope' for a better life. Vote for one. McCain&quot; is an indirect dig at one of Obama's central campaign themes -- that he offers the hope of change.</span></p>
