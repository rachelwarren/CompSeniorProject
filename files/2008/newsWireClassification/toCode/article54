  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Hazel Rigby will support Hillary Rodham Clinton until her dying day, and even after.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The New York senator cemented a place in Rigby's psyche decades ago, when Clinton's school-improvement efforts as first lady of Arkansas impressed the teacher from Alexandria, Va.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Rigby became an ardent supporter of Clinton, and after months of campaigning for Clinton's unsuccessful presidential bid, her loyalty is unwavering. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Wearing her delicate silver &quot;Hillary&quot; pin, she proudly will pledge her support to Clinton when her name is placed into nomination for the presidency at the Democratic National Convention.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I'm 72, and I thought I'd see the first woman president before I die,&quot; Rigby said. &quot;I want it on my tombstone that I supported Hillary Clinton.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> As Clinton addresses the convention tonight in Denver, and when her name is placed in nomination, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama's campaign will gauge whether Clinton supporters such as Rigby will be on board in November.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The campaign of presumptive Republican nominee John McCain has released an ad that features a former Clinton supporter who now plans to vote for McCain, saying others will too and that &quot;it's OK, really.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> And according to a USA Today/Gallup poll, 30 percent of Clinton's supporters in the primaries say they will back McCain, someone else or no one.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">***************</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Rigby is an example of how Clinton supporters in the Virginia delegation, like those in the rest of the country, vary in coming to terms with Clinton's defeat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> While many delegates interviewed for this article said they are on board with Obama and are working to unify the party and win the White House, others are not ready.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Rigby hopes to find catharsis when she casts her pledge to Clinton.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I haven't turned the page yet,&quot; she said. &quot;I will never leave her in spirit and mind, but I am going to work to make Virginia blue&quot; when she returns home from the convention.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> There are mixed feelings in the Virginia delegation about putting Clinton's name in nomination. Some say it promotes unity, and others say unity is getting on board with Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Juan Carlos Perez, a Virginia delegate from Leesburg, is not excited about seeing Clinton's name put in nomination.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I would rather not,&quot; he said. &quot;Just to not walk that fine line again. We have to move forward. We don't have much time here, and we have to unify the party and strengthen the party unity.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But Perez respects the feelings of people such as Virginian Elizabeth Chitwood, 22, who believes putting Clinton's name into nomination is an important honor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Chitwood supported Clinton until the delegate math started to work against the New York senator and then she switched her support to Obama. The Radford University senior and pledged delegate for Clinton from Pulaski County senses there still are some hurt feelings to salve.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I think there's some work to do, not to say these obstacles are insurmountable,&quot; she said, adding that placing Clinton's name in nomination &quot;is critical because she's done extraordinary work in her public life and she deserves such an honor.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The act &quot;doesn't magnify any problems. It just honors her public service,&quot; Chitwood said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">***************</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Clinton would not be the first woman whose name was placed formally in nomination by a major party. Others include Maine Sen. Margaret Chase Smith at the 1964 Republican convention and New York Rep. Shirley Chisholm at the 1972 Democratic convention.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Katherine Pino of Falls Church, Va., who is not a convention delegate, said she still is not sure about Obama and came to Denver to learn more about him.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> She said Obama's &quot;rock-star&quot; status gives her some pause, because that might not translate into leadership.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;We don't know a lot about Obama,&quot; she said. &quot;My heart is with Hillary.&quot;</span></p>
