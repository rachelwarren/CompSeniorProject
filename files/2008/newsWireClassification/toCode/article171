  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The 2004 Democratic presidential nominee accused Sen. John McCain's campaign of trying to impugn the character of Sen. Barack Obama in this year's presidential race.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;They're trying to scare you,&quot; Sen. John F. Kerry (Mass.) said on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; &quot;They are engaged in character assassination.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;They've decided they can't win on the issues, so they've decided to try to destroy his character,&quot; Kerry added, quoting his Senate colleague Russ Feingold (D-Wis.).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kerry's comments alluded to a McCain TV advertisement that debuted last week. The ad, which compared Obama to celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, raised an important point, McCain ally Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.) said on NBC.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Notwithstanding his celebrity status, is Barack Obama ready to serve?&quot; said Lieberman, the 2000 Democratic vice presidential candidate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He said the question was particularly relevant after Obama's trip to Europe, where 200,000 people turned out in Berlin to hear him speak. &quot;We're not deciding who's our favorite celebrity,&quot; Lieberman said. &quot;We're doing something very serious.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kerry countered, &quot;It tries to insinuate that his celebrity is all [Obama] has.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lieberman focused on a statement by Obama last week that caused a stir. The senator from Illinois said in Missouri that his opponents are going to try to instill worries in voters by emphasizing that Obama is an unfamiliar figure who &quot;doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The McCain campaign quickly accused Obama of playing the race card.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;You're making a personal insult to John McCain,&quot; Lieberman said. &quot;This man does not have a bigoted bone in his body,&quot; he added, noting that McCain and his wife have adopted a child from Bangladesh.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On ABC's &quot;This Week,&quot; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was pressed on whether she would allow a vote to expand offshore drilling for oil. Last week, she did not allow such a vote before Congress recessed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;You never say never to anything,&quot; she said. &quot;But from my standpoint . . . I'm not giving the gavel away to a tactic that . . . supports . . . big oil at the cost and the expense of the consumer.&quot;</span></p>
