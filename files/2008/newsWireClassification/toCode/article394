  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Since the end of the primaries, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain have run more television commercials in Philadelphia than in any other media market in the country. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And they have spent more money on ads in Pennsylvania than in any other state. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Those findings, which underline the area's importance in the election, come from the University of Wisconsin Advertising Project, which monitors political advertising in conjunction with TNS Media Intelligence/CMAG. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Commercials for the two major-party presidential candidates appeared 3,311 times on Philadelphia television from June 3 to last Saturday. Next on the list was Detroit at 2,870, followed by Cleveland; Grand Rapids, Mich.; Cincinnati; and Harrisburg. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In terms of money, the two candidates - along with the Republican National Committee - spent $10,319,000 in Pennsylvania, nearly $4 million more than in Ohio, which was second. Rounding out the top five were Michigan, Florida and Virginia. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Counting ads bought by his party, McCain has outspent Obama in Pennsylvania by about 3-2, a sign of the importance the GOP puts in trying to turn the state from blue to red. McCain has spent far more in Pennsylvania than in any other state. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pennsylvania ranks second for Obama in spending, trailing only Florida, which he hopes to turn from red to blue. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In all, Obama has spent about $27 million on television and McCain $21 million in the last eight weeks. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Political scientist Ken Goldstein, who runs the project, said the results showed that the candidates were focusing on traditional battlegrounds - including Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio - despite all the talk about expanding the playing field this year. </span></p>
