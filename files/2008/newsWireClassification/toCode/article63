  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">DENVER</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On the eve of the Democratic National Convention, Barack Obama said Sunday he hoped a week of political speechmaking would persuade reluctant middle-class voters to swing behind his bid for the White House, while Republicans sought to stir discontent among Hillary Rodham Clinton's supporters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clinton was having none of it. In a gesture of unity, Obama's rival in the bruising battle for the nomination was expected to release the delegates she won in primaries and caucuses, telling them in midweek they are now free to join her in supporting the victor. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama, who if elected would become the first black president, campaigned through swing-state Wisconsin, then flew home to Chicago to work on the acceptance speech he will deliver before 75,000 partisans on the convention's closing night.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He said he hoped convention viewers would conclude, &quot;He's sort of like us. He comes from a middle-class background, went to school on scholarships. He and his wife had to figure out child care and how to start a college fund for their kids.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Clinton outpolled Obama among working-class voters in many states through the winter and spring, and Sen. John McCain and the Republicans have worked relentlessly in more recent weeks to depict the Illinois senator as an elitist who is out of touch with blue-collar concerns.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With Democrats descending on their highly fortified convention city, party officials worked energetically to ensure a harmonious week.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thousands of blue signs that read simply &quot;Unity&quot; were stockpiled inside the Pepsi Center for distribution to convention delegates at whatever moment Obama's high command deemed appropriate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">And on a unanimous vote, the party's credentials committee restored full voting rights to delegations from Florida and Michigan. Both states were stripped of their voting rights earlier in the year in retaliation for holding primaries before party rules allowed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all Democrats know we are full partners,&quot; said Chris Edley Jr., a member of the panel.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If Democratic unity was uppermost in the minds of Obama's aides, McCain had other ideas.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Republican presidential contender's campaign readied a television commercial suggesting Obama had snubbed Clinton when he picked Delaware Sen. Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;She won millions of votes but isn't on the ticket. Why? For speaking the truth,&quot; says the ad, which also shows Clinton criticizing Obama during their battle for the Democratic nomination.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The former first lady has praised the selection of Biden. In response to the ad, spokeswoman Kathleen Strand noted that Clinton &quot;has said repeatedly that Barack Obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country, getting us out of Iraq and expanding access to health care. John McCain doesn't.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The first arrests of the convention week were reported when about 1,000 anti-war demonstrators marched through downtown under the watchful eye of police in riot-control gear. Officials did not immediately provide details on the number of those taken into custody, or even confirm that those arrested had taken part in the march.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Inside the Pepsi Center, where the convention's opening gavel falls today, the floor seating was rearranged. Delaware's delegates were granted a spot closer to the front, an upgrade resulting from Biden's selection as Obama's running mate.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With McCain trying to use Clinton to divide the Democrats, Obama defended his choice, a selection that seemed designed to fill a gap in his own foreign policy resume while appealing to blue-collar voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;He's got the passion to lift up middle-class Americans, he hasn't forgotten his working-class roots, he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up,&quot; Obama told reporters before boarding his plane in Eau Claire, Wis.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The opening night convention program - featuring an appearance by Michelle Obama - was scripted to reach out to the same segment of the electorate. Officials said her remarks would present her husband - the son of a white mother from Kansas and a black father from Kenya who later left the family - as anything but elite.<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">in the polls</span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Recent public opinion polls give Barack Obama a modest advantage at best in the race to become the nation's 44th president. John McCain has successfully cut into what had been a slightly more comfortable lead for Obama. hotel scare</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was briefly evacuated from her downtown Denver hotel on Saturday when a man carrying two hunting rifles and two pistols tried to check in to the hotel.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joseph Calanchini, 29, of Pinedale, Wyo., faces a charge of unlawful carrying of a weapon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pelosi and other guests were never in danger, Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly said.</span></p>
