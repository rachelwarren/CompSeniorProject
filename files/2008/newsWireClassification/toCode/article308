  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kimmel keeps talking</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ABC is extending its option with late-night host Jimmy Kimmel by another year, keeping him at the network through at least 2010, Variety reports.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The decision to exercise an early extension comes in the wake of Mr. Kimmel's positive attention for his &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live Game Night&quot; series of post-NBA Finals specials, which included a now-famous fist bump Sunday with presidential candidate Barack Obama. Rival candidate John McCain appeared on Mr. Kimmel's show following Tuesday's National Basketball Association game.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Those &quot;game night&quot; specials have averaged 3 million viewers, giving the show a bit more exposure than its usual audience. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mr. Kimmel also scored quite a bit of attention earlier this year, thanks to a video short featuring his real-life girlfriend, Sarah Silverman - although its title can't be repeated here - that centered on a long-running gag between Mr. Kimmel and actor Matt Damon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Like all late-night talkers, Mr. Kimmel took a ratings hit this season because of the writers strike. However, he took less of a hit than his rivals. According to Variety, his show averaged 1.7 million viewers in the just-completed TV season, down just 4 percent (from 1.8 million) the year before . All other late-night talkers suffered double-digit declines.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Kimmel&quot; also beat CBS' &quot;The Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson&quot; for the first time (by a slim margin, 1.727 million viewers versus 1.725 million) and came within 184,000 viewers of NBC's &quot;Late Night With Conan O'Brien (1.727 million versus 1.911 million), Variety says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">'Girl' power</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Showtime turned a nifty ratings trick Monday with its new half-hour &quot;Secret Diary of a Call Girl&quot; premiering to record numbers, TVWeek.com says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Call Girl&quot; attracted 949,000 viewers to the premium cable network in its first run Monday, outranking every other series premiere in the three-decade-plus history of Showtime. The previous record holder at the network was &quot;The L Word,&quot; which drew 936,000 viewers when it bowed.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The strong tune-in for &quot;Call Girl&quot; represents the latest triumph for Bob Greenblatt, the Showtime entertainment president who has launched hits such as &quot;Dexter,&quot; &quot;The Tudor &quot; and &quot; Californication.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Call Girl&quot; also was given a big leg up by its lead-in, the fourth-season premiere of Showtime's smash &quot;Weeds.&quot; The latter series attracted 1.3 million viewers in its 10 p.m. run Monday, a stunning 65 percent rise over the show's third-season premiere. It also was the highest-rated telecast on Showtime since 2004, when Nielsen began reporting ratings for individual Showtime channels.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Showtime already has ordered a second season of &quot;Call Girl,&quot; TV Week reports.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Brit TV boots Joan</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Can we talk?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Joan Rivers' salty tongue apparently got her booted from a British daytime talk show in the middle of its live broadcast, Associated Press reports.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Miss Rivers used two expletives while talking about actor Russell Crowe as a guest host on the live gab-fest &quot;Loose Women.&quot; She was asked to leave during a commercial break, AP says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">On Tuesday, the 75-year-old comedian said in a statement that she was sorry for the swearing and had assumed a censor would be able to &quot;bleep&quot; out the words.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Then she cracked wise, saying the incident reminded her of her wedding night because she was asked to leave in the middle of that, too.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">'Choice' gig for Miley</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fifteen-year-old Miley Cyrus will host the &quot;Teen Choice 2008&quot; awards show on Fox, which will air in prime time Aug. 4 at 8 p.m., the Hollywood Reporter says.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Among the musicians up for honors are Chris Brown, with nine nominations, and Justin Timberlake with three. (Mr. Timberlake is the most-winning Teen Choice icon, taking home 21 of the event's trophies - a surfboard - since 1998.)</span></p>
