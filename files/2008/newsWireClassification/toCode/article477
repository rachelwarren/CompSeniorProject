  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Bush administration yesterday prepared to take over the troubled housing finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac after concluding the companies don't have enough capital to continue to play their crucial role funding home mortgages. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A government bailout could cost taxpayers around $25 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Moreover, regulators are trying to prevent Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's problems from triggering a new wave of failures among banks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Under the plan, engineered by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., the government would place the two companies under &quot;conservatorship,&quot; a legal status akin to Chapter 11 bankruptcy, where assets are preserved, not sold off, and the company is reorganized rather than closed. Their boards and chief executives would be fired and a government agency, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, would appoint new chief executives.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The action, which would be one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades, is planned for today, according to several sources.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The epic decision highlights the size of the threats facing the housing market and the economy. On Friday, Nevada regulators shut down Silver State Bank, the 11th failure this year of a federally insured bank. And earlier this year, the government orchestrated the takeover of investment bank Bear Stearns by JP Morgan Chase.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee more than $5 trillion of U.S. home morgtgages or about half the total outstanding, Mortgage-backed securities that they manufacture have been sold by thousands of banks and investors around the world.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> When Paulson reveals the administration's plans, he will likely be walking a knife edge between two seemingly irreconcilable views..</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Free market analysts say that the government-chartered, but shareholder-owned companies pose a threat to Washington's own solvency and must be thrown into a bankruptcy-like receivership, run by the government until the current financial crisis eases and then broken up or sold off.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In no case, say advocates of this view, should Treasury pump in taxpayer money.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But congressional Democrats and major financial market players argue that the government should spare no expense in rescuing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, arguing that the two mortgage giants must be healthy not only for Americans to buy houses, but for the economy to regain its footing.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> This faction argues that Washington should pump the two institutions up with tens of billions of dollars in taxpayers' funds.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Paulson met with Fannie Mae CEO Daniel Mudd and Freddie Mac CEO Richard Syron yesterday to tell them of the decision and remove the executives from their jobs, according to two people briefed on the discussions.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Paulson also briefed congressional leaders and presidential candidates John McCain yesterday and Barack Obama on Friday night. Obama said yesterday that he approves of the government action, if it does not bail out the companies' shareholders and executives and is good for the economy. Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin said a McCain administration would make the companies smaller and more effective.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In Albuquerque, N.M., McCain said: &quot;We need to keep people in their homes, but we can't allow this to turn into a bailout of Wall Street speculators.&quot;</span></p>
