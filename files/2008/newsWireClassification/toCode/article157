  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">GEE, I wonder why, if you have a black man running for high public office -- say, Barack Obama or Harold Ford -- the opposition feels compelled to run low-life political ads featuring tacky, sexually provocative white women who have no connection whatsoever to the black male candidates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Spare me any more drivel about the high-mindedness of John McCain. You knew something was up in March when, in his first ad of the general campaign, McCain had himself touted as &quot;the American president Americans have been waiting for.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There was nothing subtle about that attempt to position Obama as the Other, a candidate who might technically be American but who remained in some sense foreign, not sufficiently patriotic and certainly not one of us -- the &quot;us&quot; being the genuine red-white-and-blue Americans the ad was aimed at.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Since then, McCain has only upped the ante, smearing Obama every which way from sundown. Last Wednesday, The Washington Post ran an extraordinary front-page article that began: &quot;For four days, Sen. John McCain and his allies have accused Sen. Barack Obama of snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him, despite no evidence that the charge is true.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Evidence? McCain needs no evidence. His campaign is about trashing the opposition, Karl Rove-style. Not satisfied with calling his opponent's patriotism into question, McCain added what amounted to a charge of treason, insisting that Obama would actually prefer that the United States lose a war if that would mean that he -- Obama -- would not have to lose an election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now comes the slimy Britney Spears and Paris Hilton ad. The two highly sexualized women (both notorious for displaying themselves to the paparazzi while not wearing underwear) are shown briefly and incongruously at the beginning of a commercial critical of Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Republican National Committee targeted Harold Ford with a similarly disgusting ad in 2006 when Ford, then a congressman, was running a strong race for a U.S. Senate seat in Tennessee. The ad, which the committee described as a parody, showed a scantily clad woman whispering, &quot;Harold, call me.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both ads were foul, poisonous and emanated from the upper reaches of the Republican Party. (What a surprise.) Both were designed to exploit the hostility, anxiety and resentment of the many white Americans who are still freakishly hung up on the idea of black men rising above their station and becoming sexually involved with white women.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The racial fantasy factor in this presidential campaign is out of control. It was at work in that New Yorker cover that caused such a stir. (Obama in Muslim garb with the American flag burning in the fireplace.) It's driving the idea that Obama is somehow presumptuous, too arrogant, too big for his britches -- a man who obviously does not know his place.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama has to endure these grotesque insults with a smile and heroic levels of equanimity. The reason he has to do this -- the sole reason -- is that he is black.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">So there he was last week speaking evenly, and with a touch of humor, to a nearly all-white audience in Missouri. His goal was to reassure his listeners, to let them know he's not some kind of unpatriotic ogre.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama told them: &quot;What they're going to try to do is make you scared of me. You know, he's not patriotic enough. He's got a funny name. You know, he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills, you know. He's risky.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The audience seemed to appreciate his comments. Obama was well-received.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But McCain didn't appreciate them. RACE CARD! RACE CARD! The McCain camp started bellowing, and it hasn't stopped since. With great glee bursting through their feigned outrage, the campaign's operatives and the candidate himself accused Obama of introducing race into the campaign -- playing the race card, as they put it, from the very bottom of the deck.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Whatever you think about Obama, he does not want the race issue to be front and center in this campaign. Every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for McCain. So I guess we understand McCain's motivation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nevertheless, it's frustrating to watch McCain calling out Obama on race. Obama has spoken more honestly and thoughtfully about race than any other politician in many years. McCain is the head of a party that has viciously exploited race for political gain for decades.</span></p>
