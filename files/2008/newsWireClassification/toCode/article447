  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Echoes from the bruising fight for the Democratic presidential nomination have barely faded in Pennsylvania as John McCain and Barack Obama square off for the final phase of the campaign in this battleground state.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain, the Arizona senator and all-but-certain Republican nominee, opened his state campaign headquarters two blocks from the state Capitol in Harrisburg on Friday. He also began airing a new TV ad his second in the state in the past week.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We're raising money at a very good rate. More people are joining the campaign every day,&quot; Jon Seaton, McCain's regional campaign manager for Pennsylvania and Ohio, said as supporters munched on pizza at a reception in the campaign's new digs. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Also Friday, Obama put up his first TV commercial of the general-election campaign in Pennsylvania and 17 other states. The Illinois senator lost Pennsylvania's Democratic primary two months ago, but clinched the nomination earlier this month.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Amy Brundage, an Obama campaign spokeswoman in Chicago, said the campaign plans to open a Pennsylvania headquarters and announce key staffers within the next few weeks.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Handicapping the Pennsylvania race is tricky business especially more than four months out from Election Day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A new Quinnipiac University poll shows Obama leading McCain by 12 percentage points in Pennsylvania and there is evidence that the state is increasingly &quot;blue&quot; that is, Democratic in its voting.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">But some political observers say McCain has a shot at winning the state's 21 electoral votes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;It's going to be a horse race,&quot; predicted Michael Young, who runs a Harrisburg-based opinion research firm.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain is a political moderate a &quot;Tom Ridge Republican&quot; in the mold of the former Pennsylvania governor who could cobble together a winning coalition of Republicans and disaffected Democrats, Young said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the Democratic primary, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York won all but seven of the state's 67 counties and the results showed support for Obama was weak among white blue-collar workers, older people and women.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Since then, Clinton and her surrogates, including Gov. Ed Rendell, have urged her loyalists to set aside old grudges and unite behind Obama in the Nov. 4 election.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">There are reasons for Obama to be optimistic.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Recent history is on his side: The last Republican candidate to carry the state was the first President Bush in 1988.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Voter registration also works to his advantage. Largely because of intensive recruitment drives by Obama and Clinton during the six-week primary campaign, the number of registered Democrats soared past 4 million a record for either party while GOP enrollment slumped.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Thomas Baldino, a political science professor at Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre, says the state is Obama's to lose.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Obama will have an easier time carrying Pennsylvania if Hillary Clinton works in the state for him,&quot; Baldino said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Terry Madonna, a professor and pollster at Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster, believes Obama has a leg up, but that McCain &quot;can make it competitive&quot; if he runs strong in the Philadelphia suburbs and picks up votes from Democrats who backed Clinton in the primary.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The issues of age and race are wild cards, although Madonna said polls show voters are more concerned about candidates' age than their race.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At 71, McCain would be the oldest elected first-term president. Obama, 46, would be the first black president.</span></p>
