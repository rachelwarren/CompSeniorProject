  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">WASHINGTON</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Supreme Court's landmark decision Thursday poses myriad questions for which answers are still a work in progress. Here are some of them.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Q. Does this eliminate all gun restrictions?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A. No.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court's majority, stressed that the Second Amendment doesn't guarantee an &quot;unlimited&quot; right to bear arms. Scalia cited as legitimate long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, as well as bans on carrying firearms into schools and government buildings. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Laws imposing &quot;conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms&quot; are also probably safe, Scalia wrote, adding that his list of Second Amendment-friendly gun restrictions &quot;does not purport to be exhaustive.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Q. But the ruling will extend beyond Washington, D.C.'s, gun ban, right?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A. Yes, although not right away.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The latest federal compilation of state and local firearm laws is some 458 pages long, and it was published in 2005, so it's not up to date. Boston, Chicago and Denver, for instance, ban the possession and sale of assault weapons. Los Angeles and San Francisco ban the sale of .50-caliber handguns.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">An untold number of these existing laws will be subject to challenge. This will take time and money as lawsuits are filed and ordinances are revised.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Q. Will the ruling allow those who are arrested or convicted on gun charges to challenge their cases?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A. Yes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Virtually every defense attorney&quot; whose client is facing &quot;a gun count&quot; in the indictment is obligated to seek dismissal, said Jack King, a D.C. attorney and the director of public affairs for the National Association of Criminal Defense lawyers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The impact could be extensive because many of the gun charges are linked to drug raids, he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Q. How about federal gun laws? Will they be affected?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A. Potentially yes, although most firearm regulations are at the state or local level.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Congress has passed a number of firearms laws in the past, such as a since-expired assault weapon ban written in 1993. Only time will tell which gets challenged next.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Q. What kind of gun laws will probably survive?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A. Narrowly tailored laws may be safe, along with laws that target the most sophisticated weaponry.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Scalia and the court's majority stress Washington's &quot;absolute&quot; prohibition of handguns . Presumably, laws that have a narrower focus will have a better chance in court.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The court also noted that the Second Amendment right to bear arms may be limited to those weapons &quot;in common use at the time&quot; the amendment was written. In other words: no rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Although this certainly doesn't mean only 18th century flintlocks may be legally owned, the court stressed that sawed-off shotguns as well as &quot;M-16 rifles and the like may be banned.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Q. How will this decision play politically in this election year?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A. In the short term, the decision highlights the importance of the Supreme Court and offers a wedge issue for political operatives. In the long run: Who knows?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Presumptive Republican presidential candidate John McCain instantly embraced the decision, while his Democratic opponent, Barack Obama, offered a more nuanced view seemingly designed to minimize differences on the volatile gun issue. Obama stressed that, like the court's majority, he believes that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to bear arms. Obama sidestepped other parts of the decision, saying simply that it offers &quot;much needed guidance&quot; to officials.</span></p>
