  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A banner slogan on the Pemberton Republican Club's Web site that said, &quot;Obama loves America like O.J. loved Nicole,&quot; disappeared yesterday after local Democrats alleged racist campaign tactics. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Web master, Ed Kuck, a recently elected Republican County committeeman, said he had seen the slogan on an Internet site and copied it onto the club's Web page about a month ago as &quot;a joke.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He removed it yesterday from the site, http://homewebs.net/pem, after a community person told him it would offend people, he said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I found out it was inappropriate, and I took it down,&quot; Kuck said, adding: &quot;I just want to apologize to anybody who was offended, because that wasn't our intention at all.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Pemberton Councilwoman Diane Stinney said a Republican friend had called to tell her about the ad, saying: &quot;I just want you to know I'm very disappointed with our Republican page.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Stinney then reported it to fellow Democrats. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She said the slogan had offended her, adding that Pemberton is a very diverse community. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We've come a very long way, and we people of different colors still have a lot of growing up to do, but there are other issues that the two [presidential] candidates have to and should be addressing,&quot; she said. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Rick Perr, chairman of the Burlington County Democratic Committee, said that, although the phrase was taken down, he preserved a copy of it. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Comparing U.S. Sen. Barack Obama, the presumed Democratic nominee for president, &quot;to O.J. Simpson, an accused murderer who was found civilly liable for his ex-wife's death, is reprehensible,&quot; Perr said in a statement. &quot;Moreover, it is a veiled attempt at inserting race into the political arena, for which the Republicans should be ashamed.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Bill Layton, who heads the Burlington County GOP, immediately denounced the slogan as &quot;despicable&quot; and &quot;the worst kind of tactics.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Layton said, &quot;There's no place in Burlington County Republican politics for this.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He said his organization has successfully backed African Americans and women for county and state legislative offices. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The slogan referenced NFL Hall of Famer O.J. Simpson's acquittal in the 1994 murders of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The phrase has been making the rounds on Web sites, posters and campaign buttons. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kuck said he had put it up when he went to add pictures of a rally at Burlington County College for U.S. Sen. John McCain, the presumptive GOP presidential candidate. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kuck said the Pemberton Republican Club mostly concerned itself with local issues and candidates and probably wouldn't get too involved with the presidential race. </span></p>
