  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Jul. 18--The Barack Obama camp on Wednesday announced it was opening 20 campaign offices throughout Virginia, some in tenacious Republican strongholds. To which the John McCain camp responded, &quot;us, too.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Add this to the state parties' many offices and it might appear soon that there's a headquarters on every street corner. Hyperbole? Sure. But just wait until every pause in television and radio programs is filled with dueling campaign ads.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Virginians haven't seen this kind of presidential campaign in a long, long time. Candidates start by making you feel good about them, then progress to making you feel poorly about their opponent. Then it gets worse. Every issue-oriented politically motivated organization will air the most low-down, dirtiest, grungiest, inaccurate, mud-slinging propaganda. Your ears will hurt.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">None of this will be intended to sway the masses. It will all be targeted at getting &quot;undecided&quot; Virginians to pick a side and motivating them to actually vote. The trick is to keep from turning off those who might have voted if not for all the squawking.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In past presidential elections, Virginians have been spared the barrage of commercials and unending campaign stops by candidates, their wives, children, in-laws, childhood buddies, fraternity brothers and pet dogs, because the commonwealth's electoral votes were solidly in the Republican column for the last 44 years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">That is no longer a given. Virginians have elected two successive Democratic governors and a Democratic U.S. senator. Even more predictive of a shift in '08 is the senatorial race to fill retiring John Warner's seat in which a popular former Democratic governor is running against a not-so-popular former Republican governor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Much can happen between now and November. After all, it is still July. Traditionally, campaigns lay low waiting for the Labor Day kickoff, but not anymore.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Those who know not of what's to come are looking forward to being thought a player.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">One blogger at The RT, our editorial page blog, wrote she'd enjoy battling presidential television ads, even negative ones, as it &quot;will give us a well deserved break from the Viagra and K-Y his 'n' hers commercials.&quot; Come, mid-October, Virginians may yearn for the tamer and saner days of sex aid peddling -- or for when their votes were taken for granted.</span></p>
