  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Only a few short months to go until Election Day, and I'm still waiting for a sustained and meaningful dialogue between the candidates on issues such as energy policy, global warming, health care, Iraq and education [&quot;Obama Hits Back, Too Softly for Some,&quot; front page, Aug. 7]. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Instead, we get grown men taking potshots at each other, TV commercials that distort the facts, and endless media coverage on the resulting drama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We should be getting more, given that both candidates actually work for us -- and they want us to give them an even better job in November. What to do? Get involved. Contact the campaigns and insist they inform rather than attempt to influence our decisions. Contact the media and demand fewer sound bites and more substantive coverage.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Believe it or not, we the people are at the helm of this election, but we need to be active before November if we want a process that serves our interests rather than those of the candidates.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">William Freeman [letters, Aug. 8] is concerned that John McCain isn't intelligent and curious enough to be our president because of his low class ranking at the Naval Academy and his inexperience using a computer. He needn't worry.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After graduating from the Naval Academy, Mr. McCain successfully completed military flight school. He also showed courage by flying combat missions off an aircraft carrier into the dangerous skies over Hanoi, the grit and determination to survive torturous conditions as a prisoner of war for more than five years, the character to refuse an offer of early release that would have given him preferential treatment over some of his longer-held comrades, and the ability to serve in the Senate since 1986.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I don't care if he ever turns on a computer.</span></p>
