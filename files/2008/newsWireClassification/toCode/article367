  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> With Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama scheduled to stump today in Charlotte, N.C., the campaign of Republican presidential hopeful John McCain announced plans to ratchet up its efforts in North Carolina. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The McCain campaign said yesterday that it had opened 14 offices in the state and hired 20 paid staffers - a number that said it would likely grow to 20 offices and 25 to 30 staffers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;This is a state that Senator Obama and his campaign have targeted and put extraordinary resources and finances in the state,&quot; Mike DuHaime, the political director for the North Carolina McCain campaign, said in a phone news conference.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> President Bush is scheduled to attend a fundraiser in Greensboro on Sept. 30 to raise money for the McCain-Palin ticket.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The event will be held at the Irving Park home of businessman Louis DeJoy and former U.S. ambassador Aldona Wos.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> DeJoy, who is state McCain finance chairman, said he expects 350 people to attend the event and predicted it would raise hundreds of thousands of dollars. DeJoy also helped organize a fundraiser the president attended in Raleigh this summer.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The McCain campaign has been playing catch-up in North Carolina, which the Obama campaign targeted early. Obama has 31 offices in the state and well over 200 staffers. Obama also has spent at least $2.5 million on TV advertising in the state, far more than McCain. Obama began his TV ad campaign in early summer, and McCain only began his during the week of the Republican national convention.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Despite that effort, the McCain campaign noted that every statewide public opinion poll has shown McCain with either a large or a modest lead in the state. They also noted that North Carolina last voted Democratic for president in 1976.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> DuHaime said the intensity of the Republican effort in the state is growing. He said 39,000 Republicans had requested absentee ballots, compared to 18,000 Democrats.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory, the GOP candidate for governor, said during McCain had shown his experienced leadership by warning of the breakdown of Fannie Mae, the troubled lender, and had sought legislation to fix it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama is scheduled to campaign in Charlotte today - his third campaign appearance in the state since the May primary. His wife, Michelle Obama, made a campaign swing through Charlotte, Greensboro and Durham last week. Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, campaigned in Charlotte last weekend.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sibelius, an Obama surrogate, campaigned in Asheville, Hickory and Greensboro yesterday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Neither McCain nor his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, has made a public campaign appearance in the state in the general election, although McCain met privately with the Rev. Billy Graham.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> DuHaime said he does not know when McCain or Palin will campaign in North Carolina.</span></p>
