  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain and Barack Obama are offering voters very different views of America's energy future.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama envisions the federal government funding alternative energy development and mandating lower fuel consumption. McCain sees a less direct federal role, relying on government incentives and market forces to boost energy supplies and promote efficiency.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Both candidates are similar in one respect: They pledge a comprehensive overhaul of energy policy. But they offer sharply divergent paths that analysts often find confounding and impractical. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;They both have ambitious goals, but less-than-ambitious means,&quot; said Bruce Bullock, the director of Southern Methodist University's Maguire Energy Institute.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Richard Kearney, the director of the School of Public and International Affairs at North Carolina State University, put it more starkly: &quot;They're just throwing stuff against a wall and seeing what sticks.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Experts agreed that neither candidate's plan is likely to lower energy prices anytime soon.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;There's no silver bullet that will bring prices down,&quot; Bullock said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">* * * *</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Voters will have a particularly tough task sorting out all the ideas.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;If I were a voter and didn't know much about energy, I would think that nothing the candidates are saying, at first glance, sounds wrong,&quot; said Robert Kaufmann, the director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Studies at Boston University.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In addition, voters should understand &quot;there is no singular answer. Markets are too complex and our energy needs are too great,&quot; added Philip Sharp, the president of Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan research group.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> To sort out the energy plans, experts said, voters need to consider these questions:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> * Will either plan help the United States reduce its dependence on oil?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The United States consumes about 20.6 million barrels of oil a day. About 60 percent is imported. That's well above the 35.8 percent that was imported in 1975, when President Gerald Ford, and later President Jimmy Carter, put their political weight behind comprehensive energy legislation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama aims to reduce oil consumption by at least 35 percent by 2030; among his ideas to curb demand is to increase fleet fuel economy 49 miles per gallon in 18 years. McCain doesn't set specific goals for consumption or auto standards.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Auto fleet-average mileage standards are scheduled under current law to increase from today's 27.5 miles per gallon to 35 mpg by 2020.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain focuses on increasing oil supplies, emphasizing that his plan to end the 27-year-old moratorium on drilling off most U.S. coastal waters will free up &quot;enormous energy reserves.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> * Can the government set energy policy on a radically different course?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain and Obama say that's their goal.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;McCain would use the cap and trade system as a way to promote alternative fuels. Funds would help develop cleaner energy technologies, including nuclear power.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama, who also supports a form of cap and trade, would spend $150 billion over 10 years to help develop biofuels, &quot;commercial-scale renewable energy,&quot; plug-in hybrids, low-emission coal plants and other sources.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> * Can the program be sold to the public?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> The biggest energy-policy problem the new president will have is likely to be political. Massive energy programs can be a tough sell, particularly to a public that wants price relief now, and with a strong array of special interests ready to pounce.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Yet President Carter did it in the late 1970s. It took all four years of his term, but he got about three-fourths of what he first proposed, and from the start he made it clear that his energy program was his top domestic priority.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Views on energy '08</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Where the presidential candidates stand:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dependence on foreign oil imports</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain: Cap and trade program to help cut dependence; send correct signals to market to move beyond fossil fuel dependence</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama : Reduce oil consumption by at least 35% by 2030 via fuel efficiency, biofuels, investing in new vehicle technologies</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Technology investment</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain: Revise federal research funding, bureaucracy to develop new emission reduction technologies; streamline process to deploy new technology</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama: $150 billion over 10 years to fund transition to digital electricity grid, low-emission coal plants, other projects</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nuclear fuel</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain: 45 new power plants by 2030; loan guarantees for new construction; supports Yucca Mtn. nuclear waste facility</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama Must address security of nuclear fuel and waste, waste storage, proliferation, public's right to know before building new power plants; against Yucca Mtn.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Renewable fuel standards</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain: Eliminate mandates, subsidies for corn-based ethanol that thwart market-based solutions</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama: 60 billion gal. of advanced biofuels by 2030; 2 billion gal. of cellulosic ethanol by 2013</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Vehicle fuel efficiency</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain: Supports CAFE standards; penalties must compel production of fuel-efficient cars</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama ; Double fuel economy standards within 18 years; retool tax credits, loan guarantees so fuel-efficient cars can be built in U.S.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Building efficiency</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain: Favors tax incentives for energy-efficient buildings, appliances</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama: All new buildings must be carbon neutral or produce zero emissions by 2030</span></p>
