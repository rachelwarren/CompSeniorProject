  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Speaking on the selection of Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware as Barack Obama's running mate on Fox News Sunday, Gov. Tim Kaine was asked this question by moderator Chris Wallace: &quot;Virginia has not voted for a Democrat since 1964, but the polls say Virginia is undecided. What, if anything, can Joe Biden do for the Democrats in Virginia?&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Gov. Kaine's response was: &quot;Joe comes from a state, Delaware, that borders Virginia. The Eastern Shore of Virginia is not only bordering, but very, very similar, and I think there is a lot in common and Joe understands that.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Hats off to Gov. Kaine for recognizing what many maps and politicians fail to acknowledge. The Eastern Shore is truly wonderful and a big economic contributor. However, even though he knows of the Eastern Shore, he certainly does not know much more than that. The Eastern Shore of Virginia does not border Delaware as he twice asserted; it borders Maryland.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In turn, Delaware borders Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania (including the outskirts of Philadelphia). That's not exactly &quot;very, very similar&quot; to the way of life on the Eastern Shore and southern Virginia.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Health-care myth</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Re &quot;Are you better off now?&quot; Hampton Roads, Aug. 22:</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">After watching Barack Obama's town hall meeting in Chesapeake, I am even more convinced that his inexperience would be damaging to the U.S. economy and to our nation as a whole.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He says that he doesn't believe the government should be taking care of everyone, but turned around and said that he is for free health care. So which is it?</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He wants free or almost free medical care, state-provided mental health care and so forth, yet doesn't have any idea of how we are to pay for it.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He talks about how people worry about how they are going to put their kids through college, then talks about his own path via student loans and work. Why can't the kids today continue to do so? If they want it bad enough, maybe they can do the same, or join the military and earn it.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Faith is fair game</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Columnist Kathleen Parker appealed to &quot;higher principles&quot; in her struggle to find a place to attack Rick Warren for hosting an interview with John McCain and Barack Obama (&quot;Purpose-driven politics,&quot; op-ed, Aug. 22).</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">What's wrong with finding out what a candidate for public office believes? If he wants to lie about it, as she implies, does that negate the need to ask the question? And, more importantly, does bringing religious thought into the public sphere equal un-Americanism? It does, only if Americans buy into the prevailing climate of anti-religious thought. This was not our Founding Fathers' intent.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Nowhere in the Constitution is it mandated that religion shall play no role in government or public life; in fact, the Constitution ensures the right of individuals and organizations to express their faith both privately and publicly.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">During the colonization of the new world, religious minorities, like the Baptists, were routinely imprisoned for publicly practicing their faith. The leaders of this new nation wanted to create a world where people of faith (which were the vast majority) could openly and without fear of reprisal practice their faith and have an equal opportunity to sit at the table of government. There was to be no &quot;wall of separation,&quot; there was to be no restriction.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This is not the political/legal climate we live in now. Today, people of faith are called &quot;un-American&quot; when they attempt to publicly express themselves with integrity. People of faith and faith organizations have as much right to be in the political/governmental process as do people of no faith and secular organizations. It is constitutional; it is American.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Voice of a movement</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Barack Obama is more than a person; he has become a movement. In history, Abraham Lincoln, FDR, John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. are examples of men who became movements. And they all became movements by their vocal powers to persuade, convince and lead their fellow Americans.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They say that the pen is mightier than the sword, but I say that the voice is even mightier than the pen in a world in which communication is immediate and the message is heard worldwide, like Obama's speech in Germany.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yes, the opponents try to suppress Obama's oratory, saying it comes from an empty suit with little experience. Try to convince the millions who have seen and heard his voice and who have come away convinced to give this young man his day in the light on Nov. 4, Election Day.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democratic casual</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Now that Barack Obama has made his selection for vice president, Gov. Kaine needs to put his tie back on. The governor's appearance recently has not been very dignified or appropriate.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Editor with style</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">An intelligent and most valuable voice was silenced this month when Tom Robotham resigned his post as editor in chief of Port Folio Weekly. It seems that the publication's corporate owners just couldn't put up with someone who gave the paper a distinct point of view and a bit of attitude, attributes sorely lacking in most of our local newspapers and magazines.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">They also couldn't stand the idea that readers might actually want to learn about slightly off-the-radar subject matter and hear from people who hold unusual, non-mainstream points of view.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Under Robotham, Port Folio Weekly was a straight-shooting, tell-it-like-it-is publication, and not a focus group driven &quot;product,&quot; which is exactly the direction the current owners wish to take the paper. It is the same mode of thinking that turned commercial FM radio into the dull, repetitive and unimaginative wasteland it has been for years.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">We will all be poorer for Robotham's departure. Let us all now turn on our radios, where &quot;Another One Bites The Dust&quot; will no doubt be airing.</span></p>
