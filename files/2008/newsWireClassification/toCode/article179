  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">John McCain, the father of private school students, criticized Democratic rival Barack Obama on Friday for choosing private over public school for his kids. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The difference, according to the Arizona Republican, is that he - not Obama - favors vouchers that give parents more school choices.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Everybody should have the same choice Cindy and I and Sen. Obama did,&quot; McCain told the National Urban League, an influential black organization that Obama will address to day.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain listed a variety of changes in education policies that he said would improve a flawed system - from school choice to more local control and direct public support to parents for tutoring. In each case, he said Obama came up short.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;My opponent talks a great deal about hope and change, and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness,&quot; he said. &quot;If Sen. Obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform, then he should start looking for new slogans.&quot; &quot;<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">ad defense</span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. John McCain on Friday defended his campaign's Web ad mocking Sen. Barack Obama as a presumptuous messianic figure. He said it was important to &quot;display a sense of humor&quot; in the race. The ad, with a voice-over calling Obama &quot;The One,&quot; features clips of the Democrat using grandiose terms.</span></p>
