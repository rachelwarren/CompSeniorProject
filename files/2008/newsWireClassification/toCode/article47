  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Barack Obama and a conservative group have escalated their fight over the group's TV commercial linking him to a 1960s radical, by firing off dueling letters to the Department of Justice. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama camp argued that the group, the American Issues Project, is violating the law.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The group cited a Supreme Court ruling to argue it is allowed to air the ad, which links Obama to 1960s radical William Ayers - who helped found the Weather Underground organization that took responsibility for a series of bombings, including nonfatal blasts at the Pentagon and U.S. Capitol, four decades ago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">American Issues Project is a 501(c)4 nonprofit corporation. Such organizations are allowed to air political ads, provided the federal government determines that the group's primary purpose is not political.</span></p>

  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democratic governors at the convention lined up Tuesday to criticize Republican Sen. John McCain and offered a chorus of praise for their party's nominee, Sen. Barack Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Underscoring the governors' rhetoric was an appeal to populations where Obama has run weak in polls, particularly among rural and middle-class voters.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The governors, speaking in short bits, vouched that Obama deserved greater consideration from those voting blocs and that McCain was unacceptable.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Authorities: Men weren't a danger</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A group of suspected drug users arrested with methamphetamine, guns and bulletproof vests made racist threats against Sen. Barack Obama but posed no true danger to the presidential candidate, federal authorities said Tuesday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The three men - all high on methamphetamine when arrested - are the subject of an assassination investigation but so far, authorities say, it appears that they had no capacity to carry out any attack .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The three have been charged with drug and weapons offenses but not with threatening to assassinate Obama.</span></p>
