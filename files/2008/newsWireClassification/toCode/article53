  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Carolyn Brown-Spiller's pale-yellow shirt said it all: Hillary.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Sen. Barack Obama will leave the Democratic National Convention here as the party's nominee for president. But Brown-Spiller, a Louisiana delegate, plans to vote tomorrow for Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I'll vote for the Democratic candidate in November,&quot; she said. &quot;Here, I'll vote for Hillary.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In an attempt to placate Clinton supporters such as Brown-Spiller, Obama agreed to allow Clinton's name to be placed in a roll-call vote for the nomination tomorrow night.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Clinton said yesterday that she won't tell her backers how to vote but that she will vote for Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> A CBS News/New York Times poll released Sunday found some of the Clinton delegates still are upset over her defeat.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> So the Democrats were orchestrating a deal that would provide a state-by-state vote for the presidential nominee, during which Clinton delegates could support her.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> But the voting would be cut off after several states, the officials said, perhaps ending with New York, when Clinton herself would call for nomination of Obama by acclamation.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Brown-Spiller bristles at the idea that Clinton supporters should step in line behind Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;It's not my job to unify the party,&quot; she said. &quot;It's his.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Clinton publicly is urging the party to come together, despite reports of continuing clashes between her camp and Obama's.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> In a statement released yesterday after Sen. John McCain, the probable Republican nominee, began running ads featuring Clinton criticizing Obama during the primaries, Clinton reiterated her support for the likely nominee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Every one of us could stand up and recite all the reasons why we must elect Barack,&quot; she said. &quot;So let there be the no mistake about it, we are united. We are united for change.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> At a breakfast for New York Democrats, she took her own shot at McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Now I understand that the McCain campaign is running ads trying to divide us. I'm Hillary Clinton, and I do not approve that message,&quot; she said, to laughter and applause.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obama, for his part, said in Iowa yesterday that both Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, &quot;couldn't have been more clear&quot; in their support for his candidacy.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Some Democratic women - many of whom were Clinton supporters - say too much is being made about a possible rift.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Several Clinton delegates said they were unhappy McCain was using their &quot;family fight&quot; against Obama, particularly in an ad released Sunday about Clinton being passed over as the vice presidential nominee.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;It makes me sad,&quot; said Pam Durham, a Clinton delegate from Fort Worth, Texas, who has not yet embraced Obama. &quot;It may unite our party against the outsider.... What he said was the truth, but it may unite us against him.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;Whatever Hillary says, we'll do,&quot; said Pam Wallace, president-elect of the Alabama Federation of Democratic Women.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> &quot;I was elected as a Hillary delegate, so whatever she says.&quot;</span></p>
