  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Sen. Edward M. Kennedy issued a summons to fellow Democrats to rally behind Sen. Barack Obama's quest for the White House during a poignant opening Monday to a party convention in search of unity for the fall campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Barack will finally bring the change we need,&quot; seconded Obama's wife, Michelle, casting her husband as a leader with classic American values. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">She pledged he would end the war in Iraq, revise a sputtering economy and extend health care to all.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Democrats opened their four-day convention as polls underscored the closeness of the race with Republican Sen. John McCain. Obama faces lingering divisions from a fierce battle with Hillary Rodham Clinton for the nomination, tough ads by McCain and his Republican allies, and a reminder that racism, too, could play a role.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;There are people who are not going to vote for him because he's black,&quot; James Hoffa, president of the Teamsters union, said in an interview . &quot;And we've got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests No. 1.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kennedy and Obama's wife were the bookends of an evening that left the delegates cheering .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The work begins anew, the hope rises again and the dream lives on,&quot; Kennedy said , reprising the final line of a 1980 speech that brought a different convention to its feet.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The senator has been undergoing treatment for a malignant brain tumor.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama's wife said it was time to &quot;stop doubting and start dreaming.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Moments later, Barack Obama appeared via satellite from Missouri, drawing cheers .</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In one of their first orders of business, delegates ratified a party platform tailored to Obama's specifications. It backs &quot;complete redeployment within 16 months from Iraq,&quot; as well as health care for all, a new economic stimulus package and higher taxes on families earning more than $250,000 a year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay, and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right,&quot; it said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama is scheduled to deliver his acceptance speech Thursday at a football stadium, before a crowd likely to total 75,000 or more. Then he and Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, his vice presidential running mate, depart for the fall campaign.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">If the opening night's convention program had a feel-good quality, not so the intensifying campaign outside the hall.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama struggled to quash a television commercial financed by an independent Republican group that linked him to a 1960s-era radical - before it could damage his candidacy as the infamous Swift Boat ads helped sink John Kerry four years ago.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">He also shipped a new commercial that used humor to depict McCain as an extension of the Bush administration, the latest in a series of negative advertisements by both sides.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Really can't explain the price of gas, or what has happened to the middle class,&quot; the announcer sings to the tune of Sam Cooke's &quot;Wonderful World.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With McCain and Bush appearing together on the screen, the announcer says, &quot;Do we really want four more years of the same old tune?&quot;<br /><br /></span><span class="c7">opening day</span><br /></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Howard Dean, the party chairman, rapped the opening gavel on schedule at 3 p.m. Mountain time - before only a smattering of delegates.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;We are ready to compete in all 50 states in November,&quot; he said. Michelle Obama</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The wife of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama spoke on the first night of the convention.</span></p>
