  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Aug. 19--Why is it that when certain people so much as sneeze, it warrants statewide media coverage? If Britney Spears sprains an ankle it would be a &quot;stop the presses&quot; moment. One such celebrity/politician is Governator Arnold Schwarzenegger, who recently made headlines for undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This may seem newsworthy to some, but personally I would rather see this headline: &quot;Legislature undergoes mandatory brain surgery to pass budget.&quot; </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Enough said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">With the filing deadline now having passed, residents have a better idea of just how many candidates are vying for spots on local city councils. The final tally is 32 people running for 11 open seats in the Victor Valley, including nine candidates vying for three spots in Victorville -- the most the city's seen in recent history. Apple Valley has nine candidates as well, including a &quot;Niles&quot; and a &quot;Jiles,&quot; as if voters need more confusion.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">This means one thing, folks: More signs and more campaign mail, or as I like to call it, more kindling.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">At a recent political event a young woman mentioned the new billboards that are adorned with the initials &quot;MK.&quot; The first thing she thought of was Mary Kay, the well-known cosmetic company. She immediately became interested, wondering if they were having a sale or releasing a new product. Much to her chagrin, upon further reading she realized it was an ad for Hesperia City Council hopeful Mark Kirk. Way to grab somebody's attention, captain Kirk; hopefully you will not be asked to give makeovers.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A recent report confirmed that the &quot;Frank&quot; referred to in Barack Obama's 1995 book &quot;Dreams From my Father&quot; is in fact Communist Party USA member Frank Marshall Davis. It seems that the blue democratic presidential candidate may have an affinity toward the red.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">I guess he wasn't kidding about &quot;change.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">However, Obama did say last week that he would not raise taxes on anyone over 70, which of course means John McCain is in the clear.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A gettogether was held last week at Apple Valley Town Hall to welcome the new town manager, Frank Robinson, who came here from Texas. I didn't get a chance to ask him if everything's bigger there or if he plans on making Apple Valley bigger, but I did tell him about this column, encouraging him to give me a call if he ever has any &quot;dirt&quot; on local politicians.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;I tend to stay away from that aspect,&quot; Robinson said. &quot;I find there's more (job) longevity that way.&quot; Touche, Mr. Robinson, I agree that a man in your position is better off avoiding political posturing. But honestly, if you change your mind, don't hesitate to call.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The election is getting closer and I have still not seen any submitted videos for the latest contest. The winner will receive an Apple iphone. Whoever can come up with the funniest McCain or Obama girl video wins. Just go to www. VVDailyPress.com and click on &quot;want to submit a video&quot; then follow the prompts. Please keep the videos between 15 and 30 seconds. Happy (film) shooting.</span></p>
