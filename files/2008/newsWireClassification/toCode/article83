  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> THE AD</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> Maybe you're struggling just to pay the mortgage on your home. But recently John McCain said, &quot;The fundamentals of our economy are strong.&quot; Hmm. Then again, that same day, when asked how many houses he owns, McCain lost track -- he couldn't remember. Well, it's seven. Seven houses. And here's one house America can't afford to let John McCain move into. [Shot of the White House] </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">ANALYSIS</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2"> This Barack Obama&nbsp;ad attempts to paint the senator from Arizona as a wealthy, out-of-touch elitist -- precisely the tactic that Republicans once used against John Kerry and John Edwards.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain did make the comment about the economy and, in an interview with Politico yesterday, could not enumerate how many houses he owns. (An on-screen graphic notes that they are worth $13 million.) The McCain camp says he and his wife, Cindy, whose fortune comes from a family beer distributorship, use four of the properties, with the others occupied by relatives or others.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The underlying assumption -- that McCain's personal wealth makes him insensitive to the struggling economy -- is highly debatable. McCain has repeatedly talked about the need to address economic problems, and both he and the senator from Illinois voiced support for -- but did not vote on -- a housing bailout bill passed by Congress. Still, the tactic could be an effective counterpunch to McCain's ads dismissing Obama as a mere celebrity.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Obama spot implicitly makes one other charge. By showing McCain speaking in slow motion with melancholy music in the background, while the narrator says he can't remember the number of homes, the ad suggests the 71-year-old Republican is confused.</span></p>
