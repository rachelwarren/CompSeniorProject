  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Leading Republicans on Sunday faulted both presidential campaigns for the increasingly negative tone of their advertising, suggesting the bitter attacks undermine John McCain and Barack Obama's credibility with voters and could backfire. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Both campaigns are making a mistake, and that is they are taking whatever their attacks are and going one step too far,&quot; said former White House political adviser Karl Rove. &quot;They don't need to attack each other in this way. There ought to be an adult who says, 'Do we really need to go that far in this ad? Don't we make our point and won't we get broader acceptance and deny the opposition an opportunity to attack us if we don't include that one little last tweak in the ad?' &quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In the past week, the McCain campaign has put out an Internet ad accusing Obama of calling Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin a pig when he used the phrase putting &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; to criticize the GOP ticket as trying to make a bad situation look better.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">In turn, a recent Obama TV ad makes a dig at McCain's age in saying McCain hasn't changed in the past 26 years. It shows McCain at a hearing in the early 1980s.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who unsuccessfully sought the GOP presidential nomination, said McCain and Obama need to engage more openly in town hall meetings rather than back-and-forth negative advertising.</span></p>
