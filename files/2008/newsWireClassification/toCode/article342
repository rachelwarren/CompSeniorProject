  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Aug. 13--Saying its candidate's plan would protect American jobs like those inside York County's Harley-Davidson plant, the presidential campaign of Sen. Barack Obama launched a radio ad Tuesday attacking Sen. John McCain's stance on the issue. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad came the day McCain visited York County for a town hall-style discussion at the York Expo Center's Toyota Arena.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">According to a script released by the Obama campaign, the ad begins with McCain speaking at a South Dakota motorcycle rally.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain says he would take the roar of Harleys over the roar Obama received from a German crowd while touring overseas.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The rest of the ad rebukes McCain for not supporting a requirement to mandate the American government buy American-made motorcycles, saying McCain called the idea &quot;disgraceful.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It also says McCain supports tax breaks resulting in jobs going overseas, with motorcycles rumbling in the background.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The ad itself does not specifically mention Harley's actions this year to cut about 300 union workers in Springettsbury Township from its payroll, but a news release about the radio ad does.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Harley-Davidson has said it has no plans to outsource American workers. At most, it would consider operating facilities near overseas markets it wants to expand business into, the company has said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">McCain declined comment Tuesday about the radio ad, saying his campaign would respond.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Paul Lindsay, spokesman for McCain in Pennsylvania and Ohio, issued a statement late in the day</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">that said McCain voted against the &quot;Buy America&quot; restriction because he does not believe in protectionist tariffs.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Also, because it would have cost the American taxpayer $5 billion per year, he said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Lindsay also took his own swing at an Obama policy that could affect &quot;hard-working Americans,&quot; citing Obama's vote for next year's budget that would have included a tax hike for Americans making about $42,000 or more per year.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Obama has said in past weeks his budget resolution votes were not tax-hike votes.</span></p>
