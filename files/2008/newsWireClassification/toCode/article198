  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Report: Lance, Kate over</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Kate Hudson's relationship with Lance Armstrong is all cycled out, the New York Daily News reports.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The Oscar-nominated actress, 29, and the Tour de France champ, 36, were spotted together in May. Despite dating for just a few months, their relationship seemed to move at warp speed. The couple introduced each other to their respective families soon after they began dating, the Daily News notes.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Yet, while they were often photographed together, they never publicly commented on the nature of their relationship. </span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The former lovebirds finally decided to end things at the three-day Lance Armstrong Livestrong Summit in Columbus, Ohio, during the weekend, an unnamed friend of the couple told US Weekly magazine. Mr. Armstrong's publicist had no comment Wednesday, and Miss Hudson's rep was unavailable, the newspaper said.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Cops: Jerry packin' heat</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Police say they confiscated a gun belonging to Jerry Lewis that was found in the 82-year-old entertainer's carry-on bag as he prepared to fly to Detroit from Las Vegas.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Las Vegas policeman Bill Cassell said Tuesday that the comic legend was cited Friday for carrying an unloaded concealed weapon at the Las Vegas airport. Mr. Lewis' manager, Claudia Marghilano, says the handgun is a hollowed-out prop gun that he sometimes twirls during his show. She told Associated Press the gun couldn't fire.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Miss Marghilano says Mr. Lewis didn't know the gun was in the bag along with other props. However, Officer Cassell says if the gun were merely a prop, &quot;it wouldn't be a weapon and we couldn't cite him for carrying a weapon.&quot;</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mrs. O. is best-dressed</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Score one for Michelle Obama.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The first-lady fashion fight continues as the Democratic White House wannabe got the vote from Vanity Fair magazine, which put her on its global best-dressed list for the second year in a row, the New York Daily News reported Wednesday.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mrs. Obama was praised for her simple, chic style and was called &quot;our commander in sheath.&quot; Left off the coveted roster was Cindy McCain.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Mrs. McCain made news while getting a private peek at Oscar de la Renta's fancy fall line. Yet Mrs. Obama, who has her own favorite high-end designers, has made sure to advertise her everywoman frugality every chance she gets.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Women across the country bought the pitch - and the dress - when Mrs. Obama announced she was wearing a $150 White House Black Market frock.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Victoria's secret</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">A regally large pair of bloomers that belonged to Queen Victoria sold for nine times their estimate at an auction Wednesday in Britain, Agence France-Presse reports.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Dating from the 1890s, the 50-inch-waist knickers, as the Brits call them, sold for $8,914 but had been expected to fetch just $990. The queen's 66-inch-bust chemise sold for $7,924, and her nightdress fetched $10,895 at the sale. The bloomers, which were sold by a British family, were bought by an anonymous Canadian.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Victoria was on the throne from 1837 to 1901, the longest reign in British history.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Singing for 007</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">It's a double-O duet.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Alicia Keys and Jack White have recorded the theme song for the new James Bond film, &quot;Quantum of Solace,&quot; AP reports.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">The R&amp;B superstar and White Stripes frontman have teamed up for &quot;Another Way to Die,&quot; the first duet to be chosen as a Bond theme. Producers said Mr. White wrote and produced the song; he also plays drums as well as singing with Miss Keys, an 11-time Grammy winner.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Troubled British diva Amy Winehouse previously was linked to the theme.</span></p> 
  <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&quot;Quantum of Solace,&quot; with Daniel Craig returning as suave Secret Agent 007, is due for release in Britain on Oct. 31 and worldwide in November.</span></p>
