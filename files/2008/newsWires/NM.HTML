<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election Odyssey ends today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What will it be like to come home, turn on your television and not see a campaign ad or listen to a telephone message from Republican or Democrat volunteers asking for your vote? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emotions have run high this year in our media-saturated environment in which news, opinions and entertainment surround us all day on our television sets, computers and cell phones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are babies who've been born and are now walking and talking since we started this campaign,&quot; Sen. Barack Obama said of his almost two-year presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Associated Press calls this election not just one for the history books but one for the ages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Democratic side, the first black nominee of either major party is bidding to become the first black president. In his quest, Obama has infused the American political experience with enormous rallies and energetic speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans, in choosing Arizona Sen. John McCain and Sarah Palin, paired a man of deep experience, compelling background and a stubborn independent streak with the first woman ever on a GOP ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite strong and fractious opinions on both sides, we hope this year goes down in the books as the year when the most Americans chose to be a part of the Democratic process by casting their votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Mexico presidential elections are notoriously close. In 2000, Democrat Al Gore won New Mexico by a mere 366 votes. Four years later, President Bush took the state by only 6,000 votes, one of the closest margins in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the world, we tout democracy as the greatest form of government. But democracy is not without responsibility. It encourages intelligence, freedom, equality and creativity from its participants. It asks us to participate in creating our own destiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voting is one part of the process that defines our future as Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you compare our lives to those in other nations across the globe, it's a small price to pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 72 voting locations throughout San Juan County. Polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 7 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone with election questions may call the clerk's office at (505) 334-9471.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weinbaum has dropped his lawsuit against the Las Cruces crosses due to a U.S. Supreme Court that he views as currently conservative and unfavorable to his cause. I guess once Obama gets a couple of his justices on the court, the lawsuit will be back on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Road builder Rawson should follow the advice of Mark Twain: &quot;Always acknowledge a fault frankly. This will throw people off their guard and give you an opportunity to commit more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alan Greenspan failed to regulate mortgage standards under a 1994 law passed by Congress, and he prolonged 1 percent interest rates, which combined with lax standards resulted in this recession. In a congressional hearing, his libertarian ideology was challenged, and he admitted its failings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Bill Richardson, go out on a good note from the state of N.M. On the presidential election vote count, can you make sure your election count officials are to speed and not make us be the laughing stock state in the Union like we were four years ago? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I too am tired to hear about the animal shelter. Mainly, because there are only negative remarks printed. I called in twice, and because I did not smear the shelter, it never made the paper. I am a volunteer, and no one has ever been rude to me, and I never observed any staff member being rude to visitors. Now, which organization is behind the hateful remarks, and I am glad, that at least the city is supporting the shelter. I know they do the best under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We applaud the decision of the Court of Appeals in striking down Weinbaum and Boyd's case against the crosses. Just imagine the ridiculous precedent that would have been set to the tune of millions, if not billions, of tax- payer dollars. What would have been next? St. Paul, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles or San Francisco?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was another typical October Saturday filled with disappointment, as we see another year of Aggie football go down the drain. Never ind the fact that it was Idaho's first Division 1A college football victory in over 2 years. Nevermind the fact that Idaho is arguably the worst team in college football. Oh, and forget the fact that Hal Mumme proclaims &quot;he is proud of Idaho, and the way they played&quot;, instead of addressing his own team's glaring deficiencies in post-game comments. Yes, I have decided to put all this behind me, because today I just realized what Hal is doing. In these tough economic times; Hal knows we are all pinching pennies. Hal knows that if the Aggies were to make a bowl game, the most faithful Aggie fans would hold a large financial obligation for buying bowl tickets, travel, and time off work. Yes! Hal knows all these things. Why do you think he decided to take his foot off the gas when we were up by 14 on UNM? Why would he lead his team into games against San Jose State and Idaho completely unprepared? Why has this team severely underachieved for the third year in row? Why you ask? Because Hal is just looking out for our best financial interest. Save that money you would have spent on bowl tickets, travel, and bowl game tailgates. Save that money you were going to contribute to this floundering football program. Put that money in your savings account, and remember to say &quot;Thank you Hal Mumme&quot; while you're doing it!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm disabled and after waiting and waiting for my absentee ballot, one arrived. On it, my address is correct, my first name is close, my last name is very wrong and they didn't even get the correct precinct. I guess I won't vote. We should brace ourselves, another cluster of errors is coming from our illustrious Do&ntilde;a Ana County Bureau of Elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is gasoline still $2.79 a gallon here, when it is $2.04 in Oklahoma City and $2.34 in Albuquerque? They (you know who they are) are still ripping us off down here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So many people would help our animal shelter if there was a welcoming, open atmosphere and a genuine desire to partner with community stakeholders, volunteers and experts in various areas instead of making enemies out of many and burning bridges over personal differences or conflicts. Let's get together and re-build and start anew. It's not too late to do just that. We need to approach it as a community-wide problem with solutions that address more than the constant pointing of fingers at the public, at each other, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9/11 and the financial meltdown. One was caused by an outside force, and the other was a homegrown catastrophe. What do they have in common? Both occurred on the watch of the same president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed bond issues are another rape of the New Mexico taxpayers. Our property taxes are going to raise. We can not afford for instance $19,000,000 for the only the first phase of an arts center at NMSU!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Kennedy's most inspiring words: &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.&quot; Today's constant push by Democrats for expanded assistance programs, including tax credits, flies in the face of these inspiring words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What soccer mom, hockey mom, Joe Six-Pack can afford $150,000 dollars in just clothes? Not only in a lifetime, but in six weeks? So much for her image as a regular soccer, hockey mother. What a farce she turned out to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Barela, you lied to us about the GRT and having no money for raises and yet you can create a bunch of hire power positions and not even consider dedicated staff who have made that place their career. Just who are all those high-powered people supposed to supervise? We don't have enough officers to operate safely now, and won't for a long time. But we'll have plenty of supervisors taking up office space. Good faith, good intentions, good riddance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Absolutely &quot;no&quot; to bond issue D, raising our taxes so NMSU can squander more of our money. Their fiasco promising us a &quot;science quadrangle&quot; for the $10 million we gave them a few years ago shows how they mislead and spend unwisely. The $19 million they now want for an arts center is merely a down payment for the more than $50 million total they plan to bleed from us over the next several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am slightly to the left. But Mary Jane Garcia has become way too far left for me   favors gay marriage, driver's licenses and health care for illegal Immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is amazing watching the Pied Piper leading all the rats to the voting booth. It is astounding to see all the number of mindless citizens supporting Obama. He is telling you what you want to hear   most of it distorted truth. Reminds me of Jim Jones!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the sugar this time of year causes behavioral problems with your children. Make sure they get meat, fish, vegs, nuts, eggs and vitamin B supplements. You are setting them up for diabetes and other complications later on in life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is no John Kennedy! Obama &quot;Ask not what you can do for yourself; ask what your country can do for y-o-u.&quot; free things for everyone because he &quot;believes&quot; you are entitled to free stuff. Remember, he says he believes everyone should have health care, etc. What you are not hearing is he not guaranteeing you all the promises he so eloquently speaks of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of pecans, laws should be passed here to enforce a changeover of growing pecans without all the poisons. They have been here for decades and the tons of petrochemicals has definitely poisoned the soil and probably poisoned the water reservoir for centuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's dump McCain. I'm hog-wild for a true Republican ticket   Sarah Palin and Joe the Plumber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I just heard an attack ad on Sen. Rawson. Mr. Fischman should be ashamed of himself. Anyone who knows Sen. Rawson knows the charges are a tissue of lies. What kind of person could live with himself after being elected on such deceit. Terrible! Terrible!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is a socialist? A socialist is a communist with a better looking suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain is no Harry Truman, who took a courageous stand against racism in 1948, risking his re-election. President Truman also concentrated his fire against the conservative, obstructionist tendencies of the Republicans like today. This is not 1948!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, the arrogant and inexperienced Barack Obama. Now the loose-lips Joe Biden. The Republicans don't need a plan to defeat this team. They themselves are tearing each other apart. Perfect, six days and counting. John McCain win landslide.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON   Americans who tuned in to the last round of John McCain and Barack Obama campaign rallies will be voting Tuesday with some false notes ringing in their ears along with the hurrahs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and running mate Sarah Palin, right down to the wire, persisted in distortions that were discredited long ago. Obama, who has been more responsive lately to being called out on his misstatements, did a rhetorical dance that avoided some of the bogus claims of the past. Even so, not all of his words bore up to scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Altogether, facts took a beating in the campaign. McCain and Obama produced enduring myths that their running mates and supporters amplified and distorted even more. When a non-licensed plumber who owes back taxes and would get a tax cut under Obama is held out by McCain as a stand-in for average working people who should vote Republican, you know truth-telling took a back seat to myth-making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, McCain gave a final airing to unsupported statements and half-baked truths at rallies such as one in Tampa, Fla., where he said: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;My friends, if I'm elected president, I won't spend nearly a trillion dollars more of your money. Sen. Obama will.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE FACTS: McCain's health care plan alone is estimated to cost $1.3 trillion over 10 years by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which also estimates that McCain's tax cuts and spending programs would drive up the national debt by $5 trillion in a decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We're not going spend $750 billion of your money just bailing out the Wall Street banker and broker who got us into this mess. Sen. Obama will. I'm going to make sure we take care of the working people who were devastated by the excesses of Wall Street and Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE FACTS: McCain supported the financial bailout, even suspending his campaign to work for passage of the failed $700 billion version that was geared even less toward families than the version that passed   also with his vote. Obama backed the bailout, too. Both added more relief for families in their own platforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We're going stop sending $700 billion to buy oil from countries that don't like us very much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE FACTS: A wildly inflated figure that McCain kept using after it was refuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Palin told two tall tales almost in the same breath in her final rallies. In Jefferson City, Mo., she declared about Obama: &quot;He voted 94 times for higher taxes, even on hardworking, middle-class Americans making just $42,000 a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE FACTS: This highly misleading if not fictional count includes times when Obama voted to cut taxes for the middle class   that's cut, not raise   while increasing them on the rich. An analysis by FactCheck.org found that 23 of the votes were for measures that would have produced no tax increase at all, seven were for measures that would have lowered taxes for many, 11 would have increased taxes on only those making more than $1 million a year. Her count also includes repetitive votes for the same measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's claim that Obama voted for higher taxes on workers making as little as $42,000 is also off the mark. Obama voted for a nonbinding budget resolution that assumed certain Bush tax cuts would expire on schedule. Translated into tax law, that could mean $15 more in taxes for an individual making $42,000, says FactCheck.org. But there has been no move to put such higher rates into law. In any event, Obama proposes tax cuts for most people earning less than $200,000 and no increases for those taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's remarks at a rally in Jacksonville, Fla., also twisted some facts and omitted important details:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;If you make less than $250,000 a year, your taxes will not increase one single dime. Not your income tax. Not your payroll tax. Not your capital gains tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE FACTS: Not quite. Individual taxpayers making over $200,000 would see tax increases under his plan, along with those who report joint income over $250,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I'm going to go through the federal budget line by line, ending programs we don't need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE FACTS: Obama has been unable or unwilling to identify programs he would cut. Instead, he offers this pain-free prescription. Obama did identify a specific savings early on, proposing to delay certain NASA missions to help pay for his education plan. Then he reversed himself. NASA spending is important to Florida, a state important to him Tuesday. He'd save billions by withdrawing troops from Iraq but plans to augment forces in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He's been a sidekick to George W. Bush, voting for the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy that he once said were irresponsible.&quot; &quot;This out-of-touch, on-your-own economic philosophy that says you should give $700,000 tax cuts to the average Fortune 500 CEO, $300 billion to the same Wall Street banks that got us into this mess. A philosophy that says we shouldn't give a penny of relief to more than 100 million middle-class Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE FACTS: Obama also supported bailing out institutions &quot;that got us into this mess.&quot; The Bush-McCain &quot;philosophy&quot; he's criticizing has not denied &quot;a penny of relief&quot; to middle-income Americans. Bush's first-term tax cuts were across the board, of most dollar value to the wealthy but spread among all taxed incomes, and Obama plans to continue them for all but the richest when the cuts are due to expire. Moreover, the government sent tax-rebate checks this year to all taxpayers except the wealthy and those earning less than $3,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;If you already have health insurance, the only thing that will change under my plan is that we're going to lower your premiums. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE FACTS: At least in these remarks, Obama hewed closer to reality by leaving out one of the most notoriously unsupported figures in his campaign-long pitch   that his plan will lower family health care costs by $2,500. His plan does not lower premiums by a set amount but rather envisions savings being passed on to the consumer over time as efficiencies from information technology and preventive care are realized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such last-minute claims capped a campaign in which the truth was often stretched to the breaking point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Months ago, Obama saddled McCain with a bum rap when he accused the Republican of wanting a 100-year war in Iraq back in the spring. Finally he relented and said McCain sees U.S. troops being in Iraq for 100 years. That's closer to right   as a peacekeeping force like the one in South Korea. But McCain might be long associated with war without end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama accused McCain of wanting to privatize Social Security, which he doesn't. Now he accuses McCain of wanting to privatize &quot;part&quot; of Social Security, which he does, as one option that younger workers could choose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, McCain blithely carried on with a variety of discredited claims, abetted by a running mate whose exuberance was not at all dimmed by contrary evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the classics:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEALTH CARE HORRORS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It only took McCain and Palin a few words to bend Obama's health care plan out of recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain told supporters he &quot;won't fine small businesses and families with children, as Sen. Obama proposes, to force them into a new, huge, government-run health care program, while I keep the cost of the fine a secret until I hit you with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin talks about Obama's &quot;universal government-run program&quot; and adds: &quot;I don't think it's going to be real pleasing for Americans to consider health care being taken over by the Feds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's plan doesn't fine small businesses. It doesn't force families with children, or anyone, into government-run health care. And the Feds wouldn't be taking over the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's health plan was distorted, in turn, by Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your health care benefits will get taxed for the first time in history,&quot; Obama warned voters in attacking it. He often leads voters to think that's the full story. Hardly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, in exchange for proposing to tax the value of health benefits provided by employers, would offer a tax credit to help people buy insurance. That tax benefit   $5,000 for a family   gives people much more than the new taxation takes away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THAT BRIDGE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Palin ran for governor, she indicated her support for a proposal to build a nearly $400 million bridge from Ketchikan, Alaska, to an island with 50 residents and an airport. She was, at times, wishy-washy about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that doesn't make for a compelling line against government waste on the stump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So her stance became: &quot;I told the Congress 'thanks, but no thanks' for that Bridge to Nowhere.&quot; And a campaign ad declared she &quot;stopped the Bridge to Nowhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, during her campaign for governor, she vowed to defend Southeast Alaska &quot;when proposals are on the table like the bridge, and not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project or any other into something that's so negative.&quot; At the time, the chief &quot;spinmeister&quot; against the project was McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As governor, she abandoned the bridge after Washington pulled the money from it, letting the federal dollars be used for other projects in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September, her transportation department completed a $25 million gravel road to nowhere. Officials went ahead with the road, which would have led to the bridge, even though it has no purpose other than for foot races, hunting vehicles and possible future development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUILT BY ASSOCIATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Ayers, a University of Illinois education professor and former member of the radical Weather Underground, was front and center in Republican claims that Obama was &quot;palling around with terrorists,&quot; as Palin put it. Ayers had a meet-the-candidate event in his home for Obama early in the Democrat's political career. The two served on the board of the Woods Fund. And they live in the same Chicago neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Palin stretched the extent of that relationship to link Obama with shadowy figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond that, they falsely implied that Ayers used the occasion of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to wish even greater harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't care about an old washed-up terrorist and his wife, who still, at least on Sept. 11, 2001, said he still wanted to bomb more,&quot; McCain told a rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This distortion originated in Hillary Rodham Clinton's play book during the primaries, when she criticized Obama for the same relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayers, Clinton said, made comments &quot;which were deeply hurtful to people in New York and, I would hope, to every American, because they were published on 9/11, and he said that he was just sorry they hadn't done more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By coincidence, The New York Times published a story on the day of the attacks about Ayers and what he called his fictionalized memoirs. The story was based on an interview he had done earlier, in Chicago, in which he declared, &quot;I don't regret setting bombs,&quot; and &quot;I feel we didn't do enough,&quot; even while seeming to dissociate himself coyly from the group's most destructive acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late in the campaign, McCain and Palin criticized Obama for attending a 2003 party for Rashid Khalidi, a Palestinian-American professor and critic of Israel. But McCain is also linked Khalidi. The professor was a founder of the Center for Palestine Research and Studies, which received $448,000 from an organization McCain chairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FUZZY NUMBERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  $4 billion: &quot;John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion&quot; in tax breaks, Obama told McCain in a debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, McCain supports a cut in income taxes for all corporations, and doesn't single out any one industry for that benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  $882 billion: &quot;Sen. McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare   $882 billion worth,&quot; Obama said. Obama ads claim McCain would cut benefits by 22 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's plan proposes neither. He wants to save money the same way Obama wants to   by making programs such as Medicare more efficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's claim misrepresents what a McCain adviser said in a Wall Street Journal story and adds distorted analysis from a partisan think tank to come up with something that goes against what McCain says he would do   protect promised benefits from being cut.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egyptian president pledges reform</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAIRO, Egypt -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak promised Saturday to push ahead with economic reform and step up efforts to combat poverty, despite the impact of the international financial crisis on Egypt's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech to his ruling National Democratic Party convention, Mubarak also ordered the government to develop strategies to mitigate the effect of the crisis on Egypt's two main sources of income -- tourism and exports. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The convention is being held amid increasing skepticism of the government, political uncertainty and worsening economic woes in the Arab world's most populous nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mubarak said the government will earmark the equivalent of about $660 million in the next three years to help &quot;break the cycle of poverty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent report, the World Bank estimated the number of Egyptians living in poverty reached 20 percent by 2005, and the U.N. Population Fund said recently that the figure was now double that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union ratifies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pact with Boeing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEATTLE -- Machinists union members ratified a new contract with The Boeing Co. on Saturday, ending an eight-week strike that cut the airplane maker's profits and stalled jetliner deliveries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vote by members of the union, which represents about 27,000 workers at plants in Washington state, Oregon and Kansas, was about 74 percent in favor of the proposal five days after the two sides tentatively agreed to the deal and union leaders recommended its approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers are expected to return to Boeing's commercial airplane factories, which have been closed since the Sept. 6 walkout, starting tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union has said the contract protects more than 5,000 factory jobs, prevents the outsourcing of certain positions and preserves health care benefits. It also promises pay increases over four years rather than three, as outlined in earlier offers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The work stoppage was costing the company an estimated $100 million per day in deferred revenue and postponing delivery of its long-awaited 787 jetliner, which has already been delayed three times, and other commercial planes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer shot to death in St. Louis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIVERSITY CITY, Mo. -- A police officer in a suburb of St. Louis has died after being shot in the town's popular University City Loop area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KTVI-TV says 50-year-old Michael King died late Friday in the area known for its trendy shops, restaurants and offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University City police say they are seeking a 41-year-old man considered a person of interest in the investigation. They also are trying to find a gray car believed to be connected with the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One witness told KTVI-TV that the officer was sitting in his car when a man walked up and shot him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators have yet to determine the motive for the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the nation, prisons go green</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LITTLEROCK, Wash. -- Of all the things convicted murderer Robert Knowles has been called during his 13 years behind bars, recycler hasn't been one of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there he was one morning, pitchfork in hand, composting food scraps from the main chow line and coffee grounds from prison headquarters -- doing his part to &quot;green&quot; the prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's nice to be out in the elements,&quot; said Knowles, 42, stirring dark, rich compost that will amend the soil at the small farm where he and fellow inmates of the Cedar Creek Corrections Center grew 8,000 pounds of organic vegetables this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inmates of the minimum-security facility, 25 miles from Olympia, the state capital, raise bees, grow organic tomatoes and lettuce, compost 100 percent of food waste and even recycle shoe scraps that are made into playground turf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It reduces cost, reduces our damaging impact on the environment, engages inmates as students,&quot; said Eldon Vail, secretary of the Washington Department of Corrections, which oversees 15 prisons and 18,000 offenders. &quot;It's good security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comedian Rock opens for Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RALEIGH, N.C. -- Comedian and movie star Chris Rock drew about 250 people to a get-out-the-vote rally for Sen. Barack Obama on Saturday, packing jokes at Sen. John McCain's expense in a brief appearance at Shaw University in Raleigh, N.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rock, casual in jeans and white sweater, revved up the crowd by praising Obama and needling McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When John McCain was a boy,&quot; Rock said, &quot;minimum wage was two lumps of coal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rock also wondered at the number of homes owned by McCain and wife Cindy: &quot;He's been on MTV Cribs 31 times.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Obama<BR>Editor:<BR>Be careful what you wish for. In the 1930s Germany voted in a candidate for change; his name was Adolph Hitler. That didn't work out very well for them.<BR>Obama would have us walk away from Iraq with the task uncompleted, therefore inviting al-Qaida to at-tack us here at home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can be assured that one of the first priorities will be to outlaw our guns. With the Democrat majority, who will stop them? Al-Qaida would have a field day in the USA against a spineless regime and unarmed citizens. I don't know about you, but I am going to vote for the candidate who says he will win the war, not the one who says he will end it.<BR>Darral Mahaffey<BR>Carlsbad<BR><BR>Socialism<BR>Editor:<BR>I have never felt so passionately about anything in my life. This election day, I believe that if you vote for Barak Obama you will throw away everything that you have grown up believing in as the American way of life.<BR>He will bring to pass socialism. There will be no more motivation to work hard to obtain the American dream. There will be no stimulus to do so because if you do, he will take away your hard-earned dollars and give them to someone who is &quot;behind you.&quot;<BR>This brand of socialism has been evolving for a few years, even at the grade school level. Children in some schools aren't made to keep score anymore because they don't want the losers to feel inferior. They miss the point: if you feel inferior, the next time you will go out and try harder. America was built on competition. The American spirit and exceptionality. We will be nothing if we have no more incentive to compete. Just look at how the Soviet Union didn't thrive for 80-some years until capitalism was invoked in the Reagan era.<BR>Obama went to Chicago and sought out these left wing characters. They did not seek him out. He believes in the same things as William Ayers, the unrepentant domestic terrorist who bombed the Pentagon, U.S. Capitol and N.Y. police stations. Obama sat for 20 years in the church of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, who said that it was America's fault that 9/11 happened. &quot;America's chickens have come home to roost.&quot;<BR>As for me, I want a true patriot to be our president. John McCain loves our country.<BR>I haven't always believed in some of his views, but I know he loves the country and will defend us. He will carry on the true American spirit.<BR>Lord God in Heaven help us if Obama wins.<BR>This is where I must say the serenity prayer.<BR>Susan Linda Mericle<BR>Carlsbad<BR><BR>A question<BR>Editor:<BR>Would one of the Obama supporters please clarify this for me. I realize this question was put to rest months ago, yet I still find it a hurdle for me.<BR>In America, we have the right to choose which church, (read a place set aside for spiritual and moral guidance and leadership) we attend and support.<BR>If I were to attend a church where I found the word coming from the pulpit did not fit my way of thinking, I seriously doubt that I would return. Anything being said that was totally objectionable, I know I would not return.<BR>If I found myself attending the same church for six to 12 months, then evidently I must have found a place where my soul and conscience is being fed.<BR>If I attend the same church for 20 years, under the same pastor, (spiritual and moral leader), then no doubt I have become a total supporter of that church, both spiritually and probably financially, as well. I probably agree and support most ideas being taught there.<BR>How can anyone vote for a man who has for 20 years supported such a man as the extremist Rev. Wright? A man who feels the drug situation in America is a government plot to &quot;keep the black man down.&quot; A man shaking his fist at the congregation yelling &quot;God damn America.&quot;<BR>Yes, even extremists are allowed view points in America, but do we need one in the White House?<BR>And no, I wouldn't vote for a Ku Klux Klan member, either!<BR>Please, would one devout Democrat show me the error of my thinking?<BR>Rocky Riley<BR>Carlsbad<BR><BR>McCain/Palin<BR>Editor:<BR>Why are we at war in Iraq? Remember 9/11? Enemies are real, waiting for weak links in our security. Sometimes war is necessary to protect our homeland; therefore, we can either find the enemy in Iraq or elsewhere or at home.<BR>My son-in-law is in the military, having served almost nine years overseas including 12 months in Iraq, so I know some of the hardships involved in deployment.<BR>The U.S. and Iraqi forces have made significant progress bringing down violence and restoring security, but this undertaking takes time.<BR>In our American Revolution we didn't gain freedom from Britain until fighting a war several years, then taking time to establish our government.<BR>Our freedom didn't come easily, but where would we be if after being engaged in war a while our forefathers admitted defeat and disbanded?<BR>McCain and Palin want to finish the work in Iraq by providing the military with sufficient funds to supply necessary equipment for victory.<BR>Obama plans to bring troops home before finishing the war, which would admit defeat. Failure in Iraq would diminish our nation's standing in the world and make us vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Next time it could be one of your loved ones or even you here at home hit by violence.<BR>The war is costing money and lives, but terrorist attacks in N.Y. and Washington, D.C., cost money and lives, too. Sen. Biden says cutting support for war will save the lives of thousands of troops. Each year more of our people are killed from DWI and violence here than the number of our service men killed in Iraq. My sympathy to each family.<BR>Obama has voted for higher taxes, stating he will increase income taxes and other taxes, meaning less freedom.<BR>Obama supports abortion for any reason while supporting your tax dollars for it. In Illinos, he campaigned against a proposed law designed to protect infants born alive during a botched late-term abortion, see www.ObamaFactSheet.com.<BR>The McCain/Palin ticket is against abortion, believing it the murder that it is. A vote for McCain/Palin means stronger military defense to protect freedom, and lower taxes allowing more spendable income.<BR>God bless our military for keeping us safe, and may it be allowed to be strong against our enemies.<BR>Jolene Goodwin<BR>Carlsbad<BR><BR>The facts<BR>Editor:<BR>I am so tired of the negative ads based on small excerpts from the record taken out of context from the circumstances of the vote. I wish the candidates could campaign about the good things they represent instead.<BR>For example, anyone that believes that John Heaton would take money directly from nursing home patients is misinformed about the facts. New Mexico was not the first state to try to get more federal dollars for Medicaid. In fact, 33 states had already secured federal match dollars using the same principle. All non-Medicaid patients did receive tax credits. No one paid more for nursing home care except the federal government in badly needed matching funds for Medicaid. John's actions on the house floor allowed for the tax credit issues to be fixed and pave the way for the state of New Mexico to secure the federal match through the courts. This was a complex process that developed over three years that cannot be explained in a one paragraph ad. I have based these statements on research and conversations with people who were involved in the process, not shiny little cards I received in the mail. I would love to hear from anyone who was adversely affected by this.<BR>I have followed all health care issues closely over the last few years and there are few if any in Santa Fe that understand the issues better than John. I have worked in the health care industry for over 20 years and have followed John's political career very closely and have serious problems finding facts to substantiate the negative stuff I have been getting in the mail. After 12 years of dedicated service there are lots of votes and lots of issues, John has worked hard for us and has brought a lot back to our community. Please vote your conscience, but be sure to get the facts about the candidates and don't fall into the negative ad trap without first researching the facts.<BR>Danny Cross<BR>Carlsbad<BR><BR>Heaton<BR>Editor:<BR>John Heaton a &quot;political chameleon,&quot; &quot;extreme poor judgment?&quot; You must be joking! What John Heaton is Ms. Camarena writing about (Oct. 23)? Not the John Heaton who's been representing all of us, our industry, our schools, our nursing homes, our health issues, constituency problems, etc. You talk about someone who is savvy about the issues, does his homework, fights like heck to get the job done, and still maintains his cool that's the John Heaton I know. The person who goes to Washington, D.C., regularly to keep the WIPP budget whole, who can improve the permitting for the oil and gas industry, who has and can successfully work to help keep our potash industry strong, and, yes, the person who knows how to get your and my problems solved and who is so well-respected that doors open for him, calls are returned and he's able to get to the right person to help solve our problems that's the steady, sensible, dedicated, thoughtful Heaton I know.<BR>John is a conservative Democrat here at home and at the Round House. You don't get the NRA A+ endorsement for nothing! Cathrynn Brown is a nice lady, but we don't know of one leadership role she's had in our community. Before this election, I'd never even heard of her. Why would anybody want to replace an effective, dedicated legislator with a complete unknown? As a friend and neighbor of John's, I have had first-hand knowledge of his dedication and commitment to this community. It's a 24-hour-a-day job, 365 days a year for him. Heaton has been an honored public servant for 12 years, and we're lucky that we've been able to keep him working for us this long. I, along with thousands in our community, want him working for us for as long as he'll do the job.<BR>Zolene Knott<BR>Carlsbad<BR><BR>2nd Amendment<BR>Editor:<BR>This letter is to all of you who consider yourselves sportsmen and women. Whether you are Republian, Democrat, Independent or something else does not matter. What does matter is whether you value your firearm ownership rights given in the Second Amendment and your freedom to hunt and fish.<BR>There are many reasons to choose a candidate to be your representative at the local, state or national level. This single issue alone supersedes most other reasons to vote for a particular candidate, regardless of party affiliation, because of the drill-down effect it has on a free society.<BR>There are races where the candidates' positions on Second Amendment rights and your freedom to hunt and fish could not be more polarizing.<BR>In Congressional Dist. 2, Ed Tinsley has received an &quot;A&quot; rating from the National Rifle Association and their endorsement, is an NRA member and an outspoken advocate of the Second Amendment. His oppo-nent, Harry Teague, received an &quot;AQ&quot; rating from the NRA, meaning they have serious questions about his positions, and he is on record giving his negative opinion of firearm ownership. He can't have it both ways, no matter what his TV ads say. He has also been endorsed by the Brady Campaign, which wants to ban all private gun ownership.<BR>Steve Pearce and Tom Udall, running for the U.S. Senate, have public records of voting to measure them by. Udall has voted with the House crowd that wants to restrict or prevent your rights to own firearms and to hunt and fish every chance he has had. He received a &quot;C-&quot; from the NRA. Pearce is the co-vice chair of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, a supporter of Safari Club International and received an &quot;A&quot; rating from the NRA and their endorsement.<BR>Both presidential candidates also have Senate voting records that clearly identify their positions. Obama has voted every time to destroy or limit your legal rights to firearm ownership, increase taxes on ammunition, allow lawsuits against firearm manufacturers, and is a toll of environmentalist extremists who want all hunting eliminated. The NRA gives him an &quot;F&quot;! McCain has continually supported sportsmen's rights and received the endorsement from the NRA. Who do you think is going to appoint Supreme Court justices who favor your firearm and hunting rights?<BR>Herb Atkinson<BR>Roswell</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a 2004 interview Lee Rawson, candidate for State Senate, said &quot;Unfortunately, negative campaigning works, and as a result, people only hear negative things about candidates ...&quot; That is why Mr. Rawson has sent such a vicious mailer that unfairly attacks Steve Fischmann.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator McCain attacks Senator Obama about a video with Rashid Khalidi. Ironically Mr. McCain as chairman of the International Republican Institute gave $448,873 and several other grants to Khalidi's Palestine Research Center! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keep hearing McCain say that Obama doesn't have the experience. Exactly what kind of experience does McCain have?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly glad that I did not vote early. With the things we found out about Obama. The brave man that is going to sit down and talk to all the terrorist. When he was afraid to answer a simple question by a simple man. Every time they get a question they can't handle they are going to panic. How is this man going to run a country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With all this liberal media Obama is getting away with a video of him and other terrorists. I think it is totally unfair if it were McCain it would be all over the freaking place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know over the past 8 years the republicans haven't managed to get everything done, but I noticed managed to get one thing done finally. Everyone is so fed up with their failed policies and from the look of early voting they have managed to get everyone to vote. So we'll give them credit for that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama says some people will pay no tax so who will pay it for them? That means that these same people that will pay no tax will still want all the services that they want. Is this the change were suppose to get.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone with half the brain will realize that this whole Joe the plumber is absolutely ridiculous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gasoline is $2.41 in Socorro at all the gas stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't understand how people are not seeing something frightening with Barack Obama and his group of followers. With a mannequin hanging from a roof and John McCain in the chimney was terrible. If it were Barack Obama they country would've gone crazy they would have called racism just because he is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the caller who has explained socialism to me, thank you but no thanks. Australia is very socialistic. Austria is very socialistic. They are not communist. You are attempting to blur the difference between socialism and communism. Obama has extreme radical friends. An Obama White House, a Pelosi Congress, and a Reid Senate will change our freedoms forever. I think you do, let me say that again, you do understand what a Super Majority means. I feel sorry that you believe that would be good. I want the government out of my life, not running it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning they said that media has been treating McCain a lot more harshly than Obama. I myself as a democrat and staying neutral have seen that same pattern. When Clinton was going against Obama they were much harder on Clinton than they were on. Now the pattern has reversed. Maybe because he is younger or something. I don't expect this comment to be on their since it endorsed Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe the plumber doesn't care if the taxes are raised or not. He not going to pay his taxes any ways. Typical republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Okay Las Cruces post office where is my absentee ballot?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those people who hung Sarah Palin and put John McCain in flames then I am going to do an Obama one. If they don't think that's wrong or that is criminal well then I don't what it is. These are people not Halloween jokes then I'll do one and then we'll see who is really joking about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do not want to lose my social security. If McCain gets elected we will kiss it good bye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If so many people have such a problem with Aggie football I got answer for that could help you and them. Don't watch and support. They don't need negativity from those who hate. Ignore them and pretend like New Mexico State doesn't have a team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have a lot of low paying jobs in New Mexico because people are because there are so many uneducated people. If you learned to read, write add, and subtract we'd have better paying jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only reason why won't vote for Obama is he changes his mine in every single commercial. That guy has me spinning around. Yes to gun control then no to gun control. Only tax people who make over $200,000 then $200,000 now $150,000. Make up your mind!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before you vote beware that congressman Miller democrat from California is making proposals for you or your children 401K it is as investmentnews.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was reported by Albuquerque that Las Cruces has the most expensive gas in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is easy to see why McCain is losing. All he is doing is attacking Obama. No word on what he is going to do for this country. His ideas apparently he doesn't have any.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes I have to laugh at Obama' new commercial. Starring the joke Bill Richardson. Who thinks his candidate will do something. I'll be glad when he is out of office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three more days: By Tuesday, the nastiness will be giving way to high hopes, false hopes, false claims -- and, for some candidates, despair. The two-year campaign for the presidency, the House of Representatives, a third of the Senate and state offices from one end of the country to the other, at last, will be over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not before Americans are subjected to a long weekend of lies posing as gospel, as well as promises of good deeds, few of which will likely get done. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is likely to be done to one politician or another shouldn't happen to a dog -- but judging from the latest wave of filth washing over many parts of the country, this would be a good time to leave home: Go fishing. Take a long drive, with or without a destination in mind -- the car radio set to a strictly-music station ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those phone calls -- especially of the &quot;robo&quot; variety -- as well as the broadcast commercials and junk mail of the trashiest kind, as Election Day approaches, could make a misanthrope of the most humanitarian soul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They've already turned the editorial &quot;us&quot; against someone we once admired: Liddy Dole, a former consumer advocate, Cabinet member, Red Cross reformer, a long-running class act and now a senator from North Carolina, has launched a vicious commercial against the Democrat challenging her for re-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kay Hagan happened to attend a fundraiser last month in Boston. Its co-hosts included people associated with a group called Godless Americans PAC. Among its aims are getting &quot;In God We Trust&quot; off our country's money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hagan's people say she got no money from that PAC; only some from one of the co-hosts. Yet the commercial portrays Hagan as a skulking Satanist, and ends with a woman's voice -- Dole would like viewers to believe it's Hagan's -- saying &quot;There is no God!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth is, Hagan is a longtime church elder and Sunday-school teacher. Her real sin, it appears, is running against someone who, to win, would stoop to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gutter tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And like attacks on Barack Obama, this one carries a sick implication: Only Christians need apply for public office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New Mexico, the leader of the Republican Women of Otero County sent out letters calling Sen. Obama a &quot;Muslim socialist&quot; and adding that she believes &quot;Muslims are our enemies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a pretty sweeping remark, even apart from the fact that Obama is a Christian: Last we looked, there was still freedom of religion in this country -- and what's wrong with being Muslim? That question also entered our minds when John McCain, supposedly in Obama's defense, corrected a female supporter who call Obama a &quot;Muslim&quot; by saying no, his opponent is a decent family man -- as if there were no such thing as decent Muslim family men. Such has been the level of discourse in this long contest ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In California, notes columnist Patt Morrison of the Los Angeles Times, interest groups are on the lookout for road rage involving bumper stickers. For our part, we wonder how quickly some of those stickers will disappear Wednesday from cars advertising losing candidates or causes -- and how many will remain for months, maybe years, proclaiming motorists to be proud supporters of the winners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet alongside the hate mail and vicious commercials, run-of-the-mill stickers are at most mild irritants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for yard signs, some are likely to become collectors' items, as Case Crenshaw of Chimay&oacute; is discovering: He makes signs for a living -- and the &quot;Obamanos&quot; ones he's been making and selling at near his cost have raised suspicions that they've been pulled from supporters' property. Win or lose, they'll be keepers here in el norte. So, too, perhaps, the McCain/Palin signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which will have the staying power of &quot;Win with Willkie?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We wish you the sanest weekend possible ...</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">445 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following editorial appeared in Friday's Washington Post:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the presidential campaign clock ticking down, Sen. John McCain has suddenly discovered a new boogeyman to link to Sen. Barack Obama: a sometimes controversial but widely respected Middle East scholar named Rashid Khalidi. In the past couple of days, McCain and his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, have likened Khalidi, the director of a Middle East institute at Columbia University, to neo-Nazis; called him &quot;a PLO spokesman&quot;; and suggested that the Los Angeles Times is hiding something sinister by refusing to release a videotape of a 2003 dinner in honor of Khalidi at which Obama spoke. McCain even threw former Weatherman Bill Ayers into the mix, suggesting that the tape might reveal that Ayers   a terrorist-turned-professor who also has been an Obama acquaintance   was at the dinner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the record, Khalidi is an American born in New York who graduated from Yale a couple of years after George W. Bush. For much of his long academic career, he taught at the University of Chicago, where he and his wife became friends with Barack and Michelle Obama. In the early 1990s, he worked as an adviser to the Palestinian delegation at peace talks in Madrid and Washington sponsored by the first Bush administration. We don't agree with a lot of what Khalidi has had to say about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict over the years, and Obama has made clear that he doesn't, either. But to compare the professor to neo-Nazis   or even to Ayers   is a vile smear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's fair to question why Obama felt as comfortable as he apparently did during his Chicago days in the company of men whose views diverge sharply from what the presidential candidate espouses. Our sense is that Obama is a man of considerable intellectual curiosity who can hear out a smart, if militant, advocate for the Palestinians without compromising his own position. To suggest, as McCain has, that there is something reprehensible about associating with Khalidi is itself condemnable   especially during a campaign in which Arab ancestry has been the subject of insults. To further argue that the Times, which obtained the tape from a source in exchange for a promise not to publicly release it, is trying to hide something is simply ludicrous, as McCain surely knows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which reminds us: We did ask Khalidi whether he wanted to respond to the campaign charges against him. He answered, via e-mail, that &quot;I will stick to my policy of letting this idiot wind blow over.&quot; That's good advice for anyone still listening to the McCain campaign's increasingly reckless ad hominem attacks. Sadly, that wind is likely to keep blowing for four more days. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voting for McCain is like rooting for Aggie football. You're pretty hopeful, but you're still going to lose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Come on, New Mexico, vote for the underdog, Sen. McCain. He is pro-immigration. He cannot help what the Bush Administration did. He has always been a friend to Hispanics. He loves the West. Do not let this election be bought by Sen. Obama. Sen. McCain is on New Mexico's side. A real patriot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can anybody explain why once again the price of gasoline is so high here the great state of New Mexico   an oil producing state? The price of gasoline in Des Moines, Iowa, is $1.97 per gallon. And, please, do not tell me it's high taxes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leonard Lee Rawson has a mailer that says building a private road for himself &quot;is a complicated community issue, not straightforward and easy to warp and distort.&quot; I think someone is being dishonest to his constituents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kent Evans has had his campaign financed by big oil. They have given him over $40,000 so far, and more could be on the way. I guess they feel they can buy him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I guess last night I found out how much Obama loves money. His $6 million commercial was amazing, like a true president. $6 million, wow, what could the world do with that? Perhaps buy a commercial. While so many are losing homes and jobs, he makes a commercial. He truly cares. He made a commercial. While a Sarah Palin puppet is hung as a joke in California and told she is stupid and how can someone spend $150,000 on a shopping spree; Obama made a commercial. I was a supporter, but I am not that far left. Loved that commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Get over it, Steve Fischmann. Lee Rawson is not a corrupt man. He has represented us for a long time and helped grow our area into a world-class place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's the point of taking on educational, business debt or working 70 hours a week if Americans are forced to be at the same level as those not taking on that time, sacrifice and debt and who work 40 or less hours a week? We want to continue penalizing and vilifying our innovators and the more ambitious? We give our children the message that it is OK and more rewarding to be mediocre at best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the crosses lawsuit finally ending; The bad news: The City of Las Cruces and the LCPS will never get back all the money spent on defending themselves over this idiotic &quot;case.&quot; The good news: Weinbaum's 15 minutes of fame are up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters should know that Representative Barney Frank (D-Mass) has publicly announced Democratic plans to cut defense spending by 25 percent as soon as they get control of congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Obama would kill his own grandchild, what makes you think he will care about yours?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good Morning America showed million-dollar homes selling in Orlando, Fla., for $500,000 including great lawns, swimming pool, two-stories. Compare that with Las Cruces homes selling in the $600,000-$700,000 and up range. They're nice but not that nice. The homes here are totally overpriced. There's not even a Disney World here. People here are unrealistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Magee, what you and other Democrats should be concerned with is the fact that you've gone &quot;ga-ga&quot; over somebody whose past is mostly a big question mark. The little we do know about Obama is shady, at best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday, 7:45 a.m., Picacho Avenue at Motel Boulevard. I'm stopped in the eastbound right-turn lane for a light that was has just changed, but is very RED. Small pickup in right driving lane that was several car lengths behind me when light changed speeds up and blatantly runs red light at a speed well over the limit. Truck nearly rear-ends another truck on other side of intersection that has just made a safe right turn on red. Driver slams on brakes and violently swerves into left lane to avoid collision. Do&ntilde;a Ana County Deputy is first in line on northbound Motel Boulevard; takes no action. And we wonder why we have a red light problem?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Kennedy's most inspiring words: &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.&quot; Today's constant push by Democrats for expanded assistance programs, including tax credits, flies in the face of these inspiring words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tinsley has experience in Washington to get things done for Do&ntilde;a Ana. There will be the low-seniority representatives from New Mexico in the next Congress. We need someone who already knows the lay of the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am done with the local newspapers and all of the liberal mainstream television media. The media has done an injustice to all of America. I voted for McCain and against the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If democracy requires an educated citizenry, this country is in deep trouble. For example, Joe the Prevaricator and his followers keep showing their ignorance by referring to Obama as a socialist, obviously with no idea of the meaning of the term. Socialism is a political and economic system by which the government owns and administers the production and distribution of goods. Obama has never advocated such a system. He simply wants to make the progressive tax system we have more equitable. So please, folks, for the sake of our democracy, educate yourselves!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can't believe Joe Biden messed up again. Now they are going down to $150,000 then a $100,000 middle class. They are sure changing their story. People keep slamming Palin for slamming the democrat. Well, she should, she needs to stand up for them. He is a jerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like for McCain to talk about the economy and what he intends to do if he becomes president   instead of so many attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My daughter in Oklahoma City called me and said that the prices of gas $1.97. Why are prices still so high?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am boycotting this liberal news crap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you want change don't vote Democrat! They are getting nuts; spending more money on these 30 minute commercials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain is wrong on the war, wrong on the economy, and wrong with his presidential pick. No more John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People of New Mexico, we need to look back at the last 48 years. Base your choice on that. Research this stuff and choose the right thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the people voting for Obama think that they are not going to have anything taken from them. They think they are going to get something. But if you think your exempt from an Obama tax increase, I dare you to think again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party is not the party I use to know. They have become very bitter; that's why I am leaving it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI   John McCain charged that Barack Obama lacks &quot;what it takes to protect America from terrorists&quot; Wednesday as he sought to shift attention away from the economy in the final week of the race for the White House. Obama cast his rival as a threat to the middle class, and readied a 30-minute prime-time commercial at a cost of millions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who has led in the polls for weeks, toughened his rhetoric as Republicans and even some Democrats said the race to pick the next president was tightening somewhat nationally and in some battleground states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Associated Press-GfK polls taken within the past several days showed Obama ahead in four states that supported President Bush in 2004 and essentially even with McCain in two others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A separate survey suggested even McCain's home state of Arizona was not safely in his column. And while it is unusual for candidates to acknowledge the possibility of defeat, Republican running mate Sarah Palin said she intended to remain a national figure even if the ticket loses next week. &quot;I'm not doin' this for naught,&quot; she told ABC News in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Senator McCain is elected, 100 million Americans will not get a tax cut ... your health care benefits will get taxed for the first time in history ... we'll have another president who wants to privatize part of your Social Security,&quot; Obama said in Raleigh, N.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Carolina is one of the states he hopes will deliver him a sizable victory next Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His appearance was prelude to a costly campaign-closing commercial. Obama bought time on CBS, NBC and Fox for $1 million per network for the 30-minute commercial. He also bought time for it on Univision, BET, MSNBC and TV One.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign officials said a portion of the commercial would include a live appearance of Obama addressing a rally in Kissimmee, Fla., and the rest would consist of videotaped segments showing him chatting with voters about a variety of issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain sought to blunt Obama's campaign-closing pitch, lacking the funds to match it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's got a few things he wants to sell you: He's offering government-run health care ... an energy plan guaranteed to work without drilling ... and an automatic wealth spreader that folds neatly and fits under any bed,&quot; McCain said in remarks prepared for delivery in Riviera Beach, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day, McCain assembled a group of former military officers and other national security advisers before criticizing Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question is whether this is a man who has what it takes to protect America from Osama bin Laden, al-Qaida and the other great threats in the world,&quot; he said of Obama. &quot;He has given no reason to answer in the affirmative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the campaign, former Democratic rival Hillary Rodham Clinton as well as McCain sought to raise doubts about Obama's relatively thin resume on foreign policy and national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, Obama traveled last summer to Iraq, Afghanistan and Europe, where he met with world leaders. Later, he tapped Sen. Joseph Biden, who has long experience in foreign policy, as his vice presidential running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, he won an endorsement from former Secretary of State Colin Powell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversely, McCain has slumped in the polls as the economic crisis has unfolded in the past several weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters Wednesday, he said the economic meltdown, while serious, was temporary, and the nation would emerge stronger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides Obama, he criticized the Democratic leaders of Congress, who hope to command larger majorities in the new House and Senate than they do now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're getting only a glimpse of what one-party rule will look like,&quot; he said, predicting deep cuts in defense spending and efforts to shrink America's role in the world if Democrats take over the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let there be no confusion about the threats we face,&quot; said McCain. &quot;I've had to make some defining choices along the way,&quot; he added in what seemed to be a reference to his time in the Navy, more than five years of which were spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By any available survey, the economy trumps the war in Iraq and national security issues in the campaign's final days, and McCain fares better on foreign policy matchups than on pocketbook issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With only six days to go until the presidential election, we've already been privy to the most intimate details about the candidates. From their favorite TV shows -- John McCain likes 24 and Barack Obama watches ESPN's SportsCenter -- to their music -- McCain prefers ABBA and Obama is fond of Miles Davis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So maybe it's time to know something else about these men -- like where they stand on the issue of obesity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, we already know that when it comes to food, McCain's sweet tooth tends toward doughnuts and Obama likes pumpkin pie. But how do they feel about regulating television commercials that try to hawk sugary snacks to kids?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is exactly the kind of information that the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity wants to know. They advocate pushing healthy food to low-income children; requiring restaurants to label their menus; and making fast-food places like McDonald's serve smaller portions along with cutting the amount of fat, salt and sugar in their meals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, though, their fight against corporate America isn't going too well. Just listen to what the new CEO of Coca-Cola said last week: &quot;People need to understand that obesity is not about a beverage or a candy bar or a restaurant meal or a PlayStation game or about working longer hours,&quot; Muhtar Kent said. &quot;It's a systematic lifestyle issue that we must address individually and collectively as a society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Umm. Excuse me, Mr. Kent. Not to be a noodge, but I think you have inadvertently given us the definition of an obesity-causing lifestyle while trying not to talk about an obesity-causing lifestyle. Oops!)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been more success in Australia, where recently food and drink manufacturers agreed not to advertise junk food during children's television programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will America follow suit? It's impossible to tell when looking solely at the policies put forth this election year by the political parties. Both party platforms are light on the mention of the obesity epidemic and vague about their intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic National Committee's platform, &quot;Renewing America's Promise&quot; -- which sounds sort of like a feminine-product slogan -- only mentions obesity three times. Two of those times, it's just a part of a longer list of other chronic illnesses. The third mention, in its entirety, is as follows: &quot;As childhood obesity rates have more than doubled in the last 30 years, we will work to ensure healthy environments in our schools.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yeah, I know it's not much. But it was enough to get some groups really excited, since it was the first time any major political party had mentioned the obesity epidemic in a platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Morgan Downey, executive vice president of the Obesity Society, &quot;It is particularly significant that the Committee demonstrated its understanding of the wide-ranging impact of obesity by referring to it repeatedly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His enthusiasm seems over the top to me. But I guess it's kind of like when you're 12 and the boy you have a crush on says your name, even if he's only telling you to move out the way. You know it means so much more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;2008 Republican Platform&quot; calls &quot;for a national grassroots campaign against obesity, especially among children.&quot; None of the obesity-prevention groups got too excited about that mention since it is the only one in more than 60 pages. And the &quot;grassroots&quot; part means that any prevention tactics will have to be started by a community, not the government -- which is exactly what we have now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now we know what the parties have to say -- but what about the candidates themselves?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in May, when Hillary Clinton was still finishing up the last dregs of her presidential run, The Washington Post asked all three candidates this question: As president, how would you make the issue of childhood obesity a national health priority?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton went on a point-by-point attack, outlining her pledge &quot;to ban junk food in schools by requiring all schools that participate in the school lunch or breakfast programs to make available only foods that meet or surpass (U.S.D.A) nutrition standards.&quot; She also promised &quot;to make the school breakfast program universal for all students in low-income communities and to double the summer feeding program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, both McCain and Obama went with the vague-is-better approach. Obama said he &quot;would convene a high-level task force (for) regularly examining federal budgets, policies and programs.&quot; And McCain said, &quot;We must do a better job of teaching children and their parents about child health, nutrition and exercise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given these answers, I think there is only one candidate who, come Nov. 4, all of us interested in the obesity issue should vote for ... if only she were still running.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIALS; Pg. A-7</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">473 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talk about money to burn: Tonight the Barack Obama campaign presents a half-hour &quot;infomercial&quot; on three television networks -- 30 minutes more than many Americans might want in a single sitting about the person increasingly likely to be our next president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Obama and Republican candidate John McCain have run some effective half-minute commercials, McCain's appearing with less frequency as his fund-raising appeal is fading and his public-financed budget of $84 million is a trifle alongside the Democratic champion's $150 million during September alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So after three ho-hum debates and countless &quot;town hall&quot; events by both parties' presidential and vice-presidential candidates in battleground states, Obama is spending scads of money selling -- or over-selling -- himself?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His fans will love it. The show is certain to help validate all the phone-banking and door-to-dooring so many people have done on the Illinois senator's behalf. But barring something spectacular -- the candidate canning 10 three-pointers in a row? Reciting the Bill of Rights backwards? A two-minute sprint from the Capitol to the White House? -- how many undecided voters will keep their remotes tuned to Obama and make their decision by station-break time?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, John F. Kennedy did lengthy commercials. But so did Ross Perot. Somehow, we can't help thinking there are better things Obama could do with his money -- besides massive advertising in this paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyering up, for example. If recent presidential elections are any indication, the next few days will be full of dirty tricks:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">u Spurious challenges to voters in the poor parts of major cities, where the masses are pinning their hopes on the man from the south side of Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">u Attempts at intimidating folks by telling 'em sheriffs, bill-collectors, la migra and others lie in wait at the polls, ready to pounce on 'em for daring to exercise their rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">u Fraudulent procedures aimed at spoiling ballots -- or miscounting them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both camps, by now, must have armies of poll-watchers organized against mischief by the opposition. But ever since the Bush campaign sent a flying squad of suits into Florida to render that state's already-faulty 2000 election system totally chaotic, Democrats have been on notice: Fight lawyers with lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some might show up out of dedication to party principles; others might heed the advice so often issued smilingly by the late legendary law prof Walter Henry Edward Jaeger of Georgetown: Get the fee first!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter-registration fraud, real and imagined, could prompt people to toss monkey wrenches into the works. Cool legal minds, not hotheads from the vested interests, might be badly needed in many parts of the country to sort out valid claims from the merely vehement ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, to our minds, is where Obama could better invest his embarrassment of riches.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think everything at the shelter is &quot;black and white&quot;. And I've been there. I've volunteered many, many hours walking dogs and I fostered once, but while my 15 yr old dog is still around I decided it was too hard on her. But, to the point, I realize the space limitations at the shelter. But the cat was brought in in a crate. And you cannot tell me a 25 lb cat is &quot;too aggressive to handle&quot;. Please. A cat that fat could've gone 72 hours without being fed, without being handled at all, while giving the owner's a CHANCE for God's sake, to claim their beloved pet. It was a horrible decision and no matter what, I should not have happened. It was WRONG. 72 hours. That's it. 72 hours and that cat would've been back home where it was loved. 72 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I saw Leonard Lee Rawson's costly TV ad for his State Senate campaign based on &quot;integrity.&quot; How come he did not mention the $111,000 of state money that he used to build a road for his own personal business. Where is his integrity? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past Leonard Lee Rawson has always arrogantly opposed election reform to minimize voting fraud. Now that Mr. Rawson is challenged by an outstanding opponent he cries wolf and falsely raises the specter of voting fraud!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I guess Mr. Weinbaum &amp; Mr. Boyd are going to have to move on to somewhere like San Antonio, San Fransisco, St. Paul or maybe Los Angeles &amp; take those cities to court for having the audacity to offend them with city names that have &quot;Christian&quot; connotations. Those men are very self absorbed to be so petty about something that 99.9% of Las Cruces (and America) is OK with! All the time &amp; money spent could've gone a long way towards helping homeless people &amp; animals in Las Cruces, but hey, why waste your precious time helping a few when you can use it to get under the skin of everybody!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I just read that Leonard Rawson says he supports term limits to improve the integrity of the State Legislature. So can someone explain why is he running for his fifth term after 16 years in the State Senate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a sad commentary on the decline of American democracy when ten days before a presidential election &quot;journalists&quot; are gossiping about Sarah Palin's wardrobe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Obama is elected president, on November 5th I'm going to take all my money out of the bank and stuff it under my mattress. I would rather the local thieves get it than those pirates on the ship of fools we call congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer from an [enthusiastic] Obama supporter: Yes. I paid into SS at age 15, and maintained continuous employment with at least one job for 44 years. I was never fired, never drew unemployment or welfare, always paid all my taxes, voted, was never arrested, had no children out of wedlock, did not contract AIDs, have an established work ethic, morality and love for humanity, respect for the military, and I believe in God. And I'm purely sick of Republicans questioning any aspect of my life; who do they think they are?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vote against the unfair bond proposals! The hard-pressed New Mexican taxpayers should not be saddled with additional property taxes when funds are available from the State Land Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A caller asked why County Manager Haines would allow commissioners to travelto Hawaii for conventions. The reason is that Mr. Haines is and has been in the pockets of several county commissioners for years. That's the way he keeps his job - by doing favors for commissioners and looking the other way when improprieties happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edward Tinsley III has shown no compassion for his ranch workers. When a ranch worker, who worked and lived as part of his compensation on his El Capitan ranch, injured his back and had surgery, Mr. Tinsley gave him 30 days to get off his property. Nice guy!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Hays' article about his adoration for Obama proves that a Ph.D doesn't amount to much. Obama is an actor, a fraud. Where are his birth documents? He's not even qualified to be a candidate for the presidency. Your credentials and his are bogus, Mr. Hays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I try to stay independent and have supported Susana Martinez for District Attorney. Today I received a political mailer where Ms. Martinez wholeheartedly supports the National Restaurant Association candidate Tinsley. Ms. Martinez - that is a mistake. You lost my future support!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To all volunteers and workers who put on the flu shot clinic at MMC: You folks did a terrific job of organizing and implementing an event to serve such large numbers of people. As first year residents of Las Cruces, we were amazed at how convenient and rapid the process was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some gurus in Congress are reportedly discussing the forced transfer of 401K's to the Social Security fund. You know that place they have stolen dry and now full of IOU's. Would you Einstein's out there explain why a &quot;super majority&quot; of these confessed socialists is a good thing? Oh that's right, change, I keep forgetting. Outside of change what other atrocities does this new vision include? A veto proof Congress controlled by visionaries that hate America, as in any money you may have but not their own wealth belongs to others. Joe the Plumber got the spoken word out of Obama. Redistribute the wealth. Gosh, that sounds like communism to me. A partially complete one term Senator is qualified to be President because? Oh, I keep forgetting, change. How did he afford those expensive colleges and extensive trips to distant parts of the world? Why are his college transcript kept secret. Who donates money to his campaign? Too many secrets, too little experience, too little explanation of what change means, and I know more about Joe the Plumber than about Senator Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Aggie football team just lost to Idaho, possibly the worst Division I-A team in the nation. I wish I could have someone drive me around in a golf cart and get paid six figures a year to do nothing like Coach Mumme. People at NM State and in the community of Las Cruces are the bigger fools for letting him make NM State football even more of a joke than it already was before he got here. I have no idea how people around here can say that Mumme is doing a good job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citizens of Dona Ana beware. The commissioners are trying to get another tax approval to help fund a joke of a proposal by the Detention Center Director. It is not a good idea and we do not need any more taxes during these hard times. Wake up Commissioners. You are way too gullible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September eleventh two thousand and one four American commercial airplanes were used as weapons. Hijacked by fanatic Muslims. Thousands of innocent people were murdered. Can this be forgotten and dismissed so easily? A Presidential candidate with associations to domestic terrorist could receive fifty percent of the vote in November. Are you out of your minds? Those that keep calling the war in Iraq unjust or unnecessary, or Bush's War, you must have better intelligence than the governments of the World? What gives you the audacity to suggest we sacrificed our most precious gift, the blood of our sons and daughters for a family grudge? There are National Secrets for a reason. I trust my Executive Branch more than any recent Legislative Branch or off the wall decisions by the Judicial Branch. The Iraq Government is retaking their country and is asking, quietly, for us to go home. What has the media reported about Iraq in the last year or so? Zilch, squat, nothing. It does not fit their agenda. Defeat is what they wanted. Defeat is what they should get. Defeat Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, Chuck Schumer, Barney Frank, Ted Kennedy, and you get the picture? Let the advertisers of Network TV know you will not buy their products if they continue to sponsor this garbage. You have power. Learn how to use it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want to thank Ashley Meeks for the wonderful item she had in the Sun News this morning (Sunday) on McCain's visit to Las Cruces. It was well written and not lopsided like most I have read lately or heard on TV. I do not believe what Sarah Palin wears, uses on her face, has any bearing on whether she will make a good Vice-President? There have been times while in a store during a hot summer day I wish more people would use ANY kind of soap, not only to keep their bodies clean, but also their mouth!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Losing the middle class isn't such a tragedy. We then don't have to pay taxes yet we still get stimulus checks, free education, medical, legal, welfare, food stamps, food pantries and kitchens, subsidized housing or keeping our houses, free clothing and winter coats, help with our utility bills and our children get free breakfasts and lunches... As long as there are the rich and taxes we will be provided for. America has a big heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anyone votes for McCain they should expect more economic problems in the future. He doesn't know the difference between capitalism, socialism and Supply-side economics! Governor Palin is totally clueless! Ignorance abounds!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Brian Haines in control of the commissioners expense account? Kent Evans collects 800.00 dollars a month from the taxpayers for travel, food, and tips. One would think that as manager of the budget,Haines would have control of expenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last time I checked quality journalism involved unbiased reporting. Today I received my newspaper with a sticker covering McCain's head, this coupled with the article for the endorsement for obama violates the foundation upon which journalism is based. The sun-news has lost all credibility and is a sad excuse for a newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain described himself as a &quot;proud deregulator.&quot; Deregulation takes the responsibility of oversight from an entity with accountability and transfers it to another where there is neither openness nor accountability like the financial institutions that created our economic woes. A vote for McCain is one for a depression!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin spending so much money on her clothes proves that she is a snob. Snobs don't relate to the people. Anyway, at 250,000 dollars a year income she is not &quot;one of us&quot; as she would like to pretend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am writing in reference to your coverage on the Gadsden High School Volleyball team. I am a recent GHS volleyball player myself and it really angers me that the media does not give the team the credit that they not only deserve, but have rightfully earned. The Gadsden Volleyball team is currently 6-0, in district, and holds first place in one of the toughest districts in the state! Not only that, but also this is the first time in the school history that Gadsden gets to host the tournament! If that is not news worthy, I do not know what is. I understand that we are not a Las Cruces school, but we are part of your district, we deserve the same coverage, as you would give to Mayfield or Las Cruces if they were in first! Gadsden has an amazing volleyball team and it is about time they get some recognition!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign cuts off WFTV after interview with Joe Biden. Is the kind of actions we want from a future president? I for one truly hope not!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powerful House Democrats are eyeing proposals to overhaul the nation's $3 trillion 401(k) system, including the elimination of most of the $80 billion in annual tax breaks that 401(k) investors receive. Is this the &quot;change&quot; we need</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, Oct. 25 at 5:15 A.M., while driving on Hwy 28 at San Miguel, Las Cruces police department unit #202 K-9 (as stated on the rear passenger side bumper) passed me as I headed north on Hwy 28. This patrol unit, with no emergency lights or sirens and obviously outside his jurisdiction, was traveling at a fast rate of speed. I decided to pace his speed and I reached a speed of 80 mph. This unit continued at this speed until it reached the town of Mesilla when it slowed down. Once again here, a perfect example of the aledged &quot;Las Cruces Finest&quot; acting as if they are above the law. I figure this particular public servant did not read or heard about the 10 year old child killed in the Dallas area by a speeding reckless policeman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hey ABC, CBS, and NBC - how about taking a reporteraway from Alaska and Joe the Plumber's driveway and giving us an update on Iraq? What our military has accomplished thereover the past few monthsis quite impressive, but maybe that's why there's no more news from Iraq in the mainstream media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's high noon on Sunday, and I just drove passed many runners in the Rio Grande Marathon on Valley Road as they struggled to reach the finish line, mouths gasping for air. If Obama wins and he nationalizes health care, does that mean I get to help pay for all thier knee replacement surgeries?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hey, Sun-News Circulation Department...it's been six weeks since I signed up for your Sunday home delievry promotion. I never received it on two of the Sundays, I had to call and report non-deliverery on two other Sundays, and someone actually managed to deliver the newspaper on the other two. And your circulation manager never returned any of my telephone calls. Is this what passes for acceptable service at the Sun-News? I'm guessing you'll bury this Sound-Off</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After voting at the Taj Mahal the other day, I noticed all of the open space there. Put the excess animals at the shelter there. Stack cat cages in the long halls. A few pit bulls in the conference rooms would look good. Don't forget to put some goats in Kent Evans' office. A playful kitten at the reception desk would be an improvement. Maybe then some ding dong will get the message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The headline reads, &quot;Early voting offers New Mexicans an opportunity&quot;. Yeah, an opportunity to get your vote counted for a change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those pictures of John McCain on the Mesilla Plaza are the best of him yet during his campaign. He looks relaxed and happy compared to the other states he was in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we have the choice of having others' wealth being redistributed to us or having our income being redistributed to others what will be our choice? What if all Americans realize this and quit achieving?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our teachers, grandparents and parents were wrong encouraging us that hard work, education and delaying gratification would pay off. It only guarantees student loan debt, business loan debt, a higher tax bracket for us and redistribution of what we have earned to strangers who didn't incur these. The underachievers in our class have had the last laugh.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON   Republican John McCain declared &quot;I'm going to win it,&quot; dismissing polls showing him behind with little more than a week to go in the presidential race. A confident Democrat Barack Obama drew a jaw-dropping 100,000 people to a Denver rally and rolled out a new TV ad asserting his rival is &quot;running out of time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heading into the final nine days of the 2008 contest, the White House competitors campaigned in key battlegrounds that President Bush won four years ago as the state-by-state Electoral College map tilts strongly in Obama's favor. Democrats and Republicans alike say it will be extraordinarily difficult for McCain to change the trajectory of the campaign before the Nov. 4 election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, I think John McCain might be added to that long list of Arizonans who ran for president but were never elected,&quot; McCain's fellow senator from Arizona, Republican Jon Kyl, told the Arizona Daily Star editorial board in an interview published Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates sparred from a distance, each criticizing the other anew in hopes of swaying the roughly one-fourth of voters who are undecided or could still change their minds. The campaign trail images and rhetoric said perhaps more about the state of the race than any poll could.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Colorado, Obama reveled in his largest U.S. crowd to date, with local police estimating that &quot;well over&quot; 100,000 people packed Denver's Civic Center Park and stretched even to the distant steps of the state Capitol. The enthusiastic sea of people prompted a &quot;goodness gracious&quot; from Obama as he took the stage. Another enormous swarm greeted him in Fort Collins later on the perhaps aptly named Colorado State University lawn; it's known as &quot;The Oval.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At each rambunctious stop Obama portrayed McCain as more of the same, saying, &quot;For eight years, we've seen the Bush-McCain philosophy put our country on the wrong track, and we cannot have another four years that look just like the last eight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Cedar Falls, Iowa, McCain campaigned before a much smaller audience and chided his Democratic rival: &quot;He's measuring the drapes. ... I prefer to let voters have their say. What America needs now is someone who will finish the race before starting the victory lap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; McCain cast Obama as too liberal for a right-of-center country, saying, &quot;He started out in the left-hand lane of American politics and has remained there.&quot; In appearances, McCain hit that same theme, accusing Obama of wanting to raise taxes and boost spending in tough economic times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is working to solidify his lead in national and key state surveys, while McCain is looking for a comeback in a political environment that has become increasingly favorable for Democrats and challenging for Republicans as the global economic crisis dominates the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In coming days, both candidates will focus primarily on Bush-won, vote-rich battlegrounds like Ohio and Florida, which decided the last two presidential elections and could do so again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania is the only state that Democrat John Kerry won four years ago that both candidates are expected to visit before Election Day. With 21 electoral votes, it hasn't voted for a Republican president since 1988, but McCain is aggressively courting white, working-class voters who overwhelmingly chose Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in the primary over Obama, who would become the country's first black president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign was exuding optimism though leaving nothing to chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrat hit McCain with the fresh ad, to air on national cable stations, that says he has &quot;no plan to lift our economy up&quot; and, thus, is tearing down Obama with &quot;scare tactics and smears.&quot; It says McCain is &quot;out of ideas, out of touch, and running out of time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illinois senator was spending the next four days in Bush-won Ohio, Virginia, North Carolina and Florida, with a quick stop in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides say Obama will lay out his closing argument in a speech Monday in Canton, Ohio. Behind the scenes, advisers were preparing the 30-minute advertisement he planned to air Wednesday on national TV networks as part of that last pitch, and also were mapping the transition to the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain was trying to stay focused on his uphill battle amid new distractions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past few days, there has been finger-pointing inside the GOP over who is to blame for McCain's struggles; reports of friction between his top advisers and aides for running mate Sarah Palin; and the continued fallout of the Republican National Committee's $150,000 purchase of high-end clothing for the Alaska governor and her family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, McCain appeared undeterred in Iowa, where public surveys show Obama comfortably leading. He also campaigned in the toss-up state of Ohio, followed by Pennsylvania on Monday, where Obama has the advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the TV interview, McCain said of the race, &quot;We're going to win it, and it's going to be tight, and we're going to be up late&quot; on election night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dismissed the Palin wardrobe flap and said many of the clothing items were immediately returned. Aides said that was for a variety of reasons, including the wrong sizes, and said the rest will be donated to charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't defend her. I praise her. She is exactly what Washington needs,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also worked anew to distance himself from the unpopular Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact is I am not George Bush. The fact is I was not popular in my own party,&quot; McCain said. Then, he added: &quot;Do we share a common philosophy of the Republican Party? Of course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama pounced on that comment, telling his Denver audience, &quot;I guess that was John McCain finally giving us a little straight talk, and owning up to the fact that he and George Bush actually have a whole lot in common.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that Bush already has cast his vote for McCain and said, &quot;We're not going to let George Bush pass the torch to John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past few days, there has been finger-pointing inside the GOP over who is to blame for McCain's struggles; reports of friction between his top advisers and aides for running mate Sarah Palin; and the continued fallout of the Republican National Committee's $150,000 purchase of high-end clothing for the Alaska governor and her family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, McCain appeared undeterred in Iowa, where public surveys show Obama comfortably leading. He also campaigned in the toss-up state of Ohio, followed by Pennsylvania on Monday, where Obama has the advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the TV interview, McCain said of the race, &quot;We're going to win it, and it's going to be tight, and we're going to be up late&quot; on election night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dismissed the Palin wardrobe flap and said many of the clothing items were immediately returned. Aides said that was for a variety of reasons, including the wrong sizes, and said the rest will be donated to charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't defend her. I praise her. She is exactly what Washington needs,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also worked anew to distance himself from the unpopular Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact is I am not George Bush. The fact is I was not popular in my own party,&quot; McCain said. Then, he added: &quot;Do we share a common philosophy of the Republican Party? Of course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama pounced on that comment, telling his Denver audience, &quot;I guess that was John McCain finally giving us a little straight talk, and owning up to the fact that he and George Bush actually have a whole lot in common.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that Bush already has cast his vote for McCain and said, &quot;We're not going to let George Bush pass the torch to John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER -- Sen. John McCain opened a fresh line of attack against his presidential rival in Colorado on Friday, saying Sen. Barack Obama's election would give Democrats unchecked authority over the nation's purse strings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The answer to a slowing economy is not higher taxes, but that's exactly what's going to happen when the Democrats have total control of Washington,&quot; he warned, while also taking a swipe at Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., for suggesting taxes and spending may need to be increased to deal with the nation's economic crisis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When he says that, quote, there are, quote, 'a lot of very rich people out there whom we can tax,' it's safe to assume that means you,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spent the day in Denver, Colorado Springs and Durango, campaigning in a traditionally Republican state where Obama is leading in the polls and has been flooding the airwaves with advertisements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain was accompanied by John Elway, a former Denver Bronco quarterback legendary for fourth-quarter heroics, who told the Denver crowd he &quot;knows a thing or two about comebacks&quot; and expressed confidence McCain would defy predictions he will go down to defeat here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judging from his speech Friday morning, McCain plans to keep hammering away at Obama on taxes, spending and the question of whether he is ready to become commander in chief, the subject of a McCain campaign ad released Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Obama said yesterday that if you want to know how he would respond in a crisis, look what he's done during his campaign,&quot; McCain said. &quot;But we've seen the wrong response from him over and over during this campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain noted Obama &quot;opposed the surge strategy that is bringing us victory in Iraq and will bring us victory in Afghanistan,&quot; continuing: &quot;He said he would sit down unconditionally with the world's worst dictators. When Russia invaded Georgia, Senator Obama said the invaded country should show restraint. He's been wrong on all of these.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP nominee also picked up on new reports of rising foreclosures to sharpen his critique of the administration and Congress for not moving fast enough to help struggling homeowners. McCain wants the federal government to spend up to $300 billion to buy bad mortgages and give homeowners a break, and on Friday morning, he appeared to refer to reports that the federal government may start guaranteeing home mortgages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who was off the campaign trail Friday visiting his ailing grandmother in Hawaii, has worked to deflect his rival's attacks, insisting that in his administration taxes would go up only for people making more than $250,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police: Volunteer lied about attack</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PITTSBURGH -- A McCain campaign volunteer made up a story of being robbed, pinned to the ground and having the letter &quot;B&quot; scratched on her face in what she had said was a politically inspired attack, police said Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashley Todd, 20-year-old college student from College Station, Texas, admitted Friday that the story was false, said Maurita Bryant, the assistant chief of the Police Department's investigations division. Todd was charged with making a false report to police, and Bryant said police doubted her story from the start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Todd was awaiting arraignment Friday on the misdemeanor false-report charge, which is punishable by up to two years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin testifies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in 'Troopergate'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. LOUIS -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin testified for two hours Friday in an abuse-of-power investigation that has been a distraction to her Republican vice presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's leadership was questioned this month in a stinging but largely toothless legislative report that found she violated state ethics laws by letting a family dispute influence her decision-making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alaska Personnel Board is conducting a parallel investigation of the firing of her public safety commissioner, Walter Monegan. Monegan claims he was dismissed because he refused to fire Palin's former brother-in-law, a state trooper involved in a messy divorce from Palin's sister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden promotes clean coal in W.Va.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHARLESTON, W.Va. --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden said Friday that &quot;clean coal&quot; is part of Obama's energy strategy. Biden said West Virginia and other coal states could create thousands of new jobs by developing the technology to help U.S. and foreign power plants burn fossil fuel more cleanly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack and I believe clean coal is part of our energy future,&quot; Biden said. &quot;That's why we supported adding $200 million in funding for carbon capture and sequestration technology. Instead of pouring our energy dollars into the sands of Saudi Arabia and the pockets of Venezuela, we should be exporting home-made technology -- solving not only our own energy challenges, but the world's.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the River, For the River&quot;   easy to see that the &quot;gala event&quot; was not geared for the average citizen: $55 tickets! Just to visit a fancy building. There aren't even any trails built yet! Also, I got a kick out of the Freudian slip made in the directions: &quot;Turn on the levy road.&quot; Should be spelled &quot;levee,&quot; but &quot;levy&quot; is probably more appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was concerned about the veterans' commercial slamming McCain 'til I saw it was paid for by a federal employees trade union. Just typical truth-twisting and mudslinging after all. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why Joe the Plumber is a good Republican: He believes in deregulation: No need to license plumbers. He believes in lower taxes: Owes $1,200 in back taxes. He believes in preventing voter fraud: He, himself, has been removed from the voter rolls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One and one is two. No, it isn't. Yes, it is. No, it isn't. Wait, are you a Democrat? Yes. Oh, well, OK, you are forgiven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone in government and on Wall Street is very sorry that you have lost half of your life savings. The company executives who drove their companies into bankruptcy are especially sad about the tens of million dollars they take under their golden parachutes while their employees go bankrupt. The government will repair it by taking whatever is left of your 401(k) to bail Wall Street out. This message approved by Sen. Obama. He will redistribute the wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So now I guess it's official. The county cares more about its lawbreakers than its public safety workers. They are about to recommend a sales tax hike to fund prisoner mental health. At the same time, for two years Brian Haines has refused to even bring the question of a sales tax increase to fund a new 911 dispatch center. The current center is in a flood zone, a high traffic corridor, and is crumbling around the hard-working dispatchers. What a disgrace!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe the Plumber finally got Obama to say what we've all been waiting for him to say! Obama will redistribute your wealth to those who won't work for a living. Sounds like Socialism to me! God bless the USA!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somebody was upset that Pearce looked and sounded angry in the debate. Well, about damn time somebody got angry! Good for Pearce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here it is: Saturday morning and reading the Sun-News sport page would lead one to believe there was only one high school football game played in the state of New Mexico. I would like an explanation why the sports editor of the paper in the second largest city in the state will not report New Mexico prep football game scores on a timely basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party in Albuquerque is sending out a nefarious mailer telling southern New Mexico how Harry Teague will raise taxes. What is their source for information   a politician blogger, Joe Monahan? We don't need northern New Mexico telling us what we should do!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We had company in from the East and thought it would be nice to head down to Old Mesilla and enjoy the mariachis. Well, my guests were appalled that here in New Mexico the announcer only spoke Spanish. No English, not bilingual, only Spanish. And since they were giving away prizes if you could answer the questions correctly, we had no idea what they were saying. Someone needs to remind Old Mesilla that they are no longer part of Mexico and that there are still people in America that speak English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sun-News has endorsed some of the worst choices for political offices ever. But then, to say I am surprised would not be true. I have always considered this paper to be a total waste of time, money, energy and trees. My bird even objects to having this rag put into its cage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a shame that the once great and unbiased Sun-News has become just another liberal blog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those of you who, because of your religion, want to obstruct my freedoms, remember our Constitution and what America is about. I do not want you to dictate to me when, how, or what to use as birth control, or how my children learn about it, or to control my access to have an abortion if that is unfortunately necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bad political idea to ridicule Joe the Plumber, Mr. Obama. Do you know how many Joe the Plumber businesses and workers you ridiculed in the nation? Joe the Plumber could possibly cost you the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restaurants opposed raising the minimum wage because they knew prices would go up. Trace it back and you will see the first of these big price spikes happens as the minimum wage starts to go up. And guess what, there's more to come. Are the poor who everyone was so concerned about really better off making $1 more an hour and paying that and more for gas, bread and milk?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New radio ad targets Jerome Block Jr.: The Conservation Voters New Mexico Action Fund will air radio ads on the Public Regulation Commission District 3 race between Democrat Jerome Block Jr. and Green Party member Rick Lass. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One ad calls Block &quot;an embarrassment&quot; and urges voters to choose Lass. It says Block has avoided candidate forums and the news media, and is &quot;facing an inquiry from the Secretary of State and Attorney General about misuse of public funds and the lies he has told.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads in the usually low-key race are scheduled to start today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More Independents in Santa Fe County than Republicans: New state voter registration numbers show more people in Santa Fe County chose no party affiliation than those who registered as Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The breakdown: 61,226 people, or 63 percent are Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 16,482, or 17 percent, are Republicans. Meanwhile, 16,665 declined to state a party preference. That group also amounted to roughly 17 percent of voters, while 4 percent chose other parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like in so many other ways, Santa Fe County is a bit of an anomaly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Bernalillo County, the breakdown looks like this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats, 48 percent; Republicans, 32 percent; declined to state, 16 percent; other parties, 3 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, the state is 50 percent Democrat, 32 percent Republican, 15 percent DTS and 3 percent other party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dems -- and a Republican -- denounce GOP 'robo calls': Lt. Gov. Diane Denish held a teleconference with reporters Tuesday to denounce automated phone calls sponsored by the Republican National Committee. The calls, going to voters all over the country, work to tie Obama to Bill Ayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are very troubled by the kind of campaign that John McCain is conducting. They are very disappointed in the nature and the tenor of the robo calls that are basically not about the things they are interested in,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Las Vegas, N.M., Mayor Tony Marquez said during the conference that he was turned off by the calls. &quot;Knowing that I am a Republican mayor in Northern New Mexico, I also condemn these unnecessary, negative calls,&quot; said Marquez, who is supporting the Democratic nominee for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very offended by those robo calls. I shouldn't have to listen to that garbage on my answering machine and neither should residents of New Mexico,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addiction<BR><BR>Editor:<BR>This letter is in response to the article concerning fraud charges against Erin Balzano (Oct. 17). Our family would like to first thank those in the community who have provided support, prayers and advice over the past year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hard for any family to understand the devastation that drug abuse can have, until it hits home. The meth addictions that are wreaking havoc on Carlsbad and on small and large towns all over this country are more than devastating, they are a true epidemic. We as residents can no longer bury our heads in the sand and watch as neighbors, friends, loved ones and people down the street neglect their children, fall into a life of crime and eventually succumb to this deadly addiction.<BR>Our family has struggled to help Erin. To help her get clean and sober, to find a treatment facility, to regain her relationship with her children and those who love her. None of this has been easy, for us as her family, or for her.<BR>Meth is a horrible drug that alters a person forever and leaves scars not erased by time. Carlsbad as a community must do more to bring down those who would destroy the lives of our children with drugs. It is heartbreaking to see the effects on a person desperate to live a sober life; it is a struggle we would not wish on our worst enemy. There is a plague in Carlsbad, and every day it takes another life, and it offers them temporary enjoyment for a life of pain and tragedy. We pray that your families never know this pain, and we pray that the police, law enforcement and judges will fight for those locked in its grip.<BR>Erin Balzano is currently in a long-term treatment facility in Albuquerque, where she works every day to stay sober. She wants other people struggling with meth addictions to know that a sober life is a reality and that God is there with you, get help now.<BR>Toni Balzano<BR>Albuquerque<BR><BR><BR>Grantner<BR><BR>Editor:<BR>Even though we are both strong Democrats who plan to vote for Obama and Udall in the upcoming General Election, we are so impressed with the qualifications of Jim Grantner, who is the Republican running for county commissioner in the 5th district, that we will vote for him also.<BR>Grantner's background in city of Carlsbad employment starting with garbage collection and on through many ranks during his employment, and his volunteer work for the city and county since his retirement, qualifies him for the position of county commissioner.<BR>The clincher for us was that he has been instrumental in promoting a program for recycling at the curb that is in its pilot program right now in Carlsbad.<BR>Bill &amp; Janice Schnorr<BR>Carlsbad<BR><BR>McCain<BR><BR>Editor:<BR>A recent campaign ad for Sen. Obama declared that &quot;Both Senator McCain and Senator Obama will protect Second Amendment rights.&quot;<BR>Well, that's half right. McCain will protect Second Amendment rights, but based on his voting record in the U.S. Senate and his political life in Illinois, Obama will not.<BR>Obama has spoken about putting lipstick on a pig, and that's exactly what campaign ads like this one do. The pig is Obama's voting record concerning citizens owning guns, and the lipstick is to try to cover up that record and turn Obama into a Second Amendment champion when he is not.<BR>For a detailed account of Obama's anti gun voting record, check out www.GunBanObama.com.<BR>The recent Supreme Court Heller decision was a victory for gun owners. In this decision five of the Supreme Court judges said what many of us have believed all along, which was that the Second Amendment gives individual Americans the right to own guns.<BR>The disturbing part of this case is that four Supreme Court judges voted against that decision.<BR>The five justices who voted in favor of the decision are the type that John McCain will nominate to the court.<BR>The four who voted against the decision are the type Obama will appoint.<BR>The fact is that Obama voted against the Senate confirmation of two of the five justices who supported the decision.<BR>The fact is that McCain signed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of individual Second Amendment rights in the Heller case, and Obama refused to sign that brief.<BR>The next president is likely to have the opportunity to appoint one or more Supreme Court justices. A change in just one vote could overturn the Heller decision. That's what electing Obama could very well do.<BR>Tom Lewis<BR>Carlsbad<BR><BR>Energy future<BR><BR>Editor:<BR>There's been a lot of talk lately about how we can break our dependence on oil, especially with gas prices here in New Mexico reaching new heights this summer and home heating oil season right around the corner.<BR>Recently Congress finally took some action. Unfortunately, they acted to actually increase our dependence on oil by repealing a 30-year ban on off-shore drilling in protected areas off our Atlantic and Pacific coasts (or in the West, &quot;by repealing a ban on oil shale development in protected areas in the Rocky Mountains&quot;). Even the Bush administration says that drilling will do nothing to lower gas prices in either the long term or short. Unfortunately drilling will keep us hooked on oil even longer and increase global warming.<BR>Instead of doubling-down on our oil addiction, we should tap our technological ingenuity and renewable energy potential to solve these problems. But we need to turn the page and stop repeating the mistakes of the past.<BR>I urge the new president and the new Congress, whoever they may be, to move towards a new energy future of economic growth, job creation, reduced energy costs, and global warming solutions.<BR>Caitlin Cotter<BR>Environment New Mexico<BR>Albuquerque</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I don't necessarily agree with the advertising slogan that Mr. Cope Reynolds, owner of Southwest Shooting Authority, displayed in your article &quot;Obama supporters decry gun store ad,&quot; it does concern me that you included a comment from Mr. Kent Salazar, a former president of New Mexico Wildlife Federation, who supports Obama because the candidate has said he will protect his right to bear firearms.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrong! He has obviously not checked Sen. Obama's record on the issue. He has always been for a form of gun control. When he was running as an Illinois state candidate in 1996, he completed a questionnaire from a Chicago nonprofit organization, Independent Voters of Illinois. The question was: Do you support state legislation to: a. ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns? Yes. b. ban assault weapons? Yes. c. mandatory waiting periods and background checks? Yes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama certainly does not support our right to bear arms, but &quot;Senator Government&quot; believes the Federal Government can best make that decision for you or I.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frankly, I want less government in my life, not more. Look how great the Fannie Mae and Fannie Mac organizations were run by the government. This is why I support Sen. McCain, because I am certain he will fight for government reform, won't increase our taxes, he is the real deal, has integrity, and one who has always put his country first before self!</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON   Momentum is building for a fresh dose of economic stimulants to boost the country out of the doldrums   perhaps by putting more money in Americans' pockets. The White House said Monday that President Bush was open to some sort of action after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned the slump could drag on without the extra bracing tonic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wall Street, stocks bolted higher, with the Dow Jones industrials rising 413 points. There also were some new signs that credit conditions were thawing a bit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national economy, already wobbling, has been rocked by a trio of hard punches from the housing, credit and financial crises. With a recession widely seen as inevitable, if not already under way, the focus in Washington has shifted to the questions of how bad, how long and how to limit the pain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is increasing talk of a post-election special session calling Congress back to the Capitol. But urgency varies greatly according to whom you talk to   and when.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're continuing to have conversations with members of Congress, and we're open to ideas that they would put forward ... that would stimulate the economy and help us pull out of this downturn faster,&quot; White House press secretary Dana Perino said around noon Monday, shortly after Bernanke endorsed the need for a fresh and &quot;significant&quot; round of government action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A couple of hours later, Bush seconded Perino's remarks, but he also said in a more optimistic tone: &quot;I have heard that people's attitudes are beginning to change from a period of intense concerns   I would call it near panic   to being more relaxed.&quot; He commented after a closed meeting with business leaders in Alexandria, La.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If congressional leaders and Bush   who has been cool to more federal stimulus spending given already exploding budget deficits   were to hash out an acceptable package, it would require a special session after the Nov. 4 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If an agreement can't be worked out, the effort probably would be taken up by the next Congress and the next president. Democrat Barack Obama has strongly advocated more government stimulus, while Republican John McCain is keeping his options open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and fellow congressional Democrats are pushing a package that could cost as much as $150 billion. Some economists, however, have advised them in recent days that to have a real impact, the total would have to be far larger, as much as $300 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of that package, Democrats want to resurrect a $61 billion House-passed measure that included about $37 billion in public works spending, $6 billion to extend jobless benefits, $15 billion to help states to pay their Medicaid bills and $3 billion in food stamp assistance for the poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats also are considering a second round of tax rebates to follow the $600 to $1,200 checks most individuals and couples got earlier this year. That money, going directly to consumers in hopes they would spend it, could push the price tag much higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unemployment   now at 6.1 percent   is expected to hit 7.5 percent or higher next year. And millions of Americans have been watching their retirement nest eggs and home values shrivel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One-third of Americans are worried about losing their jobs, half fret they will be unable to keep up with mortgage and credit card payments, and seven in 10 are anxious that their stocks and retirement investments are losing value, according to an Associated Press-Yahoo News poll of likely voters released Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the Democratic leadership, predicted Congress would return in November. &quot;We couldn't have gotten a better supporter for a stimulus package than Ben Bernanke,&quot; Schumer said. &quot;His support will change the stimulus from a possibility to a reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pelosi said, &quot;I call on President Bush and congressional Republicans to once again heed Chairman Bernanke's advice and as they did in January, work with Democrats in Congress to enact a targeted, timely and fiscally responsible economic recovery and job creation package.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in an interview with The Associated Press last Friday, Pelosi had said Congress is unlikely to approve a tax rebate before Bush leaves office, and she signaled that prospects were dim that Democrats would be able to strike a deal with the president on an economic aid package during a post-election session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, Congress enacted a $168 billion stimulus package that included tax rebates for people and tax breaks for businesses. The rebate checks did help to lift economic growth in the spring. After that, though, consumers cut back sharply and businesses have retrenched in turn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the economy likely to be weak for several quarters, and with some risk of a protracted slowdown, consideration of a fiscal package by the Congress at this juncture seems appropriate,&quot; Bernanke told the House Budget Committee. It marked the first time Bernanke endorsed the need for another round of economic stimulus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed chief suggested that Congress design the package to limit the longer-term affects on the government's budget deficit, which hit a record in the recently ended budget year and is undoubtedly headed higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernanke said the package also should include provisions &quot;to help improve access to credit by consumers, home buyers, businesses and other borrowers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also left the door open to further interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fed policymakers meet next on Oct. 28-29, and many economists believe they will again lower their key rate   now at 1.50 percent   to bolster the economy. Just a few weeks ago, the Fed and the world's other major central banks joined forces to ratchet down rates, the first coordinated action of that kind in the Fed's history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were some signs that credit problems were improving a bit. Bank-to-bank lending rates fell for a sixth straight day on Monday. Demand for Treasury bills, regarded as the world's safest investment, lessened somewhat but remained relatively high in a sign that there was still much fear in the markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the Treasury Department announced it would inject up to $250 billion in U.S. banks in return for partial ownership. So far this year, 15 banks have failed, including the largest U.S. bank failure in history, compared with three last year. And major Wall Street investment firms have been swallowed by other companies, have filed bankruptcy or have converted themselves into commercial banks to weather the financial storm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think that the article on &quot;Pre-Osama bin Biden sale&quot; was great. Thank you for putting it in the paper. Now let's see some of the other side of the comments. Comments from people that feel that Mr. Reynolds is correct. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I see that you only put in the few comments of people that were against the sign. Why didn't you put in some of the comments of people that feel the same way as Mr. Reynolds? I am one of the people that think as he does, that we would be in for gun control per the previous voting record of Mr. Obama if he is voted in as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We as a people just sit around and not say anything. Well enough is enough. Mr. Reynolds owns the sign and the property and has the freedom to put the sign out. People can decry the gun store ad all they want. As far as I know, this is still America. If it offends, do like they say about the TV or newspaper, turn the channel or don't read the paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the matter of the sign, they are free to drive on another route so that they don't have to see the sign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am against the news media that has shown such a great bias to make our Senator Obama our next president. Why not be fair and show both sides of the story and let the people make up their own mind? This article is not a complete picture as to how hundreds of thousands in this country feels.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some religious leaders push the law against partisan activity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Anne Constable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Mexican</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A minister who endorses a candidate or political party from the pulpit risks losing the church's tax-exempt status. That's the law. But often in New Mexico, and elsewhere, it isn't always carefully observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the nonprofit Rock Christian Fellowship in Espa&ntilde;ola is directly challenging the ban on political campaign activity by posting a gruesome photo of the head of an aborted fetus on the outside of its building. Below the picture are the names of three Democratic candidates: (Barack) Obama, (Senate candidate Tom) Udall and (candidate for Congress, Ben Ray) Luj&aacute; n.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the right is the photo of a happy, healthy baby headlined, &quot;Life.&quot; And below that image are the names of Republican candidates: (John) McCain, (Steve) Pearce and (Dan) East. Between the two slates is the message, &quot;You will decide.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defending the church's decision to erect the signs, Rock Christian's pastor, Michael Naranjo, said, &quot;I'd rather lose my 501(c)(3) (status) than lose my soul.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naranjo admitted he &quot;hates&quot; the picture of the mangled fetus, but thinks &quot;it is the fastest way to educate people on what abortion does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pastor encourages people to register to vote as well as to vote pro-life -- permitted activities under the Internal Revenue code -- but he said he is also &quot;educating (churchgoers) on who stands pro-life and who is pro-death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How far religious leaders can go to influence the vote is an issue that comes up during every election cycle, especially prior to presidential contests in which the candidates hold diametrically opposed positions on controversial issues such as abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago, there were many reports from Northern New Mexico that priests were discouraging Catholics from voting for John Kerry because of his support of a woman's right to choose to end an unwanted pregnancy. Kerry lost the election in the state by a narrow margin -- 5,988 votes -- but exit polls showed only 45 percent of voters who attended worship services once a week supported Kerry compared to 54 percent for George Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the law against partisan political activity is again being tested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of Rock Christian's sign, Joe Conn, a spokesman for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, said, &quot;I think it's a clear violation of federal tax law, which doesn't allow churches to intervene in political campaigns on behalf one group and against another group. The church's tax exemption could be at risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, Conn said, Naranjo could have erected the same installation in his front yard and that &quot;would have been perfectly fine.&quot; Ministers are free to get involved in politics on their own time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Santa Fe, St. Anne Catholic Church has hung a 10-foot-long banner on the side of its building at the intersection of Hickox and Alicia streets saying, &quot;Vote Pro-Life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The banner appears to pass IRS muster because it does not mention any candidate by name. &quot;It just makes me mad and gives me a stomach ache,&quot; said Sloan Cunningham of Santa Fe, who drove by the church recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It gives pause to wonder if (those who) create these messages and hang these signs have adopted any of the unplanned, unwanted or supported the orphanages and fosters where they are housed and warehoused,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An attorney who did not want her name published, also reported the banner. &quot;I'm a Catholic,&quot; she said, &quot;and I even found it offensive. It's disgusting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Simonson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico, said his organization normally opposes restricting people's ability to say what they want, but &quot;the banner comes pretty close to the functional equivalent of express advocacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ryan Oberly, an attorney with a Chicago law firm that specializes in churches and political activity, called the case ambiguous. &quot;If it said, 'Vote for McCain; he's pro-life,' or 'Vote for Obama; he's pro-choice,' that would be a clear violation. I understand where (the woman attorney) is coming from, but I think there are lot of good, compelling reasons why (the church) would lawfully be able to use that sign,&quot; Oberly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conn said he agreed with that interpretation. &quot;I don't think the IRS would intervene,&quot; he said. &quot;It doesn't identify candidates. It leaves (the intent of the church) up to the interpretation of people who see it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea for the banner started with a small group at St. Anne including Anton Balcombe, for whom the meaning is not ambiguous. The message, Balcombe said, is that people should &quot;vote for John McCain and Sarah Palin because they're pro-life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the other issues, including war and the economic crisis, are small change,&quot; Balcombe added. &quot;We murder 4,000 of our own citizens every day by legalized abortion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama is 100 percent pro-abortion,&quot; said Balcombe, who displayed an identical banner to the one at St. Anne -- along with a McCain sign -- at the intersection of Cerrillos Road and St. Francis Drive last week. &quot;He supports the right for people to kill their own children. We can't vote for that man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress began banning political campaign activity by churches and charities more than a half century ago in a 1954 amendment to the Internal Revenue Code by then-U.S. Sen. Lyndon Johnson. As recently as 1987, it amended the language to clarify the prohibition also applied to statements that oppose candidates. Conn said the IRS has become more aggressive about enforcing the law in the last couple of election cycles because more tax-exempt groups have been getting involved in politics -- even though a recent poll by LifeWay Research, a conservative Southern Baptist group, showed that 87 percent of Americans believe it is inappropriate for churches to use their resources to campaign for candidates for public office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the law, churches can hold voter-registration drives, prepare and distribute election guides or even hold a nonpartisan candidate forum. They can also take positions on public-policy issues, including those that divide candidates in an election -- so long as they stop short of approving or disapproving an individual candidate. And a minister can be politically active as long as it is clear he or she is speaking as a private citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Church at Pierce Creek in Binghamton, N.Y., lost its tax-exempt status in 1995 after the IRS determined it had violated federal tax law by publishing a full-page ad in USA Today in late October 1992 advising people that voting for presidential candidate Bill Clinton was a sin. The church sued in federal court to regain its tax-exempt status but lost in federal district court. A federal appellate court later upheld the ruling denying the church tax-exempt status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently several dozen conservative ministers tried to prompt an IRS investigation by preaching about the merits of specific candidates during their Sunday morning services. The Sept. 28 event was promoted by the Alliance Defense Fund, a conservative legal-advocacy group that believes the law is unconstitutional. &quot;The government can't demand that a church give up its right to tax-exempt status simply because the pastor exercises his First Amendment rights in the pulpit,&quot; Erik Stanley, senior legal counsel for the ADF, was quoted as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only New Mexico church that participated in Pulpit Freedom Sunday was Calvary Chapel in Rio Rancho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many local churches, on the other hand, go to great lengths to avoid risking their tax-exempt status. The United Church of Santa Fe went so far as to withdraw an invitation to state Rep. Peter Wirth, D-Santa Fe, to speak at the church after he became a candidate for the New Mexico state Senate. It also postponed an event planned by the church's Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender group with Liz Stefanics, a candidate for the Santa Fe County Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do think churches need to be careful in this realm &Eacute; certainly not endorsing candidates or giving the idea that we endorse a particular candidate,&quot; said the Rev. Talitha Arnold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Anne's banner, she said, was &quot;a bit more blurry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I definitely believe that faith communities and faith leaders have a responsibility to help frame the questions and raise concerns, based on their faith understandings,&quot; Arnold said. &quot;Where the &quot;pro-life&quot; sign gets tricky is that the phrase itself has come to mean very specific things, and a particular set of social/political issues in our society. I think it goes without saying that most churches, regardless of denomination, are all &quot;for life&quot; -- in all kinds of ways. But &quot;pro-life&quot; means a particular stance on particular issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Michael Sheehan also urges parishes to stay within the law. Every year, he issues a statement reminding Catholics of their responsibility to be informed and participate in the election in a law-abiding way. In the latest &quot;How to Vote?&quot; statement, he advised people to &quot;Vote pro-life!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pro-life society, Sheehan said, &quot;is one that respects the dignity of all human life, including unborn human life, and also protects the elderly and the sick from the creeping evil of euthanasia.&quot; He said the church also &quot;affirms&quot; stem-cell research so long as it does not harm the human embryo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are many other issues to consider, Sheehan declared, such as same-sex marriage, the death penalty, concern for the poor, the treatment of inmates, immigration police and the approach to war and peace. Priests and other church leaders &quot;are not allowed to publicly tell you who to vote for or against, but we do indeed speak to the issues such as the ones I have mentioned,&quot; Sheehan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rock Christian's Naranjo, however, contends his stand is no different from that taken historically by black churches. &quot;They've been &quot;endorsing for years,&quot; he said, pointing out that political advocacy is only a small part of his church's activities, which also include worship, a day care center and programs for drug-and-alcohol addicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naranjo, who supported the Catholic bishops who wanted to deny the sacrament of Holy Communion to Kerry, said, &quot;My feeling is, we should be able to express ourselves about issues and candidates and where they stand on issues that are pertinent to society and the church. Faith is not something you put in your pocket and take out when you need it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether he worried about Rock Christian's tax exemption, he said, &quot;Frankly I don't care. Either I obey God or I obey man.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON   Let me get this straight. A couple of agitated yahoos in a rally of thousands yell something offensive and incendiary, and John McCain and Sarah Palin are not just guilty by association   with total strangers, mind you   but worse: guilty according to The New York Times of &quot;race-baiting and xenophobia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But should you bring up Barack Obama's real associations   20 years with Jeremiah Wright, working on two foundations and distributing money with William Ayers, citing the raving Michael Pfleger as one who helps him keep his moral compass (Chicago Sun-Times, April 2004) and the long-standing relationship with the left-wing vote-fraud specialist ACORN   you have crossed the line into illegitimate guilt by association. Moreover, it is tinged with racism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that, when John McCain actually heard one of those nasty things said about Obama, he incurred the boos of his own crowd by insisting that Obama is &quot;a decent person that you do not have to be scared (of) as president&quot; makes no difference. It surely did not stop John Lewis from comparing McCain to George Wallace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The search for McCain's racial offenses is untiring and often unhinged. Remember McCain's Berlin/celebrity ad that showed a shot of Paris Hilton? An appalling attempt to exploit white hostility at the idea of black men &quot;becoming sexually involved with white women,&quot; fulminated New York Times columnist Bob Herbert. He took to TV to denounce McCain's exhumation of that most vile prejudice, pointing out McCain's gratuitous insertion in the ad of &quot;two phallic symbols,&quot; the Washington Monument and the Leaning Tower of Pisa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except that Herbert was entirely delusional. There was no Washington Monument. There was no Leaning Tower. Just photographs seen in every newspaper in the world of Barack Obama's Berlin rally in the setting he himself had chosen, Berlin's Victory Column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herbert is not the only fevered one. On Tuesday night, Rachel Maddow of MSNBC and Jonathan Alter of Newsweek fell over themselves agreeing that the &quot;political salience&quot; of the Republican attack on ACORN is, yes, its unstated appeal to racial prejudice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This about an organization that is being accused of voter registration fraud in about a dozen states. In Nevada, the investigating secretary of state is a Democrat. Is he playing the race card too?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes the charges against McCain especially revolting is that he has been scrupulous in eschewing the race card. He has gone far beyond what is right and necessary, refusing even to make an issue of Obama's deep, self-declared connection with the race-baiting Jeremiah Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the name of racial rectitude, McCain has denied himself the use of that perfectly legitimate issue. It is simply Orwellian for him to be now so widely vilified as a stoker of racism. What makes it doubly Orwellian is that these charges are being made on behalf of the one presidential candidate who has repeatedly, and indeed quite brilliantly, deployed the race card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How brilliantly? The reason Bill Clinton is sulking in his tent is because he feels that Obama surrogates succeeded in painting him as a racist. Clinton has many sins, but from his student days to his post-presidency, his commitment and sincerity in advancing the cause of African-Americans have been undeniable. If the man Toni Morrison called the first black president can be turned into a closet racist, then anyone can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Obama has shown no hesitation in doing so to McCain. Just weeks ago, in Springfield, Mo., and elsewhere, he warned darkly that George Bush and John McCain were going to try to frighten you by saying that, among other scary things, Obama has &quot;a funny name&quot; and &quot;doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has never said that, nor anything like that. When asked at the time to produce one instance of McCain deploying race, the Obama campaign could not. Yet here was Obama firing a pre-emptive charge of racism against a man who had not indulged in it. An extraordinary rhetorical feat, and a dishonorable one. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes this all the more dismaying is that it comes from Barack Obama, who has consistently presented himself as a healer, a man of a new generation above and beyond race, the man who would turn the page on the guilt-tripping grievance politics of Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I once believed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction   Last week I wrote that in 1995 Bill Ayers gave Barack Obama a fundraiser in his home. I should instead have called it a campaign event.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOLLAND, Ohio   Joe the Plumber's story sprang a few leaks Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turns out that the man who was held up by John McCain as the typical, hard-working American taxpayer isn't really a licensed plumber. And court documents show he owes nearly $1,200 in back taxes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe,&quot; whose name is Samuel J. Wurzelbacher, was cited repeatedly in Wednesday night's final presidential debate by McCain for questioning Barack Obama's tax policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wurzelbacher instantly became a media celebrity, fielding calls during the debate and facing reporters outside his home near Toledo on Thursday morning for an impromptu nationally televised news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wurzelbacher acknowledged he doesn't have a plumber's license, but said he didn't need one because he works for someone else at a company that does residential work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wurzelbacher also owes the state of Ohio $1,182.98 in personal income tax, according to Lucas County Court of Common Pleas records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 2007, Ohio's Department of Taxation filed a claim on his property until he pays the debt, according to the records. The lien remains active.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the debate, McCain cited Wurzelbacher as an example of someone who wants to buy a plumbing business but would be hurt by Obama's tax plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wurzelbacher, a self-described conservative, had spoken to Obama at a rally Sunday near his home and asked him whether his tax plan would keep him from buying the business that currently employs him, which earns more than $250,000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your new tax plan is going to tax me more, isn't it?&quot; Wurzelbacher asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said that under his proposal, taxes on any revenue from $250,000 on down would stay the same, but that amounts above that level would be subject to a 39 percent tax, instead of the current 36 percent rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said Obama's plan would stop entrepreneurs such as Wurzelbacher from investing in new small businesses and keep existing ones from growing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign posted a Web ad featuring the exchange between Wurzelbacher and Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During an afternoon taping of &quot;Late Show with David Letterman,&quot; McCain said he had not yet spoken to Wurzelbacher, and apologized for the press attention he had received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe, if you're watching, I'm sorry,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wurzelbacher had to deal with a clog of two dozen reporters outside his home on Thursday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't have a lot of pull. It's not like I'm Matt Damon,&quot; he said &quot;I just hope I'm not making too much of a fool of myself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicated he was a fan of the military and McCain but wouldn't say who will get his vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wurzelbacher said a McCain campaign official contacted him several days before the debate to ask him to appear with the candidate at a Toledo rally scheduled for Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told reporters he's unsure if he'll attend, since he's now scheduled to be in New York for TV interviews.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EL PASO - A billboard along Interstate-10 West near Raynolds supporting Republican John McCain's presidential campaign would have likely gone with little notice if it had originally included a few simple words: &quot;Paid for by Laura McIntyre.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the only text on the billboard read &quot;McCain Palin, Change babies can live with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is running for president against Democrat Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections laws require the addition of a disclaimer stating who paid for the advertisement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They need to have that disclaimer if they advocate the election of a candidate,&quot; said Bob Biersack, a spokesman for the Federal Election Commission in Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rules state that if the billboard is not authorized by a candidate or a candidate's committee, it must conspicuously state the full name, permanent address and telephone number or Website address of the person who paid for the ad. It must also include a statement that it is not authorized by the candidate or candidate's committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Kise, a regional spokesman for the McCain campaign, said the billboard was not purchased with the campaign's knowledge. Its content apparently supports McCain's pro-life stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not our billboard,&quot; he said. &quot;We have no clue where it came from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">V.J. Smith, president of the El Paso and Southern New Mexico division for Clear Channel Outdoor, referred questions about the billboard to McIntyre, who paid for its display.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McIntyre did not return calls seeking comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The billboard, however, was amended with the political disclaimer on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kise recommended that those who want to assist the campaign visit www.johnmccain.com for more information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of Obama can visit www.barackobama.com for information about supporting his campaign.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CARLSBAD -- The majority of seniors at San Jose Senior Center on Thursday said they didn't need to watch Wednesday's third and final presidential debate. They have already made their decision on who they will vote for. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pat Jones said she hasn't watched any of the debates because there is too much &quot;mudslinging&quot; by the candidates. But her vote will be in Barack Obama's favor, she said<BR>&quot;Why am I going to vote for Obama? Because he is not John McCain,&quot; Jones said.<BR>Sitting next to Jones and waiting for the noon meal to be served, Gloria Byram expressed surprise that there had been a televised debate Wednesday night.<BR>&quot;Oh, did they have a presidential debate? Had I known, I probably would have watched it,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm just disgusted with the presidential campaign. I'm not voting Obama, that's for sure. I plan to vote for McCain. Actually, I wanted to vote for Hillary Clinton, but that didn't turn out. I'm voting for McCain because he is the lesser of the two evils. At least McCain fought for this country.&quot;<BR>Johnny Baiza also said he didn't bother to watch the debate, but gave thumbs up for McCain.<BR>&quot;He's the man I'm favoring,&quot; he said.<BR>Jesse McNeal, who came for lunch and to play a game of pool, said he watched the debate and didn't hear anything new. Even though he has always voted Democrat, his vote this year will be given to McCain.<BR>&quot;The way I see it, neither one of the candidates will be able to do everything they say they are going to do if they are elected president. Congress makes and passes legislation, not the president,&quot; McNeal said.<BR>&quot;I'm African-American, and Obama will make history if he is the first African-American to be elected president of the United States. But I am going to vote for McCain. In my opinion, Obama does not have enough experience. McCain at least served our country in the military and I think he has a better economic plan than Obama.&quot;<BR>Eugenia Bemis said she switched to channels that did not broadcast the debate.<BR>&quot;I watched the first debate. I came to the conclusion that they say only what they want people to hear. They don't tell you exactly how they are going to fix things,&quot; she said. &quot;I probably will vote for McCain. He has military experience. I had three kids in the Navy and a fourth served in the Army in Desert Storm. McCain has the experience we need in a president.&quot;<BR>Anastacia Jones said she can't stand the political commercials and doesn't watch them on television. She prefers to read what both candidates have to say in the print media.<BR>&quot;I'm voting for McCain. He has good morals and he did a real good job of picking his vice presidential candidate. I like him, and he has principles,&quot; she said.<BR>Working on their ceramic projects, Betty Jo Jones and Vicky Miller talked about the upcoming presidential election and their views about the candidates.<BR>&quot;I started to watch the debate, but I gave up,&quot; Miller said with a chuckle. &quot;Oh, I'm definitely going to exercise my right to vote. But I'm going to vote for Bob Barr, who is running as an Independent. I watched him being interviewed by Glen Beck, a political commentator on CNN. Barr made more sense than all the others. I'm voting for the lesser of the three evils.&quot;<BR>Jones said that her husband suffers from Alzheimer's and, as his primary care giver, she has little time to watch television. When she does, her husband becomes agitated when political shows are on.<BR>&quot;I haven't had the opportunity to watch any of the presidential debates and listen to what they have to say. But from what I do know about each of them, I'm not going to vote,&quot; Jones said. &quot;I don't like either of (the presidential candidates). This time around I'm going to let others make the choice for me. I wish we could keep Sen. Pete Domenici (R-NM) in the Senate. He would have made a good president. I hate that his health is bad and he is leaving the Senate. We need more people in Washington like him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FARMINGTON   Lora Bradford got angry when she saw a sign saying, &quot;Pre-Osama bin Biden sale&quot; advertising a sale at a local gun store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it was redneck and ignorant to put such a sign up,&quot; said Bradford, of Kirtland. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sign outside Southwest Shooting Authority has offended Bradford and other Sen. Barack Obama supporters who complain that the Democratic presidential candidate and his running mate should not be linked with Osama bin Laden, the terrorist behind the Sept. 11 attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this sign offended people, I am damn proud of it,&quot; said Cope Reynolds, owner of the gun store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and vice presidential candidate Sen. Joe Biden want to take away Second Amendment rights of gun owners and Reynolds believes Obama has &quot;terrorist connections,&quot; Reynolds said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Reynolds has &quot;other reasons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of it is because of his Muslim upbringing,&quot; said Reynolds, who planned to take down the sign Wednesday or today because the sale has ended. &quot;I'm not saying he's Muslim now. Of course, I have my doubts, my suspicions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kent Salazar, a hunter and former president of New Mexico Wildlife Federation, a hunting and fishing lobby, called Reynolds' comments &quot;a bunch of hooey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salazar said he supports Obama because the candidate has said he will protect his right to bear firearms, said Salazar, who also is a member of the National Rifle Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as a guy trying to make money selling some rifles with a silly sign, I mean, that's kind of humorous to me,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nancy Walsh, a gun owner who lives in Gilbert, Ariz., said the sign promotes fear of the candidates. Bradford told her about the sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no reason to cause fear or hate among the community in order to get your point across,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tennille Burns, an undecided voter who lives in Kirtland, said the sign irritated her. She called the sign a &quot;crude gesture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's disturbing,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reynolds also bought an Obama mask on which he put a turban. He displays the mask in his store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reynolds said he supports Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain, but only because &quot;he's the lesser of two evils.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reynolds said his disdain for Obama has nothing to do with race. He would have voted for Alan Keyes or Condoleezza Rice   if they were in the presidential race.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEMPSTEAD, N.Y.   John McCain repeatedly assailed Barack Obama's character and campaign positions on taxes, abortion and more Wednesday night, hoping to transform their final presidential debate into a launching pad for a political comeback. &quot;You didn't tell the American people the truth,&quot; he charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unruffled, and ahead in the polls, Obama parried each accusation, and leveled a few of his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One hundred percent, John, of your ads, 100 percent of them have been negative,&quot; Obama shot back in an uncommonly personal debate less than three weeks from Election Day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not true,&quot; McCain retorted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It absolutely is true,&quot; said Obama, seeking the last word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is currently running all negative ads, according to a study by the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But he has run a number of positive ads during the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 90-minute encounter, seated at a round table at Hofstra University, was their third debate, and marked the beginning of a 20-day sprint to Election Day. Obama leads in the national polls and in surveys in many battleground states, an advantage built in the weeks since the nation stumbled into the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With few exceptions, the campaign is being waged in states that voted Republican in 2004   Virginia, Colorado, Iowa   and in many of them, Obama holds a lead in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain played the aggressor from the opening moments of the debate, accusing Obama of waging class warfare by seeking tax increases that would &quot;spread the wealth around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator also demanded to know the full extent of Obama's relationship with William Ayers, a 1960s-era terrorist and the Democrat's ties with ACORN, a liberal group accused of violating federal law as it seeks to register voters. And he insisted Obama disavow last week's remarks by Rep. John Lewis, a Democrat, who accused the Republican ticket of playing racial politics along the same lines as segregationists of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Struggling to escape the political drag of an unpopular Republican incumbent, McCain also said, &quot;Sen. Obama, I am not President Bush. ... You wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama returned each volley, and brushed aside McCain's claim to full political independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I've occasionally mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people   on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities   you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's allegation that Obama had not leveled with the public involved the Illinois senator's decision to forgo public financing for his campaign in favor of raising his own funds. As a result, he has far outraised McCain, although the difference has been somewhat neutralized by an advantage the Republican National Committee holds over the Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He signed a piece of paper&quot; earlier in the campaign pledging to accept federal financing, McCain said. He added that Obama's campaign has spent more money than any since Watergate, a reference to President Nixon's re-election, a campaign that later became synonymous with scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama made no immediate response to McCain's assertion about having signed a pledge to accept federal campaign funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about running mates, both presidential candidates said Democrat Joseph Biden was qualified to become president, although McCain added this qualifier: &quot;in many respects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain passed up a chance to say his own running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, was qualified to sit in the Oval Office, though he praised her performance as governor and noted her work on behalf of special needs children. The Palins have a son born earlier this year with Down Syndrome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama sidestepped when asked about Palin's qualifications to serve as president, and he, too, praised her advocacy for special needs children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he quickly sought to turn the issue to his advantage by noting McCain favors a spending freeze on government programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding if we're going to get serious in terms of research. ... And if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, we're not going to be able to do it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to differences on taxes and spending, McCain said Obama advocated trade policies that recalled those of Herbert Hoover, who presided over the start of the Great Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has called for tougher provisions in trade negotiations, arguing that is necessary to avoid undercutting the wages paid American workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also said Obama has aligned himself with &quot;the extreme aspect of the pro-abortion movement in America&quot; and had voted present while in the Illinois Legislature on a measure to ban one type of procedure late in a woman's pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said the bill would have undermined Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that granted abortion rights, and had been opposed by the Illinois Medical Society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there's an exception for the mother's health and life, and this did not contain that exception,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain sarcastically paid tribute to &quot;the eloquence of Senator Obama. He's (for) health for the mother. You know, that's been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's allegation about class warfare stemmed from one of Obama's campaign appearances last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ohio on Sunday, Obama was approached by a man who said, &quot;Your new tax plan's going to tax me more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A video clip caught by Fox News shows Obama replying, &quot;It's not that I want to punish your success. I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you, that they've got a chance at success, too. And I think that when we spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain referred repeatedly to that voter, Joe Wurzelbacher, a plumber from Toledo, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wurzelbacher watched Wednesday night's debate and said he still thinks Obama's plan would keep him from buying the small business that employs him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's reference to Ayers reprised campaign commercials he has run to try and raise doubts about Obama's fitness to serve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayers, who was a member of the violent Weather Underground in the 1960s, hosted a meet-the-candidate event for Obama in an Illinois race many years later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Sen. McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me,&quot; Obama replied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEMPSTEAD, N.Y.   John McCain repeatedly assailed Barack Obama's character and campaign positions on taxes, abortion and more Wednesday night, hoping to transform their final presidential debate into a launching pad for a political comeback. &quot;You didn't tell the American people the truth,&quot; he charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unruffled, and ahead in the polls, Obama parried each accusation, and leveled a few of his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One hundred percent, John, of your ads, 100 percent of them have been negative,&quot; Obama shot back in an uncommonly personal debate less than three weeks from Election Day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not true,&quot; McCain retorted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It absolutely is true,&quot; said Obama, seeking the last word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is currently running all negative ads, according to a study by the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But he has run a number of positive ads during the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 90-minute encounter, seated at a round table at Hofstra University, was their third debate, and marked the beginning of a 20-day sprint to Election Day. Obama leads in the national polls and in surveys in many battleground states, an advantage built in the weeks since the nation stumbled into the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With few exceptions, the campaign is being waged in states that voted Republican in 2004   Virginia, Colorado, Iowa   and in many of them, Obama holds a lead in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain played the aggressor from the opening moments of the debate, accusing Obama of waging class warfare by seeking tax increases that would &quot;spread the wealth around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator also demanded to know the full extent of Obama's relationship with William Ayers, a 1960s-era terrorist and the Democrat's ties with ACORN, a liberal group accused of violating federal law as it seeks to register voters. And he insisted Obama disavow last week's remarks by Rep. John Lewis, a Democrat, who accused the Republican ticket of playing racial politics along the same lines as segregationists of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Struggling to escape the political drag of an unpopular Republican incumbent, McCain also said, &quot;Sen. Obama, I am not President Bush. ... You wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama returned each volley, and brushed aside McCain's claim to full political independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I've occasionally mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people   on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities   you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's allegation that Obama had not leveled with the public involved the Illinois senator's decision to forgo public financing for his campaign in favor of raising his own funds. As a result, he has far outraised McCain, although the difference has been somewhat neutralized by an advantage the Republican National Committee holds over the Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He signed a piece of paper&quot; earlier in the campaign pledging to accept federal financing, McCain said. He added that Obama's campaign has spent more money than any since Watergate, a reference to President Nixon's re-election, a campaign that later became synonymous with scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama made no immediate response to McCain's assertion about having signed a pledge to accept federal campaign funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about running mates, both presidential candidates said Democrat Joseph Biden was qualified to become president, although McCain added this qualifier: &quot;in many respects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain passed up a chance to say his own running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, was qualified to sit in the Oval Office, though he praised her performance as governor and noted her work on behalf of special needs children. The Palins have a son born earlier this year with Down Syndrome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama sidestepped when asked about Palin's qualifications to serve as president, and he, too, praised her advocacy for special needs children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he quickly sought to turn the issue to his advantage by noting McCain favors a spending freeze on government programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding if we're going to get serious in terms of research. ... And if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, we're not going to be able to do it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to differences on taxes and spending, McCain said Obama advocated trade policies that recalled those of Herbert Hoover, who presided over the start of the Great Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has called for tougher provisions in trade negotiations, arguing that is necessary to avoid undercutting the wages paid American workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also said Obama has aligned himself with &quot;the extreme aspect of the pro-abortion movement in America&quot; and had voted present while in the Illinois Legislature on a measure to ban one type of procedure late in a woman's pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said the bill would have undermined Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that granted abortion rights, and had been opposed by the Illinois Medical Society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there's an exception for the mother's health and life, and this did not contain that exception,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain sarcastically paid tribute to &quot;the eloquence of Senator Obama. He's (for) health for the mother. You know, that's been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain likes Barack Obama. He admires and respects Obama. He believes Obama is &quot;very impressive, he's thoughtful, he's centrist.&quot; Obama has &quot;probably got a great future.&quot; He is &quot;a very honest and fine person&quot;   &quot;absolutely&quot; qualified to be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How do we know McCain feels this way? Because he said so, in public comments ranging from 2005 to as recently as May. And as the McCain campaign grew uglier last week   casting Obama as dangerous, dishonest and un-American   it was tempting to imagine the campaign McCain might have waged if he had based it on the respect for his opponent, and for the process, that he had long professed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, for example, McCain was angrily promising to &quot;name the names&quot; of those who caused the nation's worst financial crisis in decades. He was blaming Obama and his &quot;cronies,&quot; and the &quot;corruption&quot; that Obama had &quot;abetted&quot; in Washington. Meanwhile, almost as if there were no meltdown, his running mate remained stuck on attacking Obama for &quot;palling around with terrorists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But imagine if McCain had selected for his running mate not a partisan attack dog but someone with deep knowledge of the economy and a record of reaching across the aisle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine if McCain himself had decided to respond to this crisis as an American first, a candidate second. &quot;Yes,&quot; he might have said, &quot;Democrats contributed to our problems with their lobbyist-fueled defense of Fannie and Freddie. But let's not pretend that Alan Greenspan, Phil Gramm, George W. Bush   and John McCain   weren't part of this, too. Warren Buffett saw this coming, but not many of the rest of us did. Let's postpone the recriminations and work together to fix this thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, McCain was asking darkly, &quot;Who is the real Senator Obama?&quot; Imagine, instead, if he had followed his own advice from the spring, when he repudiated a state party attack ad that he said &quot;distracts us from the very real differences we have with the Democrats.&quot; Imagine if he were challenging Obama on those policy differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm sure, in the crazed intensity of a presidential campaign, it's easy to start believing your consultants and television ads   believing that the other guy is dangerous and that only you can save the country. That must be especially true when the other guy is insulting you. The mud flies both ways in this campaign, with Obama and his allies relentlessly pounding McCain as out of touch, erratic, dishonest and, over and over again, dishonorable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And honor is at the core of McCain's self-image. He's been running for president, more on than off, for almost a decade, but his determination hasn't had much to do with a highly defined ideology, program or set of policies. What underlies his ambition are values: service, patriotism, duty, honor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be that it's easier for such a campaign to get blown off course. In an exceptionally pro-Democratic year, against an exceptionally unflappable opponent, it's not surprising that a campaign without bedrock policy goals would try first one thing, then another, with one of those things being character assassination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I certainly can't prove that a McCain campaign built on respect and attention to issues would be faring better than the real thing. Without Sarah Palin to rally the base, and without the insidious questioning of Obama's patriotism, McCain might be even further behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he also might be doing better   and he might be happier, too. That, at least, is one way to interpret an intriguing exchange that took place at a rally in Minnesota on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman took the microphone to say that Obama could not be trusted because he is an &quot;Arab&quot;   not a surprising misconception, given the Republicans who have taken to stressing Obama's middle name, Hussein. But McCain rebuked her: &quot;No, ma'am, he's a decent family man, a citizen, who I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues. And that's what this campaign is all about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not what this campaign is all about, and as McCain was speaking, his campaign ads were calling Obama a liar. But it's what the campaign could have been about, if McCain had really wanted it that way.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For up-to-the-minute stock market information, to participate in community discussion and for information and stories relating to a recession, visit Recession Watch 2008. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON   The Bush administration rushed to revamp the largest U.S. bailout plan in history Monday, working with executives of the nation's biggest banks to shift and shape new pieces and get desperately needed credit flowing. Stocks soared around the world in response to dramatic efforts here and overseas   and the possibility of even bolder American action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scrambling to catch up with events, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and the bankers were modeling many parts of their revamped program after strong initiatives in Europe, where governments put $2.3 trillion on the line Monday in guarantees and other emergency measures to save banks there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elements being considered for the overhauled U.S. program included not only the details for purchasing banks' bad assets   the major feature of the $700 billion bailout bill that sped through Congress   but also direct government purchases of stock in banks, an idea that Paulson surfaced only last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another initiative under consideration: providing government guarantees for the short-term loans banks make to each other, a vital credit avenue that has come under severe stress as fears have mounted over the hundreds of billions of dollars of losses that began with the meltdown of the subprime mortgage market in the United States more than a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend, Paulson had called the heads of the five biggest U.S. banks to come to Washington for face-to-face talks about the rescue plan, according to people briefed on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack, Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. CEO Jamie Dimon and Bank of America Corp. CEO Kenneth Lewis were all asked to attend, and there was a possibility that CEOs from some major regional banks would also participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats in Congress, while supportive of Paulson's desire to expand the program, complained that not enough strings were being attached, such as restricting excessive compensation for Wall Street executives who raked in millions of dollars in bonuses by pursuing risky investment strategies that have now helped push the U.S. financial system to the brink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government should purchase only stock in financial firms that agree to cut dividends paid to shareholders, adhere to strict limits on executive compensation and curb their use of exotic investment strategies, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, House Republicans and Democrats pushed for fresh action to stimulate the faltering economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats scheduled hearings to consider a postelection stimulus package that could cost as much as $150 billion. Republicans called for tax cuts and energy exploration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a campaign speech in Ohio, Democrat Barack Obama proposed a 90-day moratorium on home foreclosures at some banks and a two-year tax break for businesses that create new jobs. Republican John McCain promised a change in direction from the Bush administration's economic policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the Europeans, governments there said they were putting $2.3 trillion on the line, based on pledges from Britain, Germany, France, Spain, Austria and Portugal in recent days. To assist the European banks, the Federal Reserve here announced Monday that it was taking actions to assure enough U.S. dollars were available to meet demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government cannot just leave people on their own to be buffeted about,&quot; said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, McCain was asking darkly, &quot;Who is the real Senator Obama?&quot; Imagine, instead, if he had followed his own advice from the spring, when he repudiated a state party attack ad that he said &quot;distracts us from the very real differences we have with the Democrats.&quot; Imagine if he were challenging Obama on those policy differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm sure, in the crazed intensity of a presidential campaign, it's easy to start believing your consultants and television ads   believing that the other guy is dangerous and that only you can save the country. That must be especially true when the other guy is insulting you. The mud flies both ways in this campaign, with Obama and his allies relentlessly pounding McCain as out of touch, erratic, dishonest and, over and over again, dishonorable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And honor is at the core of McCain's self-image. He's been running for president, more on than off, for almost a decade, but his determination hasn't had much to do with a highly defined ideology, program or set of policies. What underlies his ambition are values: service, patriotism, duty, honor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be that it's easier for such a campaign to get blown off course. In an exceptionally pro-Democratic year, against an exceptionally unflappable opponent, it's not surprising that a campaign without bedrock policy goals would try first one thing, then another, with one of those things being character assassination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I certainly can't prove that a McCain campaign built on respect and attention to issues would be faring better than the real thing. Without Sarah Palin to rally the base, and without the insidious questioning of Obama's patriotism, McCain might be even further behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he also might be doing better   and he might be happier, too. That, at least, is one way to interpret an intriguing exchange that took place at a rally in Minnesota on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman took the microphone to say that Obama could not be trusted because he is an &quot;Arab&quot;   not a surprising misconception, given the Republicans who have taken to stressing Obama's middle name, Hussein. But McCain rebuked her: &quot;No, ma'am, he's a decent family man, a citizen, who I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues. And that's what this campaign is all about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not what this campaign is all about, and as McCain was speaking, his campaign ads were calling Obama a liar. But it's what the campaign could have been about, if McCain had really wanted it that way.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON   The Bush administration rushed to revamp the largest U.S. bailout plan in history Monday, working with executives of the nation's biggest banks to shift and shape new pieces and get desperately needed credit flowing. Stocks soared around the world in response to dramatic efforts here and overseas   and the possibility of even bolder American action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scrambling to catch up with events, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and the bankers were modeling many parts of their revamped program after strong initiatives in Europe, where governments put $2.3 trillion on the line Monday in guarantees and other emergency measures to save banks there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elements being considered for the overhauled U.S. program included not only the details for purchasing banks' bad assets   the major feature of the $700 billion bailout bill that sped through Congress   but also direct government purchases of stock in banks, an idea that Paulson surfaced only last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another initiative under consideration: providing government guarantees for the short-term loans banks make to each other, a vital credit avenue that has come under severe stress as fears have mounted over the hundreds of billions of dollars of losses that began with the meltdown of the subprime mortgage market in the United States more than a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend, Paulson had called the heads of the five biggest U.S. banks to come to Washington for face-to-face talks about the rescue plan, according to people briefed on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack, Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. CEO Jamie Dimon and Bank of America Corp. CEO Kenneth Lewis were all asked to attend, and there was a possibility that CEOs from some major regional banks would also participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats in Congress, while supportive of Paulson's desire to expand the program, complained that not enough strings were being attached, such as restricting excessive compensation for Wall Street executives who raked in millions of dollars in bonuses by pursuing risky investment strategies that have now helped push the U.S. financial system to the brink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government should purchase only stock in financial firms that agree to cut dividends paid to shareholders, adhere to strict limits on executive compensation and curb their use of exotic investment strategies, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, House Republicans and Democrats pushed for fresh action to stimulate the faltering economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats scheduled hearings to consider a postelection stimulus package that could cost as much as $150 billion. Republicans called for tax cuts and energy exploration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a campaign speech in Ohio, Democrat Barack Obama proposed a 90-day moratorium on home foreclosures at some banks and a two-year tax break for businesses that create new jobs. Republican John McCain promised a change in direction from the Bush administration's economic policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the Europeans, governments there said they were putting $2.3 trillion on the line, based on pledges from Britain, Germany, France, Spain, Austria and Portugal in recent days. To assist the European banks, the Federal Reserve here announced Monday that it was taking actions to assure enough U.S. dollars were available to meet demand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAMPAIGN TALK CROSSING THE LINE?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain and Sarah Palin are making charges at their rallies about Barack Obama's character that are beginning to translate into calls for the death of Obama. Every political campaign seems to turn from issues to name calling, but not every campaign inspires hatred. This is an ethical bright line. McCain-Palin must speak publicly and passionately that violence and hatred are not their goal and will not be tolerated by their campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David River </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assassination? Is that what &quot;taking off the gloves&quot; means to Sarah Palin? Recently in Jacksonville, Fla., she repeated her effort to associate Sen. Barack Obama with domestic terrorism. A man in the audience yelled very audibly, &quot;Kill him!&quot; and Palin said nothing in response to the outburst, according to reporters covering the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giving inflammatory speeches that call forth passion for assassinating Sen. Obama, who may be elected president of the United States in three weeks, may be the lowest point in American presidential campaigns, and certainly the most dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Sen. McCain could summon the most minimal &quot;patriotism,&quot; he would replace his running mate as one who has crossed the line in rhetorical innuendo, separating partisanship from inciting passion for assassination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guilford Dudley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medanales</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm appalled by the Obama campaign's mild response to Sarah Palin's charge that Obama pals around with terrorists, given her own support for the Alaska Independence Party. Palin has strong ties to the AIP, whose aim is the secession of Alaska from the United States. In a chilling quote, the founder of the AIP spoke of his intense hatred for our country. Palin addressed the 2008 convention, exhorting party members to &quot;keep up the good work.&quot; Her husband was an AIP member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proximate cause of the most devastating conflict ever fought on our shores, the Civil War, was the secession of the Southern states in 1861. Thus, I find Palin's current ties to the radical group to be far more relevant and frightening than any purported association between Obama and a man who was a &quot;terrorist&quot; nearly 50 years ago, whose acts Obama has condemned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign focuses on issues rather than personal attacks, but his failure to challenge Palin on this mater is inexcusable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josie Caruso</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding Rich Lowry's Oct. 8 column, &quot;Free speech for some, but not all?&quot;: By using the liberal rules against &quot;hate speech,&quot; he employs the term &quot;chilling effect&quot; to attack the Obama campaign for trying to shut down radio appearances by critics. These &quot;critics&quot; are liars and slanderers. According to Lowry, free speech comes without responsibility, and we should all be free to lie and slander, especially in a presidential election. I know about the Swift-boat ad to which Lowry refers. The Obama campaign requested a criminal investigation of it, and the Virginia federal judge's verdict to stop the ad was correct. The ad shows bloody aborted babies, calls Obama a baby murderer and a pro-abortionist! Obama has repeatedly stated he is not pro-abortion, except in cases of rape or incest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd like to ask Lowry what he thinks about the &quot;chilling effect&quot; Palin creates with her claim about Obama being &quot;pals with terrorists&quot; and the fact that statements like these may incite some wacko racist with a gun.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter fraud</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unbelievable that more attention is not being paid to outright voter fraud throughout the country and Barack Obama. Obama was a paid advocate for ACORN, and still may be. As reports now are growing regarding ACORN and growing voter registration fraud in many states, why is there not more outrage?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has said nothing about this downright fraud. We, as Americans, are endowed with one vote. This is something that is a responsibility and a gift. To see ACORN and Obama absolutely disrespect this and break the law is an affront to all American voters -- be they Democrat, Republican or Independent. This is an direct assault on democracy itself. Let's all condemn the ACORN practices and activities, and send the message to Obama that we want him to show leadership in condemning the same.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walking wounded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poor John Mc Cain. Hasn't he realized yet that he will never be president? Even if the Republicans win this election, everybody knows that it will be Mrs. Joe Six Pack Palin who will run the show, oops, I mean the country! At the last debate, McCain wandered and wandered and wandered and wandered around the stage while Sen. Obama spoke. McCain looked like a wounded moose that had been shot by Sarah Palin the last time she went hunting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the way, am I the only one who would like Mr. McCain to explain the part he played in our country's failure to try to rescue the remaining POWS left behind at the close of the Vietnam War?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacqueline Maret</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Choose empathy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Santa Fe Institute presented a lecture entitled, &quot;Our Inner Ape: On the Possibility of Empathy in Other Animals,&quot; which suggests recognition that humans actually are animals and might share some attributes found in other natural creatures; attributes that, demonstrated by evolution, possess social value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This way of looking at things brings to mind our current preoccupation with the national election and the candidates' images. McCain is depicted as the warrior fighting for the American way of life; a natural creature, but not an image that brings forth an identification of empathy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has an image that is ambivalent for the American psyche because he's labeled as &quot;black,&quot; and that's confusing for many voting citizens whose emotions have not been changed by civil-rights legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's depiction, however, is one of service to community and empathetic behavior. Perhaps the perception of empathy in our national leader could become the determinant image that America is seeking?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a roundup of the latest news from New Mexico's campaign trail. The general election is Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RFK Jr.: Voter fraud a &quot;bugaboo.&quot; A new Web ad by the McCain-Palin ticket works to link Sen. Barack Obama to ACORN, a group that has been accused of turning in fraudulent voter registration cards in several states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who toured Northern New Mexico on the stump for Obama on Friday, said such talk is a distraction by the Republican Party. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The idea of voter fraud is a bugaboo that's been erected by the Republicans as part of a national campaign to suppress voter registration and intimidate voters all over our country,&quot; he said in a phone interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's a real issue is organized voter suppression in states across the country,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent national reports have said that voters in at least six swing states, not including New Mexico, may have been wrongly removed from voter rolls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spotlight on New Mexico: This week, Newshour with Jim Lehrer will spotlight the role Albuquerque and New Mexico will play in the Nov. 4 election on KNME, Channel 5 Monday through Friday from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters can also participate in two town hall meetings next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This afternoon from 3 to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4 p.m., correspondent Ray Suarez will host a live town hall meeting at the UNM Continuing Education Auditorium. Doors open at 2:30 for the free, public event that will focus on what role New Mexico and the media play in the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event will be broadcast on KUNM, 89.9 FM and streamed live on KNME's Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, voters can attend a town hall forum and debate between the candidates running for the 3rd Congressional District.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event includes a forum from 1 to 5 p.m., and a candidate debate from 7 to 8 p.m. at Rio Rancho High School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forum is put on by public TV and New Mexico First, which is asking you to sign up on its Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate will be taped and will air at 7 p.m. Oct. 16 on KNME.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sample ballots online: If you want to check out your ballot choices long before you get in line to vote, the Secretary of State's Web site can help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visit www.sos.state.nm.us to find samples.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global warming, whatever its threat-level and imminence may be, has shaken off the last of its political Doubting Thomsases -- and it's been encouraging to see both presidential candidates addressing the issue without rolling their eyes or smirking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain and Barack Obama both have advocated alternatives to fossil fuels -- and, in a realistic reaction to the attitude of decades past, have made nuclear energy part of their approach to the future. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain proposes a nuclear-power resurgence featuring dozens of new generating stations. Obama takes a more cautious approach, welcoming nuclear as part of a new combination of energy sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New Mexico, senatorial candidate Steve Pearce sees a future for nuclear power. So, too, does Tom Udall, whose concerns are the same as he's always held -- and which we share: What does humankind do with nuclear waste? And if we don't do the right thing with it, do we hasten the end of our species and all the others?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a dozen power-plant proposals in front of it -- and expects to see twice that many in the next couple of years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But our country still is under the shadow of Three Mile Island, and the partial meltdown of the Pennsylvania reactor that prompted a panic 30 years ago. And of course there was Chernobyl, and the death and destruction wrought by that plant in the Ukraine in 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chernobyl was chalked up to incompetence. At Three Mile Island, the faulty unit was repaired, and soon was setting endurance records. Those accidents sobered the world up on nuclear power -- and, in the process, raised awareness of all aspects of that energy source, including storage of spent fuel rods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 60,000 tons of spent fuel lying around our nation's nuclear plants -- carefully contained, yet cause for questions about its long-range safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yucca Mountain, out in the wastelands of Nevada, by now should be where the stuff is gathered -- and stored in relative safety until recycling science is perfected. However, Nevadans' opposition to Yucca Mountain is like New Mexicans' was to WIPP, the salt-cave repository for lower-level nuclear waste down near Carlsbad -- but even more vehement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the desert west of Salt Lake City, a commercial nuclear landfill is looking for customers -- even from Europe, where nuclear is a huge part of the energy supply, but where little attention has gone to long-term waste disposal: just cake it in glass, and worry about it later ... Utahans are worried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since nuclear energy seems headed for a renaissance of sorts regardless of who wins in November, the winners must get serious about spent fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To us, it looks like opportunities not only at Yucca Mountain -- where instead of treating the place as a burial ground, an emphasis should be on safe, but temporary, storage. Then our nation must recycle nuclear waste back into fuel, instead of counting on a new wave of wholesale uranium mining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Los Alamos National Laboratory, with all its nuclear knowledge and scientific talent, it should be given greater roles in fuel-recycling and neutralizing of nonrecyclable material, if that proves to be the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If nuclear power is to become a major player in a post-carbon era, its still-hot byproduct demands at least as much attention as its clean-power potential.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest issue facing us is the economy. Obama is in a better position than McCain to fix the economy. Why? He'll have a filibuster-proof Democratic majority in both houses of Congress, where McCain would face legislative gridlock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, unlike McCain, is not a deregulator. McCain, for all his talk of being a maverick, is a Republican at heart and his people are Republicans to the core. The Republican economic plan is broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates say that we need change and that they are the best candidate of change. But McCain's campaign wants to talk about something other than the economy. The difference seems to be that Obama wants to change what's broken in the economy and John McCain just seems to want to change the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Coogan </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am the co-founder of PureColor, Inc. a New Mexico startup that has patented an innovative coloring technology that is environmentally safe and sustainable. In order for a company like ours to be successful, we need a president who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will put his money where his mouth is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's plan would create 5 million new green-collar jobs by investing $150 billion in clean energy over the next ten years. The green building and sustainable materials industries are sure to experience significant growth as a result of Obama's initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, on the other hand, has demonstrated that he is more interested in protecting the status quo and has failed to adequately address the environmental, health and safety needs of our great country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Auger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have we figured out yet that rich politicians (and their trophy wives/running mates) don't care about us, unless we're rich? Anyone out there who is still voting the John McCain-Sarah Palin ticket would vote for a pig in lipstick if it was a Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest radio ad from the McCain campaign on Obama's health plan shows just how desperate they are. More lies and distortions will not help a failed political party win support among mature-thinking voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Wells</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One candidate has consistently asked us to rise up, come together and be our best selves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other, sadly fallen, now appeals to our worst traits, firing up that fear-based mob mentality of hatred and bigotry. Which will we choose?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sean Gardner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My head is spinning after reading about Cindy McCain's father and his involvement in the Ruidoso Downs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you contrast him with Michelle Obama's father, who worked each day with a devastating handicap, the difference is startling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">P. Elizabeth Ross</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain, the famous American war hero, is hiding behind women's skirts. He lets Sarah Palin throw grenades at Barack Obama by using guilt by association to make him seem un-American. McCain had ample opportunity to attack Obama to his face during the presidential debates. Instead he had the women -- Sarah Palin and his wife, Cindy, do his dirty work by launching scurrilous attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, his &quot;heroic&quot; actions should come as no surprise. After all, he dumped his first wife, ailing after a tragic accident, to marry a younger and wealthier woman, whose fortune helped him launch his career and has continued to help him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, he selected an unqualified woman to serve as his vice president in order to boost his poll numbers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bemis bends truth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's time for columnist Gregg Bemis to retire. First, he decides that it might be cute to give the two major political parties the names &quot;capitalist&quot; and &quot;socialist. Capitalism is an economic system, not this country's governing system (democracy: government by the people for the people, remember?).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he repeats a lie pulled directly from a McCain&nbsp;ad that says that Franklin Raines, who left Fannie Mae in disgrace in 2004, &quot;became an adviser to presidential hopeful Barack Obama,&quot; a woeful attempt to blame the market meltdown on Sen. Obama that has clearly been proven false by the fact-checking media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign chairman was a lobbyist accepting money on behalf of Fannie Mae as recently as this summer. If The New Mexican is going to continue to give space to Bemis, it should fact-check his columns. Opinion is one thing; knowingly promoting falsehoods quite another.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A founding concept</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Santa Fe County expects the oil and gas industry to pay their actual costs of doing business, attorney William Carr accuses us of &quot;not In my backyard attitudes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If people protecting their &quot;yards&quot; are so evil, what shall we say of Carr's cronies?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They invade our &quot;backyards,&quot; tell us we have no say, dig up the lawns, make off with what's underneath, demand we build them new driveways at our expense, leave the yards strewn with trash and spilled glop, turn record profits doing it, and then sneer, &quot;You gotta problem with that, elitist NIMBY scum?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitution guarantees our right to be &quot;secure in our homes and effects,&quot; but oddly enough doesn't mention the right to pollute for profit. Guess the founders were elitist NIMBYs too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kim Sorvig</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush may be a lame duck, but he and his cohorts haven't lost their ability to trick legislators (including those Democrats who never learn) and defraud the public. After encouraging greed and corruption until an enormous fiscal crisis developed, Bush's minions screamed doomsday (thus guaranteeing the crisis) so that a rescue plan aimed primarily at helping Wall Street, not at aiding the average American nor solving the basic problem, could be rushed through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having made sure that the military-industrial complex and oil companies could gain billions through the Iraq war (never mind the resulting dead and maimed), and the ultra-rich could become ultra-richer through tax breaks, on their way out the Bush administration managed a final good deed for its friends on Wall Street. Never say that Bush was not a successful president; he has been astoundingly successful in looking after those few he became president to serve.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flaunt it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why are Democrats afraid to embrace the liberal foundation of their most notable achievements? It was liberals who advocated for and established Social Security more than 70 years ago. It was liberals who advocated for and established Medicare and Medicaid to provide adequate health coverage for the elderly and needy; equal rights laws for all races and genders; and a minimum wage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was liberals who advocated for and established financial regulations to protect the citizenry during and following The Great Depression. And it was the &quot;Compassionate Conservatism&quot; group who dismantled these regulations and brought us to our present financial meltdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enough! Let us embrace progressive liberalism and denounce the regressive compassionate conservatism that has led us to our current disastrous situation. We owe it to ourselves and the generations to follow.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every time I walk into a corporate store and look inside the shirt, pants, whatever, to read the labels and see 'Made in China' (or Jamaica, India, etc.), I see children chained to a machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typically, I begin to picture their impoverished nation and their family. Typically, I begin to hate the ignorance in which America lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wonder why our government would place an embargo on products from Cuba because of communism and not on products that use child labor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">$1 or $2 dollars more: that is all it costs us to have clothes made by an adult for a fair wage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hear so much complaining about the U.S. minimum wage being too low; I think it is better than $2 a day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Udall gets vote</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerning the article on the assistance Reps. Tom Udall and Steve Pearce give constituents: I have written a petition to add a class to the Special Exposure Cohort of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act. This would allow sick cold-war veterans to be compensated for radiation-induced cancers without having to undergo the arduous dose reconstruction the program normally requires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I sent a simple request to Pearce and Udall; first, to contact the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety and request that petition be qualified for evaluation; second, to contact the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health and request that the board meet here in New Mexico to review the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I did not even receive a response from Pearce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Udall on the other hand has certainly done more than that. His office has assisted with obtaining reports that I needed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">778 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON   Convicted felon Tony Rezko. Unrepentant terrorist Bill Ayers. And the race-baiting Rev. Jeremiah Wright. It is hard to think of any presidential candidate before Barack Obama sporting associations with three more execrable characters. Yet let the McCain campaign raise the issue, and the mainstream media begin fulminating about dirty campaigning tinged with racism and McCarthyite guilt by association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But associations are important. They provide a significant insight into character. They are particularly relevant in relation to a potential president as new, unknown, opaque and self-contained as Obama. With the economy overshadowing everything, it may be too late politically to be raising this issue. But that does not make it, as conventional wisdom holds, in any way illegitimate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has only himself to blame for the bad timing. He should months ago have begun challenging Obama's associations, before the economic meltdown allowed the Obama campaign (and the mainstream media, which is to say the same thing) to dismiss the charges as an act of desperation by the trailing candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain had his chance back in April when the North Carolina Republican Party ran a gubernatorial campaign ad that included the linking of Obama with Jeremiah Wright. The ad was duly denounced by The New York Times and other deep thinkers as racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was patently absurd. Racism is treating people differently and invidiously on the basis of race. Had any white presidential candidate had a close 20-year association with a white preacher overtly spreading race hatred from the pulpit, that candidate would have been not just universally denounced and deemed unfit for office but written out of polite society entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, John McCain in his infinite wisdom, and with his overflowing sense of personal rectitude, joined the braying mob in denouncing that perfectly legitimate ad, saying it had no place in any campaign. In doing so, McCain unilaterally disarmed himself, rendering off-limits Obama's associations, an issue that even Hillary Clinton addressed more than once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's political career was launched with Ayers giving him a fundraiser in his living room. If a Republican candidate had launched his political career at the home of an abortion-clinic bomber   even a repentant one   he would not have been able to run for dogcatcher in Podunk. And Ayers shows no remorse. His only regret is that he &quot;didn't do enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why are these associations important? Do I think Obama is as corrupt as Rezko? Or shares Wright's angry racism or Ayers' unreconstructed 1960s radicalism?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. But that does not make these associations irrelevant. They tell us two important things about Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, his cynicism and ruthlessness. He found these men useful, and use them he did. Would you attend a church whose pastor was spreading racial animosity from the pulpit? Would you even shake hands with   let alone serve on two boards with   an unrepentant terrorist, whether he bombed U.S. military installations or abortion clinics?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Americans would not, on the grounds of sheer indecency. Yet Obama did, if not out of conviction then out of expediency. He was a young man on the make, an unknown outsider working his way into Chicago politics. He played the game with everyone, without qualms and with obvious success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is not the first politician to rise through a corrupt political machine. But he is one of the rare few to then have the audacity to present himself as a transcendent healer, hovering above and bringing redemption to the &quot;old politics&quot;   of the kind he had enthusiastically embraced in Chicago in the service of his own ambition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, and even more disturbing than the cynicism, is the window these associations give on Obama's core beliefs. He doesn't share Rev. Wright's poisonous views of race nor Ayers' views, past and present, about the evil that is American society. But Obama clearly did not consider these views beyond the pale. For many years he swam easily and without protest in that fetid pond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now. Today, on the threshold of the presidency, Obama concedes the odiousness of these associations, which is why he has severed them. But for the years in which he sat in Wright's pews and shared common purpose on boards with Ayers, Obama considered them a legitimate, indeed unremarkable, part of social discourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you? Obama is a man of first-class intellect and first-class temperament. But his character remains highly suspect. There is a difference between temperament and character. Equanimity is a virtue. Tolerance of the obscene is not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warren Buffet supports and counsels Obama while Donald Trump endorses McCain. Now just which of those two entrepreneurs would you pick to invest your money?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sun-News disagrees with Lee Rawson's positions. But because he has the experience and influence to carry out those positions, you endorse him. Do I have that right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It looks like all the time we have spent checking the presidential candidates' stances on the issues that are important to us has been wasted. ACORN has been busy registering cats, dead people, the Dallas Cowboys football team, etc. They will steal the election in Ohio and other states for Obama, and our votes will be wasted. One thing that could help this situation would be requiring photo IDs for voters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gas prices in the Las Cruces area are out of touch with reality. The economy is suffering, people just don't have the extra money. Yet gas is selling in Albuquerque for $2.85. Why are we forced to pay upward of $3.45 for gas?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I expect every politician to repeat their party's talking points. But when Udall blames President Bush and Congressman Pearce for the economic crisis   ignoring the fact that Bush and the Republicans tried repeatedly to pass legislation reining in Fannie and Freddie, but were opposed by Waters, Frank, Dodd, Schumer and company, it is time for the &quot;L&quot; word. Tom is lying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the worst of times to have a vote on bonds to raise our property taxes. I just lost thousands in my retirement funds. Vote no on these boondoggle bond issues on Nov. 4. We taxpayers have had enough abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Jane Garcia has stated she is against voter ID because it is unfair to poor people. I may be poor, but I still want my vote to count. If I need a voter ID, I will just get one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters, beware. A few years ago, Waded Crusado and Ben Woods told us that if we approved a $23 million bond issue, they would expand Gardener Hall and create a science quadrangle. However, they are not expanding Gardener at all, but will instead use the money to turn it into a politically-correct &quot;green&quot; showplace. Physics department space is actually being reduced, not increased. Now they promise to build a new arts complex, if we will just approve the upcoming $19 million bond issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rush is reporting that 5 million illegal aliens got mortgages using stolen social security numbers. But the bailout plan saves such individuals because ACORN and La Raza somehow got their special interest needs written up in the plan. Their operatives in the Congress are high up enough, maybe Barney Frank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Afghanistan and Iraqi Veterans of America&quot; have released their report card on J. McCain, a &quot;D,&quot; saying that McCain's voting record does not reflect his talk. Does that surprise you? We don't need talk we need real action, McCain has never provided that for the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news media does a great job of chastising those people who abuse animals (animal hoarding). When will you do the same to the families of gang members and those that threaten human life? It is time to pull the noose tighter on gang activity in Do&ntilde;a Ana County and in Las Cruces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mc Cain and Palin are smearing Obama constantly. However, during the debate, McCain did not have the guts to confront Obama with all that he is accusing him of. It is not a maverick's attitude but the attitude of a coward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can all thank Jimmy Carter for creating the CRA (Community Reinvestment Act), Bill Clinton for expanding it, and the Democrats for sticking their heads in the sand when the problems were coming known. Go to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MGT_cSi7Rs and listen to the Democrats ignore the problems, then consider who you want running our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't want my vote nullified by someone voting illegally. The attorney general needs to investigate ACORN and these other groups and get this straightened out before the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simply amazing, a Californian is running against our hometown guy, New Mexico born and raised Lee Rawson. This Californian who graduated from the University of California who was an executive for Levi Strauss &amp; Company, a San Francisco-based group that openly supports the gay lifestyle and one that would love to get their hooks into our state's senate. Is there any wonder why this guy is trying to steal a New Mexico election with all of his out-of-state money? If it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it's usually a duck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush, former Sen. Gramm and their extreme conservative Republican associates such as Steve Pearce pushed their &quot;deregulation&quot; agenda for the past eight years. Now the country's economics are in ruins thanks to these brilliant politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the reason our economy and world markets are tanking is the fear that Barack Hussein Obama will be our next president. With Obama in the White House, Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the house, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid you will see the total conversion of our Democracy to socialism. Buy gold so you can bribe the Mexican Border Police to let you in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's fun to have Lee Rawson doing a robocall on how much he cares about education. Isn't this the same guy who called pre-kindergarten &quot;government control over our families&quot; and filibustered a bill that would have renovated crumbling schools? Hey Lee, it's not just election year that matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does McCain think he can pull wool over our eyes? Well not me, he's definitely not fooling me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the caller who said they didn't know how we can be Christian and want to drill holes in the earth. Well unless you want to continue to go to war for oil supply then you go. Were not destroying our planet, we are looking for better resources. If not, we will continue to be foreign oil dependents. Get your facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People say that Palin talks the way she does because she wants to connect with Americans. She talks to people as if they were children. Everyone is not the same. She's blowing it already, so it doesn't really matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want to know why there isn't any money for public assistance, and schools are cutting staff from these facilities. Where is the money going?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using Barack Obama's middle name, Hussein, should not be considered any sort of slander; it is just his legal name. Get over it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I just watched the Steve Pearce commercial. Same Republican lies and exaggerations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I just wanted to say that I saw an O&ntilde;ate High School teacher cussing and starting a physical altercation with someone else at the state fair. Is this the type of education that our kids are receiving and the example? How can we expect our children to do any better with these examples?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I guess since the upper and middle class will benefit from the bailout adjustments, has anyone stopped to wonder what is going to happen to the lower class? Where are our benefits?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does Obama do to get his poll so high? He is a liar, and if no one notices on the debate, he said drill. He stole ideas. He has always been against drilling. Now he wants to drill. I cannot believe people don't see this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was stunned to read that the Sun-News endorsed Rawson, dismissing his little &quot;paving incident&quot; so lightly. No wonder ethics have deteriorated. Who would have ever thought the day would come when a newspaper would condone wrongdoing publicly. Shame on you!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can anyone tell me why Greyhound is allowed to operate a bus station on Amador Avenue that has no bathrooms or vending machines and locks their doors at 5 p.m.? They expect the surrounding businesses to provide services to their clients. The city council needs to look into this. If you want revitalization of downtown, move the bus station! A good spot for the bus station would be the old kick boxing building on Avenida De Mesilla. It has good on/off access to the highway, bathrooms, and vending machines could be added. Please Mr. Mayor and the members of City Council, think about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Obama didn't know he was hanging with terrorists, then he's too stupid to be president! Did his wife, Michelle, know she was working with the wife of Bill Ayers at a law firm, which hired Barbara because after all those bombings she participated in, she couldn't get her attorney's license and had to work as a clerk?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If everyone wants to criticize Palin go ahead. Well, I can't stand Michelle Obama. She is weird, hangs with terrorists, and her famous comment: &quot;For the first time in my life I am proud to be an American.&quot; Do we want a first lady to be anti-American?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON   Convicted felon Tony Rezko. Unrepentant terrorist Bill Ayers. And the race-baiting Rev. Jeremiah Wright. It is hard to think of any presidential candidate before Barack Obama sporting associations with three more execrable characters. Yet let the McCain campaign raise the issue, and the mainstream media begin fulminating about dirty campaigning tinged with racism and McCarthyite guilt by association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But associations are important. They provide a significant insight into character. They are particularly relevant in relation to a potential president as new, unknown, opaque and self-contained as Obama. With the economy overshadowing everything, it may be too late politically to be raising this issue. But that does not make it, as conventional wisdom holds, in any way illegitimate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has only himself to blame for the bad timing. He should months ago have begun challenging Obama's associations, before the economic meltdown allowed the Obama campaign (and the mainstream media, which is to say the same thing) to dismiss the charges as an act of desperation by the trailing candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain had his chance back in April when the North Carolina Republican Party ran a gubernatorial campaign ad that included the linking of Obama with Jeremiah Wright. The ad was duly denounced by The New York Times and other deep thinkers as racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was patently absurd. Racism is treating people differently and invidiously on the basis of race. Had any white presidential candidate had a close 20-year association with a white preacher overtly spreading race hatred from the pulpit, that candidate would have been not just universally denounced and deemed unfit for office but written out of polite society entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, John McCain in his infinite wisdom, and with his overflowing sense of personal rectitude, joined the braying mob in denouncing that perfectly legitimate ad, saying it had no place in any campaign. In doing so, McCain unilaterally disarmed himself, rendering off-limits Obama's associations, an issue that even Hillary Clinton addressed more than once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's political career was launched with Ayers giving him a fundraiser in his living room. If a Republican candidate had launched his political career at the home of an abortion-clinic bomber   even a repentant one   he would not have been able to run for dogcatcher in Podunk. And Ayers shows no remorse. His only regret is that he &quot;didn't do enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why are these associations important? Do I think Obama is as corrupt as Rezko? Or shares Wright's angry racism or Ayers' unreconstructed 1960s radicalism?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. But that does not make these associations irrelevant. They tell us two important things about Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, his cynicism and ruthlessness. He found these men useful, and use them he did. Would you attend a church whose pastor was spreading racial animosity from the pulpit? Would you even shake hands with   let alone serve on two boards with   an unrepentant terrorist, whether he bombed U.S. military installations or abortion clinics?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Americans would not, on the grounds of sheer indecency. Yet Obama did, if not out of conviction then out of expediency. He was a young man on the make, an unknown outsider working his way into Chicago politics. He played the game with everyone, without qualms and with obvious success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is not the first politician to rise through a corrupt political machine. But he is one of the rare few to then have the audacity to present himself as a transcendent healer, hovering above and bringing redemption to the &quot;old politics&quot;   of the kind he had enthusiastically embraced in Chicago in the service of his own ambition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, and even more disturbing than the cynicism, is the window these associations give on Obama's core beliefs. He doesn't share Rev. Wright's poisonous views of race nor Ayers' views, past and present, about the evil that is American society. But Obama clearly did not consider these views beyond the pale. For many years he swam easily and without protest in that fetid pond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now. Today, on the threshold of the presidency, Obama concedes the odiousness of these associations, which is why he has severed them. But for the years in which he sat in Wright's pews and shared common purpose on boards with Ayers, Obama considered them a legitimate, indeed unremarkable, part of social discourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you? Obama is a man of first-class intellect and first-class temperament. But his character remains highly suspect. There is a difference between temperament and character. Equanimity is a virtue. Tolerance of the obscene is not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Playing off the second debate, the Obama campaign released a TV ad Wednesday that continued the criticism that McCain's health care plan included taxing employer-based health care benefits. &quot;Instead of fixing health care, he wants to tax it,&quot; the ad says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign, in turn, put out a TV spot contending that Obama promises nearly $1 trillion in new spending in the wake of the $700 billion financial rescue plan Congress approved. &quot;Sound crazy? the ad asks. &quot;It is.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took just eight minutes into Tuesday's presidential debate for Republican candidate McCain to land the first blow, blaming Obama and Democrats for the collapse of mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're the ones that, with the encouragement of Sen. Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama responded: &quot;I've got to correct a little bit of Sen. McCain's history, not surprisingly. ... In fact, Sen. McCain's campaign chairman's firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae, not me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign manager Rick Davis has a stake in a Washington lobbying firm that received thousands of dollars a month from Freddie Mac until recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis is one of the many figures in both campaigns and near them who have been targeted as reasons why each should not be supported. As they head back on the road Wednesday, both campaigns say those associations would again be highlighted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain running mate Sarah Palin has questioned Obama's ties to William Ayers, who 40 years ago was a member of the Weather Underground, a radical group that claimed responsibility for a series of bombings. Obama had a limited relationship with Ayers, who lives in the same neighborhood and teaches at the University of Illinois at Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats have criticized McCain for his role in a 1980s banking scandal. He was one of five senators who had accepted contributions from Charles Keating Jr., a real estate speculator and savings and loan owner. Keating's institution failed and cost many investors in uninsured financial products their life savings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither figure came up during Tuesday's debate. Nor did either candidate call the other a liar, a familiar charge in this contentious campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The closest: &quot;You know, Sen. McCain, I think the Straight Talk Express lost a wheel on that one,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a discussion of an energy bill, McCain offered up a two-word phrase that drew a quick reaction from the Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know who voted for it? You might never know. That one,&quot; McCain said, pointing at his opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said after the debate, &quot;John McCain was all over the map on the issues, and he is so angry about the state of his campaign that he referred to Barack Obama as &quot;that one'   last time he couldn't look at Sen. Obama, this time he couldn't say his name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also suggested some evasiveness on Obama's part: &quot;Nailing down Sen. Obama's various tax proposals is like nailing Jell-O to the wall. There has been five or six of them, and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one pointed confrontation on foreign policy, Obama bluntly challenged McCain's steadiness. &quot;This is a guy who sang &quot;bomb, bomb, bomb Iran,' who called for the annihilation of North Korea   that I don't think is an example of speaking softly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That came in response to McCain's accusation that Obama had threatened to invade Pakistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said his rival &quot;was wrong about Iraq and the surge. He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia. And in his short career he does not understand our national security challenges. We don't have time for on-the-job training.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama countered with a trace of sarcasm, &quot;There are some things I don't understand. I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and al Qaida are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us. That was Senator McCain's judgment and it was the wrong judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does it still mean a thing if New Mexico loses its swing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years, political activists, political reporters and political junkies in this enchanted land have shared a certain pride that New Mexico in recent presidential elections, despite our modest stake of five electoral votes, has been a major swing state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could this be changing? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true, we've seen candidate visits: John McCain in Albuquerque on Monday, Barack Obama in Espa&ntilde;ola a few weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But according to statistics from The Wisconsin Advertising Project, a creature of the University of Wisconsin Political Science Department, neither campaign seems to be spending that much money in the battle for New Mexico airwaves, at least compared with other battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a WAP news release Wednesday, Obama spent $185,000 on television advertising directed at New Mexico between Sept. 28 and Saturday, while, during the same period, McCain spent $144,000. In the 15 states in which both candidates are advertising, Obama spent more in 13 states than he did in New Mexico. McCain spent more in 14 states during this period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Granted, you're going to pay more for television ads in bigger states with larger populations and more TV markets than New Mexico. But states similar in size to New Mexico, such as Nevada and New Hampshire, are seeing more political ads than our state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, WAP showed Albuquerque stations in late September and early October sold more political ad time to presidential candidates than any other market except Miami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this year, the Albuquerque television market, according to WAP, isn't in the top 10 markets for either McCain or Obama. McCain's top 10 list does include El Paso, whose television stations are watched by Southern New Mexico households. There, the Republican aired ads 474 times last week, making El Paso No. 8 in McCain's top 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the study, Albuquerque ranked 20th for total political ads last week. The campaigns, the two political parties and outside groups attacking one candidate or the other bought a total of 960 airings on Albuquerque stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not as if they're not paying attention to the West. The top market for political ads was Las Vegas, Nev., (a total of 2,020 spots) while No. 2 was Denver (with 2,007 spots.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why aren't the campaigns spending that much for New Mexico television ads?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked that question in a telephone interview Wednesday, Sarah Niebler, deputy director of The Wisconsin Advertising Project, said, &quot;I can't speak to the strategies of the campaigns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she pointed to polling figures compiled by Pollster.com. Obama is leading McCain by 6 percentage points in New Mexico, according to Pollster, which averages several polls. In Nevada, Pollster shows Obama leading by less than 2 percentage points. In both Pollster and RealClearPolitics.com, another site that averages poll numbers, New Mexico for a few weeks has been listed as &quot;leaning Obama&quot; while Nevada continues to be a &quot;tossup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if McCain's numbers start improving in New Mexico, expect to see more ads from both camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beware of Tony: Santa Fe County Clerk Valerie Espinoza told me this week that somebody out there is calling voters, falsely claiming to be from her office and trying to get Social Security numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Espinoza, the calls are being made by a man who identifies himself as &quot;Tony,&quot; telling voters their voter registrations have been denied and asking them to dial a certain telephone number to clear it up. Those who call are asked for personal information such as Social Security numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First of all, Espinoza says, that number is not associated with her office. She also said her office wouldn't ask for such information over the phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, she said, there's nobody named Tony who works for her. &quot;I even checked the temporary workers we hired, and there's no Tony, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Espinoza had some good advice that law enforcement officials frequently give: Don't give strangers personal information over the phone. That's a good way to get your identity stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E-mailing the debate: I watched Tuesday's presidential debate at a Santa Fe Community College watch party. Luckily, I wasn't trying to keep up with my work e-mail. During the debate, and for a few minutes after it ended, I received 38 e-mails from the Obama campaign, most of them with the subject line &quot;Debate Reality Check.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the night was done, both sides sent out e-mail news releases declaring their candidate the winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some reason, the McCain camp didn't e-mail me its version of reality checks. I suspect I'm just not on that list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But don't worry, guys. I think my delete finger needs medical attention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON   In a rare coordinated move, the Federal Reserve and other major central banks from around the world slashed interest rates Wednesday to prevent a mushrooming financial crisis from becoming a global economic meltdown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision sent Wall Street on a roller coaster ride. The major indexes moved in and out of positive territory, with the Dow Jones industrials at times falling more than 200 points or rising more than 100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overseas markets tumbled on worries that the move wouldn't immediately help ease the pain from the financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed reduced its key rate from 2 percent to 1.5 percent. In Europe, which also has been hard hit by the financial crisis, the Bank of England cut its rate by half a point to 4.5 percent and the European Central Bank sliced its rate by half a point to 3.75 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central banks of China, Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland also cut rates. The Bank of Japan said it strongly supported the actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The recent intensification of the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks to growth,&quot; the Fed said in explaining the coordinated action, the latest in a series of bold moves meant to pry open tight lending and revive the global economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dow Jones industrials, already down 875 points this week, rose 85 points in afternoon trading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said Wednesday that global financial markets remain severely strained, underscoring the need for quick action to implement the government's $700 billion rescue program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed's action will reduce borrowing costs almost immediately for U.S. bank customers whose home equity and other floating-rate loans are tied to the prime interest rate. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other banks cut their prime rate by half a point to 4.5 percent after the Fed announcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesman Tony Fratto welcomed the cooperation among the Fed and other countries' central banks to battle the crisis. &quot;It's important and helpful that central banks are working in a coordinated way to deal with stress in the financial system,&quot; Fratto said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was in Denver Wednesday to tour a hospital, also praised the decision. But she said Congress may need to go back into session to pass another economic stimulus package worth $150 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first economic plan this year cost $168 billion and sent tax rebate checks to most individuals and couples and awarded tax breaks to businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House did pass a $61 billion economic aid proposal last month before lawmakers left Capitol Hill ahead of the Nov. 4 election. But a similar plan failed to pass the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's presidential contenders also embraced the action. &quot;This is a global crisis that requires a global solution,&quot; said Democrat Barack Obama. Republican rival John McCain hoped it would contain the &quot;financial crisis spreading across the globe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts were skeptical that the coordinated rate reductions would do much to turn things around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At first blush, while this is a big step, it is unlikely to prove sufficient to stem the rot. Additional rate cuts are likely and further measures to inject liquidity and re-capitalize banks are needed,&quot; said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at the investment firm Brown Brothers Harriman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on attacks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Steve Terrell</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Mexican</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALBUQUERQUE -- In a blistering speech at The University of New Mexico on Monday, Republican presidential candidate John McCain tore into his opponent Barack Obama, attacking the Democrat's honesty, experience, campaign contributors and roots in Chicago politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And McCain, speaking to a crowd of about 1,000 in the Student Union Building Ballroom, repeatedly tried to paint Obama as something of a mysterious stranger, asking repeatedly, &quot;Who is the real Senator Obama?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain seemed to be purposely trying to fuel lingering doubts some undecided voters have about Obama, who burst on the national scene only four years ago, the same year he was elected to the U.S. Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't just show up out of nowhere,&quot; McCain said. &quot;You all, America knows me. You know my strengths and my faults. You know my story, my convictions. You need to know who you're putting in the White House and where that candidate came from and what he or she believes in. And you need to know now, before it is time to choose. Even at this late hour in the campaign, there are essential things that we don't know about Senator Obama or the record he brings to this campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in his speech, the Arizona senator said, &quot;What does he plan for America? In short, who is the real Barack Obama? My friends, you ask such questions and all you get is another angry barrage of insults.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's speech, described by some national reporters as McCain's harshest attack yet on Obama, fits the tone of McCain's most recent attack ad, which calls Obama &quot;dishonorable&quot; and &quot;dangerous&quot; and starts out asking, &quot;Who is Barack Obama?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said McCain, &quot;whenever I've questioned his policies or his record, he's called me a liar. ... Senator Obama will try to distract you from noticing that he never answers serious and legitimate questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me reply in the plainest terms I know,&quot; McCain said. &quot;I don't need lessons about telling the truth to the American people. And if I ever needed any improvement in that regard, I probably wouldn't seek advice from a Chicago politician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speech seemed aimed at the national media. Except to acknowledge retiring Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., who had spoken before McCain arrived, he barely mentioned the state. He also bucked political tradition by not mentioning any New Mexico candidates. Republican Senate candidate Steve Pearce was at the event, but didn't speak and wasn't name-checked by McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attacked Obama for accepting campaign contributions from executives of Fannie Mae (The Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (Federal Home Mortgage Corporation), both of which recently were seized by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has received more money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac than any other senator in history, with the exception of the chairman of the committee overseeing them,&quot; McCain charged. &quot;If Senator Obama is such a champion of financial regulation, why didn't he support these regulations that could have prevented this crisis in the first place? He won't tell you, but you deserve an answer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign later responded with a list of 26 McCain advisers and fundraisers who have been registered lobbyists for the two mortgage companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain charged that Obama had &quot;refused to disclose the people who are funding his campaign.&quot; He pointed to $33,000 &quot;in illegal foreign funds from Palestinian donors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newsweek magazine reported earlier this year that two Palestinian brothers in the Gaza Strip paid $33,000 for a bulk order of T-shirts from the Obama campaign's online store. &quot;The brothers had listed their address as 'Ga.,' which the campaign took to mean Georgia rather than Gaza. The campaign later returned the money,&quot; The Washington Post reported Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he spent a lot of time talking about Obama, one person McCain barely mentioned was President Bush. The only time he said the Republican president's name was when he said, &quot;Both Senator Obama and I differ with President Bush's economic policies. (Obama) thinks taxes are too low. I think spending is too high.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How might McCain's attacks sway undecided voters in the swing state of New Mexico? One Corrales woman, who told reporters before the speech that she was undecided, said after the speech that she's leaning toward McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the speech, Diana Diaz, 38, a pre-med student at UNM, said while most of her family supports Obama, she wants to hear more from both candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After McCain spoke, Diaz said McCain's implication Obama &quot;came out of nowhere&quot; resonated. McCain never mentioned -- and never has publicly mentioned -- discredited Internet rumors that Obama has ties to Islamic terrorists. But Diaz said McCain's talk about Palestinian campaign contributions reminded her of Internet conspiracy theories that Obama is part of a terrorist plan to destroy America. While she said she's not sure whether she believes this theory, the Palestinian campaign contributions &quot;makes me wonder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highlighting the intensity of the bad blood between the two campaigns, during the speech and immediately afterward, several protesters on both sides demonstrated outside of the Student Union Building. One woman held a sign saying &quot;Fascists (sic) Pigs For McCain,&quot; while nearby a man held a sign equating Obama with Hitler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But walking together as they left the speech were two women, one with McCain buttons, the other wearing an Obama sticker. Tracie Sawyer, 43, the McCain supporter, and Phoebe Tea, 36, the Obama fan, said the two are friends in Farmington despite their political differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Obama was here, I'd go see him too,&quot; said Sawyer, who volunteers for McCain in Farmington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both sides need to respect the other,&quot; said Tea. She added that her husband supports McCain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAS CRUCES   The Joker from Batman, presidential candidate masks and anything funny or sexy are early hot-sellers for Halloween 2008, according to merchants in the costume business. But the best outfit could be an original one-of-a-kind costume you put together yourself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trini Rivera, owner of The Gen! said Las Crucens usually start looking for costumes during the summer months and this year was no exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If anything, I think it's earlier than usual,&quot; Rivera said. &quot;This year, people seem to be doing research, looking for something they can put together themselves, instead of the commercial ones, or they want something of theatrical quality, something no one else has.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If so, they live in the right place. Las Cruces has several stores that sell or rent full costumes, but it's a great year to get creative, too. Many kids and adults start with a mask or a few accessories and create their own custom ensembles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At The Gen!, where the offerings include everything from 1950s saddle shoes to wigs, hats, helmets and special makeup, rental costs range from $15 for a fancy jacket rental to $50 for gorilla or Chewbacca suits. The average rental is about $25 and all the store's costumes are available for either sale or rent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special sections in the store include &quot;ethnic clothes&quot; from India, Mexico, the Orient, Africa and Hawaii. There are also vintage sections devoted to kitsch and classics from the 1940s, '50s, '60, '70s and '80s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other costume categories include Renaissance, Greek, Egyptian, Saloon Girls, Zombies, Pirates, ETs and a row of smaller outfits for &quot;boys, girls and babes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One-of-a-kind costumes are also a specialty at La Vieja in Mesilla, a popular resource for those seeking outfits for Halloween, Dia de los Muertos and the Renaissance ArtsFaire. Owner Carolyn Dye reports her collection of about 700 assorted costumes is also popular for local theatrical productions, movie producers and international costume collectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Popular rental choices, at $25 to $50, include vintage border looks, Renaissance and bridal gowns, Victorian and other period looks, trajes (mariachi outfits) and cowboy and Indian garb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the commercial realm, early best sellers are garb inspired by the summer blockbuster &quot;The Dark Knight,&quot; especially The Joker, reportedly popular at the seasonal Halloween superstores   Spirit Halloween in the old Toys R Us location and Halloween Bootique at the Mesilla Valley Mall   as well as ABC Party World in Las Cruces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't keep The Joker in stock,&quot; said Natasha Acuna of Halloween Bootique. &quot;For women, sexy cops, maids and referees are popular. Boys like Iron Man or Batman. And girls want Hannah Montana wigs or &quot;High School Musical' costumes, especially Sharpay and Gabriella.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her Bootique colleague Mark Anderson reports that vintage looks are big, too. &quot;It seems like every adult male wants to be the Incredible Hulk and older ladies are looking for costumes like Flapper dresses and anything from the 1930s and 1940s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pirates and sexy looks for the ladies are early hits along with &quot;neon colors. Everyone wants to be neon this year,&quot; reports Amber Perez at trendy Hot Topic in the Mesilla Valley Mall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're in the mood to get political, you could start your own Halloween dynasty this year with a whole family of Halloween presidents. You'll find masks of presidential hopefuls Obama, McCain and primary runner-up Hillary Clifton at sites ranging from superstores and Jo-Ann Fabrics to ABC Party World, where manager Barbara Rosa reports that masks are a specialty. In the political realm, they have President Clinton, Presidents George and George W. Bush and the original President George (Washington).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosa reports that there are many innovative do-it-yourselfers who like to collect their own accessories and give costumes an individual touch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a lot of props,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Halloween, American-style, seems to increasingly involve all ages, sizes and species. Regional sources offer disguises for babes in arms (Elvis outfits seem to be popular for both tiny tots and pets) and inflatables for grown-ups who want to grow up even more. Halloween Boutique has an inflatable suit that will transform you into a bronco rider, complete with a bucking bull.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those seeking custom costume concepts are busy scouting not only costume stores and costume sections at superstores, but are also investigating arts and crafts and fabric stores and thrift and consignment shops. For those on a budget, makeup, a wig or a mask or even a search through old Halloween collections or closets at home could provide you with inspiration for unique costume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more ideas, do a computer search with keywords &quot;handmade costumes&quot; &quot;make costumes&quot; or &quot;costume directions&quot; or visit a specialty sites like halloween-online.com or halloween.com</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Halloween costume safety</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Choose costumes that fit properly, especially when children will be wearing them for trick or treating or active events. Kids can trip over loose or dragging garments. Falls are the leading cause of injuries on Halloween.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Consider makeup and hats as costume alternatives. Masks and hoods that cover the face can be uncomfortable and dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When buying special Halloween makeup, check for packages containing ingredients that are labeled &quot;made with U.S. approved color additives,&quot; &quot;laboratory tested,&quot; &quot;meets federal standards for cosmetics&quot; or &quot;nontoxic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Only fire-retardant materials should be used for costumes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Use light colored materials and strips of reflective tape for outfits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Masks should have nose and mouth openings and large eye holes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Don't let kids carry sharp objects. Knives, swords and other accessories should be made from cardboard or flexible materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chose light colored bags or sacks, trim them with light reflective tape and have kids carry flashlights. Jewelry and accessories made with glow-in-the-dark lightsticks are another fun safety option.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was interesting to watch Sarah Palin patronizingly scold Joe Biden for &quot;looking back and pointing fingers&quot; during the vice-presidential debate on Thursday. She doesn't want us to examine her candidate's record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain &quot;the maverick&quot; was &quot;broken&quot; by George W. Bush in 2000, saddled and reined, then put into service as a workhorse for the Bush agenda, voting with Bush more than 90 percent of the time. Now he wants us to believe he's a born-again maverick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So of course Sarah Palin wants to scold us for looking back to see that a fair share of the blame for the disastrous eight years under Bush goes to John McCain. As the saying goes, those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's best interests are served by not looking back; our country's best interests are served by ignoring her. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Freed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Emmy for Best Actress in a Dramatic Role goes to Sarah Palin. Yes, she showed us that she can deliver a script with conviction and certainty every bit as well as Tina Fey. Her emotional range is limited, but the part did not require that. What a sorry state of affairs that we live in a country where performance in a 90-minute, prime-time television show can potentially affect the course of the next four years for our great country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four days in debate camp over 36 years in Congress; a hockey mom who recites talking points on issues she has never even considered prior to this campaign, versus someone who believes in and has lived the votes he has cast and the positions and legislation he has fought for. God help this nation and all who strive to make this a better place for our children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Neighbour</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm Cherokee, and I've just found out about Sarah Palin's record on Alaska Native and tribal issues. We know the importance of Native people being allowed to fish and hunt on their own lands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Palin is seeking to overturn every treaty the federal government has made with Alaska. She is interested in turning Alaska into a sport- and commercial-fishing paradise. Why am I not surprised?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin has also attacked Alaska tribal sovereignty and the preservation of Native languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a Methodist pastor's wife, when I hear her proclaim, as she stands with an AK-47 on one arm, how happy she is that she's a Christian and &quot;saved,&quot; I pray that we will all be saved from her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolores Pettit Broyles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the Sept. 29 letter, &quot;Palin comparison&quot;: Lawrence Franklin's comparison of Gov. Sarah Palin's lack of experience to that of Theodore Roosevelt's is so factually incorrect he would have gotten a failing grade in high-school American history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before entering the White House, Roosevelt had served as an elected state legislator, police commissioner of the nation's largest city, as assistant secretary of the Navy and governor of the nation's most populated state. Palin, on the other hand, has been mayor of a small town and run a state government whose budget is smaller than that of some public-school systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Franklin's tactic of re-writing history to bolster the Palin campaign is typical of the McCain campaign strategy: Repeat a lie often enough and the public will believe it. To paraphrase a line from a famous vice-presidential debate several years ago, &quot;Governor, you're no Teddy Roosevelt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James McGrath Morris</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tesuque</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are quite a few omissions in Lawrence Franklin's comparison of Gov. Palin to President Theodore Roosevelt. Before being selected as McKinley's running mate in the 1900 election, Roosevelt at the age of 42 had accomplished the following: extensive travel abroad to include engagement in war; Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude honors from Harvard; a year at Columbia Law School; historian (published a dozen books between 1882-1900); assemblyman of New York; National Guard; appointment to the U.S. Civil Service Commission; president of the board of the New York Police Commissioners; Assistant Secretary of the Navy; lieutenant colonel and then colonel of the Rough Riders; and governor of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When being sworn in as president in 1901, Roosevelt, who is considered to be in the top 10 of U.S. presidents and whose face graces Mount Rushmore, was not sworn in on the Bible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm a registered Republican. Back near Valentine's Day, John McCain probably got tired of interviewing the long line of solicitous men and barked, &quot;I've got to have a woman.&quot; Enter Sarah Palin, the alluring gov of ilasker. Charmed, he got all excited with dreams of hugs and hand-holding on the campaign trail followed by encounters in the Oval Office for a few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do we need some PaliCain to deaden our senses right now? Everyone should vote to make sure that this old man and his unqualified-to-be-president, hot tamale running mate get to the White House -- through the visitors gate. McCain made a mockery of the presidency when he chose Palin!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential positions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any serious person has to be very concerned about Barack Obama's political philosophy. No matter how he presents himself, he believes in much more government intervention and control in every aspect of our lives and economy. &quot;Change&quot; to Obama is a radical realignment of power, and freedom, to government and away from businesses and individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He promises a tax cut for the &quot;middle class,&quot; but he never mentions that we middle-class folks already got that with the Bush tax cut. What will accompany that gift from Barack? All sorts of direct taxes on business (windfall taxes on oil companies, increases in corporate taxes, increase in taxes on sole proprietorships -- individuals owning businesses -- increases in taxes on investment gains, etc.) plus indirect taxes (costly regulations) that will inevitably have a huge impact on business growth and of course, jobs! More jobs for more people is what we need! McCain will make that happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Forsman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have a message for Sen. John McCain and his neo-con supporters who are constantly beating the war drum, telling us that we are &quot;fighting for our freedom&quot; in Iraq. I would urge them to &quot;Get thee to the history books&quot; and research World War II. At the start of World War II, Germany and Japan had the most formidable army, navy and air force the world had ever known. Their attack on the United States and its allies became a true fight for our freedom. If we had not prevailed in World War II, we might have lost our freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To say that today the Taliban and other terrorist groups have the capability to take our freedom away is preposterous. Where are the millions of well-armed and equipped infantry, navy assault and landing ships, an air force that rules the sky and a supply line second to none that would be required to invade and conquer the U.S.? Let's call it what it is: a fight to prevent terrorist attacks on U.S. soil and our embassies around the world, not a fight for our freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Ohrbom</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are in a critical moment of &quot;choice&quot; for America's destiny as a country. As individuals, in the intensity of a crisis point, we may feel that the next step we will lead toward either life or death. Our country is going through the same thing. We need to surrender all of our past beliefs, prejudices and the habitual thinking that has brought us to this crisis -- all that has produced the illness, the pain and the lack of hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individuals in crisis need to surrender themselves, allowing Nature to exert itself. We need to let in what is right, just and good, allowing wisdom to work through our bodies and spirits. I pray that the people of our country will surrender to God and His will and let Him cast our votes for the one who will bring us less violence, peace and a more loving country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are fortunate to have two intelligent men running for president of this country. One is a talker and ambitious, the other a doer and tested by adversity. Which one of these men would be better at guiding our country through these challenging times?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who saw John McCain interviewed by George Stephanopoulos last Sunday morning got a more comprehensive picture of the man than is provided by so-called debates. We'd be better off with more interviews by knowledgeable and experience experts. Such interviews would give the citizens the background to make reasonable and sensible choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">N.D. Shelton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In answer to the many letters about Barack Obama's qualifications for the presidency, I would like to state a few facts about his background:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Obama's association with former Weather Underground terrorist William Ayers, in whose home Obama began his political career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Obama's connections with Islam and radical politics, from his father and stepfather's Islamic background to his communist and socialist mentors in Hawaii and Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Obama's minister, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, who preaches hate theology toward the United States. To be an informed voter, read Obama Nation and then vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gloria Wellman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the beginning, I sensed an honesty and exceptional intelligence. As the months went by, I watched a community organizer set up a campaign network that got the message out and recruited thousands of new voters, young and old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through it all, I've heard about change -- not the easy change of unvetted Annie Oakleys or no more earmarks, but detailed plans for improving education, for green technology, for diplomatic roads that move past 9/11. And as the race continues, I have admired a calm, reasoned leader who listens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first step to solving our current problems is to elect Barack Obama president. Obama opens the door; we push. Yes, we can!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Margaret S. Upshaw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm leaning toward Barack Obama, but have to admit I might not vote. I am upset that Hillary Clinton, as a female, was ignored by our delegates and governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will withhold support until I hear something on the issues, intentions or appointments (to the cabinet positions, military, financial sector, federal judge, etc.) being considered by the candidates. These are the individuals who really run our country. Exactly what are we to expect if Barack Obama or John McCain becomes president? Our political experts should be looking into these things and providing that kind of information to convince us to vote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. LOUIS   Under intense scrutiny, Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin stood her ground Thursday night against a vastly more experienced Joe Biden, debating the economy, energy and global warming, then challenging him on Iraq, &quot;especially with your son in the National Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alaska governor also noted that Biden had once said Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama wasn't ready to be commander in chief, &quot;and I know again that you opposed the move that he made to try to cut off funding for the troops and I respect you for that.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden responded that John McCain, too, had voted against funding, and said the Republican presidential candidate had been &quot;dead wrong on the fundamental issues relating to the conduct of the war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clash over Iraq was the most personal, and pointed, of the only vice presidential debate of the campaign, one in which Palin repeatedly cast herself as a non-Washington politician and part of a &quot;team of mavericks&quot; ready to bring change to a country demanding it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maverick he is not on the important, critical issues,&quot; Biden shot back, referring to McCain. And he said Obama was the true candidate of change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin, governor of her state for less than two years, faced enormous challenges as she walked onto the debate stage at Washington University. After five weeks as McCain's ticket-mate, her poll ratings have begun dropping as even some conservatives question her readiness for high public office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her solo campaign events are few, and she has drawn ridicule for some of her answers in the few interviews she has granted   including her claim that Alaska's proximity to Russia gives her an insight into foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the opening moments of the debate, Democrat Biden sought to make McCain out as a straight-ahead successor to an unpopular President Bush. &quot;He voted four out of five times for George Bush's budget, which put us a half-trillion dollars in debt and over $4 trillion in debt since he got here,&quot; Biden said of McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In return, Palin accused Biden of reciting the past rather than looking to the future. &quot;Americans are cravin' that straight talk&quot; that McCain offers, she said midway in the 90-minute debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With one month until the election, polls show Obama with a small but perceptible lead, and Republican officials said earlier in the day that McCain had decided to pull out of Michigan, conceding the state to the Democrats. At the same time, his own aides said the campaign may soon begin to advertise in Indiana   a state that has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After intense preparation   including two days at McCain's home in Sedona, Ariz., Palin made only one obvious stumble, when she twice referred to the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan as &quot;Gen. McClellan.&quot; His name is David McKiernan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As is her custom on the campaign trail, she spoke in familiar terms, saying &quot;betcha&quot; rather than &quot;bet you&quot; and &quot;gonna&quot; rather than &quot;going to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also spoke to the home folks. &quot;Here's a shout-out&quot; to third graders at Gladys Wood Elementary School in Alaska. She said they would all receive extra credit for watching the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can I call you Joe?&quot; she asked Biden as they shook hands before taking their places behind identical lecterns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He readily agreed she could   and she used it to effect more than an hour later. &quot;Say it ain't so, Joe,&quot; she said as she smilingly criticized him at one point for focusing his comments on the Bush administration rather than McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden's burden was not nearly as fundamental as hers. Although he has long had a reputation for long-windedness, he is a veteran of more than 35 years in the Senate, with a strong knowledge of foreign policy as well as domestic issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For much of the evening, the debate unfolded in traditional vice presidential fashion   the running mates praising their own presidential candidate and denigrating the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin said Obama had voted to raise taxes 94 times   an allegation that Biden disputed and then countered. By the same reckoning, he said, McCain voted &quot;477 times to raise taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They clashed over energy policy, as well, when Palin said Obama's vote for a Bush administration-backed bill granted breaks to the oil industry. By contrast, she said that as governor, she had stood up to the same industry, and noted that McCain had voted against the bill Obama supported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden said that in the past decade, McCain had voted &quot;20 times against funding alternative energy sources and thinks, I guess, the only answer is drill, drill, drill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chant is, &quot;drill, baby drill,&quot; Palin countered quickly, unwilling to yield to Biden on that issue   or any other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the environment, Palin declined to attribute the cause of climate change to man-made activities alone. &quot;There is something to be said also for man's activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet,&quot; she said, adding that she didn't want to argue about the causes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden said the cause was clearly man-made, and added, &quot;If you don't understand what the cause is, it's virtually impossible to come up with a solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON   Not just Wall Street is running scared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consequences of the financial meltdown now are sinking in with ordinary Americans, who worry whether their jobs, home values, children's futures and retirement plans are at risk, according to a poll out Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight in 10 fear the crisis will affect them directly, according to an AP-GfK poll. Yet 45 percent of all adults still opposed the proposed government bailout. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 38 percent were in favor of the $700 billion financial-market rescue plan and 16 percent were not sure in the poll, which was conducted Sept. 27-30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm really mixed on it,&quot; said David Couch, 49, a lawyer in Little Rock, Ark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think probably we need it to stabilize the markets but I really think there needs to be a lot of provisions attached to it so that it won't happen again and the people who were responsible won't profit from it,&quot; said Couch, a Democrat who plans to vote for Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the House rejected the first version of that plan. But supporters sought to revive it by adding several tax breaks and an increase to federal deposit insurance limits. The Senate passed the revised version 74-25 late Wednesday. The House was to vote on the revised plan today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The banks get the most of the blame for the crisis caused by risky mortgages, followed closely in the poll by the federal government for not providing adequate regulation. But most also place some blame on people who took out loans they couldn't repay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to blame everything on Bush. I think everyone else is,&quot; said Irene Kislus, 68, of Las Cruces. She blames the federal government for lax regulation, saying the crisis didn't develop overnight. &quot;They'd have to know over time this was happening,&quot; she said. &quot;I think they kept it quiet way too long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kislus, a retiree who works part time at the records department of New Mexico State University, is a Republican who plans to vote for John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a &quot;scary time,&quot; she said. &quot;The future certainly looks bleak, very bleak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 55 percent say the government should have a role, but only a limited one, when bailing out failing private businesses, limiting such intervention to certain major companies. More activism by government was favored by 25 percent and 16 percent preferred that the government not act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daphne Williams, 43, of Newark, N.J., an office administrator at JPMorgan Chase, said she supports the bailout &quot;because I think we need it. I'm afraid if it doesn't happen, then we're going to be in trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams, a Democrat who intends to vote for Obama, said she definitely worries about her job, especially since she works in the financial services industry. She puts those concerns at about 7.5 on a scale of one to 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We seem to have lost a lot of people&quot; when her company took over troubled investment house Bear Stearns in a deal orchestrated by the Federal Reserve last March. &quot;You never know what's going to happen. A deal might fall apart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She can't figure out where the blame lies for the crisis. &quot;You know, I really don't know,&quot; she said. &quot;It just has to get fixed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three in four said any bailout package should include limits on executive compensation. Such limits are in both the bill that was rejected by the House and the revised measure before the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roughly four in ten said that the federal government was &quot;moving at about the right pace&quot; in responding to the current financial crisis, slightly more who said the government was moving too slowly. Only 23 percent said they thought the government was moving &quot;too quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over half of those surveyed fear having to work longer before retirement because of lost savings, and nearly half worry that the value of their homes will be reduced over the long term. Almost a third think the crisis could put their jobs at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight in 10 fear the increased federal debt will be a burden for their children and grandchildren. The national debt is now close to $10 trillion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AP-GfK poll involved telephone interviews of a nationwide sample of 1,160 adults from Saturday through Tuesday. Interviews were conducted on both landline and cell phones. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points, 3.4 percentage points for likely voters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. LOUIS   Under intense scrutiny, Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin stood her ground Thursday night against a vastly more experienced Joe Biden, debating the economy, energy and global warming, then challenging him on Iraq, &quot;especially with your son in the National Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alaska governor also noted that Biden had once said Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama wasn't ready to be commander in chief, &quot;and I know again that you opposed the move that he made to try to cut off funding for the troops and I respect you for that.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden responded that John McCain, too, had voted against funding, and said the Republican presidential candidate had been &quot;dead wrong on the fundamental issues relating to the conduct of the war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clash over Iraq was the most personal, and pointed, of the only vice presidential debate of the campaign, one in which Palin repeatedly cast herself as a non-Washington politician and part of a &quot;team of mavericks&quot; ready to bring change to a country demanding it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maverick he is not on the important, critical issues,&quot; Biden shot back, referring to McCain. And he said Obama was the true candidate of change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin, governor of her state for less than two years, faced enormous challenges as she walked onto the debate stage at Washington University. After five weeks as McCain's ticket-mate, her poll ratings have begun dropping as even some conservatives question her readiness for high public office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her solo campaign events are few, and she has drawn ridicule for some of her answers in the few interviews she has granted   including her claim that Alaska's proximity to Russia gives her an insight into foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the opening moments of the debate, Democrat Biden sought to make McCain out as a straight-ahead successor to an unpopular President Bush. &quot;He voted four out of five times for George Bush's budget, which put us a half-trillion dollars in debt and over $4 trillion in debt since he got here,&quot; Biden said of McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In return, Palin accused Biden of reciting the past rather than looking to the future. &quot;Americans are cravin' that straight talk&quot; that McCain offers, she said midway in the 90-minute debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With one month until the election, polls show Obama with a small but perceptible lead, and Republican officials said earlier in the day that McCain had decided to pull out of Michigan, conceding the state to the Democrats. At the same time, his own aides said the campaign may soon begin to advertise in Indiana   a state that has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After intense preparation   including two days at McCain's home in Sedona, Ariz., Palin made only one obvious stumble, when she twice referred to the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan as &quot;Gen. McClellan.&quot; His name is David McKiernan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As is her custom on the campaign trail, she spoke in familiar terms, saying &quot;betcha&quot; rather than &quot;bet you&quot; and &quot;gonna&quot; rather than &quot;going to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also spoke to the home folks. &quot;Here's a shout-out&quot; to third graders at Gladys Wood Elementary School in Alaska. She said they would all receive extra credit for watching the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can I call you Joe?&quot; she asked Biden as they shook hands before taking their places behind identical lecterns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He readily agreed she could   and she used it to effect more than an hour later. &quot;Say it ain't so, Joe,&quot; she said as she smilingly criticized him at one point for focusing his comments on the Bush administration rather than McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden's burden was not nearly as fundamental as hers. Although he has long had a reputation for long-windedness, he is a veteran of more than 35 years in the Senate, with a strong knowledge of foreign policy as well as domestic issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For much of the evening, the debate unfolded in traditional vice presidential fashion   the running mates praising their own presidential candidate and denigrating the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin said Obama had voted to raise taxes 94 times   an allegation that Biden disputed and then countered. By the same reckoning, he said, McCain voted &quot;477 times to raise taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They clashed over energy policy, as well, when Palin said Obama's vote for a Bush administration-backed bill granted breaks to the oil industry. By contrast, she said that as governor, she had stood up to the same industry, and noted that McCain had voted against the bill Obama supported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden said that in the past decade, McCain had voted &quot;20 times against funding alternative energy sources and thinks, I guess, the only answer is drill, drill, drill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chant is, &quot;drill, baby drill,&quot; Palin countered quickly, unwilling to yield to Biden on that issue   or any other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the environment, Palin declined to attribute the cause of climate change to man-made activities alone. &quot;There is something to be said also for man's activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet,&quot; she said, adding that she didn't want to argue about the causes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden said the cause was clearly man-made, and added, &quot;If you don't understand what the cause is, it's virtually impossible to come up with a solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one seems to be asking or answering the question, &quot;what is the exact source of the $700 billion of proposed bailout money?&quot; Our national debt is already about $10 trillion. Whoever holds these loans currently controls the United States! If you loaned someone $700 billion, wouldn't you want something in return -- perhaps political influence, military contracts, favors, drilling in Alaska or maybe some prime real estate for a new country club in the national forest?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could it be China, the World Bank, the Federal Reserve (not a federal organization) or maybe one of those famous &quot;international community members&quot; who is stepping up to help America?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want to know exactly who would be lending us this bailout money because we are going to owe them more than you can ever imagine. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vito Hemphill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This country has been Milton Friedmanized! Friedman, who recently died, was the guru of shock-therapy economics -- capitalism taking over society, which involves massive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">privatization, immediately following a disaster such as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9/11 or Hurricane Katrina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today we are looking at an economic meltdown, and with Republicans in the White House, you can be sure that the best interest of the public at-large won't be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar economic meltdown occurred in 1929, and President Herbert Hoover's attempt to bail out the banks failed. President Franklin D. Roosevelt followed, and through the purchasing of homes and offering them at an affordable rate, as well as by creating jobs and demanding fair wages, he ended the Great Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bailout by this administration will only benefit the super-rich, and hurt the rest of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John St. Peter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No to the bailout. Let's have full congressional hearings first, and then develop a comprehensive, modern regulatory system. The stock market should not dictate the urgency of a bailout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's up 4, down 7, up 3 and so forth. A crooked casino on Fremont Street has more regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let the market regulate itself and keep taxpayer dollars for really urgent matters, such as health and education.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debatable results</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If presidential candidate John McCain cannot look his opponent in the eyes during a debate, it does not bode well for either international relations nor national security, if he is elected. What is even scarier is the thought of McCain not being able to finish his term, and &quot;You Betcha&quot; Palin becoming the country's lead foreign diplomat. Vote early for Obama/Biden!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kim Schiffbauer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Friday's presidential debate covered the economic crisis, the voters heard nothing about what the candidates would do, as president, about the growing dangers of nuclear weapons. Both McCain and Obama have said they support a nuclear-weapons-free world, and U.S. policy over the next four years will have a lasting impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next president should: achieve international agreements to deeply reduce nuclear stockpiles and end nuclear weapons testing; ensure that Iran and North Korea end their nuclear weapons programs; and keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists. So before the election, I want to hear from each of them about just what, if elected, they would do to keep America safe by reducing nuclear-weapons dangers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a week of John McCain's erratic antics, it's no surprise that Barack Obama was steady and collected at Friday's debate, while McCain was angry and gleefully vindictive. McCain could barely stand to look at Obama for most the debate, and on the few occasions he did, it was with a scornful scowl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to fact checkers at the Washington Post, McCain made nine inaccurate statements, continuing his pattern of exaggerations. Obama focused on the future, while McCain continued to refight old battles and show a temperament ill-suited to the challenges of the 21st century. It's no wonder that conservative Pat Buchanan said McCain &quot;will make Cheney look like Gandhi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain is not the same man he was in 2000. Rather than a maverick, today he is a desperate and erratic politician willing to say or do anything to win. Stop the drama, vote Obama!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gregg-orian cant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Columnist Gregg Bemis writes about governing by &quot;intentions.&quot; He needs to go back and read the Project for the New American Century by Rumsfeld, Cheney, Wolfowitz and Libby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intent of the Bush-Cheney regime was world dominance, military and financial. Part of their intent was to establish one-party &quot;rule&quot; here at home. Bemis should write about the difference between rulers and democratic leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bemis tries to shift blame, as usual, to former President Bill Clinton, while leaving out Bush touting the &quot;ownership society&quot; that he had created through deregulation. Republican crooks are not more righteous than Democrat crooks. Wall Street looks a lot like Katrina. They knew it was coming, but failed to act. Fearing political repercussions, they did not speak. It's time for a change. More of the same is insanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The road to hell is paved with good intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James P. Barber</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gregg Bemis' columns generally begin with an interesting point. However, they then start breaking down and end with blame being cast about at Bemis' whim. The time gap between his columns must be spent in numerous &quot;stewing&quot; sessions in which he figures out what non-Republican entity to pin a problem on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trying to tie the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac collapse across eight years of George Bush presidency to the Clinton administration is ludicrous. Is it instead possible that a large financial institution was poorly run and greedy? I don't own a famous sunken ship like Mr. Bemis, and I sure wish he'd stop trying to sell me one.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where has Gregg Bemis been these past couple of weeks? Under the ocean nipping off the antiquities of other nations? He certainly wasn't doing his research as he rehashed John McCain's erroneous ad about Franklin Raines being an adviser to Barack Obama. The ad was such a lie that it spurred the media to take a look at McCain's ties to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and it wasn't pretty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, took $15,000 a month between 2006 and August 2008 (yes, just a month ago) from Freddie Mac, and then did barely any work for the payment. Davis had been kept on the Freddie Mac payroll because of his close ties to John McCain. I guess fact-checking is not Bemis' strong suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suzanne J. Garney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bemis' column on the financial debacle can only be called hypocritical delusionalism. The only individuals portrayed in a negative light are all Democrats (Clinton, Obama, Dodd and Frank). By Bemis' own admission, he, like John McCain, didn't even see this coming two short weeks ago. Nor should we criticize Bush's and Paulson's heroic intentions for cleaning up the mess they themselves helped create!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It reminds me of McCain insisting on credit for &quot;The Surge.&quot; As Maureen Dowd has said, that's like an arsonist wanting credit for helping put out the fire he himself started. One thing can be said about Gregg Bemis. If he truly believes the inanities that he has committed to print, then he will never find a presidential candidate more suited to his views than John McCain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON   Not just Wall Street is running scared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consequences of the financial meltdown now are sinking in with ordinary Americans, who worry whether their jobs, home values, children's futures and retirement plans are at risk, according to a poll out Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight in 10 fear the crisis will affect them directly, according to an AP-GfK poll. Yet 45 percent of all adults still opposed the proposed government bailout. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 38 percent were in favor of the $700 billion financial-market rescue plan and 16 percent were not sure in the poll, which was conducted Sept. 27-30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm really mixed on it,&quot; said David Couch, 49, a lawyer in Little Rock, Ark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think probably we need it to stabilize the markets but I really think there needs to be a lot of provisions attached to it so that it won't happen again and the people who were responsible won't profit from it,&quot; said Couch, a Democrat who plans to vote for Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the House rejected the first version of that plan. But supporters sought to revive it by adding several tax breaks and an increase to federal deposit insurance limits. The Senate passed the revised version 74-25 late Wednesday. The House was to vote on the revised plan on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the House rejected the first version of that plan. But supporters sought to revive it by adding several tax breaks and an increase to federal deposit insurance limits. The revised version was before the Senate on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The banks get the most of the blame for the crisis caused by risky mortgages, followed closely in the poll by the federal government for not providing adequate regulation. But most also place some blame on people who took out loans they couldn't repay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to blame everything on Bush. I think everyone else is,&quot; said Irene Kislus, 68, of Las Cruces, N.M. She blames the federal government for lax regulation, saying the crisis didn't develop overnight. &quot;They'd have to know over time this was happening,&quot; she said. &quot;I think they kept it quiet way too long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kislus, a retiree who works part time at the records department of New Mexico State University, is a Republican who plans to vote for John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a &quot;scary time,&quot; she said. &quot;The future certainly looks bleak, very bleak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 55 percent say the government should have a role, but only a limited one, when bailing out failing private businesses, limiting such intervention to certain major companies. More activism by government was favored by 25 percent and 16 percent preferred that the government not act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daphne Williams, 43, of Newark, N.J., an office administrator at JPMorgan Chase, said she supports the bailout &quot;because I think we need it. I'm afraid if it doesn't happen, then we're going to be in trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams, a Democrat who intends to vote for Obama, said she definitely worries about her job, especially since she works in the financial services industry. She puts those concerns at about 7.5 on a scale of one to 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We seem to have lost a lot of people&quot; when her company took over troubled investment house Bear Stearns in a deal orchestrated by the Federal Reserve last March. &quot;You never know what's going to happen. A deal might fall apart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She can't figure out where the blame lies for the crisis. &quot;You know, I really don't know,&quot; she said. &quot;It just has to get fixed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three in four said any bailout package should include limits on executive compensation. Such limits are in both the bill that was rejected by the House and the revised measure before the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roughly four in ten said that the federal government was &quot;moving at about the right pace&quot; in responding to the current financial crisis, slightly more who said the government was moving too slowly. Only 23 percent said they thought the government was moving &quot;too quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over half of those surveyed fear having to work longer before retirement because of lost savings, and nearly half worry that the value of their homes will be reduced over the long term. Almost a third think the crisis could put their jobs at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight in 10 fear the increased federal debt will be a burden for their children and grandchildren. The national debt is now close to $10 trillion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AP-GfK poll involved telephone interviews of a nationwide sample of 1,160 adults from Saturday through Tuesday. Interviews were conducted on both landline and cell phones. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points, 3.4 percentage points for likely voters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor's note: The Following reactions on the bailout vote came into the Ruidoso News Monday. No responses were sent by the camps of Barack Obama or Harry Teague, who are running in races represented here. The statements are presented in alphabetical order by politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pete Domenici</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retiring Senator (R, NM)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Pete Domenici, former Senate Budget Com-mittee chairman, today expressed his disappointment in the House of Representatives' defeat of a bipartisan financial rescue bill and warned of the consequences across the nation if Congress fails to act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Domenici, who took to the Senate floor Monday morning to urge passage of the measure, expressed his disappointment with the House vote in a second floor speech this afternoon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am dismayed by the failed vote in the House. This is very serious and we have to find a plan that Congress can accept. Doing nothing is not an option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This action will precipitate an economic catastrophe for America. The initial response to this ill-advised action has been limited so far to the equity market and the corporate bond market, but I predict that the defeat of the plan will soon permeate our entire economy. It will also have serious and not completely predictable consequences in all markets throughout the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This plan included many features that those who opposed it wanted. It had many new safeguards for the taxpayer. Yet, a rigid adherence to an ideological purity on both sides that has never existed in our nation led many in the House to reject the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not know right now how this action will hurt the average American - higher interest rates for houses, a continued freeze in the credit markets, loss of jobs and contraction of the economy, loss of billions of dollars in pension plans. But, the consequences will come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This vote cannot be the last word Congress has to say. I urge everyone involved to begin work again immediately on adjustments to the plan that will at least satisfy a majority in the House. This Congress has an approval rating at an all-time low. None of us should be surprised why.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidate, President (R)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I speak to you at an hour of crisis for our nation's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe the crisis facing our economy could have a grave impact on every American worker, small business owner and family if our leaders fail to act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I share the anger and frustration that many Americans feel toward reckless and corrupt mismanagement on Wall Street and in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I returned to Washington last week to work on a bipartisan rescue plan. It was the only plan at that time on the table but lacked enough support to pass. It also lacked sufficient accountability and transparency to justify expenditure of the taxpayers' money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the time, the concerns of all members were not being heard. My colleagues were worried about the size of the plan and the risk it posed to taxpayers. I shared those concerns and I laid out principles that I thought must be adhered to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those principles included responsible oversight, effective transparency, added protections for the taxpayers, and a cap on excessive salaries for executives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I also believe that the legislation should have no earmarks. I worked hard to play a constructive role in bringing everyone to the table. The plan is now significantly improved. We strengthened taxpayers' protections and oversight, and the taxpayers were on the hook for less money up front. Don't get me wrong - it isn't perfect. And the fact that taxpayers could have to spend a single dollar to create stability in our economy is a decision that I do not take lightly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was hopeful that the improved rescue plan would have had the votes needed to pass because addressing a credit crisis is of vital importance to families, small businesses and every working American who must be assured that their assets are safe and protected and that our economy will continue to function.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, I've spoken to Federal Chairman Bernanke, Secretary Paulson, Congressional leaders and now it's time for all members of Congress to go back to the drawing board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I call on Congress to get back obviously immediately to address this crisis. Our leaders are expected to leave partisanship at the door and come to the table to solve our problems. Senator Obama and his allies in Congress infused unnecessary partisanship into the process. Now is not the time to fix the blame. It's time to fix the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would hope that all our leaders, all of them, can put aside short-term political goals and do what's in the best interest of the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Pearce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidate, U.S. Senate (R)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressman Steve Pearce voted today to protect taxpayers and opposed the $700 billion bailout of the financial sector. After the vote, Pearce released the following statement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Mexico taxpayers were not protected under this legislation. I strongly disapprove of putting taxpayers on the hook in order to bailout the Wall Street firms that got us in to this crisis. Those who made risky decisions should own up to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We still need solutions. This bill was not our only option. We now need to rewrite the bill to incorporate real taxpayer protections, market solutions instead of massive government intervention and correct the abuses that caused the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Going forward, legislation should include accountability for those who created the mess, transparency so investors can make informed decisions, limitations on leveraging so financial institutions are not allowed to overextend, end 'naked' short selling, and favor market principles over government intrusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have cosponsored an alternative to today's bill that more closely reflects these principles and truly protects the taxpayer, creates market incentives to create capital and reforms certain investment vehicles so we're not back here faced with the same problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Tinsley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidate, NM Senate (R)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RUIDOSO, NM - Congressional candidate Ed Tinsley's campaign released the following statement in the wake of today's vote in the U.S. House of Representatives. These re-marks are from Communications Director Jim Pettit:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress needs to get this right and instill some level of confidence amongst the American people and the world at large which is watching closely what's going on here. Pension plans and lifetime savings are at risk as is the prospect of a downward spiral in all of the credit markets - not just home mortgages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As for the people in Southern New Mexico, they need to get their money's worth from any rescue plan. Somehow, left out in all of this, is how a rescue plan helps the average homeowner in Southern New Mexico, people who played by the rules, signing up for loans they could afford and avoiding reckless speculation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, however, everyone is at risk and Congress needs to step up and provide a short-term plan to unfreeze the credit markets followed up by serious, long-term reform of our financial regulators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We saw today how partisan attacks aren't getting the job done. Ed Tinsley challenged Harry Teague to a debate on the economy for precisely this reason. Thirty-second television commercials aren't the forum for voters deciding who is best to represent them during these challenging times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Udall</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidate, U.S. Senate (D)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, U.S. Representative Tom Udall, D-N.M., released the following statement regarding his opposition to the $700 billion taxpayer bailout of Wall Street:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For eight years, the Bush Administration and its allies in Congress have allowed Wall Street to gamble with America's economy, and the results have been devastating for Main Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Administration consistently ignored the experts and failed to adequately oversee America's financial markets. Administration officials were warned that Wall Street's risky investments, combined with the mortgage industry's irresponsible practices, could produce a perfect storm that would threaten Americans' homes, jobs and life savings. Yet they did nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, the Administration's response was a $700 billion bailout with virtually no protections for American taxpayers. Congress made significant changes to the president's proposal, but I believe we should have taken more time to get this right. Four hundred of the nation's leading economists, including three Nobel laureates, have asked Congress to take more time to improve this proposal, and we should have heeded that advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The proposal we voted on today still contains significant flaws. For example, under this proposal:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- A pair of one-night polls gave Barack Obama a clear edge over John McCain in their first presidential debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifty-one percent said Obama, the Democrat, did a better job in Friday night's face-off, while 38 percent preferred the Republican McCain, according to a CNN-Opinion Research Corp. survey of adults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was widely considered more intelligent, likable and in touch with peoples' problems, and by modest margins was seen as the stronger leader and more sincere. Most said it was McCain who spent more time attacking his opponent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About six in 10 said each did a better job than expected. Seven in 10 said each seemed capable of being president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a CBS News poll of people not committed to a candidate, 39 percent said Obama won the debate, 24 percent said McCain and 37 percent called it a tie. Twice as many said Obama understands their needs than said so about McCain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on Somali pirates</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOGADISHU, Somalia -- A U.S. destroyer off the coast of Somalia closed in Saturday on a hijacked Ukrainian ship loaded with tanks and ammunition, watching it to ensure the pirates who seized it do not try to remove any cargo or crew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Russian and American ships pursued the hijackers of the Ukrainian-operated vessel, pirates seized another ship off Somalia's coast, an international anti-piracy group said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greek tanker with a crew of 19 is carrying refined petroleum from Europe to the Middle East. It was ambushed Friday in the Gulf of Aden, said Noel Choong, who heads the International Maritime Bureau's piracy reporting center based in Malaysia. He said pirates chased and fired at the ship before boarding it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Somalia, a man claiming to be the spokesman for the pirates holding the Ukrainian ship said the hijackers want $35 million to release the vessel. But there was no way to immediately verify his claim that he represented the pirates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, pirates seized the Ukrainian ship Faina en route to Kenya with 33 Russian-built T-72 tanks and a substantial quantity of ammunition and spare parts. Russia's navy said Friday that it had dispatched a warship to the area, and the United States said American naval ships were tracking the Ukrainian ship with special concern because of the weaponry on board.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steinberg, who had lymphatic cancer, died Sept. 17 at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center near his home in San Francisco, announced officials at Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker, which he co-founded in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a former patient, Steinberg started a small chocolate manufacturing company that emphasized Old World artisanal standards and &quot;completely transformed American understanding of chocolate,&quot; said Alice Medrich, a cookbook author known for her chocolate expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He changed chocolate from being seen as a mere sweet candy to having the status of a complex and interesting food. A new age of chocolate was started in this country with that company,&quot; Medrich told the Los Angeles Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By emphasizing premium ingredients and bringing artisan standards to what had been a largely industrialized process in the U.S., Scharffen Berger helped move gourmet chocolate from a special-occasion purchase to an everyday indulgence. Devotees likened it to drinking an espresso instead of truck-stop java.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before he was a chocolate perfectionist, Steinberg practiced medicine in Ukiah, Calif.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. military deaths in Iraq</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of Saturday, at least 4,174 members of the U.S. military have died in the Iraq war since it began in March 2003, according to an Associated Press count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figure includes eight military civilians killed in action. At least 3,379 military personnel died as a result of hostile action, according to the military's numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AP count is one fewer than the Defense Department's tally, last updated Friday at 8 a.m. MDT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest deaths reported by the military:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What an outstanding role model Sarah Palin is for all the little girls in our country. Here she is, the mother of a baby with special needs, two children in elementary school and a pregnant teenager, and she is running for Vice President of the United States of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, please! The truth is, little girls, that you can have it all, but not all at the same time. Sarah Palin has been seduced by power. For the good of her family and her country she just should have said &quot;no, not now.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dangerous game</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain and Sarah Palin are thinking the unthinkable, contemplating nuclear war fighting with Russia over South Ossetia. Like McCain and Palin and most other Americans, I never heard of South Ossetia until Georgia invaded it (despite the fact that the U.S. State Department warned them not to) this past August 7, on Day 1 of the Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, Russia invaded Georgia. In a recent referendum, 98 percent of South Ossetians voted for independence from Georgia. Why should the U.S. be willing to risk one single American life over South Ossetia? The change that McCain/Palin stand for is a return to nuclear poker playing. When McCain and Palin ante up, they'll be tossing American cities into the pot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inspiration, integrity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is a man of integrity, who has chosen, in Joe Biden, a running mate immensely capable of assuming the presidency. John McCain, on the other hand, has made a very reckless choice in Sarah Palin. The economy is in a meltdown not seen since the Great Depression, and the world has never been more dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need leadership now more than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ever, and we need a president who can inspire us, not one who personifies sleaziness in the conduct of his own campaign.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dishonesty, disgrace</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am disgusted with John McCain and his completely false campaign ads. He keeps telling voters that Barack Obama will raise taxes for middle- and lower-income Americans, but that is simply a lie. Obama's plan is to lower taxes for those families even more than McCain. Obama will raise taxes for only the two highest income levels, while McCain intends to significantly lower taxes for the wealthiest Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's&nbsp;ad on Obama and sex education is an even more insulting and disgraceful lie. The fact that McCain is resorting to incessant lying in his campaign indicates that he is no longer a straight talker and that he has sold his soul to the devil in an attempt to win the presidency. In doing so, he dishonors himself, as well as the office he is seeking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope everyone has read the Sept. 17 letter &quot;Peeved by poll.&quot; It's a clever satire on the &quot;war mentality&quot; currently seizing our country. &quot;Peeved&quot; parodies neo-con irrationality by taking umbrage at factual poll results published by a commentator in The New Mexican, displaying the letter writer's egotism and paranoia with strident assertions that these facts are an attack on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;War mentality&quot; affects us more than we realize; it triggers our most primitive emotions and impairs our rationality, fostering self-destructive delusions and xenophobia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a foreign culture were to invade and attempt to occupy our country, wouldn't we resist to the utmost, forever if necessary? The idea that citizens of other countries would behave differently is an elitist delusion. Consequently, so is our idea that we can &quot;win&quot; such wars. The lessons of Vietnam remain unlearned; now Iraq may bankrupt us.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Americans travel to and enjoy Mexico regularly. We need to find solutions that treat our Mexican neighbors with respect and gratitude.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yee-haw!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President George Bush brought his chainsaw mentality to the White House, treating the perceived problems of the world as if he were clearing brush on the little ranch, pretending to be a rancher, redneck cowboy-type. The chainsaw kept going, in a screaming fit of willfulness, filling the space that might be filled with thought, heart, compassion and true quiet strength. And we fell for it, not knowing that the chainsaw needs to stay on the ranch and is to be used only for cutting brush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Put the chainsaw and all its mentality on the porch or in the shed before entering the house, George, and check the willful mentality at the door. Now it is Sarah Palin, with her helicopter safaris to hunt the caribou and the wolf.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every leap year, &quot;quadrennial ethics&quot; appear, currently as a soupyTV ad.In it,a woman who is theresult of a &quot;failed abortion&quot; (whatever that is; Iguess in one mindset, every birthis a failed abortion,as everylasting marriage isa failed divorce),denounces Barack Obama for voting against infants. Leap year is also presidential election year,so we are bombarded with this kind of stuff.Butabortion,choice and population planningcan't be resolved in a soundbyte in either direction. That includes a 30-second commercial.If you want to persuade peopleabortion is wrong, why try only once every four years with an ad that makes nosense? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But start with this. This is not a campaign to persuade peopleabortion is wrong. It is a campaign to elect John McCain.Thecentralnational worry right now is the enormous economic fallout from eight years ofunwise financial adventures byfriends ofour president, helped by the removal of federalregulation and by federal welfare for the very richwhen the looting became so bad as to destroy thegoose that laid the golden egg.Time to distract the populace with something else! Abortionwill be asure winner! Ignore that economic disaster is upon us, and the same people whocaused it are nowdoubling the federal deficit with a $5 trillion bailout while simultaneously cutting taxes for the very rich whose fault this is. No wonder they want to talk about abortion instead. And that is &quot;quadrennial ethics.&quot; Personally, I learned thissix years ago, when our congressional race was between two candidates who were bothanti-abortion.A &quot;pro-life&quot; slatewas handed out by many Evangelical churches. But it only listed Republican candidates, despite a Democratic candidatewho was strongly committed to a &quot;pro-life&quot; position. At that point, I understood &quot;quadrennial ethics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real job of those who oppose abortion is education to persuadeus toa personal ethical commitment that is perpetual and not quadrennial. Some think it easier topass laws forbidding others than to actually teach ethics.It isn't, asprohibitionproved. When a majority or large minority have little idea of why they should oppose abortion, laws will not do it. After all, if making something illegal solvedanything, we would not have an out of control drug problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's try reason. Abortions are caused by unwanted pregnancies.Reducing unwanted pregnancies willconsequently lowerthe abortion rate. Some dramatic unwanted pregnancies are when the mother's life is in danger or cases of incest and rape. Butthese are relatively rare.Mostly the child is unwanted due to poor economics, social embarassment or unsuitable parents, due to factors like young age orsubstance abuse.Two methods can virtually eliminate unwanted pregnancies: abstinence and contraception. To insist we should not tell this to people withthe potential to be sexually activeis the same as the March of Dimes opposing the Salkpolio vaccine. To suggest abstinence is a great idea, but it provably doesn't work for everyone, as the skyhigh teen birth statistics (without even countingabortions) of Luna County testify. People full of hormones will discover sex whether we tell them or not. They are far less likely to discover contraception on their own. This is not to promotesex. It isto acknowledge that it exists, andif wrong, to prevent the greater wrong of inflicting either abortion or life as an unwanted and unsupported child on an innocent infant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are not willing to go there,there will be many abortions, whether legal or illegal. And if you want to be &quot;pro-life,&quot;make sure every child born is wanted. That means more than pious sentiment. It means making sure thatpeople, including poor people, have good prenatal and post-natal care,thatbabies get the right to life after birth, not just before, by havingcaring programs to support families, including poor and single parents,with child care, universal healthcare for children, good, well-supported schools, a reasonable place to live and good nourishment. Manyso-called &quot;pro-life&quot; politiciansoppose any of these post-birth measures. Many of their constituents, inand out of church, could care less about the health and education of the poor children all around them. Manyeven complain loudly aboutPalomas women who come to Deming to seek good medical care for the birth of their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is what is meant by quadrennial ethics. It has nothing to do with really being pro-life. It has a lot to do with sleazy politics. If you want to help children, born or unborn,supportmeasures to make all children wanted, supported, and cared for medically, emotionally, educationally, economically.But for this election,follow the money.</SPAN></P>

Sarah Palin cannot disguise the crisis in the financial system. It's a systemic failure; Wall Street has seen nothing like it since 1929. And we're not alone. The crisis is worldwide. Big banks in Europe are facing merger or failure. In Russia, the two main stock markets in Moscow were forced to stop trading. In a matter of months, more than $800 billion has been erased from the Russian stock exchanges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcome to the reality of the poorly regulated -- perhaps nonregulated -- free market. As someone once noted, government is always the enemy until you actually need a friend. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG needed a friend and found one; the venerable, 158-year-old investment bank of Lehman Brothers needed one, too, but it didn't get one. It failed, although Barclays, the big British bank, has bought Lehman's main U.S. investment unit. Merrill Lynch, too, disappeared, but into the arms of the Bank of America. Who or what's next?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain said earlier this year that he didn't know much about the economy. He's right; he doesn't. But that didn't stop him from saying that the fundamentals of the economy were sound, even as the financial system was crashing down about him. That was a mistake. He tried to modify his statement the next day by saying he was referring to the strengths of the American worker, but that was nonsense. He meant what he said the first time.

He laid out a program of reforms that centered around greater and more effective regulation. Earlier in the week, he promised to end the &quot;anything goes&quot; culture on Wall Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sense, both senators are a day late and more than a dollar short. The country is already in a terrible financial bind, though it is true that Obama has been saying so for many months. But who was listening? Certainly not President Bush or McCain, who seem to live in their own parallel universe. Bush is in the final months of his failed presidency, and it's difficult to see what he can do other than take emergency measures. The crisis developed under his watch and that of his administration, devoted as it is to heedless deregulation. This week, Bush sounded somber. Even this White House realizes things are not going well. By the end of the week, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson was heading a bipartisan congressional group to rescue the financial system to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crisis puts McCain in a difficult position and offers Obama an opportunity. The financial crisis has changed the dynamics of the presidential campaign. Palin, while a star performer, is no longer the main news of the day. It's the economy once again, especially the financial crisis. But who does the new dynamic favor? McCain or Obama? There are those who, in a crisis, adhere to the already known, in this case McCain. But economic issues favor Obama, and the latest polls show a small shift in his favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problems involved are enormous and complex. How to explain the complexity while connecting to the ordinary voter?

The psychological effect of the Wall Street collapse undoubtedly will reinforce the prevailing national view that the economy is in bad shape and getting worse. That ought to favor the Democrats and Obama.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama needs voters like Henrietta Gaines and her 74-year-old mother, Helen Maestas, if he is to carry New Mexico in the Nov. 4 general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They waited for hours in the sun Thursday to hear Obama speak an outdoor rally, delivering a message of economic hope and change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities estimated the crowd at 9,500, which is equal to the city's population. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am happy he came here to give Espanola a boost,&quot; said Maestas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gaines, who was born and raised in Espanola, supported Hillary Rodham Clinton during the presidential primary season. After Clinton lost the Democratic nomination, Gaines considered not voting in November but decided to back Obama. She likes his focus on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's going to hurt us all,&quot; she said of the financial crisis gripping the nation. &quot;Whoever makes it as president is going to have a lot on them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama traveled to a traditional Democratic stronghold in northern New Mexico to make a personal appeal to Hispanics, whose support is critical if he is to win the state and the White House. Hispanics account for about 40 percent of the state's voting age population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To the Hispanic community, I want you to start actually voting your numbers. Start flexing your muscle. Right here in New Mexico you'll be the difference maker,&quot; said Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hispanics accounted for 85 percent of the population in Espanola, according to the most recent Census.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, President Bush narrowly won the state by claiming a significant share of the Hispanic vote about two-fifths, according to exit polls and receiving strong margins in GOP strongholds in the state. Democrat John Kerry suffered from below-average turnout in heavily Hispanic areas such as Rio Arriba County, where Obama held his rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't say at home,&quot; Obama told voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just remind yourselves, Si Se Puede! Si Se Puede!&quot; he said, using a Spanish phrase meaning, &quot;Yes, we can.&quot; It was a rallying cry of Cesar Chavez, who formed the United Farm Workers Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech, Obama pledged to restore the nation's ailing economic health and he hammered away on the theme of change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the next 47 days you can fire the whole trickle-down, on-your-own, look-the-other way crowd in Washington who has led us down this disastrous path,&quot; said Obama. &quot;Don't just get rid of one guy. Get rid of this administration. Get rid of this philosophy. Get rid of the do-nothing approach to our economic problem and put somebody in there who's going to fight for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State GOP Chairman Allen Weh fired back in a statement that Obama &quot;doesn't have near the experience to handle the job he's asking Americans to give him, and more and more people now understand that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was the first presidential candidate to appear in rural, northern New Mexico in decades. Democrat John Kennedy campaigned in the area in 1960 to appeal like Obama to Hispanic voters. Earlier this year before the state's Democratic presidential caucus, Obama made a campaign stop in Santa Fe, which is about 30 miles from Espanola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alice Gallegos of Santa Cruz said Obama &quot;makes you feel good. He makes you feel safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her 76-year-old husband, Robert, pointed to a large banner with the word, &quot;Change,&quot; that hung behind the platform on which Obama spoke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's it say on that sign? That's what we need,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's appearance in New Mexico came as the Republican National Committee aired radio ads in Spanish in Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Espanola stressing John McCain's support for immigration legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Hispanics needed a friend in Congress during the immigration debate, who stood up? Who spoke out? John McCain,&quot; the ad states, according to a translation released by the RNC. &quot;And while the bill didn't pass, McCain demonstrated a real commitment to reforming immigration in a way that honored our laws as well as our immigrants and traditions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Hispanics needed a friend in Congress during the immigration debate, who stood up? Who spoke out? John McCain,&quot; the ad states, according to a translation released by the RNC. &quot;And while the bill didn't pass, McCain demonstrated a real commitment to reforming immigration in a way that honored our laws as well as our immigrants and traditions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his New Mexico visit today, Barack Obama plans to do more than charge up a few thousand folks at a rally in Espa&ntilde;ola. He also will make time to raise a little cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few hours after his speech on Espa&ntilde;ola's plaza, Obama is scheduled to appear at an Albuquerque fundraiser at the home of Kandace and Paul Blanchard. Paul Blanchard is a racetrack and casino owner and major contributor to Gov. Bill Richardson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost to get into the &quot;general reception&quot; at the Blanchards' is a mere $2,500 a person. Once they clear out those low-rent folks, the real fun begins with a &quot;host reception,&quot; for which the price tag is $28,500 a person. This event includes a party favor -- a photo with the candidate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not sure why the invitations include the contribution price. I thought the rule was &quot;If you have to ask, you can't afford it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under federal campaign finance laws, individuals can give a maximum of $2,300 to a candidate per election. But the limit is $28,500 for contributions to national party committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have tried to score populism points by drawing attention to Obama's high-dollar fundraisers. On Tuesday -- in response to an expensive Hollywood fundraiser that night headlined by Barbra Streisand -- state Republicans invited volunteers to a phone bank party in Albuquerque with entertainment by celebrity impersonators, including a local version of Marilyn Monroe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, GOP candidate John McCain on Monday attended a $50,000-a-plate fundraiser in Miami. I don't know whether anyone sang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Mexico gives: Speaking of campaign contributions, New Mexicans have dropped millions on this presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the latest figures available on OpenSecrets.org, the Web site of the Center for Responsive Politics, Obama has collected $1,408,314 from New Mexicans while McCain has received $593,324. As far as New Mexico bucks go, the Republican also trails Democratic runner-up Hillary Clinton, who raised $599,876.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all of them trail another Democratic candidate -- Gov. Bill Richardson, who ended his candidacy in January. New Mexicans gave the Richardson campaign $6,282,503.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as Santa Fe residents go, people in this city have given Richardson $1,624,504; Obama $792,173; Clinton $202,844; and McCain $118,787. All these numbers, according to OpenSecrets.org, are based on Federal Election Commission data released electronically Sept. 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poll-a-rama: Two new polls of New Mexico voters show Obama taking the lead in this battleground state. The results in the new polls were nearly identical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a SurveyUSA/KOB-TV poll released Wednesday evening, Obama leads McCain by 8 percentage points, 52 percent to 44 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That poll, based on automated calls to 671 likely voters from Sunday through Tuesday, showed Obama leading among Hispanic voters 69 percent to 70 percent. Earlier this week, Richardson told Santa Fe Democrats that Obama needs to get 65-70 percent of the Hispanic vote here to win the state's five electoral votes. The margin of error is 3.9 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on Wednesday, the New Hampshire-based American Research Group reported Obama ahead in New Mexico 51 percent to 44 percent. That poll of 600 likely voters was taken during the same period earlier this week. The margin of error is 4 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both polls show a gender gap, with men preferring McCain and women preferring Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Mexico poll numbers have been shifting. Recent polls by Mason-Dixon and Rasmussen showed McCain with a thin lead, though a CNN/Time poll in late August showed Obama up by 13 percentage points here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How did you vote, Tom? As a longtime political junkie with a love-hate attitude toward campaign commercials, I have to say I kind of like Senate candidate Steve Pearce's recent series of 15-second spots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First of all, they're only 15 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while they're definitely attack ads, they're definitely issue-oriented and not personal. In the ads, Pearce never comes out and says his Democratic opponent Tom Udall is a bad guy and a threat to our way of life. Pearce just says how he voted for or against something, then asks &quot;How did you vote, Tom?&quot; -- implying, of course that Udall voted the &quot;wrong&quot; way on whatever the issue is -- energy, taxes, &quot;partial-birth&quot; abortion or whatever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the ads are fairly straightforward -- although there are complexities and nuances in most legislation that can't be fully explained in 15 seconds. But one of the spots truly needs more explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm Steve Pearce and I approve this message to let you know where I stand,&quot; it begins. &quot;Raising taxes on middle-class families to pay for benefits for undocumented workers is just plain wrong. How did you vote Tom?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could Udall really have voted in favor of the Raise Taxes on Middle Class Families to Pay for Benefits for Undocumented Workers Act?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, I didn't remember this piece of legislation, so I consulted the fact sheet on Pearce's Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill, HR 3963, is better known as the State Child Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only did Udall vote for it in the House last year, so did 43 House Republicans, including New Mexico's Rep. Heather Wilson. In the Senate, it was supported by Republican Pete Domenici. The bill passed Congress but was vetoed by President Bush. Both Udall and Wilson voted to override the veto (Pearce was opposed to the override), but the bill failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colorado bound: Richardson continues his role as an Obama surrogate this weekend. He said during a Wednesday news conference he will campaign in the Colorado towns of Greeley, Alamosa and Pueblo.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">651 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me use the single word, so eloquently spoken by Sen. Barack Obama, &quot;Enough!&quot; The McCain campaign has descended into the filthy sewer of political strategy occupied by Karl Rove and his henchmen. If you still doubt this, consider the latest series of &quot;campaign ads&quot; leading up to the now infamous &quot;lipstick accusation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To briefly summarize, without extending the incident any farther: Senator Obama, in criticizing the McCain claim to a change platform, used a well-known aphorism, &quot;if you put lipstick on a pig, it's still a pig.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can see the complete video of what he said at the following URL: www.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/09/obama-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lipstick-on-a-pig-v_n_125253.html.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign, with cynical Rovian delight, claimed that this comment was a direct insult to Gov. Palin, who had mentioned the word &quot;lipstick&quot; in her acceptance speech at the Republican Convention. Presumably with Sen. McCain's approval, and most certainly with his funding, the campaign produced and released a Web ad accusing Obama of calling the governor a pig.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can see this video at the following link: blogs.takepart.com/tag/mccain-lipstick-video/.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some important things to note as you watch these: First, this &quot;pig&quot; aphorism has been used a number of times by Sen. McCain himself, most recently when referring to Sen. Clinton's health care policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, it has been used before by Sen. Obama also.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, it is such a commonly used metaphor in reference to cutting through spin that one of Sen. McCain's own former speech writers, Torie Clark, has written a book by that name (complete title; &quot;Lipstick on a Pig: Winning in the No-Spin Era by Someone Who Knows the Game&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recommend that you view both of these videos in their entirety. It should then be crystal clear to you what is going on. Rather than focus on the issues, John McCain's advisors, led in the shadowy background by Karl Rove, have convinced him that character assassination is his best and only hope. The politics of distraction &Eacute; and this at a time when we are reeling economically and internationally, when our future and the future of our children and grandchildren should be taking center stage. Apparently they have convinced him that he cannot win on the issues alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, I am an Obama supporter. Yes, I believe that on the issues and for the best hope of our future, Sen. Obama's proposals win out over those of Sen. McCain. However, it is really difficult to listen to McCain's claim of being an &quot;agent of change&quot; when he has supported the Bush policies, by his own admission, 90 percent of the time, and when he can only offer us the same for another four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the addition of Gov. Palin to his ticket as an &quot;icon of reform&quot; seems to be wearing thin as the carefully constructed mythology of her public behavior begins to peel away under serious investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we desperately need in the remaining days of this electoral season is an honest appraisal of where we want to go as a country. Are we better off now after eight years of the Bush administration? Will we be better served by four additional years of the same, or by a new direction? These are the debates we should be hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all honesty, can you say that hearing these ugly and demeaning attacks from John McCain advance this discussion for us? No matter whose policies you favor, do these Karl Rove &quot;swift boat&quot; tactics aid us in deciding?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taose&ntilde;os and all Americans should rightly be insulted by this attempt to distract us with lies. And this from a national hero of John McCain's stature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain should do the right thing and repudiate those in his campaign who have done this. Instead, he stands before us and defends the tactics. How sad &Eacute; both for John McCain and for the country he claims to consider first above his own ambition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TITLE: &quot;Dos Caras&quot; and &quot;Which Side Are They On?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LENGTH: 30 seconds each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AIRING: On Spanish-language television stations in New Mexico, Arizona and Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANALYSIS: Apparently both presidential campaigns feel less constrained by the facts when they're speaking in Spanish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain are making the same claim that the other is responsible for the failure of immigration reform. It's not a fair charge on either side, since both of them supported it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's all an effort to raise fears about their rival among Hispanic voters, who are expected to play a critical role in the battleground states of Florida, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada. Obama's campaign has said it will spend $20 million along with the Democratic National Committee to target and mobilize Hispanic voters this fall, while the Republicans aren't revealing their budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hispanics have long supported Democratic candidates, though President Bush started to make inroads, picking up about 40 percent of the Latino vote in 2004. But some Latino advocates argue that Republicans have alienated Hispanics by staking out tough positions against illegal immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both McCain and Obama support comprehensive plans to overhaul the immigration system, including a path to citizenship for the estimated 12 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally. McCain was the lead Republican sponsor of the bill, and it hurt him among his party's conservatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That includes radio host Rush Limbaugh, who regularly criticized McCain for his stance. So for Obama to compare the two on immigration is inaccurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also plays loose with the facts when he tries to blame Obama for the collapse of immigration reform. Obama supported the bipartisan effort to reform immigration, and voted for McCain's final proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCRIPT: English translation of &quot;Dos Caras,&quot; or &quot;Two Faces&quot;: Obama: &quot;I'm Barack Obama and I approved this message.&quot; Announcer: &quot;They want us to forget the insults we've put up with, the intolerance. They made us feel marginalized in a country we love so much. John McCain and his Republican friends have two faces. One tells lies just to get our vote, and the other, even worse, continues the failed policies of George Bush, putting the interests of powerful groups above working families. John McCain, more of the same Republican deceptions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">English translation of &quot;Which Side Are They On?&quot;: Announcer: &quot;Obama and his allies in Congress say they're on the side of immigrants. But are they? News reports say their efforts were like 'poison pills' that caused immigration reform to fail. The result: No to the guest worker program, to the road to citizenship, to secure borders. No reforms passed. Is that being on our side? Obama and his allies in Congress: Ready to block immigration reform but not ready to govern.&quot; McCain (speaking in English): &quot;I'm John McCain and I approved this message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KEY IMAGES: The &quot;Two Faces&quot; ad aired by the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee shows photos of immigrants as a picture of Limbaugh appears at the bottom of the screen. Limbaugh is quoted in text as saying, &quot;Mexicans stupid and unqualified&quot; and &quot;Shut your mouth or get out!&quot; As the announcer speaks of Republicans with two faces, a Spanish newspaper headline appears: &quot;They caused the failure of immigration reform.&quot; Photos of McCain with President Bush appear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Which Side Are They On,&quot; paid for by McCain's campaign and the Republican National Committee, curiously uses one of the same images that the Obama&nbsp;ad does the Spanish newspaper headline that states: &quot;They caused the failure of immigration reform.&quot; It also shows scowling pictures of Obama and other Senate Democrats, then cuts to photos of smiling Hispanic families. It shows a gavel being pounded down.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you, City Council, for voting to install the red light cameras. It's an epidemic in Las Cruces and the police force doesn't do anything about it. I witnessed four vehicles running red lights on a regular basis. Hooray   thank you!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I saw Ed Tinsley III's deceptive TV ad. He tries to pretend that his wife humbly worked behind a cash register at their first restaurant franchise. At the time, his wife was extremely wealthy from her family's oil investments. That is why he was able to acquire the all of the 23 Schlotzsky's restaurants in New Mexico and California. It helps to have a wealthy wife. The man of the people is a sham!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is about the people who are concerned about long lines at schools. The kids have to go into the cafeteria and sit at the tables and wait for Ms. Rivera to call each table to get their lunch. These kids have only 30 minutes to get their lunch and eat it, so if they are the last tables to get called and time runs out, they do not get to eat lunch. A petition was given to Ms. Rivera from students and the petition was laughed at by her, and the student punished. Not real professional for a principal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My son came home from his sixth-grade football practice with a letter from the city league board requiring us to pay $25 to an El Paso photographer for his team pictures. First, how can a this board dictate who takes our team picture? Second, why are we giving business to an El Paso business, why not a Las Cruces photographer? And third, what are you going to do to my son or his team if I don't have the $25? Required? You argued to the city that the kids didn't even have enough money to pay the registration fees and couldn't pay a field fee. But we can pay your photographer $25 for a picture? I bet the board is getting a cut of this money and the whole deal stinks!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good job Council. The red light runners will start whining now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the U.S. financial world crumbles around us, the headline reads &quot;Pit bulls seized.&quot; I now live in the backwaters of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financial crisis our country is facing now is a direct result of the deregulation policies implemented by the Republican Congress over the last several years, including John McCain. These corporations have been allowed to operate with no oversight. The interests of big business have been put before the interests of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin is by no means a maverick. Her political views and religious ideation appear to be taken directly from the mainstream teachings of the Christian Right. Her self-absorbed sarcasm and her ability to repeat the Big Lie in order to get her way should be the fundamental reason we reject her getting anywhere near the White House. Remember: Jesus was a community organizer. Pontius Pilate was a governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the reader planning on installing Phantom Plates for all of his vehicles: Wouldn't it just be easier (and more economical) to simply obey the traffic laws?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What hubris! Claiming he has the right to speed and run red lights and so uses a radar detector and the blinding license plate shields. Shame on you, sir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Schoonover has been a savior to the County Treasurer's Office. For decades, and in particular the eight years before his arrival, the Treasurer's Office had been rife with incompetence, favoritism, improprieties and an absent treasurer. Mr. Schoonover has created a top-notch office, has collected on delinquent bills owed by landowners, and is doing everything in accordance with the law. Finally, we have a full-time pro in that office, rather than a restaurant owner who tries to be a treasurer on a part-time basis!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debacle of the S &amp; L scandal involved deregulation headed by McCain. In 1996, McCain, along with his friend, Phil Gramm, instituted deregulation of large Wall Street companies as well as the oil companies. What the world is experiencing today is due in large part to McCain's deregulation efforts. These large companies such as AIG (insurance) and the oil companies have the Republicans in their pockets, the policies instituted by McCain led Senate committees is evident in what is happening on Wall Street, their greed and Republicans quest for power is destroying our way of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 25,000 (former) employees at Lehman Bros. owned 25 percent of the stock in the company. Is this maybe why A.I.G. isn't S.O.L?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why does the Federal Reserve get a 80 percent equity interest for a $85 billion loan, while the taxpayers just get the (debt) loan? Oh, and has anyone seen the Fed's books?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush Administration is ruining America by seizing control of American International Group Inc., an $85 billion deal. Taxpayers should be up in arms over this irresponsible action   welfare for the corporations!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With $455 trillion in (complex investment instruments) derivatives on the verge of vanishing in the coming months, my question is, what comes after a trillion, GA-zillion or BA-zillion?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain has one thing right when he described Wall Street asa &quot;casino culture.&quot; So don't waste taxpayers dollarsinvestigating what happened, whenwhat happens on Wall Street, stays on Wall Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some free advice to John McCain with trying to find out who is responsible for this financial collapse: You can start with the (Feds) FederalReserve, who hasn't been audited since its inception in 1913.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Election? We Dems know how to get it right   first we get a relative to head the election, then we have the clerks send out wrong precinct information guaranteeing a ton of provisional ballots. We then have two or three precincts not show up with the ballot boxes for a couple days. It will be two weeks again before anyone knows who won and New Mexico will end up on the wrong side as we did with Hillary in the primary. I wonder if our governor will be able to put a positive spin on it then?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's hope by now that Boston, Mumme and Menzies understand that if you are going to have a successful season and get the fans out, that we have to beat UTEP and UNM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the fact her unmarried teenage daughter is pregnant and that for the first time in 15 years teenage pregnancy has risen, Sarah Palin still supports abstinence-only sex education. When you have a certain ideology, it makes it very difficult to learn and change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wouldn't it be a plus if our governor had an energy policy for New Mexico? More geothermal and wind electricity, tax incentives for refinery expansion and/or a new refinery, responsible development of the Galisteo Basin and Otero Mesa? How about tax incentives for the rest of us to add insulation, windows and fireplace inserts, solar hot water and solar electricity?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some facts about our Vietnam POWs: Ninety percent suffer from PTSD. As a group, they die several years sooner than the general population. The average life span of an American male is about 76. So you can do the math and see that if elected, McCain has a good chance of leaving us with President Palin. If you are that confident that she can run the country, then go ahead and vote Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why does Coach Mumme insist on flying the football team out of Las Cruces instead of going down to El Paso? Why must we spend all the extra money getting three planes small enough to land here instead of booking one big plane on a much cheaper basis out of El Paso? Can't win games, can't manage money. Something ain't right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OK Comcast, you took the Game Show and Hallmark Channel away months ago, but you never replaced them, and yet I'm still paying the same amount every month. When will they get replaced, and please don't replace them with more Spanish channels   we have too many of those already. Put the Spanish channels where they belong, in the foreign package where people can pay extra for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Driving around Las Cruces on a daily basis, I am amazed at the amount of personal vehicles which do not have working tail-lights. LCPD should start a ticket campaign. I counted 10 in one day. Drivers need to check their vehicles regularly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oprah Winfrey, it would have been better for you to have stayed out of politics. Now because of your bias identifying political views and action against a white female (Sarah Palin)m the truth is out. Shame on you. You ditched your main supporters (white females) to the side. Here you werem so against being prejudiced and promoted equalityy for everyone. Oprah Winfrey, you actions have spoken loud and clear. Instead of crying at Barack Obama's acceptance speech, you will now cry because of your losses in your professional career and because of what your reputation will tell from here on!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too bad Richard Guy didn't kill someone while drunk driving. He would have probably only received four years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The road to a presidential victory for Democrat Barack Obama leads through the heavily Hispanic areas of northern New Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama stands an excellent chance of winning New Mexico's five electoral votes in the November general election if he carries those historically reliable Democratic counties such as Rio Arriba and San Miguel counties by big margins and sparks a better-than-average turnout of Hispanic voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That will be part of the mission when Obama visits Espanola on Thursday the first time he's made a campaign stop north of Santa Fe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Mexico is absolutely critical to our path to victory,&quot; Obama's national campaign manager, David Plouffe, said Tuesday. &quot;We think it's one of the Bush states from 2004 that's most likely to flip to Sen. Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2004 presidential race, Democrat John Kerry fell short in Rio Arriba, San Miguel, Mora and Guadalupe counties mostly rural areas in which Hispanics account for more than 70 percent of the voting age population. Kerry won there but not by the margins that Democrats can achieve. Kerry did much better in Santa Fe and Taos counties, where white, non-Hispanics a group called often called &quot;Anglos&quot; helped boost his numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush narrowly carried New Mexico by siphoning off a significant share of Hispanic voters and winning margins of 2-to-1 or more in GOP strongholds in southern, eastern and northwestern parts of the state. Voter turnout averaged 69 percent in the 21 counties that Bush carried. He won 4-to-1 in Lea County, for example, and beat Kerry 3-to-1 in Curry County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, Kerry carried Rio Arriba County home to Espanola with 65 percent of vote. That's not quite a 2-to-1 margin and only 60 percent of the county's voters cast ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Bill Richardson ran five percentage points stronger in Rio Arriba County in his 2002 race for governor and turnout was 70 percent. Richardson won re-election four years later with 81 percent of the vote in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama has to regain the Hispanic voting bloc in order to win New Mexico,&quot; says Brian Sanderoff, an Albuquerque pollster. &quot;For years the Democrats could count on a high percentage of the Hispanic vote to behave as a voting bloc. In presidential politics, the Democrats have been slipping as of late.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain doesn't have to win the Hispanic vote in New Mexico but needs to make inroads like Bush did four years ago. His campaign has targeted Hispanics, such as in a television ad launched in July. The ad featured remarks from a GOP presidential primary debate in which McCain talked about Hispanics serving in the military in Iraq and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Obama, Hispanic voter turnout is critical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to get our Hispanics to participate,&quot; says House Speaker Ben Lujan, a Santa Fe area Democrat. &quot;We know that for whatever reason that our percentage of getting to the polls is very low.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plouffe predicts a strong turnout of voters in New Mexico because of what he describes as an unprecedented grass-roots organization and &quot;what we've got is highly enthusiastic supporters, people who are really hungry for a change and realize this is a big election with big stakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think we can exceed the 2004 presidential turnout in every battleground state on the Democratic side. The question for McCain is he has to not just match Bush's turnout in '04, but he is going to have to grow it too. We think we have got more room to grow in terms of growing the electorate. We spend a lot of time on that,&quot; says Plouffe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Did Barack Obama really call Sarah Palin a pig, as a John McCain&nbsp;ad leads people to believe? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No,&quot; McCain said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican presidential nominee defended the ad anyway, saying Obama &quot;chooses his words very carefully.&quot; The implication: Obama was slyly up to something when he said McCain's call for change in Washington is &quot;lipstick on a pig,&quot; days after Palin made a lipstick joke at the Republican convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's very eloquent,&quot; McCain told The Associated Press and Florida newspapers in an interview, and &quot;it was the wrong thing to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suicide bomber strikes party</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAGHDAD -- A woman wearing a suicide vest blew herself up Monday at a coming-home party for an Iraqi police sergeant detained by U.S. forces for almost a year, killing 22 people and wounding 33, a high-ranking official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party was thrown for Adnan Shukri al-Timimi at his house in Balad Ruz. Al-Timimi was killed along with his parents and 11 high-ranking police officials, including the chief of the local station, said the official in the Iraqi-led Diyala Operations Center, who asked not to be identified. Also killed were at least eight children, some of them related to al-Timimi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. military deaths in Iraq</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of Monday, at least 4,158 members of the U.S. military have died in the Iraq war since it began in March 2003, according to an Associated Press count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest identifications reported by the military:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Army Sgt. 1st Class Daniel R. Sexton, 53, Wentzville, Mo.; died Wednesday at Joint Base Balad of injuries from a non-combat incident; assigned to the 164th Military Police Company, Fort Richardson, Alaska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe releases some power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- President Robert Mugabe ceded a large share of control over Zimbabwe's government Monday, in a power-sharing agreement that loosened his absolute hold over a nation he helped lead to independence nearly three decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal, signed in Zimbabwe's capital in a ceremony that featured a glum Mugabe shaking the hands of his rivals, provided an opening that could bring a much-needed turnaround to a nation that has been in economic free fall for years and in political crisis since elections this spring. But its success depends on the cooperation of longtime enemies who must now work together in a unity government tasked with lifting Zimbabwe out of ruin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources close to the negotiations have said Mugabe will retain control over the army. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai will become prime minister. The leader of a splinter opposition group will be deputy prime minister.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because &quot;change&quot; has become a key issue to us voters Senator McCain has predictably started calling himself a change candidate. Just as predictably Senator Obama wants to portray Senator McCain as not being a candidate of change. So Obama describes McCain's claim to &quot;change&quot; as just selling the some old policies as something new and different. To do this Obama uses on old phrase that he and McCain have used before &quot;You can put lipstick on a pig, it's still a pig. You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change. It's still gonna stink. We've had enough of the same old thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an American I understand what Obama is trying to say. Up to this point it is all pretty normal. Then somehow the &quot;lipstick&quot; part of the comment is picked up in the media and portrayed as a slur on Palin. The McCain campaign has even created an ad showing this is as a smear to Palin, and McCain has asked for a retraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why does McCain think we are dimwits who don't understand what Obama was really attacking? And why hasn't McCain responded to the real statement, that the policies he promotes are the same as the policies that President Bush has been promoting?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats ramping up efforts to court Hispanic voters in western states sent New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson to Nevada over the weekend to make the case that his party's presidential candidate, Sen. Barack Obama, will do more to fix immigration than his Republican rival, Sen. John McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richardson, a Hispanic who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination earlier this year, met Saturday with local Hispanic leaders in North Las Vegas, went to a soccer tournament sponsored by Spanish-language television network Telemundo, and spoke to Clark County Democrats at a dinner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Kerry lost Ohio,&quot; Richardson said, referring to the Democratic senator who lost a bid for the presidency in 2004 to President Bush. &quot;If he had won Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado, he would be president today. I think the key to the election are these three western states and the margin of victory is in the Hispanic vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee are expecting to spend $20 million nationally to rally Latino voters. Campaign officials say they are speaking to voters in Spanish and seeing them face-to-face to make their case for the Illinois senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is also seeking the Hispanic vote, and has released an ad promoting the Arizona senator as a leader in immigration reform. The campaign also plans to air an ad during the Alma Awards, an entertainment awards show honoring Hispanics, in which McCain says immigrants are &quot;symbols of hope&quot; and promises &quot;practical and fair&quot; immigration laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fernando Romero, a Democrat and president of Hispanics in Politics, said a surge of support justified the creation of a &quot;Hispanic Democrats for McCain&quot; group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We realize borders need to be secured. We realize it's not amnesty,&quot; Romero said. &quot;But this is a man who has a record of helping the Hispanic community versus someone who has no history.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in New York</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Mexican wire services</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The nearly 3,000 people who died when hijackers commandeered four passenger jets on Sept. 11, 2001, were remembered Thursday, as President Bush dedicated the first national memorial to the victims and the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates came together in a moment of silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a ceremony at the Pentagon, where 184 people were killed, Bush recalled how the &quot;doomed airliner plunged from the sky, split the rock and steel of this building and changed our world forever.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His voice cracking, he noted that, &quot;There has not been another attack on our soil in 2,557 days&quot; and said he hoped that future generations of Americans with &quot;no living memory&quot; of the attacks would conclude that, &quot;We did not tire, we did not falter and we did not fail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A memorial can never replace what those of you mourning a loved one lost,&quot; he told the audience, estimated at 15,000 people, that included many family members and friends of those who died at the Pentagon that day. &quot;We pray that you will find some comfort amid the peace of these grounds. We pray that you will find strength in knowing that our nation will always grieve for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York City, where 2,751 people were killed when American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 slammed into the World Trade Center towers, causing the buildings to collapse, presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama walked with Mayor Michael Bloomberg and McCain's wife, Cindy, to a temporary memorial site. They laid roses at a reflecting pool at the base of ground zero and paused, bowing their heads in silence. They also greeted a group of survivors, first responders and family members of the people who died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In honor of the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil, both campaigns suspended television advertising for the day. The two men appeared Thursday night at Columbia University at a forum on national service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates to succeed Bush both have faulted him at least in part on his response to the attacks. Obama has criticized Bush for the war in Iraq and for failing to focus resources on the efforts to defeat the Taliban and capture al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. McCain has been critical of Bush's early management of the war in Iraq. Both candidates argue that the American prison holding suspected terrorists at Guant&aacute; namo Bay in Cuba is damaging U.S. credibility abroad and should be closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama appeared to allude to some of those disagreements in a statement he released marking the anniversary, saying, &quot;The terrorists responsible for Sept. 11 are still at large, and must be brought to justice. Let us resolve to defeat terrorist networks, defend the American homeland, stand up for the enduring American values that we cherish, and seek a new birth of freedom at home and around the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither Obama or McCain spoke publicly at Ground Zero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before traveling to New York, McCain spoke at a remembrance ceremony at a field near Shanksville, Pa. -- the spot where United Airlines Flight 93, with 40 passengers and crew aboard, crashed after what investigators have concluded was an uprising against the four hijackers. In his remarks, the Arizona senator noted that the plane's intended target was believed to be the U.S. Capitol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hundreds, if not thousands, of people would have been at work in that building when that fateful moment occurred, and been destroyed along with a beautiful symbol of our freedom,&quot; he said. &quot;They and, very possibly, I owe our lives to the passengers who summoned the courage and love necessary to deny our depraved and hateful enemies their terrible triumph.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Pentagon ceremony, former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who helped people flee the building after the crash, fought off tears as he talked about how &quot;a great building became a battlefield.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He mourned the Pentagon employees who &quot;one morning kissed their loved ones goodbye, went off to work and never came home,&quot; and the passengers on American Airlines Flight 77, which had left Washington Dulles International Airport barely an hour before the crash, &quot;who in the last moments made phone calls to loved ones and prayed to the Almighty before their journey ended not far from where it began.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was here that their fates were truly merged forever,&quot; he said. &quot;They fell side by side as Americans. And make no mistake, it was because they were Americans that they were killed here in this place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members and friends of those who died at the Pentagon took solace in the ceremony and in each other's company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just couldn't come back here right after it happened,&quot; said Pam Thornton, whose son died at the Pentagon. &quot;Now, being here around everybody else who has had people they love die makes it easier.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have officially decided on our two candidates in this outrageous election season. Now, and for the next couple months, it's time to focus on what divides us as Americans, and then pick the guy with whom we agree most. But, aside from the issues, both candidates are dealing with issues that they probably never bargained for. Both candidates are facing problems of a musical nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's problems are plentiful. The Republican candidate has faced criticism, complaint, consternation and even litigation over his choices of campaign theme songs. For a while, he was taking to the stage as Chuck Berry's &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; played. That came to a screeching halt when Berry endorsed Barack Obama, saying, &quot;America has finally come to this point where you can pick a man of color and that not be a drawback. It's no question, myself being a man of color, I mean, you have to feel good about it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a spell, ABBA's &quot;Take a Chance on Me&quot; served as a makeshift theme. &quot;We played it a couple times,&quot; said McCain, &quot;and it's my understanding (ABBA) went berserk.&quot; The campaign also tried to use John Mellencamp's &quot;Pink Houses&quot; and &quot;Our Country,&quot; but Mellencamp is an ardent Obama supporter, and insisted that McCain stop using his tunes to rally GOP support. On the day that McCain announced Sarah Palin as his running mate, he took the stage in Dayton, Ohio, as Van Halen's &quot;Right Now&quot; played. Van Halen wasted no time releasing a statement of displeasure through their publicist, saying that the band's members had no idea McCain would be using their song, and claiming that his campaign had never approached them to ask for permission. &quot;Had they asked,&quot; the statement read, &quot;permission would not have been granted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And speaking of Sarah Palin, McCain's VP candidate didn't waste any time before (inadvertently) jumping into the fray. The day she was announced, word got out that, in her days of high school basketball, her nickname was &quot;Sarah Barracuda.&quot; This prompted the campaign to commandeer the Heart song, &quot;Barracuda,&quot; for use at her stump appearances   a move that was met with anger and chagrin from Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart. They publicly reached out to the McCain campaign, asking them to stop, saying &quot;The Republican campaign did not ask for permission to use the song, nor would they have been granted that permission.&quot; Then, at the Republican National Convention, the song was played again as Palin joined McCain onstage as the balloons fell. Nancy Wilson again spoke out, telling Entertainment Weekly, &quot;I think it's completely unfair to be so misrepresented. I feel completely (screwed) over.&quot; A subsequent statement from the sisters said, in part, &quot;Sarah Palin's views and values in NO WAY represent us as American women. We ask that our song &quot;Barracuda' no longer be used to promote her image.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some singers aren't content with issuing public statements of disapproval. After the Ohio Republican party ran a television ad on behalf of the McCain campaign which appropriated Jackson Browne's &quot;Running on Empty,&quot; Browne fired back with a lawsuit. Browne names the Ohio Republican party, the Republican National Committee and John McCain in the suit. If Browne's copyright is found to be violated, the crime warrants statutory damages of $150,000. But Larry Iser, who represents Browne, thinks the damages would exceed $1,000,000. See, Jackson Browne never allows his music to be used in television ads   regardless of the product. Copyright laws are tricky, and it will be interesting to see how this plays out. It would be wise of McCain to stick with the song that John Rich (of Big &amp; Rich) recorded for him, &quot;Raising McCain,&quot; if only to avoid ruffling more feathers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next week I'll travel to the other end of the spectrum to address Barack Obama's musical conundrum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A friend of mine went over to the Democratic headquarters yesterday to ask for yard signs to show his support for Obama in the election. He was told there was a $5 charge for yard sign to show his support. Who's stupid idea was this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Equally, if not more so, our once great country and in fact the entire planet should be more concerned with our overpopulation than we are with high fuel prices and inflation. Thank you!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. How does Sarah Palin connect to middle-class America? First of all I don't think most middle-class Americans, particularly women, go on with assault weapons on weekends and shoot large animals. I don't connect with her at all and I am your typical middle American female. I connect more with Barack Obama who helped his community, who helped his neighbors. Sarah Palin, she's a joke she so unprofessional when she appears on stage with McCain, who actually shows her more affection than he shows his own wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Tell Steve Pearce to quit siding with big oil. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Regarding the lunch at the schools, my grandson goes to Onate. Now try getting 1000 or more kids sometimes with behavioral problems in a line. They only have one lunch line. How ridiculous is that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. To all politicians, it's not how bad you fought but how well you governed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. If county commission is going to put on the TV they should at least clean up a little bit. This guy McCamley looks like a hobo, hasn't shaved in days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Any Hillary Clinton supporter who was voting for Clinton but is now voting for McCain should be ashamed of themselves and have their voting privileges taken away!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Politics are so bitter, so adolescent and foolish with all these pointing-fingers games. Guess I'm not voting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Here is one thing I didn't know about Sarah Palin: She has son with special needs and she took him and exposed him to loud noises and bright lights. I find that to be questionable parenting. She just cannot make wise decisions. That was classic political propaganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Because Do&ntilde;a Ana County allowed the developer to build on an arroyo, Weisner on the East Mesa has been closed for over a month now. All Do&ntilde;a Ana County has done is to tell us to take the detour to nowhere!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. Obviously if something were to happen to McCain, Palin picks someone a person with depth and foreign affairs, not a Joe Biden. Belittling community organizing is fair pay for them diminishing her as the mayor of Wasilla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. It has been tough to lower the teen pregnancy rate. The celebrity families have made it hard for teenagers to understand why it is a concern for adults. Now we have a vice presidential candidate who makes nothing of her teenage daughter being pregnant. The message they are trying to send is that she is keeping the baby and no abortion. The other message is being sent that it is OK to have sex as a teenager. As woman and as a mother, this makes me angry!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. You parents that are always complaining about the very expensive bus service that your child is provided. If you want him or her to have air conditioning and brand new vehicles, I have an idea. Why don't you take them to school every single day in your air conditioned car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. I just want to know why our mayor is worried about the name of a ball? I think he should be more worried about the community that this organization helps. He should be worried about is what can do for our community and not be worried about a ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17. I recently saw a derogatory political ad aimed at Tom Udall paid for by the Chamber of Commerce. I think people are informed enough to the Chamber of Commerce but a Republican organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">18. By Ken Miyagishima's admission, he's the one who pulled mayor's ball off the community foundation annual event. They didn't leave him, he left them. Get it? Get your facts straight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">19. George Bush has been a headache and a threat to countries that want to blow us up. Which they did, until they were stopped. After November, their only worry will be a young kid or an older man whose backup is a woman who can read a speech and hunt a moose in Alaska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">20. I cannot believe Lieberman, Romney and Huckabee can be supporting McCain after that big slap in the face! That slap was choosing Gov. Palin as his VP candidate. He pretty told them that they weren't qualified enough to be his VP candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Via e-mail:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">21. I have been reading in the paper about the proposed usage of the old Country Club Golf Course. Why not make it a municipal golf course? The green fees would pay for the maintenance and they could be kept low enough for people that can not afford Sonoma Ranch or the Country Club. Las Cruces is the only town in the state of any size that does not have a municipal golf course. There are towns all over the country, less than half our size that have a municipal golf course. We have a great chance to have one without the expense of building one, just move in. It would also solve the problem of keeping the green area right by where people drive through our town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">22. Doesn't it seem odd that La Academia Dolores Huerta Charter School is advertising six teacher positions in the middle of the first semester? When six teachers at the school leave on their own accord, something is truly wrong. If one wants to see what is going on please attend the meeting on Thursday. I know I am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">23. All that was missing from the Raiders Stadium on Monday Night Football was the Democrat voter registration people. Get my point?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">24. Credibility actually means something to people who wish to be informed. There is no point in watching someone who is trying to mislead you, such as Obermann and Matthews from MSNBC. They behave as though they are working for the Obama administration. Oh, as employees of MSNBC, I guess they are. Now they got what they deserved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">27. Most veterans I know are very excited about this new state veterans' museum. It will teach our young about the sacrifices of past and present generations, while bringing attention to our veterans needs. Those who have said the money should go to health care are misinformed. Veterans' health care is paid for and run by the federal government, not the state of New Mexico. This museum will be funded and run by the state, not the feds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">28. The Greater Las Cruces Chamber of Commerce members should take a hint from the Silver City Chamber members and petition to re-elect the entire board of directors instead of having the same right-winger &quot;good old boys&quot; filling the same seats from year to year. Ask Mattiace to fill his VP role and actually do something for his salary since he's getting paid way more to do this job than he was as mayor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">29. Here is Congressional candidate, Ed Tinsley III's incoherent energy policy: &quot;The bridge from today's energy needs to the future is domestic oil.&quot; Forget renewable energy, he strictly supports the &quot;bridge to nowhere&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">30. My hat's off to D.A. Susana Martinez. It's about time someone did something about the truancy in Las Cruces. I have lived here for only a few years, but have never seen the truancy we have here. There are more students wandering the streets around the schools than there are inside the schools. This has always amazed me that nothing is done about it. Maybe now things will improve with a D.A. who is taking a stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">31. Why doesn't the Sun-News give us any information about the lone bid by Philippou for the State Trust Land out on the East Mesa in which he proposes to trade undeveloped dubious land he owns in other places? Would not the citizens be interested in this highly political deal with Commissioner Lyons?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">32. The V.A. is a federal program funded by the federal government. The Veteran's Museum is a state project funded by the state. The museum does not take money away from the current mismanaged Veterans administration. The one's to complain to about lack of care is your congressman or your senators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">33. With the bankruptcy of IndyMac, Bear Stearns (purchased by J.P. Morgan, only to avoid being on the hook for billions of dollars in future liabilities), the fall of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and another 600 to 1,000 banks projected to go under, I think the &quot;Titans of Finance&quot;, starting with the Federal Reserve, need to be overhauled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">34. Susana Martinez should worry about her own &quot;due diligence&quot; in the D.A.'s Office! Hearing and reading stories about innocent people being incarcerated for 40 days, 43 days, when the eyewitnesses and evidence clearly says otherwise, well, maybe Susana Martinez should be hit with a charge of malicious prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">35. No! John McCain, &quot;change&quot; has already arrived via eight years of a war-mongering, corrupt, Republican administration. Since you don't know how many houses you own, it doesn't surprise me that your clueless with the current state of the economy, banking and housing collapse and the demise of the U.S. dollar with record deficits and spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">36. Until the cycle of poverty is broken and the standard of living for the generations of families here in New Mexico is brought up, truancy, drop-out rate, drug and gang involvement, along with teen-pregnancy, will not change with some fascist threat by the D.A.'s Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">37. City Council and D.A. Susana Martinez, don't you have better things to be doing with your resources other than pursuing minor inconveniences and children who don't want to go to school regardless of whether the parent cares or not? You're wasting the taxpayers money, move onto some more meaningful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">38. Caller, I'm glad that the Albertson's 10 for 10 helps you, but that is nothing but a marketing ploy. Especially when you can go elsewhere and get the item for less than one dollar, which is what you're paying with the 10 for 10. It would help you further to watch sale items from other local and independent grocery stores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">39. At the conclusion of the McCain/Palin rally in Albuquerque, KOAT TV interviewed several participants. One was overjoyed with Palin because she was a true conservative, &quot;she loves guns and Jesus,&quot; and then in an after thought he added, &quot;and life&quot;. I wonder what Jesus thinks of that juxtaposition?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">40. Hope these cowards that go around shooting at homes get punished to the fullest extent of the law. This city needs to aggressively pursue and take these gang bangers off our streets before it gets out of control. They are like a cancer if not stopped now, we will all be sorry later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">41. When I heard Sarah Palin talk last night I wasn't sure if I was sure if it was a professional wrestler or a governor of a state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1880 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Listen up! The first task of a would-be leader is to garner followers. Yet the Republicans try to dismiss Senator Obama's ability to draw a crowd. Senator Obama is methodical. He puts first things first. First he gets people out to hear him then he gets them to share his vision. Then he gets everybody to work with him to create a better United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would the genius who removed the clover leaf from I-25 and University Avenue please return it. Thank you!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, I have concern. I was just reading about the lunch line at Zia Middle School. The same thing is happening at Lynn Middle School. These kids are walking away from the lunch line because it is so slow they only have one lunch and there are hundreds of kids. My grandchildren go to that school and have not eaten lunch since school started. I don' think that's fair. We pay taxes. They're supposed to eat right. It's part of their curriculum, it's part of being a good student, and these kids are dropping out of the lunch line. Could somebody see into it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The county commissioner that has the East Mesa ought to get his head out of his rear and get that road fixed on Weisner Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know where some of you people get your information from. Michelle Obama presented herself the way she has always presented herself. I watched every minute of the convention so far, and I will watch it &quot;till the end. I have watched the responses from Democrats and Republicans on CNN, Fox, and MSNBC, and I have never seen half of the things you people claimed have happened or have been said. Are you writing your own script? Or are you just trying to put one over on us?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope that people have noticed that Barack Obama has a tendency to be defiant when you criticize him about something. An example is when he went overseas and held this grand extravaganza before the German people, and others who said the moccasin ad campaign made him a celebrity like Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. So once again Obama decides to be defiant and do exactly the same thing even after being criticized. When tonight he will have extravagant Greek type of stage that is designed by none other than the person who does the designing for Britney Spears sets on her tours. So I would say Barack Obama seems to put it in your face just to spite people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I live in Hatch, and I wanted to thank who ever is responsible for having the teachers start dressing up as professionals. They want to be paid as professionals they should start looking like professionals. Instead of teeny boppers trying to blend in with the students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the Republican leaders and inspirers put out the word for rain in Denver during the Democratic Convention. Well it turned out as a beautiful day. I guess God didn't want to listen to them!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yeah I can see about our city cops and at the intersection of Elks and Main Street a car is broken down, and traffic is backed up. Instead of a cop getting out and helping get the car off the road and directing traffic, he went right around and ignored them. There's no emergency lights on. Was he getting off his shift? And if he was, couldn't he call someone else over to that intersection? So that's why we pay our cops. Good job city police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is concerning the Roadrunner bus that burned and blew a lot of smoke on Idaho. I had a relative on that bus, and the paper failed to mention the military person who had a fire extinguisher and put out the fire and saved some people on that bus from injury and danger. I'd like to thank that person for saving my relative from major harm. Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most outstanding characteristic about Obama is the fact that if B.S. were music he would be a symphony orchestra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I applaud Senator Obama for his acceptance for nomination of the United States. Enough is enough. We're taking back this country. You GOPs, get real! We're going to start with city council. Take back the City of Las Cruces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mesilla marshal who is smiling while escorting a distraught Carol Boyse in the paper should be ashamed of himself. Completely unprofessional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republicans are going strong. They have picked a woman vice president. That is great. I was a Democrat and voting for Hillary, but she didn't make it. All the females in my family, 32 as of right now and trying to convince some more, we will all go for McCain. Smart man, smart choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does anyone need to be reminded that these so-called titles of respect that some like to be called have to be earned. Unlike those awarded in the service in our country. Or the common title of Mr. or Mrs. Titles of respect need to be earned, and truthfully I haven't seen a politician lately that either deserves my respect or me calling them by some title they think they deserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well this is concerning Tom Udall. He doesn't understand how our government works. I don't know how somebody who has been to D.C. and served in the Senate can actually blame the president when he is part of the body that makes laws and controls government. Should we send him back? No! If he doesn't know how our government works, he doesn't need to be there to start with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well McCain has officially blown it. He picked Sarah Palin, the female governor of Alaska. First of all, everyone sees it as an attempt to try to say I can do something historic too. Second of all, everyone, she's in the back pocket of oil companies. Thank you for your pick Mr. McCain for leaving the open road for president Obama!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is to let Bill Richardson see what a real governor from a real state, Sarah Palin, is now doing. And you thought you could be vice president. HA!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now see Bill Richardson it's real plain and simple. If you don't run crazily to Washington every 5 minutes and abandon your state to have these wild delusions of becoming V.P. or president, a governor from another state like Sarah Palin is nominated. But you chose to run around like a mad man. Well look where she is, and where you are buddy!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If John McCain were elected president, and God forbid something happened to him, how qualified is his vice presidential candidate to be commander in chief? Not very, I don't think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In negotiating the new contract with El Paso Electric, which starts on Sept. 9, I hope Mayor Miyagashima remembers that he wanted to do away with the franchise fee of 2 percent. And that he doesn't increase the franchise fee to the public. Keep your promises mayor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I just saw an interview with Sarah Palin and all I got to say is ... no experience! She has only won two terms as mayor in some little Po-dunk town in Alaska and a year and a half as a Governor. Oh yeah, and a former beauty queen. Thanks McCain you handed the election to the Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't understand why so many people are enthralled by Barack Obama. He's never held a real job. He wheeled and dealed his way into politics. He has no accomplishments. He was chosen as chairman of a subcommittee, but never held a single meeting. He may be a fine order, but is that all it takes to become president of the United States?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain has proven his inability to lead this country by choosing Sarah Palin after meeting her only once. His age and his medical history would put this inexperienced woman a heartbeat away from the presidency. If he is trying to appeal to Hillary Clinton supporters, he apparently does not understand that Sarah Palin is no Hillary Clinton. His desperate choice was a gamble. Do not put John McCain in a position to recklessly gamble with the future of our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidates, canvassers, campaigners: Please do not leave your literature on the doorsteps of those that don't answer your knocks! Although I appreciate your enthusiasm and dedication to the democratic process, these items can indicate the vacancy of a home. Think about the implications!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wow as an independent from a small-town in middle America. Palin has my vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you see the MSNBC/CNN talking heads and print media, as well as most Libs, trying desperately to tear down Sarah Palin, it shows their fear. They know she connects with middle America in a way a certain elitist &quot;community activists&quot; never could.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cindy McCain made her money the old-fashioned way. She inherited it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I agree with the caller about Sen. Rawson's personal beliefs. Who cares! It's what Rawson does that counts with me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can anyone praise Sen. Leonard Lee Rawson for his support of education? Mr. Rawson has consistently opposed funding for schools and voted against $1.4 billion in school funding. Our community needs a state senator who shows concern about our low-income families and their children's education. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How could Palin resonate with working women when she is against pay equality?! The administration she is backing, and planning to perpetuate, is the reason why working women are not doing as great as they should.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that McCain would be the second oldest president if elected, and the oldest elected to a first term, I'd really like to see more coverage about his health concerns. Also, given this situation, I'd really like to know more about Palin's views on issues, since there's a real possibility that she would become President of the U.S. if McCain were elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who is the brilliant marketer that separated the fans from the court and teams? If you attend NMSU volleyball games, and you should, you'll see the court side seating all around the arena almost empty with eight to 10 guards placed to keep you out. Seems that this was someone's moneymaking scheme that failed again. Athletic marketers continue to put money first and fans last. Would you not think that the team would like the fans close to give them encouragement?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the city is thinking ahead a little bit. Let's face it, the population of Las Cruces will continue to grow, and more parks and green space will be demanded. It would be cheaper and easier in the long run to convert LC Country Club into a park now than to scramble to find space a few years down the road after the country club and other open areas have been filled up with houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that everyone has been seemingly distracted by the current Ms. GOP Distraction, let's look at the accomplishments of our local poll's running for reelection, like Kent Evans. Just exactly what has Mr. Evans done for our county since he has been in office that would justify being reelected?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The District Attorney'sOffice says that in 2007 there were 7,000 cases screened and 5,000 approved for prosecution. My question is, how many of those 5,000 resulted in conviction?With the lowest conviction percentage in the state, I think waiving the exemption and having a review board may make the D.A. think twice about charging andputting an innocent person behind bars when the evidence and witnesses say otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Quayle's bloopers may have been more fun to poke fun at, but in a speech on May 9, 2008, at Beaverton, Ore., Obama claimed to have visited 57 states. So that is where it came from. I did you a favor, do me one. Why is the Bush family accused of every horrid thing that has happened since we vacated caves as the domicile of choice?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the caller about McCain supporters hating this country, you need to be educated about Obama, his friends, associates and pastor. If you need the names, check out the Rev. Wright, and I will vote for McCain because I want to save this country from Democrats and terrorists.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jennifer Tilly was back visiting Indian Market this weekend. She was out and about Friday night, and then seen at market on Saturday. Also seen on the Plaza was actress Maggie Gyllenhaal, spotted at a booth. Most impressive, though, was the sight of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the throngs of people on the Plaza on Saturday of market. Wisely, the justice wore a broad hat to protect herself from the very bright sun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of Justice Ginsburg, she also attended the final performance of the Santa Fe Opera's Billy Budd on Aug. 21. After the performance, Ginsburg mentioned to an orchestra member that she had been to three other productions of Billy Budd -- in her mind, the Santa Fe Opera production was tops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Duvall and a companion stopped in at Ecco Espresso and Gelato on East Marcy Street on Thursday. Since arriving in town for the filming of Crazy Heart, the iconic and Oscar-winning actor has been out and about around town. On this stop, he was casually clad in what looked like sweats and that male favorite, a baseball cap. Down South, those head coverings are better known as &quot;gimme-caps,&quot; because businesses give them out to advertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, in these political times, are Duvall's connections to both Barack Obama and John McCain. According to the IMDB movie Web site, Obama and Duvall are both descended from French immigrant Mareen Duvall (as are both Dick Cheney and Harry Truman). Duvall also is connected to McCain, whose ancestor worked with George Washington, a relation of Duvall's through adoption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe's sister to the north, Taos, gets a publicity shot in the arm from O, The Oprah Magazine in its September issue as one great fall getaway. From fantastic flora to great views to superb hiking, Taos is billed as one of the best places to visit across the country during autumn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spread even features a photo of El Prado, featuring the ever-popular chile ristras (spelled, unfortunately, as chili in the cutline). In that same issue, you'll find Santa Fe resident Willa Shalit, featured in an article about her work with the women of Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A shout-out to teen Lucy Ohlsen, a 16-year-old Santa Fe High student who is off to Denmark this year as an exchange student. She dances, plays French horn and piano and loves to write. Her dad, Greg Ohlsen, owns the Travel Bug, and her mom, Ellen Stelling, is a self-employed CPA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guy Fieri from the Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives was spotted at Backroad Pizza at lunchtime Monday. The popular show is filming in Santa Fe.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gas price blame</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is amazing to anyone connected with reality that the Republicans are now trying to blame the Democrats for the high price of gasoline. They resort to lies and smears since their performance has been so abysmal. The reasons for high gas prices are simple to understand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republicans' reckless spending and borrowing, coupled with gigantic tax breaks to the very rich, have caused the value of the dollar on the international market to be cut almost in half. Since oil is priced in dollars, the producers have had to double the price just to stay even. Without the Republicans, we'd be paying less than $2 per gallon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even worse, they have consistently blocked all efforts to require automakers to build cars with higher gas mileage. If we had required 30 miles per gallon (other countries require even better mileage than that), instead of the 20 that our cars and trucks now get, we would be spending about the same on gas as we were paying eight years ago, before they took over. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They now have the nerve to try to squeeze even more ill-gotten gains from the country by overturning George Bush Sr.'s bans on oil drilling. The only thing to be gained from that would be to throw more billions of dollars into the pockets of the fat-cat Republican campaign contributors. They sure aren't going to charge us any less for that oil (our oil!) than the Arabs do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can't afford to let them go on plundering our nation. We had a strong economy in 2000. It is now on the ropes. Four more years of Republicans in Washington could be enough to make the damage permanent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palestinian repression</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israel continually defies international law by building settlements on the West Bank and in Jerusalem. Zealotry is costly to Jews and Arabs alike. Rabin's assassin was a Jewish settler who killed 29 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque in 1994, prompting Hamas to begin suicide bombings against Jewish civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biblical boundaries of Israel are not dispositive. Genesis 15:18 claims land from the Nile to the Euphrates and Gilead, a grandiose thought in today's reality. Judges 20:I mentions only Dan to Beersheba, which wouldn't include Haifa and the Negev. God apparently wrote nothing down until 80 Chapters of the Old Testament. The entire Jewish canon came together around 100 AD after rabbis decreed which documents would constitute Scripture. The Greek version of the Old Testament was written for Ptolemy II, King of Egypt several centuries BC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Testament was debated by Christians for four centuries prior to prescription of an official canon. Some wished to toss the Old Testament altogether and early Christian fundamentalism began to evolve as a defense against Agnostic scholarship. Christians and Jews believe their Books of the Bible were composed by God. Christ never wrote anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Golda Meir said there is no such thing as a Palestinian People, a sympathy most favored by local writer-physician Michael Polsky, who continually writes scathing letters and always takes no prisoners. Churchill differed with his proposal for Arab and Jewish states in Palestine but failed in his desire to separate Transjordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jews resided in &quot;Palestine&quot; under Turkish dominion for 500 years, millennia removed from Biblical calculations. Some Jews today wish to expel Arab-Israeli citizens from Israel, to live in yurts as many have for four generations in refugee camps. Revanchist claim based on archaic seigniorage can only be construed as apocryphal. But the cycles of repression and revenge continue. The Gods have many avenging angels.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supports Fischmann</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Fischmann should be elected our State Senator for District 37. He will represent all the residents of Do&ntilde;a Ana County and Sierra County whatever their party affiliations. It appears to me that he really wants to follow in the footsteps of J. Paul Taylor, one of the great progressive legislators of New Mexico. Taylor was recognized everywhere in the state of New Mexico for his accomplishments for the young people, for the disadvantaged and for the people who didn't have a voice. Partisan bickering has killed important legislation regarding education, ethics reform, working families, affordable housing and real economic development. Money-giving lobbyists, campaign donors and wealthy developers have a firm hand on the state Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Fischmann has been severely attacked by these groups. He is a threat to their control of the state Senate. It was fortunate for New Mexicans that Mr. Fischmann exposed the unfavorable agreement between Las Cruces and El Paso Electric and the no-bid sweetheart deal between the State Land Office and a large developer for the East Mesa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Fischmann will be a voice for much-needed reform in the state Senate. His main goal he says is to &quot;to return government to serving the needs of everyday citizens first.&quot; He has a comprehensive plan for bringing in good jobs, providing health care for truly needy New Mexicans, addressing the many issues of education and our youth, protecting the environment and making New Mexico the leader in renewable energy. He will also ensure taxpayers get a fair shake on complicated tax increment financing plans being promulgated by big developers. The question for the voters is do we want to maintain the status quo. Mr. Fischmann will give a voice to all the residents of New Mexico not to the special interests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proud of heritage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I belong to the second generation in my family born in the USA after New Mexico became a state. My ancestors were born here, but it was a territory of the USA. My mother was born in 1912, a few months after we became the 47th state. It may seem strange to you that we are proud to be what God in His infinite wisdom and goodness ordained us to be, but we are proud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I am speaking to someone and you do not understand what I am saying, in all likelihood I am not talking to you. You are rude to eavesdrop. When and if I do talk to you, you will understand what I am saying. I will make sure of it. I will make my sentences as simple as they need to be to communicate with you. If I speak in a language that you don't understand, it is still American by virtue of having been spoken by me, an American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are also proud of our architectural style and heritage, please be courteous and stop insulting us. It has been the style in this area long before the Mayflower landed back east. The buildings were probably here when you arrived in the area. If you didn't like the style, you should have considered locating somewhere more pleasing to you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am delighted to be bilingual. You should try learning another language; it isn't as hard as you might imagine. I actually had no trouble learning English as a second language. Now I probably have a better command of English then most people who have no other tongue. I certainly have a better command of the language then the president of the United States.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's affair</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have really had it with the media and it's sensationalistic coverage of John Edwards' affair. It seems to me that since he is not running for any office there is really no point to all the coverage. Maybe I'm wrong; maybe the point is to humiliate his wife as she fights her final battle with cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand there is a candidate for the presidency who is getting a pass by the media for his indiscretions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of John McCain's affairs and the circumstances under which they occurred, President and Mrs. Reagan shunned him. Also, for the same reasons the pastor who has served the Bush family for years has decided to endorse Sen. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Sen. McCain did for all who don't know; after his first wife was disfigured in a car accident he had several affairs. Included in the affairs was one he had with his current wife. Ultimately he left his wife to marry the much younger Cindy. All this makes me question his commitment and integrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, Sen. McCain seems not to be able to do enough to denigrate his current wife. On several occasions he has publicly lost his famous temper and struck out at her using the &quot;c&quot; word. Also, this year at the Sturgis motorcycle rally, he offered a group of bikers to have her enter a dance contest which was to have been top-less and was called the banana dance (use your imagination).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why has the media not had a field day with this? Is it because they want to get this guy elected? If this reprobate becomes our president what does it say about the values of our country? Also, what does it say about the GOP's vaunted &quot;family value?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before John McCain announced his choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, the race for president of the United States was one for the history books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the first black nominee of a major political party, Barack Obama's speech -- given on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s &quot;I have a dream&quot; speech -- contained both soaring rhetoric and brass-tacks policy points. In one 45-minute stretch before 84,000 screaming people, Obama decisively ended his summer slump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In accepting the nomination of the Democratic Party, Obama framed the fall race as a choice between the numerous failures of the Republican Party and his vow to bring back our nation's shared vision of American promise and opportunity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, McCain was preparing to share his choice for vice president, using the Friday announcement as a way to zap the buzz for Obama's speech -- and then, to the surprise of almost everyone, as a Hail Mary pass to the endzone to change the dynamics of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By picking Palin, McCain appeals both to disaffected Hillary Clinton voters (after all, all women want is a woman on the ticket, right?) and to hard-core conservatives. It's also a completely Western ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 44-year-old mother of five, former beauty queen, first-term Alaska governor is beloved of the right-wing. She is pro-life, pro-gun, supports teaching creationism in the schools and proudly touts her experience in both the PTA and as a hockey mom. Her youngest, a 4-month-old, has Down Syndrome. She's pro-business, pro-drilling and pro-resource development. Before becoming governor of Alaska, a job she's had less than two years, she was mayor of her hometown, a town of 7,000-plus outside of Anchorage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's also touted as a reformer, someone who cleaned up Alaska politics, a label that has tarnished somewhat since Palin became embroiled in her own scandal. She stands accused of seeking to have an ex-brother-in-law fired from the state police. She, like so many Alaska politicians, is being investigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is banking on her firing up the conservatives in his party, as well as appealing to women of all political persuasions. On that level, the pick could also be read as insulting. It is saying that women will vote gender before experience, before policy, before competence. It is, as Josh Marshall of the Talking Points Memo Web site, puts it, &quot;a daring pick, but I think a very weak pick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, it's McCain's pick, and as such, once again calls his judgment into question. If the first job of a vice president is to be ready to step in as president, Palin doesn't cut the mustard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, Obama reached out to senior U.S. Sen. Joe Biden, bringing to the Democratic ticket not a gimmick but a serious foreign policy expert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's gamble, though, shakes up the race, gives the pundits something to ponder and the voters a new face to absorb. It's a warning, too, that the &quot;maverick&quot; will do just about anything to get elected. But then, after a month of Obama-as-celebrity commercials and patriotism put-downs, we knew that, didn't we?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER -- The official balloting for the Democratic presidential nomination had been going on for some time. State by state, alphabetically, each delegation leader announced the votes for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton -- but only after praising various aspects of their home state, prominent Democrats who came from there and current Democratic office holders. Finally, New Mexico was called, and state party chairman Brian Col&oacute;n followed tradition, spending several moments bragging about the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the tension built, however, instead of announcing the New Mexico vote, Col&oacute;n yielded to the state of Illinois, which earlier had passed. Illinois' votes gave its own senator, Obama, the vote total needed to officially clinch the nomination. Illinois then yielded to New York, whose senator, Clinton, moved to nominate Obama by acclamation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So New Mexico's vote never was officially announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Col&oacute;n later said the vote would have been 35 for Obama and 3 for Clinton, who earlier in the day had released her pledged delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swift boats and wind turbines: U.S. Rep. Tom Udall of Santa Fe, speaking to New Mexico delegates to the Democratic National Convention at breakfast Wednesday, said Republicans are starting to use &quot;swift boat&quot; tactics against him in his race for U.S. Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few moments later, Udall introduced the next speaker, who happened to be a Texas oilman who in 2004 helped finance Swift Boat Veterans for Truth -- an organization that infamously attacked presidential candidate John Kerry with some claims that turned out not to be true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">T. Boone Pickens, a lifelong Republican, wasn't there to talk about partisan politics, however. He was there to speak on The Pickens Plan, his ambitious agenda for promoting alternative energy sources. He's been running national television commercials for the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pickens wants to spend $1 trillion on wind-turbine farms for power generation and use natural gas to fuel automobiles. He claims the proposal would cut the amount the country spends annually on imported oil from $700 billion to $400 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pickens told the Democrats that his plan differs with Al Gore's call for a switch to electric automobiles within 10 years. He said it would be more realistic to use natural gas to fuel cars for the next 20-30 years. &quot;Then we'll get to Al's plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those attending the breakfast responded enthusiastically. After the talk, many Democrats crowded around Pickens to shake his hand and pose with him for photos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked how it felt to be fawned over by all these Democrats, Pickens said, &quot;It's great. I like people who like me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Pickens was quoted in April by The Wall Street Journal Online as saying he supported Republican presidential candidate John McCain, Pickens said Wednesday after his talk that he's staying out of the presidential race to concentrate on his energy plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pickens in New Mexico has hired a couple of top Democratic strategists -- Dave Contarino, the former Bill Richardson campaign manager, and Caroline Buerkle, the former Patricia Madrid campaign manager -- to promote The Pickens Plan. Pickens plans to speak at a town hall forum in Albuquerque on Sept. 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did Udall, who is running against Republican Steve Pearce for Senate, commit a faux pas by mentioning swift boats? No, said his campaign manager, Amanda Cooper. &quot;T. Boone's cool with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing up to spies: I spotted the sign while I was riding the free 16th Street Mall bus Tuesday morning. A big sign with a simple message: &quot;Stop Government Spying&quot; held by a smiling man with bushy gray sideburns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 11 hours later, while walking down 16th, I spotted the same guy holding the same sign, this time assisted by a younger woman. I couldn't resist talking to him to find out why he was doing this for hours on end on the streets of Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His name is Ben Masel, and he comes from Madison, Wis. He's a longtime activist and veteran of many protests and various causes. When I told him I was from The New Mexican, he said he was at a drug reform conference in 2001 that then-Gov. Gary Johnson attended. I'd covered that same conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm doing this partly in the hopes of influencing president Obama,&quot; he said, &quot;but especially to try to influence members of Congress passing through, with the sense that we need some legislative fixes for the massive erosions of our privacy. My own representative, Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) stopped and posed with us an hour ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masel said Baldwin will sponsor a bill to create &quot;an affirmative privacy right in cell phone location data, which apparently belong to the phone companies to deal with however they like.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masel said he hasn't faced any harassment from police or passersby in Denver. But he has forced some &quot;free speech issues&quot; with business owners who have tried to remove him from sidewalks. &quot;I've backed each of them down,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When some security guards tried to have him removed from in front of a downtown hotel, Masel said, the manager came out to discuss the problem and eventually the manager agreed with Masel's right to protest on a public sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masel also was protesting a party Sunday at the Mile High Station thrown by AT&amp;T for the conservative &quot;Blue Dog&quot; Democrats. Some left-wing blogs have criticized the party, noting most of the Blue Dogs voted to immunize telecommunication companies for their participation in the Bush administration's warrantless spying program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops tried to remove him, but Masel said a Denver police lieutenant was &quot;smart enough&quot; to know he had a right to protest on a public sidewalk. Masel said he agreed to stay in one spot and not block passersby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maureen Warfield, who was helping Masel hold the sign, said she'd just been there for a short time. &quot;I was just walking up and down, and I saw this awesome sign,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warfield, who is from Castle Rock, Colo., said she's been downtown every day during the convention, sometimes with her children. On Monday, she said, she was in front of an MTV Rock the Vote performance with a sign that said &quot;Screw Iraq, Fight for Freedom in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got four kids,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm a stay-at-home mom, and I'm sickened by what's happening today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masel said he plans to protest the Republican convention in St. Paul, Minn., next week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West Romero Road</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a property owner along this road, I absolutely have no interest whatsoever in seeing this road paved, not now, and probably never. My taxes are based on the land value, and I bought the land as a place to have gardens and sanctuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paving the road may make access to a few Earthships more palatable in the winter and summertime, and save a few gallons of water at the car wash, but it will not reduce the flow of traffic or the speeds at which vehicles travel. Further, it will only destroy the very nature of the &quot;Georgia O'Keeffe&quot; views. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it stands today, the road is a throwback to days of old, and one can pull over and gracefully take photographs that become fantastic memories. How will a paved road improve the picture?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I bought land for gardens and sanctuary and not to profit by a tumultuous market. I also bought land in order to be a part of a thriving intellectual and artistic community located in and around this roadway. The only gain in paving the road will be for homeowners with an interest in fast profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth is real estate always increases and has steadily done so since the founding of these United States. Property for some people is a means to retirement, but for others like myself, it is a connection and a bond to the community. It represents hope and sustainability. I hope people will respect the wishes of he many residents who do not want this road paved.</SPAN></P>

I hope you read our ad in the July 24 Tempo thanking hundreds of individuals and businesses who gave time, money, services, and lots of love to help the foundation raise money to buy hospital equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, I missed some incredible folks in that ad, and I wanted to acknowledge their great contributions to Toast of Taos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toast of Taos bills itself as the best of Southwest wine, art, and food, but it also features incredible music. Numerous musicians added their immense talents to our events this year -- to the delight of all. I especially want to thank the following musical groups and individuals who added great magic to our events: Rick De Stefano; Lewis, DonCon and Turnmire; Mariachi Le&oacute;n; Paul Jones; Billy Archuleta; and Meredith Blis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people think that John McCain is a less risky choice for president than Barack Obama. His white hair and raspy voice are reassuring, very much like the grandfathers whom we idolized as children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am a few years younger than John McCain. I don't have the physical stamina I had 20 years ago. My mind is not as sharp. And it is harder for me to respond to even minor challenges in my life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain takes weekends off from campaigning. He seems to be confused about Sunni/Shia, the sequence of events in Iraq, and changes in the map of Eastern Europe. He has few new ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not discrimination based solely on age. It is questioning the fitness of a candidate for the most demanding job in the world. My security and that of my country could depend on someone who is just not up to it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Open pit mining in Questa again? Does Chevron know the history of this out-moded mining practice in Questa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November 1964, the Molybdenum Corporation of America announced plans to expand its small mining operation in Questa. The company had originally planned underground mining but chose instead to dig an open pit in order to begin operations quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Open pit mining requires bulldozing tons of broken up rock from above the ore vein, a practice now known as &quot;mountain top removal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where does all this broken rock go? In Questa it was dumped on the sides of other mountains. Ugly they look -- but more than that, they move. The issue of rock slides (rock pile instability in industry parlance) brought Gov. Richardson to Questa several years ago and monitoring devises and barriers were installed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less dramatic but a certain and constant danger, is the problem of acid rock drainage. Rain and air on broken rock surfaces cause oxidation which acidifies the water. This acid drainage then leaches metals from the rock which drain into the ground water and the river below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does Questa want more of the same? Does Chevron really want to go for the quick profit, as Molycorp did 40 years ago, and further devastate the landscape and pollute the water of this beautiful Northern New Mexico village?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While registering voters at the Duck Races last Saturday, I was surprised to find how many people do not know that Senator Obama is pro-abortion. I couldn't believe that in this age of mass communication, they would be unaware. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then it dawned on me. He really doesn't like to advertise that fact, since it could cost him votes. For example, in his appearance at Saddleback Church, in response to the question &quot;when does life begin,&quot; he chose to declare &quot;that answer was above his pay grade&quot; Here was a chance to clearly state his position. He chose not to, as he usually does on most issues, such as gun control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2003, then-Illinois Sen. Obama led the battle to defeat the Illinois version of the federal Born-Alive Protection Act, which would have treated babies living, although briefly, outside the womb, as babies. He also opposed a similar bill in 2001. Even Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., a strong abortion advocate, supported the bill. But Obama opposed it. He even accused pro-lifers of lying about his record, but his campaign now admits, he was in fact lying about the pro-lifers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Change?&quot; I hope not.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tax plan in simple English</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To counter recent false and misleading attack ads by John McCain on Barack Obama's tax proposals, here is the gist of Obama's tax plan for America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama would reverse the Bush tax policy, which heavily favors the mega-rich. He would lower taxes for the poor and middle-class families (below $150,000), increase taxes for the rich, those earning upwards of $250,000 a year, and simplify it so most Americans could file in five minutes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would eliminate all taxes on seniors making less than $50,000 and they would not have to file.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would give 150 million working Americans up to a $500 tax credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To help fix the Social Security System, he would apply a tax of 2 to 4 percent on all incomes above $250,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's clear from his proposals that Barack Obama is not beholden to the wealthy and powerful, the corporations or lobbyists. He is for the average American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, John McCain would make the Bush tax cuts for the rich permanent. On Aug. 16, McCain defined the rich as those making more than $5 million a year and those making less as middle class. This elitist notion places him way out of the mainstream. Of course being married to a multi-millionaire beer heiress will do that to you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Mexican</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Ralph Nader, it was the same tired, old question, the one about being a spoiler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the people in the audience, however, it might have been a new version of the answer he's been giving since the first time he ran for president. Still, it had a familiar ring:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we all have an equal right to run for election ... then we have an equal right to get votes, then we have an equal right to try and get votes from one another,&quot; Nader said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we're either all spoilers of one another, or none of us are spoilers unless we think that third party and independent candidates are second-class citizens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nader, a lawyer and consumer advocate turned perennial presidential candidate, gave a soft-spoken news conference and speech to a group of about 150 people at the College of Santa Fe. He appeared tired after speaking earlier in the day in Albuquerque at The University of New Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Independent Party candidate, Nader will be on the ballot in New Mexico this fall after supporters gathered more than the needed signatures to secure a spot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nader, who has spent 40 years working on consumer issues in Washington, expressed disappointment at being shut out of the upcoming presidential debates between Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're No. 3, and we're kept off the debates. ... Now, last I heard, the 60th seed at Wimbledon had a chance ... but you are No. 3 (in the presidential race), and you are denied access to 100 million viewers,&quot; he said. &quot;This is not democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign is working to qualify for one debate in New Orleans this fall sponsored by Google. To participate, though, he needs 10 percent of voters' support in polls. In a CNN-Opinion Research Corp. survey conducted in late July, he was at 6 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his appearance, Nader was quick to take swipes at both parties and the two-party system. &quot;The professional Democrats don't want to look in the mirror and see why they can't landslide the worst Republicans in Republican Party history, and so they scapegoat the Greens, and people shouldn't fall for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said both parties have worked to shut members of other parties out of the political system. &quot;They get it into the minds of voters that they are the only show in town, and we're trying to change that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nader urged audience members to participate and to vote their conscience. &quot;How can you respect yourself if you don't vote for who you believe in?&quot; he said. &quot;Who else do you vote for if you don't vote for who you believe in?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One part of his speech that drew loud applause was his discussion of how taxpayer money should be used. Nader called for &quot;no more stadiums built on the backs of taxpayers&quot; while local schools and libraries are falling apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nader's visit comes after Obama and McCain were in the state last week. New Mexico is predicted to be a battleground state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santa Fe waiter Matt Buchly said he knows he'll vote for Nader for sure. He said he's tired of politicians who talk in circles. &quot;When he (Nader) talks about something, he talks direct. When somebody asks him a question, he answers direct. He's not talking in all these phrases and around in circles and abstractions that nobody understands, which is the deal with Obama, I think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buchly, 23, a registered Green, said he's glad he's got a third-party choice. &quot;I feel like I want to support Obama, but I feel like I don't know what he stands for. When I've seen him in the debates, and I've seen him talk, and I've checked out his Web site, and when I try to understand, it's all abstractions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buchly also likes Nader's idea that anyone can run for office. &quot;I've heard him say in this campaign that he believes that the everyday working man should be able to run for office, and it seems like every other party doesn't even allow that kind of option.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nader today was scheduled to be in Denver at the Democratic National Convention, where his campaign planned to have 14-foot props he said no photographer or reporter there would miss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The props: a Lady Liberty statute and a huge bottle with a cork. &quot;Uncork the debates,&quot; he said. &quot;Stop putting the debates in a bottle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nader is running with San Francisco attorney Matt Gonzalez, who was elected to that city's Board of Supervisors in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Nader and Libertarian Bob Barr, other minor party presidential candidates expected to be on the ballot are Green Party candidate Cynthia McKinney and Constitution Party candidate Chuck Baldwin, a Florida preacher.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pie Town, in fact, has nothing to fight about except what's tastier, the pumpkin or the pecan?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can you not like this small Catron County village located on Highway 60 between Quemado and Datil? I mean, when folks say, &quot;let's drive into town for dinner,&quot; they're talking about Albuquerque 160 miles away. That's my kind of place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can you not like a town nesting at 7000 feet where the Daily Pie Caf&eacute; boasts a slogan that trumpets, &quot;It's All Downhill From Here&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pie Town claims to be America's &quot;Friendliest Little Town&quot; and it just may be. They say neighbors wouldn't think of driving by without waving. Unlike Albuquerque, where motorists tend to hold up a finger in another type of greeting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pie Town claims she is visited by a myriad of travelers seeking a more relaxed route as well as hikers and bicyclists from around the world traveling the &quot;Great Divide&quot; from Mexico to Canada.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a recent weekend morning, I telephoned Mike. I'm not making this up. He was baking pies. I envy the folks of Pie Town. I could live there for about three weeks. Then I would begin missing the squabbling of civilization.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to be a republican one must be super rich or super stupid!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I saw in the paper the other day that our district attorney was introducing John McCain at Pan-Am. I have a better idea how about keeping an eye in the shop? Let's work at enforcing and prosecuting the laws in our county and less on political activities. Let's have a district attorney that's a little less non partisan. How about that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hi this is a response to the person who called in on going easy on the homeowners the weeds. Don't worry Codes doesn't do anything I've called them and called about weeds. I've called for months and they don't do a darn thing. Our mayor doesn't care or he'd say something. So don't worry about it bud. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wiener road is closed to through traffic. What we want is Do&ntilde;a Ana County planning why the developer was allowed to build in Arroyo and caused this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want to know about the bus situation there at Zia. My son also rides that bus and I pay a lot of taxes. For him to be the only one. I need an answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My son attends Highland Elementary and while I am extremely happy with their educational organization and the teachers my son has. I'm not pleased with their lunch. They only have one line for I was told 750. They only ran one line something needs to be done, our tax dollars need to be sent over. So that they fix that so they can have two lunch lines going at once. That is ridiculous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is officer Lauren Barrel immune to the domestic violence charges here in Las Cruces?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I get a kick out of these auto commercials. Who are they kidding? They are ridiculous and they've been bamboozled the public for the last 50 years. Charging 18-20,000 for a mid-ranged car. Your just making millionaires out of the dealership owners. You can sell more cars if you lower the prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama just allowed the Washington insiders choose his vice president of the United States. Joe Bidden is probably one of the worst 36 senators congress has ever had. Bad choice Mr. Barack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am calling about Wiener. It would be great if the county could publicize road closures so that we don't drive into the construction and then have to turn around. To drive all the way around thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes I've been to my daughters elementary school, Valley View, and wonder why no one knows why there is an elderly woman walking aimlessly down through the halls with what looks like a bag of groceries. She has been there like 3 days in a row. We need to watch out for our kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It just continues to amaze me. People continue to say that an education a college education will help you advance in life but yet to NMSU employees highly educated are being accused of hoarding over 100 animals many dead animals on their property. Go figure!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liberals are foaming at the mouth because McCain had problems getting the exact number of homes which include a lot of rental property and in a debate. Yet quickly forget that his majesty Obama stated in a speech that there were 57 states! Yeah let us forget that. That's a typical liberal thing. You probably won't see that in the newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just reading of Viewpoints by Bill Burial in the Sun News. How sad that a man with a presumably with a masters degree in education was teaching in the public school system can write in the level of a high school student. That was the poorest composition I have ever seen. Now I don't really have to wonder why our kids are failing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, Mr. Burrola after reading your article in Saturday morning's paper. You probably need to practice what you preach you rambled all over the place and made no sense at the end when you talked at the end about John Edward's. What did that have to do with homework?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you democrats like the Kerry-Edwards ticket you will love the Obama-Biden ticket. Let's face it we blew it again. Hillary would have won it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can hardly wait to see that part of the democratic national convention where Obama blesses the fishes and the loaves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple that neglected the 118 in their home should be tied to the tree in the plaza of Mesilla and horse whipped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For me Obama secretly anticipated the selection of Joe Bidden as his running mate is a bit of a disappointment. Although Bide is a well meaning and experienced lad he is no match to intelligence and perception to keep our presently thinking magnificent shop afloat if called upon. Hopefully McCain will bring home the bacon in his choice for running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the response to the sound off comment regarding the Obama Vs McCain visit. Obama visit was low key as I was veteran's day and he wanted to honor them and not take away from their day. Both candidates visits were by invitation early only. As far as imperial presidency McCain owns 7 homes and initially he couldn't keep count. Versus Obama one I don't believe McCain has any idea what the average person is going through economically. Al he cares about is dumping more of our hard earned money into the war effort.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Steve Terrell</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Mexican</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're huge pep rallies, choreographed to fire up the troops to get behind the party's ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're giant infomercials, programmed to sway television viewers with messages about the life, philosophy and character of the party's candidate for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're extravaganzas of schmoozing, networking and entertaining for politicians and party leaders, underwritten by the same corporations and interest groups that spend billions lobbying Congress and funding campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what the major political parties' national conventions -- which used to be held to decide on nominees -- have become in the early 21st century. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first one of the 2008 presidential year begins Monday in Denver, where thousands of Democrats, even more journalists, and a wide array of lobbyists and others involved in the political process will come to see U.S. Sen. Barack Obama accept the party's nomination for president of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next month, the Republicans have their turn in Minneapolis, where U.S. Sen. John McCain will accept the GOP nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conventions, which cost millions, are a logistical nightmare for planners and a pain for those locals who aren't directly making money from the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the nominations of Obama and McCain are purely ceremonial confirmations of who won the most primaries and caucus votes, why have the conventions?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The purpose is to excite and activate the activist core of both parties and to tell a story about the nominee to the public,&quot; Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, explained in a telephone interview last week. &quot;It's all about civic education and civic activation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign finance watchdogs, however, warn that conventions represent something else. &quot;It's as if the laws are suspended so corporations can foot the bill for these huge infomercials for the two parties,&quot; said Massie Ritsch, spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Center of Responsive Politics,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sabato, who's attended all major party conventions since 1976, said despite the popular view that conventions have evolved into staid and predictable pep rallies, the events still are important for the major political parties. &quot;They still have conventions because they're still relevant,&quot; he said. &quot;But the nature of conventions have changed. Conventions used to be competitive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, not long ago, conventions used to be where presidential nominations were decided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As recently as the 1950s, Sabato said, conventions were known for backroom arm-twisting, and wheeling-and-dealing delegates had a much larger role in choosing the nominee. Before the '50s, conventions frequently would go beyond the first ballot to select the nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by the early 1970s, both major parties had moved to give voters more of a say in who got nominated. More and more states moved to hold primaries and caucuses that legally bind delegates to vote for the candidates based on the amount of voter support they receive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, this year in New Mexico, Hillary Clinton barely edged out Barack Obama in the February Democratic Caucuses. That means Clinton won 14 New Mexico &quot;pledged delegates&quot; while Obama won 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One last vestige of the old backroom king-maker system is the &quot;superdelegate&quot; system. This system became especially controversial early this year when Obama and Clinton were fighting it out, raising the possibility the nominee could eventually be determined by these delegates, who are not chosen by primaries or caucuses. Superdelegates mainly are elected officials -- governors, Congress members, other high-ranking officials -- as well as state party leaders and activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New Mexico, six superdelegates support Clinton, while five superdelegates and one &quot;add-on&quot; selected by the Democrats' state Central Committee support Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama superdelegates are Gov. Bill Richardson, U.S. Sen. Jeff Bingaman, U.S. Rep. Tom Udall, state party chairman Brian Col&oacute;n, former state party chairman Fred Harris and &quot;add on&quot; Laurie Weahkee, who is the lead organizer for the Native American Voters Alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's New Mexico superdelegates are Lt. Gov. Diane Denish, Albuquerque Mayor Martin Ch&aacute; vez, labor leader Christine Trujillo, state party vice chairwoman Annadelle Sanchez, DNC committeeman Raymond G. Sanchez and DNC committeewoman Mary Gail Gwaltney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food, drink</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and politics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Mexico delegation has a full schedule in Denver. Each day the group starts out with a breakfast at the Crowne Plaza hotel, the headquarters of the delegation. Assuming the breakfasts are similar to the ones held in Boston in 2004, delegates will hear news about other convention-related events from party leaders -- over eggs and coffee. And usually there is a breakfast speaker. For instance, on Thursday, Texas oil billionaire T. Boone Pickens -- a Republican, for the record -- will talk about his plan for alternative energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There also are lunches planned each day of the election for the delegates at restaurants including Maggiano's Little Italy, Nine75, Union Station Rail Car and The Samba Room at Larimer Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates might have to settle for Pepsi Center hot dogs for dinner because the convention floor sessions are going on during that hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most nights after the convention, there are receptions to which delegates are invited. There's a late-night event at Churchill's in The Brown Palace Hotel, hosted by party chairman Col&oacute;n; an event honoring Richardson at the Crowne Plaza's swimming pool; parties at the Coors Field/RocHenge Skybox Suite and at Lodo's Bar and Grill, which advertises &quot;the biggest and best patio in downtown Denver.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who's paying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for this party?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political conventions are one of the last bastions of unlimited &quot;soft money&quot; in the national political process. Corporate interests are happy to pick up the tab for all kinds of lavish parties, receptions, meals, meet-and-greets and various other events for the delegates, many of whom are Congress members, legislators, governors and other elected officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there's an added bonus: Corporate money spent on a political convention doesn't have to be reported until 60 days after the convention ends -- or just days before the election -- &quot;when most people's minds are on other things,&quot; said Ritsch, whose Center for Responsive Politics operates the OpenSecrets.org Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Conventions are an opportunity for corporations to do what they're not normally permitted to do -- subsidize campaigns with unlimited amounts of money right out of their treasuries,&quot; Ritsch said. &quot;The goal is to get access to policy makers in a social atmosphere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ritsch said conventions give delegates a little taste of the lobbyist-paid wining and dining that goes on in Washington, D.C., when Congress is in session. &quot;It's just more concentrated at the conventions,&quot; he said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rationale for the conventions loophole in federal campaign finance laws is that the money spent isn't really for political reasons but to promote the host cities of the conventions. However, a study by OpenSecrets.org and The Campaign Finance Institute, also headquartered in Washington, D.C., shows that the companies footing the convention bill in Denver might have other things on their minds besides promoting the Mile High City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the study, the 141 corporate sponsors of the Democratic Convention have spent nearly $160 million on campaign contributions to presidential and congressional candidates and more than a billion dollars in lobbying expenses since 2005. In addition, there are at least 48 contributors to both the Democratic and Republican conventions that have paid out more than $180 million in campaign contributions and $1.3 billion in lobbyist expenses since 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Mexico delegation has its own sponsors for the various meals and parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them are railroads including Union Pacific and BNSF; communications giants like Qwest and Verizon; energy interests like The Williams Cos., a natural-gas corporation, and the New Mexico Oil &amp; Gas Association; financial industry interests like RBC Dain Rauscher, American Benefits Consulting and Fidelity Investments; developers like Albuquerque's Mesa del Sol; at least one electronics giant, Intel; a well-connected consultant, Zamora Strategic Advisors, headed by Geno Zamora, former counsel for Richardson's office and now a senior adviser in the New Mexico Obama campaign; and labor unions including the film and television technicians and firefighters unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to those sponsoring specific events, the state party lists other sponsors for the New Mexico delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are &quot;presidential&quot; sponsors who donated a lump sum of money to the state party for the delegation. These include the International Association of Firefighters; Merck, a pharmaceutical company; and Nestor and Angela Romero. A spokeswoman for the state party said the amounts these sponsors donated will be disclosed on the party's next Federal Elections Commission report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of these, Nestor Romero, was the subject of past controversy. A 2005 Legislative Finance Committee report revealed his company had received fees totaling more than $10 million in the previous two years for performing examinations of insurance companies for the state Public Regulation Commission's Insurance Division under then-Superintendent Eric Serna. Under the state's system, the examiner is paid by the insurance companies instead of state funds. Romero's company has performed 90 percent of the insurance examinations since 2003 through no-bid contracts. No legal action was taken against Romero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also &quot;gift&quot; sponsors listed who donated unspecified gifts to the delegation. These are Route 66 Resort &amp; Casino (which donated T-shirts, key chains, American flag pins and water bottles), MVD Express, New Mexico Association of Counties, Sacred Wind, a communications company involving lobbyist and longtime Richardson ally Butch Maki (which gave delegates model wind turbines) and Maki's company, Butch Maki &amp; Associates.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain opened his town hall meeting Wednesday at the Pan American Center Annex with a discussion of developments in Georgia, where Russian forces were at that time digging trenches and building fortifications. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went on in his speech to discuss energy development and the war in Iraq. During the Q&amp;A session that followed he shared his views on abortion, health care, taxes, Social Security, border security, immigration and the integrity of the election system in states using computer touch-screen voting machines. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of which made the nightly cable news shows. The big news of the day came after the town hall when McCain held a media availability with the national press and fumbled a question about how many houses he owns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The potential resurrection of the Soviet menace is apparently pass&eacute; when compared to the opportunity to play to voters' most base instincts   petty jealousy and class envy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith Olbermann dubbed his first segment on Thursday's MSNBC Countdown shown, &quot;Meltdown in Las Cruces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Really? I've seen some meltdowns. Once, on deadline of the night we were changing computer systems at a newspaper I worked for in Kansas, I found the tech guy, who had moments earlier gone on a box-kicking, stack-tumbling rampage through the area where the Sunday inserts were stored, sitting on a cement floor, staring into space and quaking uncontrollably in anger and frustration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that was a meltdown. McCain stumbled over a question he wasn't expecting, and later had his staff clarify his answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obermann accused McCain's campaign of using his POW history as &quot;immunity&quot; when responding to the controversy. Immunity from what? Being rich? Marrying an heiress?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To his discredit, Barack Obama's campaign had a TV ad out the next day seeking to score political points on the issue. So much for all that high-minded talk of running a new kind of issues-oriented campaign. And yes, I am aware that McCain's camp would have done the same thing had the tables been turned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I suppose everybody has their own definition of what qualifies as rich. By my definition, every major party candidate nominated to run for president in my lifetime has been obscenely wealthy. The fact that some may be more obscene than others matters little.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between now and November, both McCain and Obama will go to great lengths to demonstrate their empathy with Americans struggling in our faltering economy and to burnish their &quot;common man&quot; credentials. How pointless. I don't want a president who will feel my (and others') pain. I want a president who will do something to help to alleviate my pain   or at least not contribute to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Obama are both honorable, intelligent men, who have very different ideas as to the best way forward on the economy and a number of other critical issues. Wouldn't our democracy be stronger if we focused on those issues and not the &quot;gottcha&quot; moment of the day?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPRINGFIELD, Ill.   Barack Obama introduced Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware on Saturday as &quot;a leader ready to step in and be president,&quot; and the newly named running mate quickly converted his debut on the Democratic ticket into a slashing attack on Republican John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP presidential contender will have to &quot;figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at&quot; when considering his own economic future, said Biden, jabbing at the man he nevertheless called his personal friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a reference to McCain's recent inartful admission   in a time of economic uncertainty   that he was not sure how many homes he owns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before a vast crowd spilling out from the front of the Old State Capitol, Obama said Biden was &quot;what many others pretend to be   a statesman with sound judgment who doesn't have to hide behind bluster to keep America strong.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats coalesced quickly around the 47-year-old Obama's selection of a seasoned veteran of three decades in the Senate   a choice meant to provide foreign policy heft to the party's ticket for the fall campaign against McCain and the Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show Obama rates relatively poorly against McCain on foreign policy issues, and Biden is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with extensive experience in that area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain called Biden a &quot;wise selection.&quot; But McCain indicated that he believed there was still plenty to criticize the Obama-Biden ticket on foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that Joe will campaign well for Senator Obama, and so I think he's going to be very formidable,&quot; McCain told CBS News. &quot;I've always respected Joe Biden, but I disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first Gulf War to his position where he said you had to break Iraq up into three different countries. We really have different approaches to many national security issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden, a 65-year-old congressional veteran, emerged as Obama's choice after a secretive selection process that reviewed at least a half-dozen contenders   but evidently not Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former first lady who was Obama's tenacious rival across the primaries and caucuses of winter and spring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama made a symbolic choice for the site of the ticket's first joint appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a brutally cold winter day more than a year ago when he stood outside the historic structure in the Illinois capital to launch his quest for the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He returned this day in sunshine, the party's improbable nominee-in-waiting, a black man in his first Senate term who outdistanced a crowded field of far better-known and more experienced rivals for the nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic National Convention opens on in Denver Monday to nominate him as president and Biden as vice president, the ticket that Democrats hope to ride into the White House after eight years of Republican rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls indicate a highly competitive race at the end of a summer in which McCain eroded what had been Obama's slender advantage in the national surveys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A security fence sprung up overnight around the Pepsi Center as the pace of preparations accelerated in advance of Monday night's opening session, and police on bicycles patrolled nearby streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the sports arena, even the Zamboni machine   the lumbering, wheeled vehicle used to resurface the ice between periods of hockey games   had been moved out to make room for the Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's convention opens on Labor Day in St. Paul, Minn. He has yet to select a running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to Obama's pick, the McCain campaign quickly produced a television ad featuring Biden's previous praise for McCain and comments critical of his new benefactor. In an ABC interview last year, Biden said he stood by an earlier statement that Obama wasn't yet ready to be president and &quot;the presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the Republican Party arranged for an independent expenditure advertising campaign to coincide with the Democratic convention. One individual familiar with the plans described a $2.25 million effort on cable and broadcast stations through Aug. 31 in the battleground states of Colorado, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama brought Biden on stage with his glowing introduction to the strains of Bruce Springsteen's &quot;The Rising.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly named running mate moved center stage in shirt-sleeves at a brisk trot that belied his 65 years, and embraced Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm glad to be here,&quot; said the man who has twice sought the presidency. Thousands of newly printed signs bearing the words Obama/Biden sprouted in the crowd that waited in anticipation in 90-degree temperatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men spoke for 16 minutes   unlikely a coincidence given Biden's reputation for verbosity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's remarks were carefully crafted to emphasize Biden's accomplishments in the Senate, his blue-collar roots and   above all   his experience on foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can tell you Joe Biden gets it,&quot; he said. &quot;He's that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in Cedar Rapids and the corridors of the Capitol, in the VFW hall in Concord, and at the center of an international crisis,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast to the Obamas and the McCains, the Delaware senator isn't a multimillionaire. Biden and his wife, Jill, have $59,000 to $366,000 in assets and $140,000 to $365,000 in debts, including a $15,000 to $50,000 line of credit Biden co-signed with his son to cover college expenses, according to a financial disclosure report for 2007, which describes assets and liabilities in ranges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama recounted the personal tragedy that struck Biden more than 30 years ago, within days of his election to the Senate, when his first wife and their child were killed in an automobile accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Biden raised his surviving children as a single parent, commuting between the Capitol and Delaware daily on the Amtrak train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For decades, he has brought change to Washington, but Washington hasn't changed him,&quot; Obama said, attempting to blunt an emerging Republican line of attack that notes Biden's three decades in the polished corridors of the Capitol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a jab at McCain that foretold Biden's far sharper criticism, Obama said his political partner &quot;will give us some real straight talk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden blended praise for Obama and criticism of McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't change America and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to Bush's scheme of privatizing Social Security,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't change America and end this war in Iraq when you declare   and again these are John's words   &quot;No one has supported President Bush in Iraq more than I have,' end of quote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Axelrod, Obama's senior strategist, described Obama's vice presidential search as &quot;a long process but it always pointed in Biden's direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who is close to Obama, added, &quot;Many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece   Kaine, Bayh and Biden.&quot; He referred to Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine and Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP presidential contender will have to &quot;figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at&quot; when considering his own economic future, said Biden, jabbing at the man he nevertheless called his personal friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a reference to McCain's recent inartful admission   in a time of economic uncertainty   that he was not sure how many homes he owns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before a vast crowd spilling out from the front of the Old State Capitol, Obama said Biden was &quot;what many others pretend to be   a statesman with sound judgment who doesn't have to hide behind bluster to keep America strong.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats coalesced quickly around the 47-year-old Obama's selection of a seasoned veteran of three decades in the Senate   a choice meant to provide foreign policy heft to the party's ticket for the fall campaign against McCain and the Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show Obama rates relatively poorly against McCain on foreign policy issues, and Biden is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with extensive experience in that area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain called Biden a &quot;wise selection.&quot; But McCain indicated that he believed there was still plenty to criticize the Obama-Biden ticket on foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that Joe will campaign well for Senator Obama, and so I think he's going to be very formidable,&quot; McCain told CBS News. &quot;I've always respected Joe Biden, but I disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first Gulf War to his position where he said you had to break Iraq up into three different countries. We really have different approaches to many national security issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden, a 65-year-old congressional veteran, emerged as Obama's choice after a secretive selection process that reviewed at least a half-dozen contenders   but evidently not Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former first lady who was Obama's tenacious rival across the primaries and caucuses of winter and spring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama made a symbolic choice for the site of the ticket's first joint appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a brutally cold winter day more than a year ago when he stood outside the historic structure in the Illinois capital to launch his quest for the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He returned this day in sunshine, the party's improbable nominee-in-waiting, a black man in his first Senate term who outdistanced a crowded field of far better-known and more experienced rivals for the nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic National Convention opens on in Denver Monday to nominate him as president and Biden as vice president, the ticket that Democrats hope to ride into the White House after eight years of Republican rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls indicate a highly competitive race at the end of a summer in which McCain eroded what had been Obama's slender advantage in the national surveys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A security fence sprung up overnight around the Pepsi Center as the pace of preparations accelerated in advance of Monday night's opening session, and police on bicycles patrolled nearby streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the sports arena, even the Zamboni machine   the lumbering, wheeled vehicle used to resurface the ice between periods of hockey games   had been moved out to make room for the Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's convention opens on Labor Day in St. Paul, Minn. He has yet to select a running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to Obama's pick, the McCain campaign quickly produced a television ad featuring Biden's previous praise for McCain and comments critical of his new benefactor. In an ABC interview last year, Biden said he stood by an earlier statement that Obama wasn't yet ready to be president and &quot;the presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the Republican Party arranged for an independent expenditure advertising campaign to coincide with the Democratic convention. One individual familiar with the plans described a $2.25 million effort on cable and broadcast stations through Aug. 31 in the battleground states of Colorado, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama brought Biden on stage with his glowing introduction to the strains of Bruce Springsteen's &quot;The Rising.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly named running mate moved center stage in shirt-sleeves at a brisk trot that belied his 65 years, and embraced Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm glad to be here,&quot; said the man who has twice sought the presidency. Thousands of newly printed signs bearing the words Obama/Biden sprouted in the crowd that waited in anticipation in 90-degree temperatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men spoke for 16 minutes   unlikely a coincidence given Biden's reputation for verbosity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's remarks were carefully crafted to emphasize Biden's accomplishments in the Senate, his blue-collar roots and   above all   his experience on foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can tell you Joe Biden gets it,&quot; he said. &quot;He's that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in Cedar Rapids and the corridors of the Capitol, in the VFW hall in Concord, and at the center of an international crisis,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast to the Obamas and the McCains, the Delaware senator isn't a multimillionaire. Biden and his wife, Jill, have $59,000 to $366,000 in assets and $140,000 to $365,000 in debts, including a $15,000 to $50,000 line of credit Biden co-signed with his son to cover college expenses, according to a financial disclosure report for 2007, which describes assets and liabilities in ranges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama recounted the personal tragedy that struck Biden more than 30 years ago, within days of his election to the Senate, when his first wife and their child were killed in an automobile accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Biden raised his surviving children as a single parent, commuting between the Capitol and Delaware daily on the Amtrak train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For decades, he has brought change to Washington, but Washington hasn't changed him,&quot; Obama said, attempting to blunt an emerging Republican line of attack that notes Biden's three decades in the polished corridors of the Capitol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a jab at McCain that foretold Biden's far sharper criticism, Obama said his political partner &quot;will give us some real straight talk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden blended praise for Obama and criticism of McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't change America and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to Bush's scheme of privatizing Social Security,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't change America and end this war in Iraq when you declare   and again these are John's words   &quot;No one has supported President Bush in Iraq more than I have,' end of quote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Axelrod, Obama's senior strategist, described Obama's vice presidential search as &quot;a long process but it always pointed in Biden's direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who is close to Obama, added, &quot;Many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece   Kaine, Bayh and Biden.&quot; He referred to Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine and Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain opened his town hall meeting Wednesday at the Pan American Center Annex with a discussion of developments in Georgia, where Russian forces were at that time digging trenches and building fortifications. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went on in his speech to discuss energy development and the war in Iraq. During the question-and-answer session that followed, he shared his views on abortion, health care, taxes, Social Security, border security, immigration and the integrity of the election system in states using computer touch-screen voting machines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of which made the nightly cable news shows. The big news of the day came after the town hall when McCain talked with the national press and fumbled a question about how many houses he owns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The potential resurrection of the Soviet menace is apparently pass&eacute; when compared to the opportunity to play to voters' most base instincts   petty jealousy and class envy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith Olbermann dubbed his first segment on Thursday's MSNBC Countdown shown, &quot;Meltdown in Las Cruces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Really? I've seen some meltdowns. Once, on deadline of the night we were changing computer systems at a newspaper I worked for in Kansas, I found the tech guy, who had moments earlier gone on a box-kicking, stack-tumbling rampage through the area where the Sunday inserts were stored, sitting on a cement floor, staring into space and quaking uncontrollably in anger and frustration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that was a meltdown. McCain stumbled over a question he wasn't expecting, and later had his staff clarify his answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obermann accused McCain's campaign of using his POW history as &quot;immunity&quot; when responding to the controversy. Immunity from what? Being rich? Marrying an heiress?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To his discredit, Barack Obama's campaign had a TV ad out the next day seeking to score political points on the issue. So much for all that high-minded talk of running a new kind of issues-oriented campaign. And yes, I am aware that McCain's camp would have done the same thing had the tables been turned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I suppose everybody has their own definition of what qualifies as rich. By my definition, every major party candidate nominated to run for president in my lifetime has been obscenely wealthy. The fact that some may be more obscene than others matters little.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between now and November, both McCain and Obama will go to great lengths to demonstrate their empathy with Americans struggling in our faltering economy and to burnish their &quot;common man&quot; credentials. How pointless. I don't want a president who will feel my (and others') pain. I want a president who will do something to help to alleviate my pain   or at least not contribute to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Obama are both honorable, intelligent men, who have very different ideas as to the best way forward on the economy and a number of other critical issues. Wouldn't our democracy be stronger if we focused on those issues and not the &quot;gotcha&quot; moment of the day?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to thank the lady in front of me at the Starbucks on Valley (on 8/19 @ 10a m). I don't know her, she paid for my drinks and I felt that it was a very nice and appreciated gesture. It definitely made me have a better day than I was already having. And that goes to show that there are still really nice people in the world. Thank you!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a citizens of Las Cruces I am curious as to why the lcpd do not ticket anyone who runs a red light? I have seen several people run red lights and lcpd being stopped at the same stop light and not doing anything about it. But God forbid you don't have a seat belt on or don't stop for three seconds at a stop sign because the lcpd will be issuing a citation. Don't you think running red lights are a little more dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you, Ron Prentice, for your truthful description in the Monday Sun-News of what the Democratic party stands for. How any honest, hard-working American could vote for an agenda like that, just blows my mind! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is President of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, Bob Gallagher who is also chairman of the NMSU Board of Regents urging his oil and gas buddies to defeat Representative Nate Cote, District 53? Mr. Cote is the best legislator in New Mexico while his opponent is an inexperienced car insurance agent, who strictly follows the party line.Everyday we are flooded with emails about Obama full of lie's. Never are there any of McCain. Do you think that the Republican Party could be behind these emails?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They want to give New Mexicans 50 dollars to help them in these tough times. Meanwhile, Mr. Moore just got a 5% raise on his $130,000 annual salary. That's $6500 annually. What is really going on? I guess tough times only for some.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They come up with a bunch of lies and innuendoes and just get people to see things their way with all those lies.&quot; That description is only accurate for the dumbocrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know John Edward's lost his speaking time at the upcoming Democratic National Convention because he had an affair and lied about it. They gave to slot to Bill Clinton. Is there anybody else who sees a problem?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawrence Joy said that he is an independent that supports &quot;monkey-waving&quot; Lee Rawson. However, Mr. Joy is a registered Republican and has run for office as a Republican. There is an old adage: &quot;If he walks like a duck, and he talks like a duck, he is most probably a duck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have been hearing radio ads by Tom Udall (Democrat), that he supports domestic oil drilling. So by that statement, he must agree we should drill in the Otero Mesa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is it that the City Council did not invite any experts in oil exploration and drilling to the meeting about drilling in the Otero Mesa. Instead, they only had the environmentalist Bixby speak to the council. Did they even ask Bixby to point out one instance of domestic oil drilling contaminating a fresh water aquifer in the United States? I have not heard of any, and I lived over thirty years in oil drilling states with large underground aquifers that make the Otero Mesa aquifer look like a cow pond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The environmental wacko's have no idea of the technological capabilities the oil companies have to prevent contamination of underground aquifers. It is the same old crap they spew out, which is preventing our country becoming energy independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The front page article in the USA Today(08-20-08) about government contracts booming and helping the economy, in my mind, is the epitome of hypocrisy. The government and the Federal Reserve, a privately held entity, is the main reasonwhythis once great country is breaking economic records on the downside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 45 percent of home buyers who purchased a homein 2006, (upside down) owing more money on their homes than there worth, I think it's time Realtor's continuing education includes some trainingin economics, market history and common sense!!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My child also rides the &quot;old&quot; bus at Zia. I feel the days of prejudice and discrimination need to be over. Everyone should be treated the same. I'm sorry the student's mother walked a mile to school; my child would have to walk 8 1/2 miles. Times are changing. I'm sure the lady used to be young, pretty, and thin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gadsen schools are a great place to teach. First teachers are reprimanded for flunking too many students. Secondly, all students are promoted regardless if they have too many F's or to many A's. What a wonderful school</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is there still talk about victory in Iraq and losing in Iraq? They war in Iraq when Hussien was taken out of power. That was the end of the war. Since then its just been an occupation there nothing to win there's nothing to lose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mcain and Mr. Obama do nothing but bash each other. There is no solid information about their plans. Ron Paul is looking better and better everyday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats are at it again about Steve Pearce that are nothing but lies. The lies are all they can come up with today. Thank you bye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am against the red light cameras. Because it would get rid of an old tradition. When the red light turns two cars go through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now some college and university has had the drinking age lowered to 18. They figure if its lowered to 18 it'll cut on the binge drinking usually associated with some one with a 21st birthday. Don't they realize that there only going to make the binge drinking worse with the age 18 instead of 21? Drinking is worse than most drugs. It should be a controlled substance. We don't need alcohol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of you believe we need to do more drilling because we need to get more oil are just being cruel and heart less and thoughtless of future generations. All your doing is pushing off our problem on our children and grand-children's generation. We need to find alternatives we need to stop our dependency on oil not find more of it. Because it doesn't matter its going to run out. If it doesn't run out now it'll run out later. So why not take care of it now instead of making it our children's and grand-children's problems? Were suppose o make their lives better not worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still waiting for someone to answer my sound off in which I asked &quot;why is it a problem for John Kerry to be married to heiress?&quot; And why is not a problem for John Mcain to be married to an heiress? Can someone please explain the reason to the double standard? I can only assume that if you never that question in my previous soundoff you have no answer for that. Its just plain ordinary Republican snobbiness and double standards!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You think the same illogical thinking if the Israelites must give Israel to the Palestinians then Americans must give USA back to native-Americans thank-you!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please notice the difference between Obama visit and Mcain visit to Las Cruces. When Obama came it was all done with private meeting behind closed doors with no media. When Mcain comes its a town hall where everyone is invited. I think we can see the difference between the Mcain presidency and the imperial presidency of Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someone complained about beach volleyball being an Olympic event. So why is it easy to justify beach volleyball than it is to justify ballroom dancing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just to let Las Cruces know there are some fabulous home grown tomatoes down at the farmers and crafts market now on Wednesdays and Saturday mornings so come and get them!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm just calling in to hope that everyone is going to go see &quot;Mamma MIA&quot; it was one of the most fun filled, feel good movies I've seen in years. Don't miss it!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Domenci's legacy is that he stayed too long. When he first sought office he was four terms limits and changed that after he one the second time. So the thing is these people get into office and they never want to come home. That's his legacy he stayed too long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wait a minute am I reading this soundoff correctly your daughter goes to Zia middle school and drives the bus? Holy Smokes!!!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems like early everyday we have sirens running down Elks Drive. But hardly an explanation in the paper or in the news. Is every run a true emergency? Thank you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what I think the editor of the El Paso Times has stepped down. It is time for the editor of the Sun-News to step down also.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you want to catch a lot of fish like especially Croat you need a good bait like minnow bait. They jump up in the water to catch it. There's fish farms in Truth or Consequences and Hatch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can't believe I just heard a commercial from one of our local credit unions telling you that you should get a loan to pay for your middle school students school supplies. Is that what this world is coming to when now your expected to take out a loan to buy your kids pencils? For goodness sakes!!!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for the opportunity to speak up again a politicians want status quo. That's why the media keeps a status quo. Mary Jane Garcia uses 50 dollars for your community guess what needs to be done in your community jobs, high paying jobs. So they can give you 50 dollars. Don't listen to what the politicians say see what they do. DUH!!!!!!</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right when our country needs to be focusing on hard choices for the future -- whether planning for energy independence, fixing the health-care mess and repairing our foreign-policy misadventures -- we are talking about affairs and celebrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential campaign, instead of turning on big issues, is narrowing to the point of silliness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Edwards' affair with a would-be filmmaker is merely a distraction, in that he no longer is a candidate for president of the United States. What Edwards did in 2006 -- unless he misappropriated campaign funds and broke election law to keep his mistress quiet -- makes him a flawed human being and a worse candidate. But really, it's old news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain philandered his way through his first marriage, leaving a wife injured in an accident for a much younger and richer woman. Does anyone care? Not much, judging from media attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Edwards affair, on the other hand, is eating up oxygen that should be better spent on how these presidential candidates plan to solve the many problems of our modern world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much more precious oxygen -- thanks to the 24-hour, unending cycle of talking heads -- is being wasted on the notion of celebrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain started it off with his silly ad comparing Barack Obama to Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. As if a man smart enough to thrive at Columbia, Harvard and as a lecturer at the University of Chicago, is nothing more than an empty suit. As if, despite his youth, Obama has no achievements to speak of, including community organizing, serving as a state legislator and his work in the U.S. Senate. As if speaking with eloquence and grace is a minus, rather than a huge plus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans are determined to turn Obama into a 2008 version of John Kerry, elitist, arugula-eating, separate and apart from the rest of us. This, despite the facts of Obama's life -- raised by a single mother, attended school through scholarship and hard work -- is the very definition of a self-made man. He and his wife, Michelle, own only one house, unlike the McCains. Michelle doesn't even own a jet for her husband to borrow on the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To answer back, the Obama team pointed out McCain's own attraction to celebrity culture -- endless appearances on late-night shows, the cameos in TV shows and movies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tit. Tat. Tit. Tat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course Democrats have to respond, but it seems to me attacks and comebacks should be framed in a way to tackle issues with substance. It's not that as a voter, as a citizen, I mind attacks. I just want them to matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what I wish would happen:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats, ever so cautious, must stop letting the other side define them. They should take a page from Karl Rove's playbook -- not by going nasty, but by attacking to strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's strength is his perceived foreign-policy experience, his ability to be a wartime commander. It's his issue, and Democrats need to tackle it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From McCain's Navy record (with his history of crashing planes) to his well-documented temper to his first-impulse to use force as an answer to crisis, Democrats have a strong case to make that McCain is simply not temperamentally suited to have his finger on the trigger. His fellow Republican senator, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, said it bluntly. &quot;The thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine. He is erratic. He is hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans, ever so quick to trivialize, have every right -- indeed, responsibility -- to take on Obama on his youth, relative inexperience, etc. But please, do so with substance, with issues that matter, and don't spend so much time turning this campaign into a trivial pursuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are a nation in recession, fighting two wars abroad and an energy crisis at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have no time to waste.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JUNCTION CITY, Calif. --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A helicopter carrying a firefighting crew crashed in the remote reaches of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, and nine of those on board are missing and feared dead, authorities said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four others on board were critically injured, according to Ian Gregor, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. Authorities have not yet identified all the passengers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sikorksy helicopter crashed about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday while taking off from a remote site about 35 miles northwest of Redding, in northern California, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the surviving victims, Richard Schroeder, 42, said in a phone interview from his hospital room in Redding that it seemed the propeller of the helicopter hit a tree as it was taking off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crew was among 1,200 firefighters, assisted by nine helicopters, who were battling the Iron and Alps complex fires in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest that have burned 86,000 acres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Congress must act on energy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JACKSON, Ohio -- Republican candidate John McCain on Wednesday called on Congress to return from its summer recess to address immediately the U.S. energy crisis, though he missed numerous energy-related votes in the Senate last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of forcing Congress to deal with energy issues could open the Arizona senator to charges of hypocrisy. The liberal-leaning League of Conservation Voters gave McCain a &quot;zero&quot; rating for 2007, saying he had missed all 11 votes related to such critical energy topics as automobile fuel economy, offshore Virginia drilling, refinery construction, renewable electricity mandates, energy efficiency, liquefied coal and support for biofuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama ridicules McCain over tires</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ELKHART, Ind. -- Barack Obama taunted Republican presidential rival John McCain on Wednesday for first ridiculing him for advising voters to keep tires inflated and then later acknowledging the practice saves gasoline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be interesting to watch this debate between John McCain and John McCain,&quot; Obama said as he campaigned in Indiana with Sen. Evan Bayh, a Democrat widely considered a top-tier candidate for running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greyhound stops 'bus rage' ads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TORONTO -- Greyhound has scrapped an ad campaign that extolled the relaxing upside of bus travel after one of its passengers was accused of beheading and cannibalizing another traveler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad's tag line was &quot;There's a reason you've never heard of 'bus rage.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greyhound spokeswoman Abby Wambaugh said Wednesday that a billboard and some tunnel posters near a bus terminal in Toronto are still up and would be removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vince Weiguang Li, who immigrated to Canada from China in 2004, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of 22-year-old carnival worker Tim McLean. He has yet to enter a plea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iraq has billions in oil surplus money</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAGHDAD -- Iraq is paying for more of its own reconstruction but is still struggling to spend its multibillion-dollar surplus as it copes with a flood of oil revenue and a cumbersome approval process meant to curb corruption, U.S. officials said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iraq could finish the year with as much as a $79 billion cumulative budget surplus as oil revenues add to leftover income the Iraqis still haven't spent on national rebuilding, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office made public Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Iraqis -- who lack adequate electricity, clean water and jobs -- find it unfathomable that their country is awash in oil dollars. Last year, it spent less than a third of the $12 billion budgeted for major projects such as electricity, housing and water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, senators renewed calls for Baghdad to pay more for its own reconstruction, which has been heavily supported by hard-pressed American taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But U.S. officials who work with the Iraqis on reconstruction said the Baghdad government has been increasing its capital spending by 30 percent to 35 percent each year since 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. military deaths in Iraq</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of Wednesday, at least 4,134 members of the U.S. military have died in the Iraq war since it began in March 2003, according to an Associated Press count. The AP count is one more than the Defense Department's tally, last updated Wednesday at 8 a.m. MDT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest identifications reported by the military:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Army Spc. Ronald A. Schmidt, 18, Newton, Kan.; died Sunday in Balad of injuries from a vehicle accident Saturday in Ashraf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Army Pvt. Timothy J. Hutton, 21, Dillon, Mont.; died Monday in Baghdad of injuries from a noncombat incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Army soldiers died Monday when their patrol was struck by an explosive in Baghdad. Killed were Sgt. Gary M. Henry, 34, Indianapolis, and Spc. Jonathan D. Menke, 22, Madison, Ind.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Senator Barack Obama &quot;the biggest celebrity in the world?&quot; And is that a bad thing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign is betting that it is, but what do the voters think?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Davis, campaign manager for Senator John McCain, held a teleconference with reporters July 30 to defend a new ad charging that Democrat Barack Obama is all flash and no substance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weeks ago, McCain charged that Obama, couldn't understand the Iraq war because he hadn't traveled to the war zone &quot;in years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Obama, who had visited Iraq in 2006, returned to Iraq as Senator McCain insisted, but McCain didn't like the attention it brought Obama. The Republican candidate's advisors decided to use the trip against Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's something you expect from someone releasing a movie,&quot; Davis said in reference to the news coverage of Obama's trip to Iraq and his meetings with Israeli and European leaders that ended with a speech by Obama in front of 200,000 Germans in Berlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis charged that Obama is using images of &quot;his adoring fan base around the world to get a lot of media attention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He defended the inclusion of images of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton shown in the ad as a way to &quot;reinforce the point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican campaign has put out ads telling voters that McCain's experience as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam war trumps Obama's judgment on Iraq and the media attention they perceive Obama is getting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The voters will have to decide if they want to elect the biggest celebrity in the world or an American hero,&quot; said McCain campaign staffer Steve Schmidt, who joined Davis for the teleconference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vietnam again ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vietnam has not only been used against Democratic candidates. The Bush campaign used the Vietnam war against McCain in 2000 when McCain challenged Bush for the Republican nomination by implying that his time as prisoner of war in Vietnam had made McCain mentally unstable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oddly, Schmidt worked for the Bush campaign in that election and now works for the McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For me, as a Baby Boomer who watched two brothers drafted on their 19th birthdays, the trend of defining a presidential candidate in the context of Vietnam is inexplicable. It was a war that was called the &quot;Vietnam Conflict&quot; until the Tet Offensive in 1968 turned it into a war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the third consecutive presidential election cycle, an undercurrent driven by the unresolved issues of the war that sent Americans to Asia not long after the French were defeated at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 and continued until Richard Nixon's &quot;Peace with honor&quot; in 1975 floats in the background of presidential politics like a ghost that morphs from good to evil and back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Clinton was disparaged because he did not serve during the war. He received a deferment and became a Rhodes Scholar instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Kerry actually served in combat in Vietnam, but his patriotism was challenged in the 2004 presidential campaign by a series of ads accusing him of exaggerating his military service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;swift boat&quot; ads played more often on news programs than they did as paid advertising during the last presidential campaign. The Vietnam veterans who appeared in the ads were interviewed endlessly by the national news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the fact that President George W. Bush never left the states during his national guard service and may not have shown up for duty, Kerry's combat service was belittled as &quot;not that bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, Clinton won his election. Kerry lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time around, the Democratic candidate is too young to have served during Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For voters under 30, that war may seem like ancient history. Iraq is the war they will remember for the rest of their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question for voters in 2008 is will they accept the use of the Vietnam war to manipulate the way they evaluate the candidates or will voters focus on issues facing Americans today?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's about time we got cameras at intersections! Running red lights is rampant. These dangerous, inconsiderate idiots should be stopped for the sake of all of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Camera crews descended on the ailing Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's Hyannis compound this weekend to film an emotional tribute scheduled to air at the Democratic National Convention in August. He should also get the Mark Spitz Lifetime Achievement Award</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was an accident on Highway 70 on Sunday that looked very serious. Why was there nothing mentioned on your online paper? There was something about an accident in El Paso. I thought the Las Cruces Sun-News would rather report El Paso news than Las Cruces news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a citizen of Las Cruces why or has their ever been a fan drive in Las Cruces like there is in El Paso? After watching ABC News I see the stores have donated a lot of boxed fans for people who cannot afford air conditioning. Mainly for seniors and low incomes people. I would like to see something like that happen in Las Cruces. I would donate a fan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I have notices a number of people on motor cycles. Sure, the gas prices are up but safety is also important and these people riding motorcycles and scooters in flip flops and shorts... I don't know if the have ever picked gravel out of themselves but there should be a law to prevent it. If they lay there scooter or motorcycle down in flip-flops and shorts I would feel sorry for them because it hurts. They need shoes or boots, not flip-flops! If you like your feet, and you like to walk on them put regular shoes on!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I was driving by the courthouse this morning, I looked over into the parking lot and I had a flashback of when the parking lot was the football home of the LCHS Bulldawgs. I bet anybody over the age 55 would remember going to a game there. The great team of Rudy and the greatest Bulldawg Rudy Estrada. I thought I would pass this along. I'm sure it will create a lot of memories for many people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nice picture the other day of the kids in 4H. However, it is very frustrating because I have tried to get my son involved in 4H for the last couple of years, and no matter how many times I call no one seems to respond. There does not seem to be a way for him to sign up. It makes me think it is a closed club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'm getting tired of my mailbox getting filled everyday with junk, and I mean junk mail from a supposed New Mexico Youth organization. When as far back as I can remember most youth in our State are unable to vote. So why are they trying to discredit someone who has served New Mexico well over the last years. Leonard Rawson not only deserves our vote, he has shown he has earned it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This new McCain&nbsp;ad is ridiculous, I was not a Obama fan, but McCain is making it easy for me to become and Obama fan. McCain is ludicrous. He acts like a whiney, mean, grumpy, old man who does not know how to use the Internet, is not into the 21st century, and just wants to be a crabby old guy that wants it run his way. I see no reason to vote for McCain, the whole time he has been running he has not said one positive thing. He has finally put me in the Obama camp!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  My grandson is 31 and registered to vote for the first time ever. He said Obama is the first person he has ever wanted to vote for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It takes a lot of nerve for Pete Demenici and Steve Pierce to sit in Washington criticizing Democrats for the energy situation. They have been in office years and what have they done? Pete in particular has been in Congress since 1972 in the U.S. Senate, and Senate energy chairman, and he has never gotten an energy policy passed. He has not done anything in the last 30 years to develop energy renewal sources and to bring down oil prices, or wean us off foreign oil. But he sits here now and blames Democrats and playing politics with the oil situation. It is disgusting and sad to see him ending his career like this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Pruitt, when you write a letter to the editor criticizing the education system you should make sure your letter is written properly. You say in there &quot;Strides is increasing&quot;. Shouldn't that be &quot;Strides are increasing.&quot; I may not be as well educated or as strict as you, but I think I can write a better letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We need a man like Tinsley representing us. He is a cowboy like G. W. He would tie a convicted felon to his horse. Get him a chew of tobacco and drag him until his head pops off. This is our kind of man!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama's latest blinder is that we can make up our shortage of oil and bring down gas prices by inflating our tires. We need to deflate his nonsense!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On behalf of the Lopez children, I wanted to know if you can print anything on the story about their father, Juan J. Lopez, who was killed on the rain track so we can put them at ease about what happen to him. They are still concerned as to what happen. There has been no answers as to what happened that day. I just want to know that their sorrows are felt throughout New Mexico. Their father was a resident in Las Cruces for 44 years and he did give to the community. I would just like to request an article concerning what happen to help put them at ease. Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Today was our mail carrier Julie's last day on our route Palmer. Thank you Julie for being so dedicated to your job and for being so nice. We will miss you and so will our dog of 10 years, Zipper!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I live on the East Mesa of Weisner and Arroyo, these streets are a mess. Weisner has been closed two weeks without any repairs. They would rather close the roads than fix it and people have to detour on their own. Our county commissioner needs to get on the ball and fix these roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama talks about being a family man and protecting is daughters, but he invited Access Hollywood that deals with the stars in rehab to interview his very young daughters. Now we see a video of him hip-hopping with Snoop Dogg, who is in trouble with the law all the time. We have Ludacris who has the most filthy videos out and Obama invited him to his camp, and he has come out with this hateful racist track about Hillary Clinton, McCain and Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  About the steak dinner the teachers had, I think that E.A.s should have been included in that. We deserve a steak dinner! We work just as hard, if not harder. The teacher I work with sits behind a desk while I teach her class. Where is my steak dinner?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Your headlines read that &quot;fewer schools are reaching their goals&quot; as far as education. Fewer schools are meeting their goals as far as getting educated children out and graduated. It is amazing how teachers blame the tests! The tests are to hard. They are about 40 percent of what the test were 30 years ago. There has to be another reason, the teachers blaming the tests is a cop out!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If we want to improve the education in Las Cruces we need to get rid of bilingual education and teach in English in the Head Start programs instead of Spanish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have read the article about how school is, not what it is supposed to be and I wonder why they don't seat the classroom in rows so the teacher who can see instantly who is paying attention and who is not instead of scattering them all over the classroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why do we allow Exxon Mobile to make $1,500 per second? We are not a communist country. We are capitalist, and that money gives jobs and return to investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The codes says lack of man power will cause a delay among people to be helped with yard work. Yet, they gave me only three days to cut my grass and pull the weeds. How fair is that? Shouldn't I be given more time before I am fined?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The leadership of Las Cruces Country Club is either clueless or cynically deceptive. It is one thing to recruit new members with promises that turn out to be dramatically overstated but now they are blaming everyone but them selves for delays and retreating deadliness. It is time to take responsibility!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is for Peggy Bogard that thinks she has the answer to things... First, every place does not have to be available for every person. There are plenty of places to go and things to do if you are a disabled veteran or senior, but when all those people and all those vehicles they have to use are allowed in, it spoils it for the rest of us. I don't think you thought about that. When I was younger, I did not appreciate having every camp ground and every area overtaken by ramps, trails and handrails and all that kind of business. There are places for young, active people to go and things for them to do, they do not have to be made accessible to other people. You can pick and choose where you can go, it is not the responsibility of everybody to take care of you if you are not able. You guys go to be aware of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I just got done reading the school days are not what they used to be. Although I am a teacher, I agree with what he said. But I do want Michael Haze to know I bet the teachers we had back then didn't spend class time taking kids from MAPS testing to PLAN to the New Mexico competency exam. Or miss class time to attend student IEP meetings, or spending before and after school attending parent conferences, and did not have to be doing the job the counselors used to do, which is register the kids. There is so much time taken out of a teacher's teaching time that there is very little time to teach. It is a shame, and it is not the teachers fault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The argument against red light cameras that &quot;someone else might be driving my car&quot; is a red herring. If that is a concern, don't loan your car to someone you don't trust to obey the law. I have had too many close calls with red-light runners to object to cameras. I hope they catch them all!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I am once again surprised by the actions of one of our Christian leaders. Recently, he became upset with the band director and redirected all traffic on the Web site to the Web site of a rival school. The alarming facts of this story are not only that the parent is an adult, he is also the pastor at Sonoma Springs Presbyterian Church. Is this an act worthy of one of our &quot;Christian&quot; leaders?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To the person who took 11 days to get a letter from El Paso: It only took three days to get a package from Nashville via UPS. That's the difference between a government-run operation and a private company. And the liberals want the U.S. government to run health care. What a mess that would be!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Well, there is no such thing as &quot;rap&quot; music. It is just a bunch of jig-jam garbage noise, and a nuisance to all. Only the abjectly stupid would listen to such.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Udall's refusal to even consider off-shore drilling should disqualify him as a senator. He doesn't understand how the high price of gas is affecting his constituents, or he doesn't care and puts the environment over hard-working New Mexicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the age of terrorism, nuclear reactors are inviting targets. Now Congressman Pearce is foolishly pushing for nuclear reactors in New Mexico in his new TV spot. By the way Mr. Pearce where are we going to put all the nuclear waste and what happens when radioactive elements accidentally leaks into our underground water systems?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The installation of red light cameras at some Las Cruces intersection by a for profit company, Red Flex Traffic Systems of Phoenix, is nothing more than a business model that transfers the wealth of the citizens of Las Cruces to a few business men in Phoenix. They don't care about our safety, just their bottom line. Yes, there would be no cost to the city to operate or administer the program, but there is a social-economic welfare cost to the citizens of Las Cruces (the source of the wealth). We need to take care of our own safety, because people will always act in their own self interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It would be nice if the sports editor would put in the National league West in baseball. The games are played late, but there is nothing in the paper the day after which I understand. But could you at least put something in two days later?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I was pushing my car one afternoon and two teens in a white pickup truck pulled into the parking lot and asked me if I needed help. They and the lady next to me helped me get it started. I did not get their names, but their parents should be very proud that their boys grew up the way they did. They are assets to the community. Thank you boys!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now we find out Wal-Mart has been having meetings telling their employees they need to vote for Republicans for president because if a Democrat gets in to office a bill will pass that is currently in congress which would allow Wal-Mart employees to unionize. Wal-Mart is one of the reasons we still need Unions to protect the workers and make sure they get their fair treatment. So this is what Wal-Mart is doing now, why does Las Cruces want a third one? We should get rid of the two we have!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To the lady with the gas bill for $60. Get this, my meter was completely turned off and my bill increased $15 over that minimum charge. Somebody needs to get those gas meter readers on the ball. I wonder who the head of that department is?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a tax paying voter of New Mexico, I'm glad to see the flyers about Sen. Rawson that have been mailed out to every voter in the southern part of the sate. I'm glad to hear what is going on and how our senators are voting. We seldom hear about it. I will not vote for him in my district, but I appreciate being informed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hers is one for you, when you go on vacation in Mexico, do not drink the water! Okay, so why should we be eating things from Mexico that have to drink the water. We should not be eating or importing anything from Mexico that we eat. Think about it. It might be over your head though!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Is it true that illegal aliens that have contributed nothing to Social Security are entitled to a larger benefit than those who have been paying in for 40 to 50 years?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I went to the post office and I was ransacking the trash for coupons from Arbys, McDonalds, Sonic, and wherever. People were passing by getting their mail looking at me, well it was not like I was reading peoples mail, I wanted the coupons. I mean, you could not believe how many coupons I found. At least 50 for Sonic alone. People don't take advantage of using the coupons, and would rather pay more. I wish I had the money to pay more, but I don't. I take advantage of this even though it embarrasses me sometimes. I am not stealing, so I want to bring to attention with our economy these days we need everything we can get at a good price, and I'm sorry people waste so much and don't care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I noticed the poverty reduction task force wants to improve housing access for residents. Didn't they mean to say citizens? Maybe this is part of the problem of 18 percent of New Mexicans living in poverty. Maybe many of them just came across the border and ha had no education or job skills, and put 10 people in one small mobile home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It makes me sick when I hear people still trying to blame environmentalists on gas. Get over it, they tried to tell us 30 years ago that we were going to run out and find alternatives. Even though you ignored their advice, at least today have the common decency and integrity to admit that they were right. Stop blaming them for something they tried to prevent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is about Exxon, I understand that their last quarter was about eleven point six billion, which is the biggest amount of money ever made in the history of this country. They just got through retiring their CEO last year, and he got $420 million for retirement. So I advise all you people that drive to not buy Exxon gasoline. Maybe they will wise up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We keep hearing people say that we have to stay in Iraq until the war is won. The war in Iraq was over when Saddam was captured. After that we just became an occupying force and they don't want us there anymore. There is nothing left to win or lose, we need to respect the wishes of the country we are occupying and get out of there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I just read a wonderful story about a deaf girl who attends O&ntilde;ate and about her trials and tribulations. This is the second story I read about her. Why hasn't the Sun-News covered this story? She is an inspiration to all our teenage daughters. Instead you devoted a whole page to pregnant teens? This is a a positive girl in our society, she is an outstanding young lady and deserves every bit of credit she gets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Someone, somewhere, for some purposes of self-gratification or self- glory, has decided that they want a veterans museum here. So one way or another there will be a museum. No one may ever go to it, but it will be here with some person's name on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lets name downtown &quot;Old Las Cruces&quot;, just as they named Mesilla &quot;Old Mesilla&quot; in 1972. These newcomers think they can come in and read a couple of books and all of the sudden they are historians. We that have been here four to five generations find it amusing. The stories I hear from these wannabe natives are sometimes so out in left field that I wonder where we are headed. I am and will die a true Mesillero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I want to Sound Off! about the incompetence of the Do&ntilde;a Ana road department. We are still flooded in Leasburg, the road is washed out. We have not seen any county commissioners at all. The road is also washed out at the American Bend lateral, and there isn't even flashing signs. The Do&ntilde;a Ana road was recently resurfaced in the last few months, but it still has no stripes. I don't know what these people are doing, but now I understand that they dumped tons and tons and tons of dirt in the mouth of the Edward's arroyo and that they in fact caused this flood in Leasburg. I wonder who will pay for that? Probably all of these tax payers!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gee, I don't know, if you go to a park and there's a religious event for children, but you hate God or don't believe in Him, then why not go find another park instead of complaining. You atheists, satanists and witches should form your own events, except that you hide in closets afraid that people will find you out.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election campaign for president is too long, in my view, especially as an independent. I liked John McCain better when he was a &quot;maverick.&quot; Now they are trying to remake him as a conventional Republican so he can raise more money to flood the television networks with smear commercials. I had hoped the era of polarized politics with regard to business effected in our national capital would go back to an era characterized by more bipartisanship. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain does have more experience in the area so-called &quot;inside the Beltway,&quot; but it is as a maverick that he was reputed for efforts involving the Democrats and independents as much as the Republicans. To a large extent, however, his co-sponsored bills did not make it into law. Others did not work effectively once enacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is more of an unknown. His strength is he has a vision, which has activated large numbers of young voters either for him or against him. This result from inspiration is essential to breathe new life into any democracy. Obama's strength is in the power of the Internet. It is the kind of power that does give him a chance to get around the powerful interest groups, which have dominated government in this country for a long time now at the expense of the little guy. The big question is how much can he control these &quot;masses&quot;   or will it be vice versa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I firmly believe in the concept of one man, one vote. It is possible that we could have another election by which one candidate wins the popular vote and another garners the electoral vote. Something does need to be changed in this regard. This should not be left up to the small number of nine citizens on the Supreme Court again.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take back the economy from environmentalists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think it is time the people of the U.S. take back their economy from the environmentalists. They have a stranglehold on everything we do, and it all stems from energy. There are countless rules and regulations for everything that goes on in this country, from environmental impact studies to, you name it. And they all add big expenses to every project (think the new school). France gets 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power. Why can't we? Environmentalists. Japan gets most of its electricity from nuclear power. Why can't we? The environmentalists have the Democrats in their pocket, so rules and regulations make it almost impossible to build any reactors, or oil refineries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventy-five percent of the people in the U.S. say &quot;Drill Here, Drill Now!&quot; What do the Democrats say? No! Drill on the 64 million acres where there is no oil. That will help a lot. We keep hearing the same old tune, &quot;It will take 10 years to get any oil,&quot; which we have been hearing for at least 10 years. There is a bill in Congress to allow offshore drilling and in the ANWR, but Speaker Pelosi will not let it come to a vote. Senate majority leader Harry Reed echoes the same song. Congressman Steve Pearce sponsored the bill in the House, along with 45 bi-partisan colleagues, for domestic drilling. I don't think you will see Congressman Udall's name on it. Last night, Congressman Udall had a TV ad saying we need more refineries. Check his record, see if he has voted in favor of anything that would help our current energy situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, while we are on the economy, Sen. Obama talks about it a lot, along with the budget deficit. But are you aware of the bill he has introduced in the Senate to give approximately $845 billion to the U.N.? That is a tax of over $2,000 dollars for every man woman and child in the U.S. It is Senate bill 2433, and has already passed the House and passed out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Please note that both of these votes were &quot;voice votes&quot; which was a deliberate strategy of the Congressional majority so no record would be kept of who voted in favor of this bill. What would $845 billion do to the deficit, and where would the money come from? Possibly from a global tax on fossil fuels, (coincidentally gasoline is a fossil fuel), so it would cost even more to fill up your gas tank, and heat your homes. I will not comment again on the U.N.'s honesty and ethics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if you want higher taxes, you know who to vote for. If you want lower taxes vote for McCain, Pearce, Tinsley and Skinner.</SPAN></P>

There was Barack Obama on a nine-day trip through eight countries with three network anchors and all John got was a lousy T-shirt. Or to be more exact, all he got was a ride in George H.W. Bush's golf cart and a rejection slip from The New York Times' op-ed editor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even McCain's inner circle began to get snarky.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never mind that Frankie's &quot;Eyes&quot; was a No. 2 hit in 1967, a year when Obama was 6. For some reason, McCain's cultural references have a sell-by date of 1970. It's like the strange &quot;Summer of Love&quot; ad that tries to place Obama in the upheavals of 1968 when he was headed to second grade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it wasn't just Frankie Valli that makes me feel that the Republican is locked into a 40-year-old time frame. It's the debate about Iraq itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Hart once said, &quot;In a way, John is refighting the Vietnam War.&quot; For a long time, the former prisoner of war has believed that Vietnam should have, could have had a different ending.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, too, his attention on Iraq has been less on the war's origin than on some undefined victorious conclusion. McCain jumped the shark when he accused Obama of wanting to win an election even if it meant losing a war. But even before that intemperate charge, he said something equally damning: &quot;The fact is, if we had done what Senator Obama wanted to do, we would have lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain starts the historical clock running after the invasion and even after the surge. For all his complaints about the media, he's been able to focus the Iraq debate on the surge's success. He has said repeatedly, &quot;I'm proud that I was right. That's what judgment is about. That's why I'm qualified to lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what if &quot;we had done what Obama wanted to do&quot; in 2002, when he was a lowly state senator and an opponent of invasion? We wouldn't have roared into this disaster. What if we dated judgment to the prewar days? Is McCain still proud that he was right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am well aware that we cannot rewind the past. We focus now on the least catastrophic exit plan. When the Iraqi prime minister and Obama agree on a timetable, I synchronize my watch. But it's still fair to measure a candidate by his view on our entrance to this war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current president has never admitted that we invaded Iraq on false premises or phony pre-emptives or fictitious weapons of mass destruction. Bush will breeze home to Texas without a modicum of guilt. Do we want another president like that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's go back to a McCain op-ed that did run in The New York Times before the invasion: &quot;Only an obdurate refusal to face unpleasant facts ... could allow one to believe that we have rushed to war.&quot; Let's go back to an interview with Tim Russert when McCain was asked if he would still have gone to war even knowing there were no WMDs. &quot;Yes,&quot; he answered without missing a beat. The only regret or anger expressed by McCain is that we didn't have enough troops earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, in the recent, rejected op-ed, McCain said that by advocating timetables for withdrawal, Obama was &quot;emulating the worst mistake of the Bush administration by waving the &quot;Mission Accomplished' banner prematurely.&quot; Dear John: Wasn't the &quot;worst mistake of the Bush administration&quot; launching the invasion at all?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not a summer of love. Frankie Valli is no longer a teen idol. Iraq is not Vietnam. But Americans are in a $10 billion-a-month war with more than 4,000 dead and 30,000 wounded. We've watched the current president deny and deny that he was wrong in invading Iraq. If there's a bottom-line, rock-solid qualification for being the next president, it's a candidate who acknowledges just how badly we were misled. So far, Obama's The (Only) One.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain can be a Berliner, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee decided to have a little fun with Barack Obama's widely anticipated speech Thursday at Berlin's Victory Column. It is airing anti-Obama ads in Berlin's namesakes in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not a lot of audience reach in these tiny radio markets, but certainly a poke in the ribs to Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 60-second ad accuses Obama of voting against allocating money for military troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When it came time to act, he voted against critical resources: no to individual body armor, no to helicopters, no to ammunition, no to aircraft,&quot; the ad states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reference is to Obama's vote on May 24, 2007, against a $120 billion appropriation, most of it for troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Obama had voted for a similar bill weeks earlier that required the administration to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq by Oct. 1, 2007. That bill passed, but President Bush vetoed it. The legislation that replaced it contained no withdrawal language and it passed 80-14 with Obama among the dissenters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of that vote, Obama issued a statement: &quot;After he vetoed a plan that would have funded the troops and begun to bring them home, this bill represents more of his stubborn refusal to address his failed policy. We should not give the President a blank check to continue down this same, disastrous path.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has otherwise voted for every spending bill for troops in war zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a veteran and someone who has always put the public interest first, John McCain stood by our troops,&quot; McCain's&nbsp;ad says. &quot;If Obama can't rise above politics to support our soldiers in a time of war, then how can he claim to have the strength to change the way Washington works? John McCain is ready to lead. Barack Obama is not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain aired a similar message on a television ad last week, but that ad has received limited airplay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign denounced the ad as a &quot;distasteful and misleading attack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are honest differences between Sen. Obama's position on Iraq and Sen. McCain's, but there's no question that both support our troops,&quot; Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan said in a statement. &quot;Under the RNC's definition, John McCain would have also chosen politics over our military when he urged George Bush to veto funding for the troops, and we know that's not the case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, Obama began broadcasting a new Spanish language radio ad in Colorado, Florida, New Mexico and Nevada that seeks to connect with Latino and Hispanic voters by highlighting his middle-class roots and work on jobs-related issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He grew up without a father raised by his mother with the support of his grandparents,&quot; the ad's announcer stats. &quot;Through student loans and hard work, he graduated from college.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad refers to his work as a community organizer in Chicago. It also says that while a state senator in Illinois, &quot;he passed a law that helped reduce the welfare rolls by over 80 percent by helping families to secure jobs.&quot; Obama did not single-handedly &quot;pass&quot; the law, but he was one of a handful of original sponsors of legislation that adopted Clinton-era federal requirements that welfare recipients obtain work and that set time limits on benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An early script of the Obama&nbsp;ad that the campaign released erroneously Wednesday had tried to make a greater connection with Hispanic voters by stating that Obama's father, originally from Kenya, &quot;was an immigrant.&quot; That reference was dropped in the final ad. Obama's father divorced his mother when Obama was two years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hispanic and Latino voters generally tilt Democratic and polls show Obama well ahead of McCain among that voting bloc. Hispanic voters have become especially important this election because states with sizable Hispanic populations, such as Colorado, Florida, New Mexico and Nevada are presidential battlegrounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has run Spanish language ads as well. He has aired ads in Nevada and New Mexico promoting his economic plans. Another featured his Naval Academy roommate Frank Gamboa who touted McCain's work on behalf of Hispanics and stated, without naming Obama, that &quot;the other candidate has just discovered the importance of the Hispanic vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has also run a Spanish language radio ad in Florida that promoted his support of the Colombian Free Trade Agreement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain&nbsp;ad blames Obama for gas prices</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine -- Republican John McCain worked on Monday to wrestle the spotlight from rival Barack Obama's tour of Iraq by insisting he was right and the Democrat was wrong about the war and releasing a new critical ad blaming higher gas prices on his opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Obama toured the war zones trailed by U.S. network TV anchors, McCain ridiculed him from afar during a visit with the first President George Bush at his summer home on the Atlantic. At the same time, the Republican contender released an eyebrow-raising new ad flatly blaming the Illinois senator for higher gasoline prices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican and Democratic presidential contenders have differed sharply over Iraq. Obama has said he would withdraw U.S. troops from combat there over 16 months while reinforcing the U.S. effort against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. McCain has resisted any timetable for withdrawal, insisting victory in Iraq is a necessary precursor to success in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any withdrawal of troops from Iraq &quot;must be based on conditions on the ground,&quot; McCain told reporters as he stood beside the 84-year-old former president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator disparaged Obama as &quot;someone who has no military experience whatsoever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Bosnian leader arrested in Serbia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELGRADE, Serbia -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, a war crimes fugitive and one of the world's most wanted men, was arrested Monday evening in a sweep by Serbian security forces, the country's president said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karadzic has been indicted by the United Nations war crimes tribunal for former Yugoslavia for genocide during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. He has been hiding since 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Boris Tadic's office said in a statement that Karadzic was arrested &quot;in an action by the Serbian security services.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karadzic, who was the leader of ethnic Serbs during the war that erupted with Bosnia's secession from Yugoslavia, is accused of masterminding massacres that the U.N. war crimes tribunal described as &quot;scenes from hell, written on the darkest pages of human history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had topped the tribunal's most-wanted list for more than a decade and was said to have resorted to elaborate disguises to elude authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portugal's AG closes McCann case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LISBON, Portugal -- Portugal's attorney general ordered police Monday to halt their investigation into the disappearance of British girl Madeleine McCann because detectives uncovered no evidence of a crime during their 14-month probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case will remain closed unless new evidence emerges, Attorney General Fernando Pinto Monteiro's office said in a statement. Detectives found no reason to charge any of the three people named as suspects: Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry and local man Robert Murat, the statement said. All three denied involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the announcement, the McCanns said being named suspects in the case had damaged the search for Madeleine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an order issued today ... the investigation into the disappearance of the minor Madeleine McCann has been halted because no evidence was discovered of any crime committed by the suspects,&quot; the attorney general's statement said. It added the investigation could be reopened &quot;if new evidence emerges from any serious, pertinent and authoritative&quot; source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disappearance of the blond-haired girl in May 2007 immediately attracted intense global media attention, which continued unabated as her parents were named as suspects and few clues turned up to explain how she mysteriously vanished from a hotel room during a family vacation in Portugal's southern Algarve region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hurricane warning issued for Texas, Mexico coasts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI -- A hurricane warning has been issued for parts of the Texas and Mexico coasts as Tropical Storm Dolly churns through the Gulf of Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Monday that the warning in Texas extends from Brownsville to Port O'Connor. The government of Mexico also issued a hurricane warning from Rio San Fernando northward to the U.S. border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forecasters say it's likely Dolly will become a hurricane, but they don't expect it to become a major hurricane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 9 p.m. MDT, Dolly was located about 435 miles southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas. It was moving at about 17 mph and had maximum sustained winds near</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">50 mph.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">595 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He didn't win friends or influence people from the English-only bloc, but Barack Obama's recent advocacy of Spanish struck a nice note here in the American Southwest. It should resonate around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was ad-libbing his way through a presidential-campaign appearance in Georgia -- but even there he drew applause when he said, in rhetorical response to the notion of our nation as a single-language fortress, &quot;you need to make sure your child can speak Spanish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a great indicator of Obama's inclusiveness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anybody wants to fault him for that remark, it should be for the premise he tossed off right before it: &quot;Instead of worrying about whether immigrants can learn English -- they'll learn English.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, really? Many do -- but many don't, and that bothers certain gringos whose ancestors gave up their German, their Italian, their Swedish during rapid assimilation. So even as Obama was smirking it up about European visitors to this country who speak our language and others -- while your average American tourist there might do well to say merci beaucoup -- there was no denying that it's Spanish that draws the ire of a vocal few Middle Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By even mentioning sporadic efforts at mandatory-English legislation, he might have been raising a straw man -- but he was pretty effective at tearing it down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here in Santa Fe, Spanish has been spoken for far longer than English has -- and it still is. To most newcomers from the old British colonies and their colonies-turned-states, that's part of the charm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But today, immigrants from southern North America are everywhere in this country -- and so is their language. Even as they set about learning the lingua franca, their spoken-word assimilation delayed by their need to work 25 hours a day, our country's Spanish-speaking population is being catered to by a commercial world eager for their business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But is that any reason for resentment from the masses whose language is limited to English?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chauvinism, it might be argued, is a trait traceable to our simian forebears -- thus tough to overcome. And what if those people are talking about us in that language not enough of us understand?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To that, the editorial &quot;we&quot; would say: Don't flatter yourselves; chances are, they're conversing about the same boring stuff we are: the weather, the kids ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if it really bothers you, why not break their code? Pick up some Spanish; it's probably the easiest other language to learn. The New Mexican publishes La Voz de Nuevo Mexico, where advertisements, cartoons and photo captions are painless introductions to the language. And on Mondays, we offer El Nuevo Mexicano.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Papers in many parts of the country are offering similar publications -- so Obama pretty clearly is onto something when he says &quot;we should have every child speaking more than one language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he made clear, it doesn't have to be Spanish -- but Spanish is so prevalent that the senator made sense applying espa&ntilde;ol to his not-just-English pitch. He is running advertisements and commercials in that language. And his opponent's first general-election radio commercials shout &quot;estamos unidos con John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sooner immigrants learn English the better. But besides offering their kids transitional bilingual programs in our schools, we should make more languages available to all children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As today's international crises make clear, the United States must gain greater awareness of a world closing in on us. For too long, we've taken the dominant-nation attitude that others must speak our language. We pay for that arrogance every day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visit: McCain in Duke City for fundraiser, town hall gathering</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALBUQUERQUE -- Presidential candidate Sen. John McCain said Monday that if elected he would ask Los Alamos National Laboratory to work on a &quot;national mission&quot; of energy independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to put them to work on some additional areas of energy,&quot; the Arizona Republican said of the weapons research laboratory, which has been facing funding cutbacks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, though, McCain emphasized he'd keep the lab's current mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to let 1,000 flowers bloom here,&quot; he said. &quot;Wind, tide, solar, nuclear, batteries that will run a car for a couple hundred miles,&quot; McCain told New Mexico reporters during a ride through Albuquerque on his Straight Talk Express campaign bus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who last visited Albuquerque in late June, was in New Mexico to raise funds and campaign in what is considered a battleground state in this year's presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidate later Monday was expected to attend a fundraiser with prominent Republicans at the local Hilton hotel. An invitation listed suggested donations ranging from $1,000 to $25,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, McCain was scheduled to hold a town hall gathering in Albuquerque with 500 guests. Tickets for the event were given away on a first-come, first-served basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the 23-minute bus ride from the Albuquerque airport to the hotel, between catching glimpses of Fox News on a TV in the back of the giant bus, McCain also expressed hopes for reform of the nation's immigration laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we can get to an overall immigration reform very soon, we just have to say we'll secure the borders first,&quot; McCain said. &quot;Hispanics want the border secure, they see the trucks coming across the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in New Mexico and Arizona, one of the standard tactics is to send a group of illegals across, they call the Border Patrol, the Border Patrol comes ... and then the drug dealers come behind them. They know the cruelties of the coyotes (smugglers). They want a temporary worker program that works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both McCain and Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic candidate, are expected to spend more time in the coming months in New Mexico, seen as a swing state with a critical Hispanic population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has aired several television and radio ads in New Mexico, with the most recent TV ad aimed at attracting Hispanic voters. In the ad, he praises Hispanics for service in the U.S. military, including green card holders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, during his last trip to New Mexico in late June, said LANL would remain a weapons-research facility under his administration. But, if he's elected, LANL also would be at the forefront of research for technology to aide in nuclear nonproliferation, the Illinois senator said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Los Alamos has been one of our premier research facilities, and we need to do more research in this area, in part because we've got to deal with the critical issues of nonproliferation,&quot; the Democratic contender said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said he would put a priority on developing technology to detect &quot;loose,&quot; unaccounted-for nuclear material. He also said there needs to be a technology to ensure nuclear materials designed for civilian purposes in countries that don't currently have nuclear weapons aren't turned into bombs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain returned to New Mexico in search of money for his presidential campaign and support among swing-state voters, including Hispanics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the second time within two months that McCain visited New Mexico, a state that backed Republican George Bush four years ago but narrowly went with Democrat Al Gore in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain attended a private fundraiser at an Albuquerque hotel Monday evening and plans to field questions from New Mexicans at a town hall meeting Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said in an interview that he'll emphasize the economy during his town hall meeting. He also pitched his proposal for a gasoline tax holiday as a way to help New Mexicans, particularly those living in rural areas who may drive long distances to reach their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said he would broaden the duties of the national laboratories, such as one at Los Alamos, to include more research and development of energy, including solar, wind and other renewable energy sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Energy independence is a national mission,&quot; said McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both McCain and Democrat Barack Obama are targeting Hispanics a rapidly growing segment of the nation's population and a critical source of votes in the presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before arriving in New Mexico, McCain spoke to the annual convention of the National Council of La Raza at its meeting in San Diego. The Arizona senator highlighted his work on immigration reform with Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy legislation that would have provided a path to legal status for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants already living in the United States. Obama appeared before the group on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said he's ready to move ahead with immigration reform legislation but the nation first must secure its borders, which &quot;we're moving forward in that direction pretty quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The overwhelming majority of people who cross our borders illegally are crossing for the same reason why our forefathers came,&quot; McCain said of immigrants looking for jobs in the U.S. &quot;But there's always a risk since 9/11 of somebody who wants to do bad things in our country coming across an unsecured border. So it is a national security issue as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hispanics account for almost 40 percent of voting age New Mexicans and traditionally have provided a solid base of support for Democrats. But Bush claimed a significant share of the Hispanic vote in 2004 about two in five voters, according to exit polls. That's partly why Bush carried New Mexico in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a great way for a Republican to cut into a Democratic constituency,&quot; Brian Sanderoff, an Albuquerque pollster, said in a recent interview. &quot;They would do that by maintaining their conservative message on social issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hispanics in northern New Mexico are socially conservative, according to Sanderoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hispanics were the focus on a new television ad launched by McCain's campaign last week in New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada. The ad featured remarks at a debate with GOP presidential candidates last year in which McCain talked about Hispanics serving in the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you go to Iraq or Afghanistan today, you're going to see a whole lot of people who are of Hispanic background. You're even going to meet some of the few thousand that are still green card holders who are not even citizens of this country, who love this country so much that they're willing to risk their lives in its service in order to accelerate their path to citizenship and enjoy the bountiful, blessed nation,&quot; McCain says in the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So let's from time to time remember that these are God's children. They must come into country legally, but they have enriched our culture and our nation as every generation of immigrants before them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like eager but awkward suitors, Barack Obama and John McCain are working hard and sometimes fumbling in their efforts to court Hispanic voters who could swing November's presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the African-American Obama and Anglo McCain, the problem is less one of language than of trying to understand a group whose own diversity can make it a mystery to others. It's not a simple matter of saying, &quot;Take me to your leaders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that, in essence, is the ground game the presidential candidates and their campaigns have been playing in pitching to voters who could form decisive constituencies in critical battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They just come to me and say, 'Who are the bosses of the Latin community?'&quot; said Patrick Manteiga, who runs a family-owned newspaper for Hispanics in Tampa's historic Cuban neighborhood of Ybor City. &quot;That's like coming and asking, 'Who are the bosses of white America, of the soccer moms?'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates are pressing their case in three speeches in as many weeks to Hispanic umbrella groups and working in other ways to make their outreach more sophisticated. Republicans have opened an office in Orlando, where most of the state's Puerto Ricans live, and Obama opens one this week in Ybor City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They've both got their work cut out for them in appealing to a large and growing segment of the population that has leaned Democratic but has not always been motivated to vote. A recent AP-Yahoo News poll found Obama leading McCain 47 percent to 22 percent among Hispanic voters, with 26 percent undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is respected by many Hispanics for refusing to pander to anti-immigrant sentiment over the years. Yet he is viewed in some Latino quarters as a sequel to the unpopular President Bush, a problem he has with voters at large, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's vitality and soaring oratory appeal to Hispanics just as they do to others. Whoops of approval were heard throughout his speech this week to the League of United Latin American Citizens' convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Obama emerged from Democratic primaries a distant second to rival Hillary Rodham Clinton among most Hispanic groups. Like voters at large, Latino voters question the one-term senator's experience. And there are tensions between blacks and Hispanics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hispanic voters are hardly monolithic. Some in the West have roots going back more than two centuries, while others were sworn in as citizens last week. Some consider themselves white and some black, and many represent every shade in between.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the last presidential election, Hispanics in key swing states such as Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and Florida represented anywhere from 8 percent to more than 30 percent of voters, according to exit polls, and their numbers are only expected to grow this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE CLINTONITES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clara Apodaca, 73, of Las Cruces, N.M., is among the Clinton supporters who quickly made the shift to Obama. The longtime Democrat was hoping to see a woman in the Oval Office, but she now believes Obama would be the best candidate to handle the economy, the war and the country's reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're so badly thought of throughout the world,&quot; she said. &quot;We need to shore up our relationships.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet 64-year-old Denver resident Paul Sandoval, who was also a Clinton supporter, has yet to make up his mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama has not sold me that he's the best candidate, regardless if he's a Democrat,&quot; the Mexican restaurant owner said as he served up eggs for the morning crowd. &quot;I'm going to wait. I'm going to see how they perform on that stage, answering those hard questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there is Fernando Romero, a former casino executive and longtime political organizer in Las Vegas. Romero advised Democratic candidate Bill Richardson, but he calls Obama's relationship with Hispanics shallow. For now, he's backing McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately (Obama) is the one that we know nothing about and has made little effort to communicate with us,&quot; Romero said. &quot;There are so many good qualities that Senator McCain has and proven qualities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE REPUBLICANS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign is counting on such voters, hoping they will judge him as an individual and not a fixture of the Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Republicans are seeing their own defections among Hispanic voters, especially in Florida, where for the first time more are registered as Democrats than Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain remains popular among Cuban-Americans in Miami, who tend to vote Republican and admire his military record and his support for U.S. policy toward Cuba. The campaign unveiled its Florida Hispanic steering committee last week with names of roughly 100 active Hispanic supporters from throughout the state. But a crowd of nearly 1,000 people, many of them Cuban-Americans, turned out to hear Obama speak at a private luncheon in May. An Obama campaign sticker briefly peaked out from the wall outside Little Havana's famed Versailles restaurant last month, a traditional gathering point for Republican hard-liners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesus Mendoza, 51, owner of the Tijerazo barber shop in Tampa, explained his change of heart as he wielded his scissors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a true Republican,&quot; said the Puerto Rican native. &quot;I believe people should work hard and get less help. But the Republicans have been in power for eight years, and I don't think things are better. Obama, he's a young candidate, but he's intelligent. Even though I'm a Republican, I'm not blind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Orlando, Angie Thillet, 38, who voted twice for Bush, is leaning toward Obama because he proposes to get the country close to universal health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thillet went without insurance coverage for years, despite white-collar jobs. She has insurance now through her employment at a funeral home, yet she was afraid to go to the doctor after she hit her head in the bathtub because her deductible is more than $1,200.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She doesn't like the hype surrounding Obama, especially comparisons to John F. Kennedy. Still, she says, &quot;I won't be voting for McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If talk radio is any measure, Obama is making inroads. Magda Yvette Torres, a two-time Bush supporter and host of a Spanish-language program in central Florida, fielded calls heavily in favor of the Democrat on one recent show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of my listeners supported Hillary Clinton, and a few months ago, you would have heard a lot of these same people calling in to criticize Obama, more than a few talking about his race,&quot; Torres said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEXAS IN FLUX</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Texas Hispanics have tended to vote Democratic, in the 2004 presidential election Bush, the state's former governor, split their vote with Democrat John Kerry. Now their support may be up for grabs again not enough perhaps to swing the state but enough to force McCain to spend more resources there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's personal appeal won over San Antonio office manager Naomi Mathews, 35. The Mexican-American considers herself a Republican but is leaning toward Obama. She was impressed that he held a town hall across the street from the coffee shop where she works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe it's the whole change thing,&quot; said Mathews. &quot;He made an impression on us. Maybe we can trust this person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mathews was one of many Hispanic voters, among dozens interviewed by The Associated Press, who said they wanted more of a direct pitch from the candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angelette Aviles, 32, an active supporter of McCain, believes he will help the economy and be tough in the international arena. But she was frustrated by a recent South Florida radio ad highlighting a former Cuban political prisoner's support for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like, OK, I think the hardcore voters in Miami are going to vote for the Republicans no matter what,&quot; she said. &quot;The younger generation, they're more concerned about bread and butter issues. You need to reach out to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manteiga, a Democrat, said Hispanics want more than Obama's stadium speeches or McCain's town-hall meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one is meeting with the 40 Latin ministries, as they would in the black community,&quot; he said. &quot;Latins want a hug. They want a touch. If 300 or 400 people shake the candidate's hand, that translates exponentially into votes when they talk to their family and friends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MATTERS OF RACE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manteiga said a personal connection is most important for Obama because he must convince Hispanics who are uncomfortable voting for a black candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Hispanics interviewed by the AP acknowledged tensions on that front, because of competition over jobs and services or because of prejudice. Yet many also said these issues would not be the deciding factor for them, especially in a year when the economy and the war in Iraq loom large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To me, being Hispanic, the government caters to blacks,&quot; said Eddie Martinez, 51, of Las Vegas. &quot;Anything the government is giving away goes to blacks first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, Martinez plans to vote for Obama because he believes the Illinois senator would be the best at bringing jobs to the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manny Genao, a Dominican native, has run the popular Cafe Madrid in east Orlando for years and proudly displays portraits of local Republican leaders across his walls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Genao said people in his neighborhood complained about an uptick in crime with the influx of &quot;the diverse people&quot; who poured in from New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the next breath, he said the Bush administration was too close to the oil companies and that he views McCain as more of the same. Then he compared Obama's speeches to those of Martin Luther King Jr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm still undecided,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Associated Press writers Felicia Fonseca in Albuquerque, N.M., Kathleen Hennessey in Las Vegas, Sarah Karush in Washington, Ivan Moreno in Denver and Elizabeth White in San Antonio contributed to this report.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential candidate reaches out to Hispanics with radio ad in Spanish</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Target: Pro-war group made up of 'nonpartisan' veterans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Mexico, considered a swing state in the presidential election this year, has been chosen for a new Spanish-language radio ad for Republican candidate John McCain and a television ad for a national pro-war veteran's group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 60-second McCain&nbsp;ad, which will run in New Mexico as well as Nevada, features the voice of Frank Gamboa, McCain's roommate at the U.S. Naval Academy, speaking in Spanish. It's a direct appeal for Hispanic support for the Republican candidate in states with large Hispanic populations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an English translation provided by the campaign, Gamboa, who calls himself &quot;a proud Latino,&quot; says McCain &quot;wants what is best for the Hispanic community&quot; and &quot;shares our same conservative values and faith in God. He knows that family is the focal part of our lives and that we value hard work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad also plays up regional pride. &quot;Being from Arizona, John knows this. He has earned the trust of Latinos and has a history of supporting us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, President Bush fared far better with Hispanics than previous Republican presidential candidates. According to some polls, Bush received about 40 percent of the Hispanic vote. McCain's&nbsp;ad is an obvious appeal to conservative Hispanics who backed Bush. McCain sees an opportunity to capitalize on the fact that Democrat Barack Obama was weak among Hispanics compared with his primary rival Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However recent polls show support for the GOP by Hispanics has fallen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of that could be because of the harsh rhetoric from some Republicans that has accompanied the immigration debate. Though McCain co-sponsored a comprehensive immigration bill with Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy, he has since said he would vote against that bill, which would have provided a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also soon to hit New Mexico -- and 11 other battleground states -- with ads is a group called Vets for Freedom, which identifies itself as a &quot;nonpartisan organization established by combat veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan&quot; whose mission is &quot;to educate the American public about the importance of achieving success in these conflicts by applying our firsthand knowledge to issues of American strategy and tactics in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a news release, VFF next week will announce &quot;a multimillion-dollar television-advertising buy in target markets and on national cable that will air next week and run throughout July and August.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the ads, the group intends to establish &quot;grass-roots&quot; organizations in the targeted states and &quot;pound the pavement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although they call themselves &quot;nonpartisan,&quot; and the news release doesn't mention either presidential candidate, the group, according to its Web site, already has run commercials critical of Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liberal Web site SourceWatch calls VFF a Republican &quot;front group&quot; with ties to President Bush and conservative publisher William Kristol, whose magazine The Weekly Standard has published several articles by VFF leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most prominent Democrat backed by the organization was pro-war U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, who lost the Democratic primary in Connecticut in 2006 but was re-elected as an independent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOTE 2008</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama released his first general election television ad Thursday in New Mexico and 17 other states, a 30-second spot that stresses his work ethic, love of family and patriotism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Democratic presidential candidate spent part of his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia, in the ad, Obama talks about &quot;the Kansas heartland.&quot; The Illinois senator is also wearing an American flag lapel pin -- something that conservative pundits have criticized him for not wearing in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America is a country of strong families and strong values,&quot; a smiling Obama says above soft, pleasant music. &quot;My life's been blessed by both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was raised by a single mom and my grandparents. We didn't have much money, but they taught me values straight from the Kansas heartland where they grew up. Accountability and self-reliance. Love of country. Working hard without making excuses. Treating your neighbor as you'd like to be treated. It's what guided me as I worked my way up -- taking jobs and loans to make it through college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's what led me to pass up Wall Street jobs and go to Chicago instead, helping neighborhoods devastated when steel plants closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why I passed laws moving people from welfare to work, cut taxes for working families and extended health care for wounded troops who'd been neglected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I approved this message because I'll never forget those values, and if I have the honor of taking the oath of office as president, it will be with a deep and abiding faith in the country I love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad features childhood photos of Obama with his mother and his grandparents as well as one from his years as a a community organizer in Chicago. There's campaign footage of Obama talking to a soldier and an elderly woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With its heavy emphasis on words like faith, family, work and country, and emphasizing his modest upbringing, Obama seems to be consciously countering some Republicans' efforts to paint him as a radical or an elitist out of touch with mainstream America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like most of the states where the ad is airing, New Mexico is considered a battleground state. However, the ad also is showing in a few strong Republican states such as Alaska, Georgia, North Carolina, Montana and North Dakota. This perhaps is an effort to expand the presidential battlefield or at least force his Republican opponent, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, to spend money in what he otherwise might have considered &quot;safe&quot; GOP states.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exit: Some consider Clinton brand of politics out of date</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton ended her presidential campaign Saturday, and with it nearly two decades of her family's dominance of the Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this isn't exactly the party I'd planned, but I sure like the company,&quot; Clinton, 60, told cheering supporters at the National Building Museum in Washington as she suspended her campaign and endorsed Barack Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The way to continue our fight now &Eacute; is to take our energy, our passion, our strength and do all we can to help elect Barack Obama the next president of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her reluctant departure from the campaign -- she waited four days after Obama clinched the nomination -- marked more than just the end of her long quest for the presidency and what would have been a unique husband-wife dynasty in the White House. It signaled the end of the Clintons' pre-eminence in the Democratic Party, at least temporarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the better part of two decades, Bill and Hillary Clinton were the leading lights of the party, often pushing against the party's liberal left wing, their bare-knuckle politics adding the words &quot;war room&quot; and &quot;vast right wing conspiracy&quot; to the campaign dictionary, their personal lives a magnet for investigation, imagination and speculation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it's not the end of the Clinton era, it is on hiatus,&quot; said Larry Gerston, a political scientist at San Jose State University in California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She could come back, of course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronald Reagan lost a close Republican nomination battle to Gerald Ford in 1976, and then won it and the White House four years later. John McCain lost the Republican nomination in 2000 and won it this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 18 million votes in this year's Democratic primaries, Clinton built a broad coalition with support from women, Hispanics and working class whites. If Obama falls short in November, she'd be well positioned to run in 2012. If he wins this year and a second term in 2012, she could run in 2016, when she'd be 68 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, however, her time at the top is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's true in policy -- where the Clintons started pushing against the party's more liberal left wing on issues in the early 1990s, when Bill Clinton pushed for welfare reform and free trade, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She ran this year, first as a pro-military hawk, criticizing Obama's vow to meet with foreign dictators and his proposal to raise Social Security taxes on those who make more than $100,000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clinton brand of politics -- an often ad hoc mix of triangulation and confrontation that Obama criticized as too combative and out-of-date for a new era -- lost its luster in the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Clinton was defiant last Tuesday evening when she refused to concede, she was conciliatory to Obama Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today as I suspend my campaign, I congratulate him on the victory he has won and the extraordinary campaign he has run. I endorse him and throw my full support behind him and I ask of you to join me in working as hard for Barack Obama as you have for me,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York senator, who came closer than any woman in history ever has to winning a major party presidential nomination, was joined by her mother, her husband and their daughter, Chelsea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted the unique nature of her campaign and how it touched women -- older women who were born before women had the right to vote and younger women still waiting to see one of their own shatter the most prominent glass ceiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although we weren't able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it has about 18 million cracks in it, and the light is shining through like never before,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Children today will grow up taking for granted that an African-American or a woman can, yes, become the president of the United States,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters started lining up at dawn under a scorching sun, many of them women of her generation who flocked to her campaign and were her steadiest and most loyal supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Randels, a Clinton supporter from Lansing, Mich., called the event &quot;bittersweet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're losing a candidate who I think was the right candidate,&quot; Randels said. &quot;It's sad. But it's time for us to focus on the failures of the last eight years. We need to make sure we don't repeat them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Clinton supporter, Shannon De Witt, a flight attendant from Miami, said he'd like to see an Obama-Clinton ticket: &quot;They would do much for this country. They agree on 95 percent of the issues. They have strengths that complement each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agreed Denise Fight, 51, of Seal Beach, Calif.: &quot;All politics get testy and aggressive. I want to see the party come together, see them work together to do some good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There also were some Obama supporters, who said they came to show party unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Ogas, a retired federal agent from Annapolis, Md., was one of the few Obama supporters in the crowd (he came with his wife, a Clinton supporter).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm glad she's finally willing to concede and unite the party,&quot; Ogas said. &quot;I'll give her a strong hand. It's overdue, but I'm just glad she's doing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
