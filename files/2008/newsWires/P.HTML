<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Madelyn Dunham, who watched from afar as her only grandson rapidly ascended the ranks of American politics to the brink of the presidency, did not live to see whether he was elected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Dunham, 86, Sen. Barack Obama's maternal grandmother, died late Sunday evening in Hawaii after battling cancer, which Mr. Obama announced yesterday upon arriving in Charlotte for a campaign stop on the eve of Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She has gone home,&quot; Mr. Obama said, his voice emotional as he briefly spoke of her death at a campaign rally. &quot;She died peacefully in her sleep with my sister at her side, so there's great joy instead of tears.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama learned of his grandmother's death at 8 a.m. yesterday, aides said, but carried through with a morning rally in Florida without making an announcement. A written statement was issued by the campaign, in Mr. Obama's name, before he spoke at a late-afternoon rally in Charlotte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Dunham was the final remaining immediate family member who helped raise Mr. Obama during his teenage years in Hawaii. He called her Toot, his shorthand for &quot;tutu,&quot; a Hawaiian term for grandparent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama broke from the presidential campaign trail in late October to travel to Honolulu to bid his grandmother farewell. He spent part of two days with her, as she lay gravely ill in the small apartment where he lived from age 10 to 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Ms. Dunham was too sick to travel to see her grandson on the campaign trail, Mr. Obama and other family members said she closely followed his bid for the presidency through cable television. Yet she became a figure in his campaign, seen through images in television commercials intended to give him a biographical anchor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Dunham, who grew up near August, Kan., moved with her husband, Stanley Dunham, to Hawaii. In the early stages of his candidacy, Mr. Obama spoke wistfully about his grandparents, whose all-American biography suddenly was critical to establishing his own American story. He spoke of how his grandmother worked on B-29s at a Boeing plant in Wichita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. Obama, the loss came on the final full day of his presidential campaign. Sen. John McCain and his wife, Cindy, offered their condolences yesterday, saying: &quot;Our thoughts and prayers go out to them as they remember and celebrate the life of someone who had such a profound impact in their lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His grandmother's illness had been weighing on him in recent weeks, friends said, which is why he insisted on interrupting his schedule to visit her late last month. He kept the visit to one day, advisers said, partly out of her own insistence that people not create a fuss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Sometime late tonight, many Americans will feel like losers. Some will have worked months, maybe years, to elect someone who is staring at defeat. Some will have invested a heaping helping of hope into John McCain or Barack Obama, only to face four years under the opponent. There will be tears, denial, anger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As this epic season barrels to a resolution, there is much at stake besides ideology and leadership. Namely: winning and losing. Success will send one side into shared ecstasy. Failure will deaden the other side with lonely grief. It will hurt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would argue there's no starker dichotomy in American culture than in the idea of success and failure,&quot; says Scott Sandage, author of &quot;Born Losers: A History of Failure in America.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sting of failure ripples through all aspects of life; yet, we're quick to write it off, or deflect fault, or deploy banalities to soften the blow. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There seems to be no way in American public life to talk about failure without resorting to cliches,&quot; continues Sandage, who teaches history at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh. &quot;Like, 'You're not a failure unless you quit,' or 'Failure is a learning opportunity.' They're kind of true, but they presume failure is always shameful. They presume failure is excusable only in the context of a continued all-out quest for success.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandage's book covers failed capitalist ventures from the past 200 years, a period during which Americans have broadened &quot;failure&quot; from a word that describes an outcome (as in, &quot;a failed business&quot;) to a word that describes an identity (&quot;I am a failure&quot;). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it's this redefining of failure that gives people trouble, says Edwin Locke, professor emeritus of leadership and motivation at the University of Maryland. Just because you fail doesn't make you a failure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people may generalize a loss to dissatisfaction with themselves,&quot; Locke says. &quot;But that's hugely mistaken, because not reaching a goal is limited to  that goal. It's not a condemnation of your life.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locke has researched goal-setting theory, which says that specific, hard-to-achieve goals produce better performance. He has found through experiments that people who set higher goals accomplish more but are more likely to fail. People who are terrified of failure set their goals too low, so they &quot;succeed&quot; by substandard markers but fail in a broader sense. The trick is to unleash a healthy ambition, set specific goals, and remain resilient and adaptable in the face of failure, Locke says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes hard work leads to failure, as Sandage writes in his book. It's an un-American reality, but Katie Fox-Boyd and Farah Ahmad know all about it. They worked hard to get John Kerry elected president in 2004. We know how that turned out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, there they were a couple of weeks ago on K Street, canvassing through Grassroots Campaigns, working full time to get Obama elected. What if their guy loses again? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We say we're moving to France, but we don't have the money, and we love this country,&quot; says Fox-Boyd, 24. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a distressing time after the last election, but people are now working harder because of it,&quot; says Ahmad, 23. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drive to rebound is an indispensable part of recovering from a loss. It's part of a simple equation for living successfully, regardless of failures, says Frank Farley, a professor of psychology at Temple University in Philadelphia who studies motivation, leadership and the psychology of sports and politics. That equation: Self-knowledge plus motivation equal a successful life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trick is to be a constant student of your evolving strengths and weaknesses, and keep moving forward, whether or not you deserved to lose. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you lose in some venture, in any aspect of your life, learn from it,&quot; Farley says. &quot;That's the motivation part. You learn about yourself, and you do something based on that. Some people when they lose -- they blow it off, they don't think more about it. They may be mad about it. But sensible people tend to reflect. 'What happened there?' Successful people get better at it. A loss, to them, is information.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life coach Ed Modell encourages a similar plan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rather than tell a client to not be upset about losing, we ask them powerful questions,&quot; says Modell, a past president of the D.C. chapter of the International Coach Federation. &quot;Questions like 'What have you learned about yourself from this experience?' and 'What do you need to do to get closure around this situation so you don't keep thinking of yourself as a failure?' &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only good way to lose is to be open to learning from it and avoid the temptation to leap to two extremes: dismissing a loss as meaningless or considering a loss the final judgment on a matter. Land somewhere in the middle, the experts say. A loss should be a source of wisdom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandage offers the example of Al Gore, the man who spent his life working toward the presidency. Defeated in that arena, he rose again to become the spokesman for the issue of climate change, winning a Nobel Peace Prize. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He reinvented himself,&quot; Sandage says. &quot;He found a new rationale for public service that was not about individual ambition.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which brings us back to politics and Election Day. There should be a clear winner and a clear loser. But, for those on the loser's side, that doesn't mean the result should cloud Nov. 5 and 6 and 7 and all the days that follow. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When all else fails, he writes about it </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jason Zasky co-founded Failure Magazine 8 1/2 years ago, when the United States was riding high on tech-boom success. The country's a bit different today, but the magazine is as focused as ever on failures and missteps in every avenue of life -- from business to history to science to sports. (His most recent article is on the &quot;spectacular failure&quot; of the Detroit Lions' ousted general manager.) Zasky, 38, lives in New York, where he writes for and edits the online magazine. Excerpts from an interview: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most magazines devote themselves to the best-dressed celebrities, the most competitive athletes, the biggest-earning companies. So the topic of failure corners a very specific market. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, failure is a very broad subject. It also is constantly intertwined with success. I think most of our stories are not very obvious. Failure is in the eye of the beholder a lot of the times. That may be the case with this election coming up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's a good example of the type of story you do well? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a golfer named Moe Norman. He was a Canadian golfer, and we billed him as &quot;the greatest golfer the world's never known.&quot; He was this unbelievable golfer, but he was kind of like the Rain Man of golf. Because of some challenges he'd had personally, he never lived up to expectations, and never made it on the PGA Tour. That's a good example of a story you'd hardly ever hear of that also had two sides. Here was this fantastic golfer -- one of the best ever -- but as a commercial entity, he was a failure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I assume the economic and political climates have provided good fodder for the magazine. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The failures of the past eight years, with the Bush administration and Republican leadership -- at times that's aided traffic to our site. People are doing a lot more failure-related Web searches. The first time I really noticed it was with the response to Hurricane Katrina. In some ways, the failures of the past eight years have helped. We're probably one of the few entities where that's the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's the biggest failure ever? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we first launched the magazine, we did the Failure of the Millenniums. It was Charles the Hammer and the Battle of Tours (a 732 A.D. conflict wherein the Frankish empire stopped Muslim advances into Europe, which perhaps delayed mankind's progress in math and science, according to Zasky). And every year, we do a Failure of the Year. If we want to relate this to politics: In 2004 our failure was &quot;the American voter&quot; for re-electing Bush and being fooled twice. In 95 percent of the content there is no angle, so to speak. We're very neutral, but this was one of the few exceptions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are your plans for Failure? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll relaunch the site in the near future. I guess I'd like to see a big media partner provide us with more support. And I'd like to host a &quot;failure week&quot; on the History Channel.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats retained and expanded their control of the Senate on Wednesday, ousting Republican Sens. Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina and John Sununu of New Hampshire and capturing seats held by retiring GOP senators in Virginia and New Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 25 of 35 Senate races called, Democrats were guaranteed at least a 54-46 majority, including two holdover independents who vote with Democrats. But they were hoping for even greater gains in a political environment that clearly favored Democrats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Carolina state Sen. Kay Hagan, little known politically before her run, defeated Dole -- a former Cabinet member in two Republican administrations and 2000 presidential hopeful. Dole had tried to tie Hagan, a former Presbyterian Sunday school teacher, to atheists in an ad that appeared to backfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New Hampshire, former Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen defeated Sununu in a rematch of their 2002 contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats now exercise a slim 51-49 control of the chamber. Piggybacking on aggressive Barack Obama voter-registration and get-out-the-vote drives in battleground states, Democrats were reaching for a coveted 60-seat, filibuster-proof Senate majority. However, leaders in both parties portrayed that goal as a long shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic former Virginia Gov. Mark Warner breezed to victory to take a Virginia Senate seat long held for by terms by retiring GOP Sen. John Warner. Warner beat another former governor, Republican Jim Gilmore, in the race to replace retiring five-term Sen. John W. Warner. The two Warners are not related.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New Mexico, Democratic Rep. Tom Udall defeated Republican Rep. Steve Pearce to succeed retiring Sen. Pete Domenici. Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden won another six-year term representing Delaware in the Senate, although it would become moot if Obama wins the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who had been a target of national Democrats, won re-election against two-time Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bruce Lunsford in a contentious race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Warner's victory in Virginia, Democrats now control both Senate seats and the governor's mansion. Virginia usually votes Republican in presidential elections, but this year Democrats viewed it as one of their most promising pick ups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats were counting on a slumping economy, an unpopular war and voter fatigue after eight years of President Bush to bolster that majority, building on the six seats they added in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaching their goal of 60 seats was a stretch. But having a majority in the mid to high 50s would enable Democrats to exercise far more control than they have now, since some Republicans probably would join them in efforts to break Senate logjams on many bills and judicial appointments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats' hoped that only two Democratic senators would lose their Senate seats as a result of the national elections: Biden and Obama. And if the Democratic presidential ticket prevails, Democratic governors in Illinois and Delaware are sure to appoint Democrats to replace them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate seats of Obama and GOP presidential candidate John McCain were not up this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats had fewer seats to defend than Republicans. Of the 35 races on Tuesday's ballot, 23 are now held by Republicans, 12 by Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats also counted as a good prospect the Colorado seat of retiring Republican Sen. Wayne Allard, where Democratic Rep. Mark Udall, son of the late Arizona Rep. Morris &quot;Mo&quot; Udall and cousin of Tom Udall, the New Mexico Senate winner, faced former Republican Rep. Bob Schaffer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another possible pickup for Democrats: Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. Stevens, at 84, the longest serving Republican in Senate history, sought re-election despite calls from GOP leaders to resign after he was convicted last week of seven counts of lying on Senate financial disclosure forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was locked in a tight contest with Democrat Mark Begich, the mayor of Anchorage. Another closely contested race was in Minnesota, where Republican incumbent Coleman was challenged by Democrat Al Franken, the former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; writer and actor. A significant third-party candidate, Independent Dean Barkley, was complicating the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Sen. Gordon Smith in Oregon was also on the list of Democratic targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going into the election, only one incumbent Democrat appeared vulnerable: Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. Republicans made a spirited run at her, but Democrats saw her seat as a safe one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican incumbent senators who cruised to re-election included Lindsay Graham in South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, Jeff Sessions in Alabama, James Inhofe in Oklahoma, Lamar Alexander in Tennessee, Pat Roberts in Kansas, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, and Michael Enzi in Wyoming. Sen. John Barrasso, appointed after Wyoming Sen. Craig Thomas died, was elected to fill the remaining four years of Thomas' term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic senators easily winning re-election included Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, Dick Durbin of Illinois, John Kerry of Massachusetts, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, Carl Levin of Michigan, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Max Baucus of Montana, Tom Harkin of Iowa and Jack Reed of Rhode Island.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I found myself in frightening and unfamiliar territory recently in agreeing with most of what Paul Heise stated. Today we have firmly landed in the real world once again as Heise touts his ultra-liberal, left-wing nonsense. In his defense, at least he does not hide his Barack Obama-based rhetoric. I give him credit for that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But buyer beware. Look what this man says and compare it to Obama's speeches. Let me first qualify this as I will not be casting a ballot for either of our presidential candidates tomorrow. As I had printed in earlier letters to this media, I have advocated all of us do the same since neither candidate has earned our vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as in Obama's pre-Phillies half-hour talk, we must look at Heise's opinion from start to finish. Heise, much like Obama, starts by criticizing President George W. Bush's policies and solely blames the present administration for the fact that our economy and the economies of the world are in peril. Granted, that to try to defend much of the Bush administration's policies is not unlike trying to convince arachnophobics that spiders can be wonderful creatures. But the liberal mentality continues to rail on how the little guy is being burdened with the high cost of Iraq and Afghanistan, the bailout, the stock market and the high cost of energy while conveniently distancing itself and the Democrats from any responsibility or accountability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They talk about tax breaks for the majority while Obama, in his half-hour commercial, as does Heise, derails his fiscal responsibilities by adding programs that will cost trillions and save you billions. The numbers do not justify their rhetoric. It is so nice to be back into the real world again. (Peace, collaboration, accountability and a sane movement toward the political middle created a most uneasy feeling for the past week or so.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't be fooled by the smooth talk of Obama or the Ph.D. of Heise. But at the same time, be just as wary of the hypocrisy of John McCain and his ilk. Use your vote wisely tomorrow! Our great country is at the brink of a very deep abyss with steep walls and a very difficult return from the depths.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain poked fun at his presidential campaign's financial shortcomings and his reputation as a political maverick on NBC's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Saturday Night Live</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who is trailing Democrat </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Barack Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in most battleground-state polls, also appeared during the show's &quot;Weekend Update&quot; newscast to announce he would pursue a new campaign strategy in the closing days of the campaign.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought I might try a strategy called the reverse maverick. That's where I'd do whatever anybody tells me,&quot; McCain said. If that didn't work, &quot;I'd go to the double maverick. I'd just go totally berserk and freak everybody out,&quot; the Arizona senator quipped.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, McCain and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Tina Fey,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> portraying his running mate, Alaska Gov. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sarah Palin,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said they couldn't afford a half-hour TV commercial like that aired by Obama so they said they'd sell campaign products on the QVC shopping channel instead.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other things, McCain advertised a set of knives to cut through pork in Washington. Fey, as Palin, advertised a set of &quot;Joe&quot; dolls commemorating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Joe the Plumber</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Joe Six Pack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and her Democratic rival, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Joe Biden</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The pretend Palin also pulled out T-shirts saying &quot;Palin 2012&quot; and said she wouldn't be returning to Alaska after the election. &quot;I'm either running in four years or I'm going to be a white </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Oprah</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debuting at No. 2 with $10.7 million was the comedy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Zack and Miri Make a Porno</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, starring </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Seth Rogen</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Elizabeth Banks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as pals who do a skin flick to dig themselves out of debt.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spielberg and Jackson have planned to make two movies about Tintin, a young red-headed reporter, and his dog, Snowy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the next-to-last day of the 2008 campaign, Republican John McCain continued his nonstop wooing of Pennsylvania voters while Democrat Barack Obama focused on Ohio, the state without which the GOP has never managed to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For both candidates, neither of whom broke much new ground yesterday, the emphasis was on firing up loyalists for the final push, rather than persuading the few voters left undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking in Wallingford, McCain assured 1,500 cheering supporters inside the gymnasium at Strath Haven High School that he would win the election tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I've been in a lot of campaigns; I know when the momentum is there,&quot; he said. He drew loud cheers when he proclaimed: &quot;The pundits have written us off, just like they've done before. Well, Mac is back.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain repeated his criticism of Obama's level of experience, describing himself as a proven, time-tested fighter for his country. He also had a promise tailored to Phillies fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My first executive order is that we will never allow the World Series to be delayed by an infomercial ever again,&quot; McCain said with a smile. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rain-delayed second part of the decisive Game Five Wednesday night started a few minutes later than other games due to Obama's half-hour-long political program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama's day in Ohio included rallies in Columbus, Cleveland and Cincinnati.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Go vote right now,&quot; Obama told supporters in Columbus, directing people to a nearby early-voting location that remained open. &quot;Do not delay, because we have work to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He took particular delight in taking note of the endorsement that McCain received Saturday from Vice President Cheney, an endorsement that quickly became the subject of an Obama television commercial.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said Obama: &quot;[Cheney] knows that with John McCain you get a twofer: George Bush's economic policy and Dick Cheney's foreign policy - but that's a risk we cannot afford to take. It's time for change, and that's why I'm running for president of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Democrats have a slight lead in Ohio, which was the deciding state in 2004. No Republican candidate in history has prevailed without it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, said on ABC's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">This Week</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that he felt good about his candidate's chances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The main thing I worry about is complacency,&quot; Axelrod said. &quot;I don't want people to hear me or anyone and assume that this campaign is over. If we are casual about this and we don't go to the polls and make our voices heard, then we could get a result that the polls don't project. And that's my concern. That's why we're hop-scotching all over the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even as Obama and McCain made their closing arguments, they were careful not to get in the way of their massive get-out-the-vote organizations, which had hundreds of thousands of volunteers making telephone calls and knocking on doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The evidence suggests that the overall national turnout may be extraordinarily high, perhaps exceeding 135 million, compared with 122 million in 2004 and 106 million in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the final hours, Pennsylvania loomed large, with polls showing McCain gaining ground but still trailing by an average of 7 percentage points - as opposed to 6 points nationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For McCain, the state was a must-win, even though it has gone Democratic in the last four elections, to offset anticipated losses in traditionally Republican states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How much was the Republican ticket counting on Pennsylvania? After McCain's visit to Perkasie Saturday and his stops yesterday in Wallingford and Scranton, he was planning another rally today outside Pittsburgh. His campaign manager, Rick Davis, called the state the key to the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In contrast, Obama, who was last in the state nearly a week ago, felt confident enough of his chances to stay away, leaving the state to his organization - he has 81 offices and untold thousands of volunteers - and to others set to speak for him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton is to be in Pittsburgh, former President Bill Clinton in Erie, and vice presidential candidate Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. at Marconi Plaza in South Philadelphia tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa.) said that McCain might win the state if some Pennsylvanians who have told pollsters they'll vote for Obama vote for McCain instead. Specter said that such behavior, if it happens, would not be evidence of the so-called &quot;Bradley effect,&quot; in which blacks running against whites have sometimes done worse on Election Day than in late polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Well, I don't like the Bradley effect categorization and I don't like the suggestion of racism,&quot; Specter said on CNN. &quot;People are just different on polling and voting.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the McCain event in Wallingford, several voters expressed cautious optimism about the candidate's chances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't trust any of the polls; they take one at every hiccup,&quot; said Shirley Garman, 71, of Brookhaven, talking about a &quot;silent majority&quot; that favors McCain. &quot;I personally think that everyone who's been very silent better get out and vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain concluded his day with a nostalgic touch, a town hall meeting in the town of Peterborough in the state of New Hampshire, which he considers his second political home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without his victory in the primary there in January, he likely would have been eliminated from the race for the GOP nomination. This fall, New Hampshire is one of the states won by the Democrats four years ago where he has much of a chance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another highlight of the final weekend for McCain was his appearance on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Saturday Night Live</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where he did a skit with Tina Fey as running mate Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain concludes the campaign today with a seven-stop, cross-country journey expected to take 20 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It begins in the morning in Tampa and includes rallies in Blountville, Tenn., Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Roswell, N.M., and Henderson, Nev., before concluding in the city of Prescott in his home state of Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama's final day is somewhat less ambitious with rallies in Jacksonville, Fla., Charlotte, N.C., and Manassas, Va. Then he will return to his home in Chicago to await the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Biden in Phila. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The final event of the presidential campaign in this area takes place tonight at Marconi Plaza in South Philadelphia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It will feature Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill, along with members of the Phillies, including Jimmy Rollins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gates open for the outdoor rally at 8:30 p.m. Entry is at Broad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Bigler Streets.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE WAY or the other, you are about to make history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the presidential campaign comes to a frenetic close today, Pennsylvania is ground zero for an election that will give America its first African-American president or its biggest upset in 60 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a crowd of 2,000 yesterday at Strath Haven High School in Wallingford, Delaware County, Republican John McCain was predicting an upset. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been in a lot of campaigns, I know when momentum is there,&quot; Mc Cain said. &quot;I sense it. I feel it. I know it . . . pundits have written us off, just like they've done before. My friends, the Mac is back!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While McCain is finishing the campaign with a heavy presence in Pennsylvania, Democrat Ba-rack Obama is relying more on surrogates and a massive field effort to capture the state's 21 electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three polls last week gave Obama a double-digit lead in Pennsylvania, but a new NBC/Mason Dixon poll shows Obama up by only 4 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though no Republican presidential candidate has carried the state since 1988, McCain has continued his blitz here in the campaign's closing days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain was in Perkasie, near Quakertown, on Saturday, in the Philadelphia suburbs yesterday and was scheduled to be in the Pittsburgh area today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, apparently more comfortable with his position here than McCain, plans no appearances in Pennsylvania today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both Bill and Hillary Clinton will campaign for Obama separately in western Pennsylvania today, and Democratic vice-presidential candidate Joe Biden will rally at Marconi Plaza in South Philadelphia tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign says that Biden will appear with a couple of members of the championship Phillies team, but spokesman Sean Smith said that their identities are &quot;under our hat for now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the state Republican Party has begun airing hard-hitting TV ads attacking Obama and featuring his controversial former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you think you could ever vote for Barak Obama, consider this: Obama chose as his spiritual leader this man,&quot; an announcer says, as the ad cuts to Wright shouting, &quot;Not God bless America, God damn America!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain had promised not to raise the issue of Wright in the campaign. State GOP spokesman Peter Feldman said yesterday that McCain &quot;is not the referee of every political ad in this election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's appearance in Delaware County yesterday came only hours after his &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; appearance. Mc-Cain traded in his suit for a tight black jacket with a popped collar and told the crowd that he's within a &quot;couple points&quot; of catching Obama in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, who appeared alongside McCain yesterday with former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback and others, said that Pennsylvania could determine the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to put too much pressure on you folks,&quot; Lieberman said, &quot;but let me just say that the future of the free world is on your shoulders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain again ripped into Obama for wanting to &quot;spread the wealth around&quot; - a phrase he picked from the Democrat's conversation last month in Ohio to the ubiquitous Joe &quot;Joe the Plumber&quot; Wurzelbacher - and said that he would double the child deduction for working families, cut the capital-gains tax, and lower business taxes to help create domestic jobs and to keep U.S. companies from sending jobs overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Raising taxes makes a bad economy much worse. Keeping taxes low creates jobs, keeps money in your pants,&quot; he said - a phrase that caused some supporters to look at each other with cocked eyebrows, then awkward laughs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm gonna make government live on a budget, just like you do,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's Pennsylvania campaign director, Craig Schirmer, said in a memo that the campaign has had 57,000 volunteers mobilized to get out the vote in the closing days of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The visits of John McCain and Sarah Palin,&quot; he said, &quot;can't compete with this grassroots organization.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding one more chip to the big bet he has placed on Pennsylvania, Sen. John McCain will fly into Pittsburgh for an airport rally this morning following two appearances yesterday in the eastern part of the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His 11th-hour appeals in this state are one part of the avalanche of calls, door-knocking and last-minute campaigning rolling across the remaining competitive states in a presidential election that could set a record for voter turnout. Mr. McCain's cross-country journey today begins in Tampa, Fla., and includes rallies in Blountville, Tenn.; Pittsburgh; Indianapolis; Roswell, N.M., and Henderson, Nev., before concluding in the city of Prescott in his home state of Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Republican underdog courted votes in the Philadelphia suburbs and in Scranton, yesterday, Sen. Barack Obama was concentrating on the neighboring battleground of Ohio, where he was cheered by supporters in Columbus before joining singer Bruce Springsteen for a massive outdoor rally in Cleveland. Mr. Obama's final day today is somewhat less ambitious, with rallies in Jacksonville, Fla.; Charlotte, N.C., and Manassas, Va. Then he will return to his home in Chicago to await the results. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traveling here this morning, Mr. McCain will cross paths with Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who again will ask the voters of a state that supported her in its April primary to turn out for her rival for the Democratic nomination. Details of Mrs. Clinton's planned appearance here were unavailable last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former President Bill Clinton will also barnstorm the state today. In addition to an appearance in Erie, he'll make two more stops hoping to rehabilitate the campaigns of two of the few vulnerable Democratic House incumbents in a year in which their party hopes for another big gains in Congress. The former president will stump for Rep. Paul Kanjorksi, D-Luzerne, and Rep. John Murtha, D-Johnstown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such high-profile appearances will dominate the television news. Less visibly, the campaign's get-out-the-vote operations, the focus of months of planning and groundwork, have shifted into their intense final sprints toward Election Day tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's concentration on Pennsylvania defies polling numbers showing Mr. Obama with a substantial, though somewhat reduced lead in a state that twice narrowly eluded grasp of President Bush. Sen. John Kerry edged Mr. Bush by 144,000 votes out of the nearly 5.7 million votes cast by Pennsylvanians four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, however, the Democratic registration edge in the state has nearly doubled with more than 500,000 new members of Mr. Obama's party, many signed up through the massive registration drive organized by his campaign. Democratic ranks grew by 13 percent while the number of officially Republican voters actually fell by 1 percent, or about 28,000 votes. Statewide, Democrats outnumber Republicans by roughly 1.2 million, double their margin of just a year, ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, while recent polling numbers continue to favor the Democrat, they show some evidence that Mr. McCain's focus on the state has allowed him to gain ground. Earlier last month, the daily tracking poll conduced by Muhlenberg College had consistently shown Mr. Obama with a double-digit lead; now Mr. McCain has moved to within six or seven points of his rival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They really have gone all out here, and to some degree it has helped move the dial,&quot; said Chris Borick, the director of the Muhlenberg survey. In the latest Muhlenberg tracking poll, Mr. Obama had the support of 52 percent of the voters surveyed compared with 46 percent for Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Borick noted that despite some increase in Mr. McCain's support, Mr. Obama's standing in the state has remained steadily above 50 percent for weeks. Mr. Borick said that while Mr. McCain had gained some ground in the state's northeast and southwest, he appeared to have less traction in trying to overtake Mr. Obama's stronger position in the crucial Philadelphia suburbs and the adjacent Lehigh Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tomorrow's results will be a partial measure of the value of personal campaigning, just as it will test the true effectiveness of the vaunted Obama ground game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans are trying to counter the apparent Democratic logistical advantage with an extensive wave of robocalls bombarding Pennsylvania and other battleground states. As both Clintons campaign in the state, one of the Republican messages capitalizes on the long Democratic primary fight with a passage from Mrs. Clinton in which, while making the case that she would be a better Democratic nominee, she favorably compared Mr. McCain's experience to Mr. Obama's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator McCain will bring a lifetime of experience to the campaign and Senator Obama will bring a speech that he gave in 2002,&quot; the recording says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the call, Mrs. Clinton's office issued a statement that said: &quot;Sen. Hillary Clinton does not approve this message, and as she criss-crosses the country, she has said time and again that the choice in this election could not be more clear. The McCain/Palin ticket offers only more of the same failed policies while the Obama/Biden ticket offers the vision, leadership and positive solutions we need. I wonder why the Republicans aren't using those words?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's rally today will be in a hangar at Atlantic Aviation, 300 Horizon Drive, in Moon. Doors to the event open at 10:45 a.m., but Mr. McCain is not expected to appear until some time after that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates will get one more crack at a national audience tonight -- and one with a disproportionate representation of Western Pennsylvanians -- when they both will appear in interviews at halftime of the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game between the Steelers and the Washington Redskins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his get-out-the-vote bid in Ohio yesterday, Mr. Obama took particular delight in taking note of the endorsement that Mr. McCain received Saturday from Vice President Dick Cheney, an endorsement that quickly became the subject of an Obama television commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Mr. Obama: &quot;[Mr. Cheney] knows that with John McCain you get a twofer: George Bush's economic policy and Dick Cheney's foreign policy -- but that's a risk we cannot afford to take. It's time for change, and that's why I'm running for president of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats have a slight lead in Ohio, which was the deciding state in 2004. No Republican presidential candidate in history has prevailed without it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an appearance yesterday on CNN, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said Mr. McCain might win Pennsylvania if some of this state's residents who have told pollsters they'll vote for Mr. Obama vote for Mr. McCain instead. Mr. Specter said that such behavior, if it happens, would not be evidence of the so-called &quot;Bradley effect,&quot; in which blacks running against whites have sometimes done worse on Election Day than in late polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I don't like the Bradley effect categorization and I don't like the suggestion of racism,&quot; Mr. Specter said. &quot;People are just different on polling and voting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Facts have taken a beating in Campaign '08.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each in his own way, John McCain and Barack Obama have produced enduring myths, amplified by their running mates and supporters. When a non-licensed plumber who owes back taxes and would get a tax cut under Obama is held out by McCain as a stand-in for average working Americans who should vote Republican, you know truth-telling is taking a back seat to myth-making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has clung tenaciously to many of his distortions throughout the campaign, yielding on a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has taken a different tack when he is called on his misstatements. Although perhaps too late to really set the record straight, he's edged closer to the facts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You might need a microscope to tell the difference, but slight variations in a pitch or accusation can make all the difference between bogus and real.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama saddled McCain with a bum rap when he accused the Republican of wanting a 100-year war in Iraq back in the spring. Finally he relented and said McCain sees U.S. troops being in Iraq for 100 years. That's closer to right - as a peacekeeping force like the one in South Korea. But McCain might be long associated with war without end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama accused McCain of wanting to privatize Social Security, which he doesn't. Now he accuses McCain of wanting to privatize &quot;part&quot; of Social Security, which he does, as one option that younger workers could choose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, McCain has blithely carried on with a variety of discredited claims, abetted by a running mate whose exuberance is not at all dimmed by contrary evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin repeated her boast that she declared &quot;thanks but no thanks for that bridge to nowhere&quot; long after it became clear she had said no such thing - neither in words nor in essence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's down-to-the-wire accusation that Obama &quot;will raise your taxes&quot; contradicts Obama's tax-cut proposals for all but wealthy Americans. His dark warnings that Obama will fine small businesses that do not provide health insurance goes against a plan by the Democrat that exempts small businesses from paying for coverage. In fact, Obama would give them money to help them offer insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the realm of exaggeration and misrepresentation, omission plays a large part, too, in denying voters important information on what the next president will do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither candidate has owned up to the budget crunch that is certain to crimp their promises, send the country far deeper into debt, or both. Obama's assertion that his cost savings more than pay for his programs, and McCain's statement that he'll freeze most government spending and balance the budget in four years, are not believed outside their campaigns and circles of allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the myths:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OIL SLICKNESS:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much,&quot; McCain says, again and again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a seriously inflated figure cited by McCain for the value of U.S. oil imports from countries hostile to America. In fact, the government says the U.S. spent less than half that sum on crude oil and refined petroleum projects from foreign sources last year, and most were from friendly countries such as Canada, Mexico and Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama upped the stakes when he used the figure, boiling the vast web of oil and debt transactions down to two countries: &quot;Nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia,&quot; he said. &quot;It's mortgaging our children's future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEALTH CARE HORRORS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It only takes McCain and Palin a few words to bend Obama's health care plan out of recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain tells supporters he &quot;won't fine small businesses and families with children, as Senator Obama proposes, to force them into a new, huge, government-run health care program, while I keep the cost of the fine a secret until I hit you with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin talks about Obama's &quot;universal government-run program&quot; and adds: &quot;I don't think it's going to be real pleasing for Americans to consider health care being taken over by the Feds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's plan doesn't fine small businesses. It doesn't force families with children, or anyone, into government-run health care. And the Feds wouldn't be taking over the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between them, McCain and Palin got one part of it half right: Obama has not said how much he would fine larger companies if they do not meet his requirement to offer health insurance or pay into a kitty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's health plan is distorted, in turn, by Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your health care benefits will get taxed for the first time in history,&quot; Obama warns voters in attacking it. He often leads voters to think that's the full story. Hardly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, in exchange for proposing to tax the value of health benefits provided by employers, would offer a tax credit to help people buy insurance. That tax benefit - $5,000 for a family - gives people much more than the new taxation takes away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over time, the tax credit could lose value as premiums rise faster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's not an argument the Democratic ticket has chosen to make, in speeches, debates and relentless advertising. Running mate Joe Biden mischaracterized the new taxation as the largest middle-class tax increase in history, ignoring the credits in a rhetorical exercise that would flunk Accounting 101.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THAT DARNED BRIDGE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Palin ran for governor, she indicated her support for a proposal to build a nearly $400 million bridge from Ketchikan, Alaska, to an island with 50 residents and an airport. She was, at times, wishy-washy about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that doesn't make for a compelling line against government waste on the stump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So her stance became: &quot;I told the Congress 'thanks but no thanks' for that Bridge to Nowhere.&quot; And a campaign ad declared she &quot;stopped the Bridge to Nowhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, during her governor's campaign, she vowed to defend Southeast Alaska &quot;when proposals are on the table like the bridge, and not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project or any other into something that's so negative.&quot; At the time, the chief &quot;spinmeister&quot; against the project was McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As governor, she abandoned the bridge after Washington pulled the money from it, letting the federal dollars be used for other projects in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September, her transportation department completed a $25 million gravel road to nowhere. Officials went ahead with the road, which would have led to the bridge, even though it has no purpose other than for foot races, hunting vehicles and possible future development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUILT BY ASSOCIATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Ayers, a University of Illinois education professor and former member of the radical Weather Underground, was front and center in Republican claims that Obama was &quot;palling around with terrorists,&quot; as Palin put it. Ayers had a meet-the-candidate event in his home for Obama early in the Democrat's political career. The two served on the board of the Woods Fund. And they live in the same neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Palin stretched the extent of that relationship to link Obama with shadowy figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond that, they falsely implied that Ayers used the occasion of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to wish even greater harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't care about an old washed-up terrorist and his wife, who still, at least on Sept. 11, 2001, said he still wanted to bomb more,&quot; McCain told a rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This distortion originated in Hillary Rodham Clinton's playbook during the primaries, when she criticized Obama for the same relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayers, Clinton said, made comments &quot;which were deeply hurtful to people in New York and, I would hope, to every American, because they were published on 9/11, and he said that he was just sorry they hadn't done more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By coincidence, The New York Times published a story on the day of the attacks about Ayers and what he called his fictionalized memoirs. The story was based on an interview he had done earlier, in Chicago, in which he declared, &quot;I don't regret setting bombs,&quot; and &quot;I feel we didn't do enough,&quot; even while seeming to dissociate himself coyly from the group's most destructive acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late in the campaign, McCain and Palin criticized Obama for attending a 2003 party for Rashid Khalidi, a Palestinian-American professor and critic of Israel. But McCain is also linked Khalidi. The professor was a founder of the Center for Palestine Research and Studies, which received $448,000 from an organization McCain chairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FUZZY NUMBERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-$4 billion: &quot;John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion&quot; in tax breaks, Obama told McCain in a debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, McCain supports a cut in income taxes for all corporations, and doesn't single out any one industry for that benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-$2,500: That's how much Obama says his health care plan will bring down costs for a family of four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's plan does not lower premiums by $2,500, or any set amount. Obama hopes that by spending $50 billion over five years on electronic medical records and by improving access to proven disease management programs, among other steps, consumers will end up saving money. He uses an optimistic analysis to suggest cost reductions in national health care spending could amount to the equivalent of $2,500 for a family of four over time. Even if savings that large are achieved - economists are highly skeptical - not every dollar is bound to be passed on to consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-94: That's how many times McCain and Palin say that Obama has voted for tax increases or not to support a tax cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This inflated count includes repetitive votes as well as votes to cut taxes for the middle class while raising them on the rich. An analysis by factcheck.org found that 23 of the votes were for measures that would have produced no tax increase at all, seven were in favor of measures that would have lowered taxes for many, 11 would have increased taxes on only those making more than $1 million a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-$882 billion: &quot;Senator McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare - $882 billion worth,&quot; Obama said. Obama ads claim McCain would cut benefits by 22 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's plan proposes neither. He wants to save money the same way Obama wants to - by making programs such as Medicare more efficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's claim misrepresents what a McCain adviser said in a Wall Street Journal story and adds distorted analysis from a partisan think tank to come up with something that goes against what McCain says he would do - protect promised benefits from being cut.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Obama's fist bump. Palin's lipstick. McCain's plumber. Clinton's tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've been through a lot in the two-year slog that will be remembered as Campaign 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of it was temporarily fascinating. And at the same time utterly forgettable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What will endure? What will fade faster than a campaign promise? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answers depend, in part, on who wins Tuesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Barack Obama becomes president, he and Michelle may soon be fist-bumping on the White House portico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If John McCain pulls out a victory, Tina Fey's spot-on send-up of GOP running mate Sarah Palin could well be &quot;the iconic image of the 2008 election,&quot; says Robert Thompson, a professor of pop culture at Syracuse University. Even if McCain loses, the Fey factor may well have some legs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does it say that, in the end, one of the most enduring images of the campaign may be a comic's schtick about a vice presidential candidate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, so much of what we've talked about, blogged about, analyzed and dissected is fading from memory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember the minitempest over Obama's lipstick-on-a-pig comment, and whether it was a subterranean insult to Palin? Or Hillary Rodham Clinton's gripping account of her arrival in Bosnia under sniper fire, which never happened? Or McCain's&nbsp;ad lumping Obama with Britney Spears and Paris Hilton as just another celebrity? Or the video of John Edwards carefully coifing his hair, set to the music of &quot;I Feel Pretty?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're just getting started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was Obama's Jay-Z moment when he brushed off his shoulders, giving a visual brush-off to his critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Joe Biden's putdown of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani's speeches as nothing more than &quot;a noun, a verb and 9/11.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was Palin's eye-popping announcement during the Republican convention that her unwed teenage daughter was pregnant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And will.i.am's viral Internet paean to Obama, &quot;Yes We Can,&quot; featuring celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and John Legend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was Clinton's doomsday ad claiming she was best equipped for the 3 a.m. phone call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And McCain's Web ad mocking Obama as &quot;The One.&quot; (Complete with images of Charlton Heston as Moses parting the Red Sea.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was Obama dancing his way onto the set of &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show.&quot; (McCain did &quot;Ellen,&quot; too, but he didn't dance.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And McCain planting himself on the couch with the ladies of &quot;The View.&quot; (Obama did &quot;The View,&quot; too.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was the Republican convention chant of &quot;drill, baby, drill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Democrats' rejoinder of &quot;jobs, baby, jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama had Obama Girl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain had Joe the Plumber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember Clinton choking up in New Hampshire about what was at stake in the race, and later declaring that was when she'd &quot;found her voice?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or Biden waxing on about President Roosevelt's TV presence during the 1929 stock market crash - when FDR wasn't president and there wasn't any television?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or martial arts star Chuck Norris barnstorming for Mike Huckabee?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike who?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Thompson offers an apt oxymoron for it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were temporarily iconic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You betcha. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What will endure?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's address on race, way back in March, could well stand the test of time, regardless of whether the Democrat wins or loses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When his campaign was thrown off-stride by his former pastor's incendiary remarks about race, Obama faced the issue head-on and spoke to the frustrations of Americans of all races: &quot;The anger is real. It is powerful, and to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots, only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Months later, the 84,000 people who filled Denver's Invesco Field to see Obama become the first black American to accept a major party nomination for president were a sight to be remembered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For McCain, my friends, his most memorable moment may well have come far earlier, when he found redemption in the snows of New Hampshire after losing the Iowa caucuses. His candidacy had been written off not much earlier as essentially dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Dezenhall, a public relations expert, nominates a different telling moment for McCain, from the town-hall-style debate in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was sort of wandering around in the back as Obama was speaking,&quot; Dezenhall said. &quot;You have this old guy who just doesn't know what to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victor's path to the presidency will be well chronicled in future history books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The losers' treks, no matter how compelling, will get lesser treatment. Except, perhaps, for Obama's historic journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all of the intensity of Clinton's quest to become the first woman president, from the dramatic high of her New Hampshire comeback to her excruciatingly long exit from the race, and all of the drama and silliness in between, says Thompson, &quot;ask any 18-year-old freshman entering college five years from now about any of those things and I will be very surprised if any of them can tell you anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Democratic victories forecast in New Jersey in the presidential and U.S. Senate races, party leaders hope to make gains farther down the ballot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state's seven Democrats in the U.S. House appear to be safe Tuesday, but polls show close races for two of the six Republican seats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic winds also are blowing through county and local races, with party officials aiming to pick up municipal seats from Mount Laurel in Burlington County to Pitman in Gloucester County.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Being a Republican this year is just awful,&quot; said Bill Layton, the Burlington County Republican chairman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, he said he was confident his candidates could break the trend - as they did in past years when Republicans lost statewide races in New Jersey but won local races. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most closely watched contests is for retiring Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Saxton's seat in the Third Congressional District, which covers Cherry Hill and runs through Burlington and Ocean Counties. The race between Republican Chris Myers, the Medford mayor, and State Sen. John Adler (D., Camden) is considered a dead heat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conservative Freedom's Watch has run negative television ads about Adler, and President Bush visited to raise $65,000 for Myers. Democrats targeted the district early last year, believing the demographics had changed in their favor. National Democrats have helped Adler with political strategy, fund-raising and advertising. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In central New Jersey, Assemblywoman Linda Stender (D., Union) is running against State Sen. Leonard Lance (R., Hunterdon) in another close race for a longtime Republican seat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, Democrats in Shore districts from Cape May to northern Ocean County are giving longtime GOP U.S. Reps. Frank LoBiondo and Christopher Smith vigorous challenges. Although analysts expect both to hold their seats, their Democratic opponents are weakening the castle walls for future battles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the top of the ballot, polls predict double-digit victories in the state for Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama over Republican John McCain, and Democratic U.S. Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg over Republican Richard Zimmer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though well-respected in the House in the 1990s, Zimmer, 64, has been badly underfunded and unable to break through to voters, according to polls, in this race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Zimmer is a quality candidate but doesn't have a shot because the headwinds are so bad for Republicans this year,&quot; Fairleigh Dickinson University political scientist Dan Cassino said. &quot;While I don't think anyone's terribly enthusiastic about Frank Lautenberg, I don't think he's done anything so awful that people want to kick him out.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First elected in 1982, Lautenberg has made transportation a niche issue. He has fought to fund Amtrak, and is known for banning smoking on commercial airlines' domestic flights. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was the only senator to be challenged in a primary this year, handily defeating U.S. Rep. Robert E. Andrews of Camden County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrews based much of his campaign on the age of Lautenberg, who is 84. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmer said his race would be about effectiveness, not age. In his only cable-television ad, he hammered on the point and backhandedly raised the age issue. He used an adolescent skateboarder to play a smug Lautenberg, who nonchalantly apologized for being ineffective and asked for six more years to make good on promises made in the 1980s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a time-honored incumbent strategy aimed at keeping the challenger's profile as low as possible, Lautenberg ignored Zimmer on the trail and in his media campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in the House, Zimmer wrote the national Megan's Law, which informs residents when a sexual predator moves into their neighborhood. In the Legislature, he wrote farmland-preservation legislation credited with saving thousands of acres of open space. A social moderate, Zimmer is a tough fiscal conservative who has promised to whack earmarks from the federal budget - even pork destined for New Jersey. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lautenberg spent much of the general election in Washington working on the energy and economic crises. When he did come home, he spent most of his time in North Jersey. He agreed to a single televised debate, and has not spent money on television advertising. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee paid for the ad that viewers in the New York and Philadelphia markets have seen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farther down the ballot, voters in Burlington, Gloucester and Camden Counties are being asked to elect freeholders, and Burlington is having a special election for county clerk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans in Gloucester County think they will be helped by the highly publicized ethics and corruption investigations into the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. The university fired Democratic Freeholder Warren Wallace after the FBI raided his office in 2006. Wallace has not been charged criminally, but a federal monitor criticized his handling of a contract and for spending work time on freeholder business. Wallace has denied any wrongdoing, and Democrats expect him to be reelected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gloucester County Democrats are hoping to pick up seats in Pitman and Elk Township, while Republicans think they can pick up seats in Monroe and Franklin Townships. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Burlington County, towns to watch Tuesday are Mount Laurel, where Democrats hope to pick up seats, and Moorestown, where Republicans hope to take back control. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With more than 500,000 newly registered voters in New Jersey this year, election officials are expecting long lines at the polls, which will open at 6 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not simply that this is an important election. It's that people know it is. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facing two unending wars, a sky-is-falling economy, and unabated enmity from all corners of the world, Americans are having little trouble connecting their individual lives to the larger, heaving whole. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, they understand that they will be participating in a potentially transformational vote that could reshape health care, energy policy, the economy, national security - and possibly elect an African American man to the highest office in the land. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters in the Philadelphia region are energized - on edge, even - and paying attention, having viewed candidate debates and commercials in record numbers.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're also swelling voter rolls, with 492,307 newly registered voters in Pennsylvania since the primary, Democrats outnumbering Republicans more than 2-1. In New Jersey, 489,056 new voters have registered.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People of both parties promised pollsters they'd turn out in unprecedented numbers on Tuesday - awake, aware, and cognizant of the moment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Famously poor at remembering their history, Americans seem determined this week to make history. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just wish my mom and grandmother were alive to see this,&quot; said retired teacher Ernestine Rouse, 82, standing at a Germantown bus stop. &quot;An African American, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">qualified</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African American, making it this far.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That same seriousness of purpose was very much in evidence at the Cosi restaurant in Bryn Mawr, where CNN is the only network that manager Mike Zepp, 23, allows on the television. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We watch it always because this will be a life-changing election,&quot; he said. &quot;Utterly life-changing.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His customers, both those who back John McCain and those who support Barack Obama, agreed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I find myself reading more about the candidates than I did in any other election,&quot; said Yvonne Lalime, 53, of Malvern. &quot;I'll be making more of an educated than emotional decision, because it's so important. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a change in America. More people are getting involved.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, said Lalime's lunch companion, Marian Ciaccia, 54, of Broomall, who declared American voter apathy a thing of the past. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a different type of focus people have,&quot; Ciaccia said, breaking off part of a cookie. &quot;People are taking issues seriously this time. . . . I think it's the wars that impact it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both women said they would vote for McCain. Lalime said her son works for the Republican's campaign in Virginia and sends the family long e-mails on the need for a war hero in the White House during perilous times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two tables over, Tim Phelan, 42, of Bryn Mawr, was nodding, saying McCain's his man as well. Recently laid off from a financial firm, Phelan said Americans understood there was a lot on the line this election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see an energy around this election, although I'm not sure if it's positive, negative, or just nervous,&quot; Phelan said. &quot;It's the issues, it's the candidates, it's the world backdrop.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sipping soup with a BlackBerry nearby, 21-year-old Kasey Krutski, a Temple University School of Pharmacy student, said this would be her first presidential election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economy is compelling her and her friends to participate in democracy this week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Democrats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After graduation, I'll be out in this economy, and that's scary,&quot; Krutski said. &quot;So many young people will be getting involved and voting for Obama, for his passion.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting a few blocks away in the reading room at Bryn Mawr's Ludington Library, Mary Pat Otte, 54, wants her vote for Obama to &quot;send a message to Washington, D.C., that you have to be responsive to the needs and wishes of the American public.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Wall Street in turmoil, her husband, who works for a hedge fund, gave up an apartment in New York to commute far more cheaply from home on the Main Line instead. Her family also gave up vacations this year.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was worried about the country and its direction before the economy went in the tank,&quot; she said. &quot;The U.S. is in decline. Our economy is sliding, and in the eyes of the rest of the world we're no longer a leader.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weariness of President Bush is helping energize voters - from both parties.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New Jersey, working the counter of Legends Gourmet Pizza &amp; Salads in Burlington City, Elizabeth Petnicki, 19, worried that her generation would carry the burden of the $700 billion rescue package. And she's disillusioned with the war in Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she'd vote for McCain, who visited Burlington County College, where she's a student. He has the experience, she said, and knows how to fight a war. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know a lot of people that are in Iraq, and I want them to come home.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Charles Cosme, awaiting a bus on Burlington City's Broad Street, said he'd pick Obama to solve the same concerns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sick and tired of Republicans wasting [billions] on Iraq when this country is suffering,&quot; said Cosme, 31, who lost his job as a groundskeeper for a cemetery and has started to get his food from the local food bank.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election, he said, will &quot;affect my life big-time.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That notion echoed across the river and up in Mount Airy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This election means everything to me,&quot; boomed college sophomore Christopher Gaddie, on a break from work in front of InFusion Coffee &amp; Tea, where he's a barista. &quot;It means whether we're going to continue being a messed-up country, or get on the right track in favor of progress.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gaddie, 21, who was laid off last month from a second job, at an art store, rattled off his list of worries. Chief among them: his inability to get a scholarship at Temple's Tyler School of Art because of the tanking economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He still lives at his parents' Mount Airy home because he can't afford an apartment, and next semester, he'll have to switch his school status from full- to part-time, delaying his graduation date. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Working-class people need a break,&quot; he said, adding that he'd be voting for Obama to bring about that break. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some, such as Philadelphia lawyer Michael Coard, fear that rather than making history, this election could be a disturbing repeat of the past.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, many votes of black folks and poor folks were stolen in the last two federal elections,&quot; Coard warned in e-mails he sent out to educate African Americans about their voting rights. &quot;And the very same voter thieves are conspiring to do the very same thing again.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ida Middleton, 79, who on Thursday was settling in to play pinochle at Germantown's Center in the Park, was confident that would not happen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, the retired seamstress said, history is being made. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have a lot of people involved - especially young people and especially the other people,&quot; Middleton said with a wink, referring to white voters. &quot;We've never had this many people voting for a black man. It's surprising me every day.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the frantic, final days, the long and captivating 2008 presidential campaign has gone back to basics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Republican John McCain, that means reiterating that he is an experienced leader, tested in crisis, who advocates the low-tax economic approach best able to spur a recovery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Barack Obama counters that his own agenda embodies the change sought by a worried nation and that his rival offers only a continuation of the failed policies of President Bush. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all that has happened during the last year and more, after all the petty controversies, endless television commercials, and high-stakes debates, this is the choice facing the voters on Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With two days left, all the available signs - including the public-opinion polls, the early-voting numbers, and the official statistics confirming that the economy is contracting - seem to be pointing to an Obama presidential victory, the first in American history by a person of color.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's strategists are so confident of their position that they have started running commercials in such core GOP states as Georgia, North Dakota, and McCain's home of Arizona. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The die is being cast as we speak,&quot; Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, told reporters on Friday, referring to the early voting. &quot;We have a lot of work to do, but we like where we are.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His counterpart in the McCain campaign, Rick Davis, predicted a stirring, come-from-behind victory for a candidate who has been counted out before. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The one thing that's clear,&quot; Davis said, &quot;is that we've established some momentum.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the most telling sign about the race at this point is that the campaigns are focusing primarily on states won by President Bush in 2004. Among them are Ohio, Florida, Indiana, Missouri and Virginia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means that Obama, safely ahead in nearly all the Democratic states, has the chance to win by a decisive margin - and that everything must break right for McCain if he is to piece together the necessary 270 electoral votes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only major blue state being contested is Pennsylvania, which the Democrats carried in the last four presidential elections. McCain was in Perkasie, Bucks County, yesterday, was to be in Wallingford and Scranton today, and plans a stop in Pittsburgh tomorrow. Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph R. Biden Jr. is scheduled to be in South Philadelphia tomorrow night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, much will depend on who turns out and in what numbers. Bill McInturff, McCain's pollster, said he expected as many as 135 million votes to be cast, which would be up 10 percent from 2004. Plouffe said turnout would be even higher. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One lingering concern for Obama supporters is that their candidate might fall victim to the so-called Bradley effect, named after Tom Bradley, a former mayor of Los Angeles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1982, Bradley, an African American Democrat, lost the race for governor of California to a white Republican after leading in the final polls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The explanation then was that some white voters who opposed Bradley for racial reasons had lied to pollsters rather than voice socially inappropriate views. And in other elections during the 1980s, including some Philadelphia mayoral races, black candidates fared worse on Election Day than in the polls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there has been no recent evidence of the Bradley phenomenon, which some analysts say might have been overblown in the first place. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no hidden vote against former U.S. Rep. Harold Ford Jr., a black Democrat, during his defeat by a white Republican in a racially charged 2006 Tennessee Senate race. The same was true for Obama in this year's Democratic primaries, except the one in New Hampshire. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if there is a hidden racial vote against him Tuesday, his campaign expects to be able to offset it through high black turnout and a field organization ready to turn out every Obama vote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Election Night, the nation won't have to wait long to find out whether the polls were right this time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the states with an early, 7 p.m. closing time are Virginia and Indiana, two Republican states where Obama has made a huge effort. If he puts both in his column early in the night, the national outcome should no longer be in doubt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this campaign, the great imponderable is how different things might have been had the financial crisis not exploded when it did. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sept. 15, the morning that America woke up to the collapse of Lehman Bros. and the takeover of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., McCain had a roughly 2-point lead in the polls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That morning, McCain declared that the fundamentals of the economy were strong. Hours later, he said that there was a crisis and that government was to blame. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At various times in the next 10 days, he called for creation of a blue-ribbon commission, asked for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said he would suspend his campaign until Congress came up with a rescue plan, then unsuspended it with no rescue plan in place. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Sept. 26, the day of the first debate, Obama, whose responses to the economy had been more measured, was up 4 points. Three weeks later, after the last debate, he was ahead by 7. The numbers haven't moved much since. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In these closing days, the final arguments from the candidates have had a strong negative component.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said McCain: &quot;The question is whether [Obama] is a man who has what it takes to protect America from Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda, and other grave threats in the world. And he has given you no reason to answer in the affirmative.&quot; A McCain&nbsp;commercial called Obama &quot;dangerously unprepared.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Obama: &quot;If you want to know where Sen. McCain will drive this economy, just look in the rearview mirror.&quot; He talked about lost jobs and about falling incomes and home values during the closing months of the Bush administration. &quot;You've got to ask yourself: . . . Why would we keep on driving down this dead-end street?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The direction that voters wish to take will be known after the polls close Tuesday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the man chosen to be the 44th president of the United States will have to start figuring out how to deal with the problems he has been talking about the last two years.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What to Watch for Tuesday </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indiana and Virginia. Polls there close early, at 7 p.m. Those states will give an early indication of what's happening. Both have gone Republican since 1964 but are in play this year. If Barack Obama wins either one, he's in very good shape. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ohio. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Closing time is 7:30 p.m. Ohio has voted with the winner in the last 11 elections, and no Republican ever has won the White House without it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Pennsylvania. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls close at 8 p.m. John McCain has worked this state as hard as any in the country, viewing it as the key to his electoral strategy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Exit polls. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The television networks might be a little cautious in using them in states with early voting. Exit polls reflect only the sentiments of individuals voting on Election Day; in some states, 40 percent of the vote will have been cast earlier. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">West Coast.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unless the race </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is a blowout for Obama, the Democratic candidate won't be able to get to the needed 270 electoral votes without California, where the polls close at 11 p.m. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">A long night. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">A McCain victory, if it happens, figures to be narrow. It won't happen by network projections. It will take counting all of the votes, into the wee hours. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To carry Pennsylvania on Tuesday, Republican John McCain needs a couple of big things to go right, as well as most of the little ones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He must get overwhelming support from his party's rural base and siphon away working-class Democrats in the Pennsylvania rust belt. Barack Obama's expected big vote in Philadelphia and its suburbs must underwhelm. And rain in the eastern part of the state wouldn't hurt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a lot of pressure: With options on the electoral map dwindling in the final days, Pennsylvania has become central to McCain's hope of winning the White House. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To use a baseball analogy, I think McCain has got to almost throw a perfect game to win Pennsylvania,&quot; said Christopher Borick, a pollster and professor at Muhlenberg College. &quot;I think he can close it, make it a more competitive race, but to win, everything would have to break his way.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP strategists and leaders say they believe Democrat Obama's support is soft in the state, which has favorable demographics for McCain - an older and whiter population than the national average, and regions with socially conservative working-class Democrats who have backed Republicans in the past. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, Democrats have registered hundreds of thousands of new voters. Now there are 1.2 million more registered Democrats than Republicans, double the party's advantage in 2004, and the Obama campaign is confident it can get the new voters to the polls. McCain must hope that's not the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has led by double digits for more than a month in most public polls of the state, and his party enjoys a big lead in voter registration. McCain, analysts say, also carries the twin burdens of association with a deeply unpopular president and of history: Voters usually punish the nominee of the party in the White House when the economy sours. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some indications the Pennsylvania race is tightening, however, including a Mason-Dixon poll last week for NBC News in which Obama's lead, 47 percent to 43 percent, was within the margin of error of plus or minus 4 points. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is no runaway. It's going to surprise a lot of people,&quot; said GOP state chairman Robert Gleason, of Johnstown. He said party phone banks had identified more voters for McCain than they had for President Bush in 2004. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other battlegrounds - Missouri and Florida, for example - have been closer longer, but McCain has elevated Pennsylvania to strategic importance because his campaign is making a major push to capture a state that has been reliably Democratic in presidential elections for 20 years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pennsylvania is the Ohio of 2008,&quot; Democratic national chairman Howard Dean said last week. &quot;If we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole shooting match. McCain has chosen to make his last stand here.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since all the other most closely contested states were won by the GOP four years ago, McCain needs to pick up a Democratic blue state to assemble an Electoral College majority of 270 or more votes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's clear that Pennsylvania is a major target, based on the measures of advertising money and the most precious campaign resource of all: candidate time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spent at least $24.8 million on TV ads in Pennsylvania from April 3 through Monday, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks the cost and content of political advertising. (The figure includes spending during Obama's primary struggle with Hillary Rodham Clinton.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, McCain bought $20.9 million worth of time in Pennsylvania, the tracking firm said. Nationally, the Democrat has outspent him, 3-1, in ad money in recent weeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since he wrapped up the Republican nomination in early March, McCain has visited the state 30 times, holding 43 events. His running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, has stopped in 14 times, appearing at 23 events, since Aug. 30. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has visited the state nine times, holding 20 events, since he wrapped up the Democratic nod in June. Running mate Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware has had 14 events on seven visits to the state since Aug. 29. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the attention he has been giving it, McCain appears to have a narrow path to victory in Pennsylvania, analysts and Republican officials say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His strategy rests on running well on the traditional Republican turf in the rural center and northern tier of the state - the so-called T. McCain also hopes to pull away white working-class Democrats in the industrialized regions of southwestern and northeastern Pennsylvania. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Out west, there are a lot of values voters,&quot; said Gleason, the state chairman. &quot;Abortion is very important.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is expected to wallop McCain in Philadelphia, which usually provides the margins for statewide Democratic wins, and carry Allegheny County, home to Pittsburgh. But Republicans are confident they can carry some white ethnic wards in South Philadelphia, in Northeast Philadelphia, and along the Delaware River, dampening Obama's city vote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal is to do better than Bush did four years ago, when John Kerry carried the city by 412,106 votes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP officials believe they are getting traction with Obama's recent remark that he wanted to &quot;spread the wealth around,&quot; a comment made to an Ohio worker who asked about his pledge to raise taxes on the wealthy, including some small businesses, and cut them for lower-wage workers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellow members of the Polish American String Band are responding to the McCain critique that Obama can't be trusted on taxes, said GOP lawyer Brian Preski, who was chief of staff to former state House Speaker John M. Perzel (R., Phila.). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of those guys are union men . . . and even they say they are not for Obama,&quot; Preski said. &quot;It's not the black-and-white stuff you think you'd hear from guys from Port Richmond and South Philadelphia. The attitude is, 'Hey, I may be working as a cop now, but someday I may want to own a small business, and I don't want to be taxed into oblivion.' &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If everything else fails for McCain in Pennsylvania, he might want to hope for rain, maybe a sleet storm that stretches from Philadelphia and its suburbs through Allentown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study published last year in the Journal of Politics confirmed that precipitation on Election Day helps Republicans. After comparing returns and weather reports for every U.S. county in the 1948 through 2000 presidential elections, the researchers concluded that the GOP candidate gained 2.5 percentage points for every inch of rain or snow above normal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A really crappy nor'easter that keeps spinning around over half the state's population would be ideal,&quot; pollster Borick joked. &quot;When you're looking for things like that, it says you are in an uphill battle.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long-range Weather Channel forecast for Tuesday calls for high temperatures in the mid-60s and sunny skies - with a 10 percent chance of precipitation. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Simpsons&quot; is no longer the must-see-weekly cultural icon it once was, but even some infrequent viewers make a point of tuning in for the annual Halloween episode, &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; (8 tonight, WPGH). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's installment, number XIX, begins with political commentary more than political humor, something viewers started to see in these episodes a few years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Homer goes to the polls on Election Day 2008. At first he votes for John McCain on a touchscreen, then tries to change his vote to Barack Obama. The machine casts six votes for McCain instead before it eats Homer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This doesn't happen in America!&quot; Homer says. &quot;Maybe Ohio, but not America!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps it would be funnier if the scene didn't reference a very real concern. Viewers tune to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; to escape anxieties, not to be reminded of them. So it's a relief that the detour into real issues is short-lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next sketch is a gloss on &quot;Transformers&quot; that isn't all that funny. That's followed by the lackluster &quot;How to Get A-Head in Deadvertising&quot; about dead celebrities used in modern advertising. It begins with an amusing, spot-on Homer-centric spoof of the &quot;Mad Men&quot; opening credits and then devolves into a Homer killing spree. He takes out several modern, living celebrities (George Clooney, Prince, Neil Armstrong) so their images can be used in ad campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best sketch is saved for last: &quot;It's the Grand Pumpkin, Milhouse.&quot; No one believes Milhouse, who believes the Grand Pumpkin exists. So he makes a declaration of faith, borrowing from the Apostle's Creed of the Christian church: &quot;I believe in the Grand Pumpkin, almighty gourd, who was crustified over Pontius pie plate and ascended into oven. He will come again to judge the filling and the bread.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This sketch succeeds because it offers the most sly cultural commentary, including the Grand Pumpkin's offense when he's offered pumpkin seeds: &quot;You roast the unborn!?!&quot; The segment occupies the difficult-to-achieve middle ground of comedic commentary, a spot &quot;The Simpsons&quot; used to land in with much greater frequency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering the historic significance of the upcoming presidential election, the buttons, signs and pencils candidates are handing out to voters are pretty ho-hum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Mihaly, of Pine, knows his presidential campaign history. Over the last 40 years, he has collected more than 20,000 campaign pins and other memorabilia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Bill Clinton/Bob Dole/Ross Perot election of 1996 hit new levels of nastiness, Mr. Mihaly, 54, said the types of items candidates are handing out this year are typical, despite the election's sharp rhetoric. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, it's been pretty civil,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About the most interesting thing he's found so far was a button that says, &quot;Steelers Stands for Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To avoid arguments about politics, a topic he finds incredibly boring, Mr. Mihaly always says his favorite button is the one he most recently acquired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm surprisingly nonpolitical for a political collector,&quot; he said. &quot;I can't think of anything I would want to talk about less.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, it's the history of presidential campaigns that Mr. Mihaly finds so fascinating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidents have been marketing themselves since George Washington's day, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the 1896 election, Republican William McKinley and Democrat William Jennings Bryan both put out 3-inch bars of soap shaped like baby dolls. Tags on the dolls say, &quot;Tell your dad to vote for ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women couldn't vote then, Mr. Mihaly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mihaly was 10 when his father bought a few campaign buttons at a garage sale, thinking his children would find them interesting. From there a hobby was born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to running the occasional classified ad asking for pins and other memorabilia, Mr. Mihaly, who works in finance and customer service, has a network of friends and relatives who are always on the lookout for something he might want.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also collects items himself by visiting local political headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For as large as his current collection is, people are often surprised how little space it takes up, he said. Most of the pieces are in small display cases that can be stacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has no intention of letting the collection take over his house mainly because, he said with a chuckle, &quot;My wife wouldn't permit it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strangest piece in his collection is a rubber shower head shaped like Richard Nixon's head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess you remove your metal shower head and put that one on and then water comes out of his mouth,&quot; Mr. Mihaly said. &quot;I don't know that I would want to look up in the shower and see Richard Nixon staring at me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest item he's collected so far is a huge banner from the 1940 election between Wendell Willkie and Franklin D. Roosevelt. It's the type of banner that would have hung from the ceiling at Willkie's campaign headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His smallest item is a button from the 1908 Taft/Roosevelt election that is about half-inch in diameter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he's an expert on the memorabilia, Mr. Mihaly has become a keen observer of what campaigns mean philosophically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest difference between old and more recent campaigns is the degree to which candidates' histories are laid bare. Every mistake, every slip of the tongue, everything someone has done is right there for everyone to see, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Historically, your past was off limits,&quot; Mr. Mihaly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The messages candidates tout from town to town are pretty much the same, he said. Mudslinging and the distortion of each other's records has been going on since the country's beginning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the upcoming election, Mr. Mihaly sees Mr. McCain's message as &quot;experience,&quot; while Mr. Obama is highlighting &quot;change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's vice presidential running mate Sarah Palin's message has been, &quot;I'm one of you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Palin's joke about lipstick being the difference between a pit bull and a hockey mom has perhaps produced the most potentially confusing campaign button to date, Mr. Mihaly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The button's picture, predictably: a pit bull wearing lipstick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fifty years from now, people will look at that button and wonder, 'what is that all about?' &quot; Mr. Mihaly said, laughing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, he has collected about 40 pieces of memorabilia from this election and he'll continue collecting as long as it remains fun. He said he doesn't know what will become of his collection, but a button a friend made for him probably predicts his fate fairly well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says, &quot;The person who dies with the most buttons wins,&quot; Mr. Mihaly said, laughing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign has collected a record-shattering $640 million, but only two of his staff members are among the 15 highest-paid workers in the general election, according to campaign finance records. The rest, including the three highest paid, are employed by Sen. John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign, despite having more than 700 field offices across the country, compared with fewer than 400 for Mr. McCain, has spent slightly less on rent than its counterpart. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And even though Mr. Obama has raised $400 million more than Mr. McCain, he has spent less on fundraising consultants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has devoted enormous sums in this election to nearly everything, including more than $280 million for advertising and $31 million for the payroll. His half-hour prime-time commercial on Wednesday, which cost more than $3 million, was perhaps the most visible flexing of his financial muscle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Obama campaign, under the watchful eye of its manager, David Plouffe, has worked hard to maintain a reputation for frugality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign has escaped the glare that has come with spending excesses that dogged other candidates, including the millions that Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton handed to her pollster, Mark Penn; John Edwards' $400 haircuts, and the large outlays for consultants and other expenses that nearly bankrupted Mr. McCain's primary campaign last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's both extravagant and frugal at the same time,&quot; Joe Trippi, a former top adviser to Mr. Edwards and the manager of Howard Dean's campaign in 2004, said about Mr. Obama's operation. &quot;Extravagant in its mission and ambition but frugal in how they implemented it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign officials pointed to steps they have taken to save money, a challenge made urgent after the campaign's implosion last year. But the campaign has also had far less to work with, constrained by the $84 million given to it for the general election under the public financing system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having opted out of public financing, Mr. Obama has spent far more than the combined total spent by President Bush and Sen. John F. Kerry in 2004, according to Federal Election Commission records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign's gaping advantage is sharpest in its advertising budget and payroll. In the wek of Oct. 19 to 25, the Obama campaign spent nearly twice as much as Mr. McCain and the Republican National Committee on television advertising. Mr. Obama's payroll had nearly 800 employees in the first half of October, twice as many as Mr. McCain's, with far more Obama-paid workers in closely contested states than McCain-paid workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, a review of FEC records shows that the Obama campaign has used several methods to keep expenses down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns have relied heavily on volunteers. The Obama campaign has increased its ranks beyond salaried employees who receive regular paychecks and benefits by enlisting hundreds of local per diem workers for get-out-the-vote efforts. The Obama campaign has made $3.2 million in per diem payments, many no more than a few hundred dollars and most often made for brief periods during the Democratic primaries. The McCain campaign has reported relatively few per diem expenditures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike its Republican counterpart, the Obama campaign has frequently used a provision in campaign finance law that allows supporters to donate work space for the campaign. It has credited more than 250 people with making in-kind rent contributions totaling $210,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, campaign finance data shows that the Obama campaign has indulged in its share of luxuries. It has spent more than $5 million on renting arenas and other places for Mr. Obama's vast campaign events. Obama campaign officials also appear to have devoted significantly more than Mr. McCain's organization to polling, about $3.8 million since July, compared with just over $1.1 million for the McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign spent more than $57,000 at the Four Seasons in Amman, Jordan, during the candidate's overseas trip in July, although a spokesman said that much of that was for rooms for the traveling press corps and that the campaign would be reimbursed by the news organizations. The campaign spent about $60,000 on the staging for Mr. Obama's speech in Berlin on that trip. Then there is the $140,000 that the campaign has spent at companies that make American flags, apparently mostly for campaign events, compared with just $7,000 spent by the McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these seem to be more the exception than the rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three highest-paid staff members in the presidential campaign since July, when the general election campaign began in earnest, were Mark Salter, Mr. McCain's speech writer; Robert DeServi, who produces the campaign's events; and Trey Walker, who manages Mr. McCain's campaign in the mid-Atlantic region. The highest-paid Obama staff member was Julianna Smoot, his finance director. (The best-compensated people in campaigns frequently are consultants.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign's rules for limiting expenses are strict. Workers at the Chicago headquarters are reimbursed for trips to the airport only if they take public transportation. Staff members on the road receive a $30 per diem for meals, compared with $40 for members of the McCain campaign. In the primaries, the Obama campaign required workers to drive if they were going somewhere less than a five-hour drive away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though the budget was large,&quot; Mr. Plouffe said, &quot;because of the aggressiveness of the strategy, you really have to watch every dollar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media consultants have typically received some of the biggest paydays from presidential campaigns, earning 6 percent to 7 percent of the total advertising purchases by Democrats in the last several elections. The Republicans saved money in 2004 by paying flat fees to their media strategists. Democratic campaigns, including Mr. Obama's, began clamping down as well in this election, capping the fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They've been at it for nearly two years. Now, the hours left in their epic campaign have dwindled to two digits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain and Barack Obama are using them to criss-cross the country making their final arguments to voters, who have been the targets of the longest, most expensive and, arguably, the most unpredictable campaign in American history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican McCain vowed that that unpredictability would continue through Tuesday with a historic upset, defying polls and circumstances that allowed his opponent, while warning against complacency, to suggest that he feels &quot;a righteous wind&quot; at his back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In pursuit of another Dewey-Defeats-Truman moment, Mr. McCain continued to focus on Pennsylvania while continuing to play defense in a slew of normally Republican states where he appeared to be trailing the freshman senator from Illinois. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reflecting the confidence of the Democratic campaign, Mr. Obama was spending his increasingly scarce campaign time in states that President Bush won four years ago, pressing home his argument that his opponent, while calling himself a maverick, offers little more than an extension of the Bush administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning in Virginia, one of the Bush states in which Mr. Obama's polling has topped 50 percent, Mr. McCain tried to raise doubts about his opponent by seizing on the Democrat's observation the previous day in Iowa, that his breakout victory in the state's caucuses had vindicated his faith in America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My country has never had to prove anything to me, my friends,&quot; Mr. McCain said. &quot;I've always had faith in it and I've been humbled and honored to serve it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokesman Bill Burton released a statement blistering the Republican's comparison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's pathetic that John McCain would take a statement Barack Obama has been making for a year about his faith in the American people and distort it to attack his patriotism,'' Mr. Burton said. &quot;Sadly, this is what we've come to expect from a desperate, dishonorable campaign.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b&gt; Red states targeted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">/b&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Virginia Mr. McCain headed to a rally in Bucks County outside Philadelphia. After a detour to New York City for an appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; the GOP nominee planned to return to the state today for appearances in Scranton and Delaware County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bucks and Delaware county stops would continue his focus on the vote-rich and once reliably Republican Philadelphia suburbs that have trended Democratic over the last decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican hopes to boost his southwestern Pennsylvania turnout tomorrow with yet another appearance at an airport hanger in Moon, less than a mile from the site of a similar appearance earlier this month at Robert Morris University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic vice presidential nominee, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., was to be in Philadelphia tomorrow night, but as of yesterday, Mr. Obama had no plans to return to a state in which he has enjoyed a strong polling lead for months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's decision to forgo 11th-hour campaigning in the state could be seen as a sign of his campaign's confidence in his standing here. But the Obama forces continued to pour dollars into the state's television markets and were embarked on a last-minute get-out-the-vote drive that Gov. Rendell has described as unprecedented in the state's political history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While several surveys in the last week did show some narrowing in his margin here, an aggregate of results compiled by the Web site pollster.com continued to show Mr. Obama with a nine-point Pennsylvania advantage and with his average poll number above 50 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign remained intent on overcoming those odds, however, to balance the likelihood that his opponent would capture other states that contributed to Mr. Bush's 2004 total of 286 electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If, for example, Mr. Obama were to capture New Mexico, Colorado and Iowa -- all states in which the Democrat is now leading -- Pennsylvania would be a vital counterweight to their combined Electoral College total of 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama appeared in Colorado, Nevada and Missouri yesterday, all states won by Mr. Bush four years ago. At a stop in Colorado, he took as a rhetorical gift a statement from Vice President Dick Cheney, who in a rare campaign appearance in Montana praised the Republican nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earlier today, Dick Cheney came out of his undisclosed location and hit the campaign trail,'' Mr. Obama reported. &quot;He said that he is, and I quote, 'delighted to support John McCain.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to congratulate Sen. McCain on this endorsement because he really earned it,&quot; Mr. Obama added, according to the prepared text e-mailed by his campaign. &quot;That endorsement didn't come easy. Sen. McCain had to vote 90 percent of the time with George Bush and Dick Cheney to get it. He served as Washington's biggest cheerleader for going to war in Iraq, and supports economic policies that are no different from the last eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain spoke to cheering crowds, their ground troops began the final drive to mobilize their voters. In this potentially crucial area, the amply funded Obama campaign is acknowledged even by most Republicans to hold an advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the primaries and caucuses, the Illinois senator's campaign established a track record of voter registration and get-out-the-vote logistics perhaps unprecedented in modern campaigns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their only rival for that accolade may have been the Bush-Cheney effort in 2004. In a conference call with reporters Friday, Republican aides maintained that their rate of voter contacts was actually ahead of the pace that the GOP campaign recorded four years ago, but in numbers of offices, paid staff and volunteers, their logistical push appeared to be dwarfed by the Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b&gt; Early voting records</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">/b&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls have also consistently found a Democratic advantage in the proportions of McCain and Obama supporters who say they are enthused about their candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some combination of enthusiasm and fieldwork appeared to be evident in the strong, in some places, record rates of early voting occurring in the 32 states that allow no-excuse voting before the traditional Election Day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one knows the tally so far, but the party affiliations recorded, and the demographic backgrounds of early voters found in polling, led the Democratic campaign to suggest that Mr. Obama would go into Tuesday with a substantial head start in crucial swing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a call with reporters, David Plouffe, the Obama campaign manager, maintained that to overcome the early votes already banked, Mr. McCain would need to win significantly more than 50 percent of Tuesday's ballots to achieve overall majorities in many early voting states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a memo widely distributed Friday, McCain campaign manager Rick Davis, disputed that analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The facts undermine their argument,'' he said. &quot;In our analysis of early voting and absentee votes to date: The composition of the electorate has not changed significantly and most folks who have voted early are high-propensity voters who would have voted regardless of the high interest in this campaign.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a call to reporters Friday, and in a recent memo from its pollster, Bill McInturff, the McCain campaign cited progress in its national numbers. But one neutral polling expert saw a more static picture continuing to favor the Democrat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not surprisingly, yesterday was another heavy day of new poll releases: 37 new statewide surveys and 10 national releases,&quot; Mark Blumenthal wrote in a weekend analysis on the web site pollster.com &quot;Yet these surveys indicate no clear trends and leave our bottom line electoral vote count unchanged. McCain does a little better on some polls and on some of our statewide trend estimates, Obama does a little better on others. The net result -- for today at least -- looks mostly like random noise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday's new national poll releases, however, provided no good news to those looking for a late shift to Mr. McCain. Mr. Obama's margin on our national trend estimate clicked up slightly yesterday (to +6.0) for the first time in a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b&gt; Keystone State flooding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">/b&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's planned airport rally Monday will be roughly his 20th appearance in Pennsylvania since the spring, far more than his rival's total. Mr. Obama has made two appearances in the state since the final presidential debate. Mr. McCain and his running mate have practically camped out here. Pennsylvania has also been consistently near the top of the McCain list for television advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wisconsin Advertising Project, which tracks media spending across the country, reported that from Oct. 21 to Oct. 28, the McCain campaign, along with coordinated GOP spending accounted for roughly $1.39 million on Pennsylvania television, just a shade behind its spending in Florida. The Obama campaign, however, poured $2.7 million into the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall in those seven days, the Democratic campaign outspends its rival by a margin of about 3-to-2 on television. Florida spending provided a prime example of the financial edge Mr. Obama reaped by opting out of the federal financing system. There, while, the McCain forces were spending $1.4 million, the Democrat poured in $4.6 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the face of the Obama ground game, Republicans continued to try to exploit Democratic fissures remaining from a drawn-out primary in which Mr. Obama was beaten by Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton by nearly 10 points. In one mail piece, the GOP featured a picture of Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton smiling together and trying to associate the Republican &quot;as the father of three daughters'' with Mrs. Clinton's &quot;18 million cracks in the glass ceiling.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, the Republican State Committee announced that they would sponsor television ads reminding voters of Mr. Obama's association with his former pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright. A state committee official said the ad would air on &quot;network television,'' but did not release any details on the extent of their buy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While frequently raising questions about other Obama associations, notably the former Weather Underground figure, William Ayers, Mr. McCain's own campaign has avoided mention of the sometimes-incendiary remarks of the Rev. Wright. In the spring, Mr. McCain had urged North Carolina GOP officials to pull a similar ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to comment on the state committee's plans yesterday, McCain spokesman Paul Feldman said, &quot;John McCain's position with respect to Reverend Wright is clear. He is not the referee of every political ad in this election.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- A usually elusive 60-40 Senate majority is the Democrats' target in Tuesday's election. They are certain to make gains even if they fall short of those magic numbers needed to break Republican chokeholds on their agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Senate candidates will benefit from any coattail effect a big victory by Sen. Barack Obama might bring, as well as from the already weak economy and an unpopular war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Math also favors Democratic Senate candidates this year. With 35 of the Senate's 100 seats on the ballot Tuesday, Democrats have fewer at risk than do Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After picking up six seats in the 2006 midterm elections to wrest control from Republicans, Democrats have the barest of Senate majorities -- 51 seats under their control, including two occupied by independents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they are overwhelmingly favored to pick up GOP-held seats in Virginia, New Mexico and Colorado, three states where Republican senators are retiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And many Republican incumbents running for re-election are in difficult races. Included in that group is Ted Stevens of Alaska, the longest-serving Republican senator in history, who was convicted last week on seven corruption counts. He's high on the list of top Democratic pickup opportunities, even though Alaska has long been a solid Republican state. Mr. Stevens spurned pleas by Sen. John McCain and party leaders to step aside rather than stay in the race against Democratic challenger Mark Begich, the mayor of Anchorage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on the list of endangered Republicans: Sens. Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina; John Sununu of New Hampshire; Norm Coleman of Minnesota; Gordon Smith of Oregon; Saxby Chambliss of Georgia; Roger Wicker of Mississippi and possibly even Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Democratic-held seats appear in jeopardy, and just one Democratic senator, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, faces a serious challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have spent heavily in Louisiana, and felt that the GOP's candidate, state Treasurer John Kennedy, was within reach. But recent polls suggest otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Democrats are taking full advantage of the Obama campaign's organizing skills and registration drives, especially in battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've worked hand in glove with the Obama campaign,&quot; said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., chairman of the National Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to a filibuster-proof majority, &quot;It's hard to get to that 60 and I don't want to oversell it,&quot; Mr. Schumer said. &quot;But I do think we're going to pick up a large number of seats and that's going to make Democrats very happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a mirror reflection of that optimism, Republicans are glum. Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, says there's no question that the top of the ticket is affecting Senate races, along with the financial crisis. &quot;It's a fairly toxic atmosphere out there&quot; for Republicans, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He acknowledged that Democrats could still exercise firm control by just coming close to the 60 votes: &quot;I think if the Democrats get to 57 or 58 seats, on a lot of issues they will be able to override a Senate filibuster, because they seem to be able to pick off a few Republicans on a lot of the particular issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shifting political landscape is no more dramatic than in the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In North Carolina, Mrs. Dole -- who served in both the Nixon and Reagan administrations and is the wife of 1996 GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole -- looked at first like a safe bet in her bid for a second term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But revelations that she has spent little time in North Carolina in the past year have allowed Democratic newcomer Kay Hagan, a state senator with financial backing from national Democrats, to make the race one of the nation's most competitive. A late-in-the-race Dole ad suggesting her rival has ties to an atheist group may have backfired. Ms. Hagan, who is a Presbyterian Sunday school teacher, took offense and threatened to go to court for a &quot;cease-and-desist&quot; order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In next-door Virginia, another red state won by Mr. Bush in 2000 and 2004, Mr. Obama has made an aggressive effort and is leading in recent polls. Former Democratic Gov. Mark Warner, a Senate candidate, has a commanding lead in polls over another former Virginia governor, Republican Jim Gilmore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Georgia, incumbent Mr. Chambliss, the Republican, looked like another sure winner. But he's being forced into a tight race by Democrat Jim Martin, a former state representative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What changed? A heavy Obama organizing campaign in the state, as in the rest of the South, has resulted in the registration of hundreds of thousands of new voters. In addition, Mr. Chambliss angered conservatives by voting for the $700 billion financial bailout bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Chambliss appears slightly ahead, a spirited challenge from a third-party candidate could throw the election to a high-profile Dec. 2 runoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This race looks quite interesting in a way that it didn't a month ago,&quot; said Merle Black, an Emory University political science professor who specializes in southern politics. If the race is forced into a runoff, &quot;Georgia will be the center of the political universe for about a month,&quot; Black said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b&gt; Other close races:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">/b&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Mississippi, where Mr. Wicker, the appointed GOP incumbent, is holding a slim lead to fill the remaining four years of the retired Trent Lott's term. Former Democratic Gov. Ronnie Musgrove is making the race more competitive than first anticipated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Kentucky, where Mr. McConnell, the GOP Senate leader, is being heavily targeted by national Democrats. Although Mr. McConnell is favored to hold the seat, the Democratic pressure has kept him in his home state instead of helping other GOP candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Minnesota, where Democrat Al Franken, the former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; writer and actor, appears to have pulled ahead of Republican Sen. Norm Coleman in a closely fought contest. In a recent development, a Texas businessman claimed in a lawsuit that he was forced by a political benefactor of Mr. Coleman to funnel $75,000 to an insurance company that employs Mr. Coleman's wife. Mr. Coleman on Friday denied the allegation as &quot;false and defamatory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospects that Mr. Obama might win the White House and Democrats gain an effective filibuster-proof majority is not lost on the nation's business community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has poured $30 million into an issue-ads campaign arguing against what it considers would be an antibusiness Congress under a Senate firmly controlled by Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that with a Democratic president, the focus on the Senate becomes even more pronounced, because the Senate will really be the arbiter of the final outcome of legislation,&quot; said Bill Miller, the chamber's political director.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1053 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain-Palin campaign strategists who put all their eggs in Pennsylvania's basket would do well to remember &quot;Arab arms dealer&quot; Adnan Khashoggi. Who?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me explain by recalling a time 17 years ago when the American dream appeared to have collapsed for a wide swath of workers in the nation's industrial economy, when The Philadelphia Inquirer garnered national attention for its investigative economic series &quot;What Went Wrong&quot; and a different war against Iraq led by a different George Bush really did end up accomplishing its mission in a few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the spring of 1991 my then-boss Gov. Robert P. Casey appointed Pennsylvania Secretary of Labor and Industry Harris Wofford to the vacant U.S. Senate seat created by the untimely death of moderate Republican John Heinz. Mr. Wofford was largely unknown to Pennsylvanians, despite having been an aide to John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., his leadership in the civil rights movement and in helping to found the Peace Corps, and his former presidency of Bryn Mawr College. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talk about an uphill climb, Mr. Wofford's Republican opponent was to be U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, a two-term former governor and a man long-known as a reform-minded, Western Pennsylvania moderate with an impressive resume of public service. But like the first President Bush, Mr. Thornburgh had adopted some of his party's Reagan revolution &quot;government is the problem&quot; rhetoric that did not seem responsive to the challenges many Pennsylvanians were facing in lost jobs and skyrocketing health care costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The polls before Labor Day showed Mr. Thornburgh leading Mr. Wofford by a crushing 44 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then as now, the cost and availability of health insurance provided a dramatic barometer of the economic insecurity felt by so many in the middle class. Many people rightly remember Mr. Wofford's campaign for his simple but compelling idea, first suggested to him by a doctor in Philadelphia, that if the U.S. Constitution provides those accused of a crime with a right to a lawyer, then every American ought to a have a right to a doctor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then as now, the incumbent party responded by raising the specter of &quot;government-run socialized medicine.&quot; But as the weeks of October brought a continued Wofford surge for changing the status quo in Washington, the Thornburgh campaign also tried something that has become a familiar Republican tactic: stoking fears of Middle East terror through guilt-by-association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They launched a TV ad misleadingly suggesting that Mr. Wofford had accepted campaign contributions from Adnan Khashoggi, a high-profile Saudi arms merchant who had been implicated in the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages scandal. (The claim was based on the slender reed of a story from decades earlier when Bryn Mawr College had considered a donation that was never made for an academic program from a foundation Mr. Khashoggi funded.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like McCain's team of Karl Rove proteges today, the Thornburgh campaign probably had polling data showing that such an extreme claim would have traction with enough Pennsylvania voters to make a difference. But then as now, the poll and focus-group-tested attack lines proved less effective when delivered in the context of the wider reality in which most likely voters actually live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, as a 65-year-old white man with a long resume in government -- albeit one with a liberal past that even included an arrest during a peaceful demonstration at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago -- Mr. Wofford was not likely to be as vulnerable to such attacks as a freshman senator with an African father and an Arabic middle name. And however much the Middle East was a major international concern in 1991, that was a full decade before America itself was attacked with thousands killed in our own great cities and a field in rural Pennsylvania. Effective or not, back then such claims didn't push the same emotional buttons as they do now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, the McCain camp believes that the Ayers/Khalidi/terrorist/Muslim/anti-American/socialist messages will drive down Pennsylvania support that would otherwise go to the Democratic ticket this year. They can point with hope to John Kerry's surprisingly anemic Pennsylvania victory in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the lesson of the 1991 &quot;Wofford Wave&quot; suggests that the attack approach ultimately will not work in a troubled economic environment. In fact, changes in the state over the past two decades make it even less likely to do so now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that earlier moment when voters demanded change, Mr. Wofford won a surprisingly large share of the Philadelphia suburbs that had long been a reliable source of Republican votes. Since then, as in other such areas of the northeast United States, an increasingly ideological brand of Republicanism and demographic shifts have made these suburbs perform increasingly Democratic. As recent news reports have pointed out, the Democratic registration edge statewide is now up to 1.2 million voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Powell's recent rebuke of the McCain-Palin ticket is reflective of the more moderate Republicans and independents who are typical of the growing Philadelphia suburbs. And two years ago Bob Casey Jr.'s double-digit trouncing of Sen. Rick Santorum showed that an energetic anti-government &quot;movement conservative&quot; message of the kind Gov. Sarah Palin delivers is not what most Pennsylvanians are looking for in a time of economic dislocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in October 1991 we made light of the desperate attacks on Mr. Wofford's patriotism, decorating our campaign vans with ironic &quot;Khashoggi Caravan&quot; signs for the final swing across the state. And Mr. Wofford kept surging to a remarkable 10-point landslide victory over the more familiar and widely respected Mr. Thornburgh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama and his team can hardly afford such levity about some of the more disturbing messages that the McCain-Palin campaign has been relentlessly sending at this insecure time for so many Americans. The national media has certainly focused on the fact that some socially conservative Democratic voters in southwestern Pennsylvania may even believe them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if history is any guide, chances are that on Election Day, in what has become the Republican ticket's ultimate battleground, the powerful tide Harris Wofford rode 17 years ago will again make Pennsylvania the &quot;keystone in the Democratic arch.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Could the polls be wrong?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain and his allies say that they are. The country, they say, could be headed to a 2008 version of the famous 1948 upset election, with Mr. McCain in the role of Harry S. Truman and Sen. Barack Obama as Thomas E. Dewey, lulled into overconfidence by inaccurate polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe it is a very close race, and something that is frankly very winnable,&quot; Sarah Simmons, director of strategy for the McCain campaign, said last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few analysts outside the McCain campaign appear to share this view. And pollsters this time around will not make the mistake that the Gallup organization made 40 years ago -- ending their polling more than a week before the election and missing a last-minute surge in support for Truman. Every day brings dozens of new state and national presidential polls, a trend that is expected to continue right up to Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, there appears to be an undercurrent of worry among some polling professionals and academics. One reason is the wide variation in Obama leads: Just Tuesday, an array of polls showed the Democrat winning by as little as two points and as much as 15 points. The latest Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll showed the race holding steady, with Mr. Obama enjoying a lead of 52 percent to 45 percent among likely voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some in the McCain camp also argue that the polls showing the largest leads for Mr. Obama make the mistaken assumption that turnout among young voters and blacks will be disproportionately high. The campaign is banking on a good turnout among GOP partisans, who officials say have been energized by this year's election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have been wondering for weeks&quot; whether the polls are accurately gauging the state of the race, said Steven Schier, a political scientist at Carleton College in Minnesota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Borrowing from lingo popularized by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Mr. Schier asked what are the &quot;unknown unknowns&quot; about polling this year: For instance, is the sizable cohort of people who don't respond to pollsters more Republican-leaning this year, perhaps because they don't want to admit to a pollster that they are not supporting the &quot;voguish&quot; Mr. Obama?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If so, that could mean the polls are routinely understating Mr. McCain's support. &quot;I have no evidence that this is happening, Mr. Schier said, but &quot;I'm still thinking there's a 25 percent chance that this is a squeaker race and McCain pulls it out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other experts are less uncertain. Ruy Teixeira, a political demographer at the Center for American Progress and the Century Foundation, said averaging the daily polls points to &quot;pretty much the same thing -- that the race is pretty stable and that Obama has a stable lead. Typically, when you are this far ahead at this point, it's hard to lose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very unlikely that we are going to get surprised by a last-minute movement,&quot; said John Petrocik, chairman of the political science department at the University of Missouri. &quot;Obama has been running six to eight points ahead for the better part of two weeks, and it's hard to imagine that turning around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most pollsters do not subscribe to another notion advanced by poll skeptics -- that a &quot;Bradley effect&quot; results in an underestimation of the opposition to black candidates among white voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign's case that the race is closer than many polls suggest appears to rest largely on the proposition that the composition of the electorate this year will closely resemble the electorate in 2004. That year saw both major-party campaigns energize voters, resulting in an unusually high turnout that will be difficult to improve upon this year, they said, despite the excitement generated by the Obama campaign among young voters and African Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just think there was a lot of assumption that the electorate was going to have a lot more new voters&quot; who will vote disproportionately Democratic this year, said Ed Goes, a GOP pollster who has consulted with the McCain campaign. &quot;It just hasn't made sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain team points to results reported Tuesday by the Gallup organization, whose daily tracking poll showed Mr. Obama up 49 percent to 47 percent using Gallup's traditional turnout model, which assumes that turnout will follow the patterns of past elections. Mr. Obama has a larger lead, seven points, using a model that assumes a higher presence of first-time voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Pew Research Center poll released Tuesday that shows a 15-point lead for Mr. Obama is based on relaxed criteria for when to consider a black respondent a likely voter, said Andrew Kohut, president of the center. He said the poll assumes that roughly 12 percent of the electorate this year will be black, compared with 9 percent in 2004, with a similar increase among younger voters. Mr. Kohut defended this approach, saying there are historically high levels of interest in this contest among both demographic groups. At the same time, he added, &quot;We've consistently shown less enthusiasm and engagement among Republicans than is typical, and the composition of the electorate shows that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kohut said there are still several variables that signal Mr. Obama has not closed the deal, such as a large number of respondents in the Pew poll who see the Illinois Democrat as a risky choice. But Mr. Kohut said the odds are against &quot;a huge shift&quot; in voter preferences by Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some polls show Mr. Obama with a healthy lead even without an assumed upsurge in African American and young voters. Mr. Obama's seven-point lead in the Washington Post-ABC News poll is not premised on disproportionately higher turnout among those demographic groups. The poll's turnout model assumes that 10 percent of likely voters will be black, compared with the 11 percent who voted in 2004, according to the network exit poll. Voters younger than 30 make up 16 percent of the Post-ABC sample, little different from the 17 percent four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Post polling director Jon Cohen said the survey designers &quot;carefully consider a range of likely voter scenarios and use our best judgment. Our polling throughout the campaign has been on target and, we believe, helpful to understanding what is really happening. I hope it stays that way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One potential pitfall,&quot; Mr. Cohen said, is that The Post and ABC conduct interviews with a random selection of those who have only cellular phone service alongside a traditional random sample of those with residential phone service. One recent criticism of current polling has been that it does not accurately capture the sentiments of those who primarily use cellphones.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With less than two days before the election, some have had their fill of political advertisements, phone calls, literature, and e-mails, and some locals can't get enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final push for the vote -- from prerecorded phone messages to literature in the mail to the intent to have presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain speak during halftime of Monday Night Football tomorrow, proves the election is everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Danville News in Virginia, Melvin W. Ryan Sr. stated in an editorial that he is sick of reading letters promoting the Democratic candidates, especially Barack Obama, as the savior of our once great nation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andy Keller stated in an editorial at dailypress.net on October 16, &quot;I'm a political junkie of sorts, and yet here we are less than three weeks away from the biggest election of my lifetime and I'm sick of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Chambersburg, it's no different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tate Campbell said he has been getting a lot of phone calls, but understands the election is important. &quot;I like the commercials,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erik Rodeheaver said he knows the election is very important, but is ready to find out who will be the next president. &quot;I'll be happy when it's over,&quot; he said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol Collum of Asheville, N.C. said the political phone calls are a freedom of speech and that is important because many countries do not have free speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annie Bingaman, student at Wilson College and Chambersburg High School, said she is not sick of the political ads, but is beginning to get sick of the phone calls. &quot;The phone calls are kind of redundant,&quot; she said. &quot;I think the campaigns seemed to start really early this year,&quot; she said. She said she enjoys the news coverage of the candidates because there is always new information coming out about them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can never really know too much about a candidate,&quot; first-time voter Kyle Culbertson, Chambersburg, said. &quot;I want to get information about the candidates up until the day I am going to vote.&quot; He said he does not get tired of seeing or hearing the political ads. Culbertson is very excited to vote for the first time and he thinks that is one of the reasons why he is not sick of hearing about the election. It's also a monumental election in his mind because a black man and a woman are running for main offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to make a knowledgeable decision on who you are going to vote for,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel McGehee said he wishes there would be more particulars from the candidates, especially from Barack Obama, not just his words. He said he has only received one campaign phone call and it was from the Obama campaign, but he said he has received a lot of literature. He does not watch the political commercials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the same thing over and over.&quot; He also mentioned that he wishes they would bring back the Lincoln-Douglas debates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leigh Huss has a game plan when it comes to the political phone calls. &quot;I don't answer the phone until I know who is calling,&quot; he said. He said he waits for the caller to leave a message and hear who is talking before picking up the phone. &quot;We have gotten a few political messages on the answering machine, but they are easily erasable,&quot; he said. He also agreed with McGehee that the messages on television don't tell you anything important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been following the election very closely,&quot; Tony Stoops, Chambersburg, said. &quot;I'm not sick of the amount of coverage, I am sick of the distortions that both sides present about the other candidate.&quot; He said the tone of the election bothers him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam Henry, Chambersburg, said he does not like either of the presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The advertisements are getting old,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days before Election Day, John McCain and Barack Obama are playing on each other's turf, with McCain dashing through Democratic states where he trails and Obama showing his strength in one that voted Republican in the last two presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show Obama leading nationally and in several key states that could decide the election, including Virginia, Colorado and Pennsylvania. The Obama campaign is seeking to expand the playing field even further, perhaps setting the stage for an electoral landslide. But McCain's advisers note that the Arizona senator has come from behind before. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year ago, McCain's campaign appeared all but dead before came rebounded to win the New Hampshire primary en route to a Super Tuesday landslide that essentially won him the GOP nomination. On Sunday, McCain's advisers predicted another come-from-behind victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John's a closer. He always has been,&quot; former Sen. Fred Thompson said on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; &quot;He often is given up for dead literally and politically. People have been wrong about him before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the election has yet to be decided,&quot; Thompson added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Wallingford, Pa., Sunday, McCain declared to a cheering crowd: &quot;Two days. Two days to victory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said Pennsylvania will be the most important state to watch Tuesday. It is one of two states won by Democrat John Kerry in 2004 where McCain is still competing. The other is New Hampshire. McCain is visiting both Sunday, as well as Florida. Polls show Obama leading in New Hampshire while Florida is a tossup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was spending Sunday in Ohio, a traditional battleground that went for the Republican presidential candidate in 2004 and 2000. His events included an appearance in Cleveland with rocker Bruce Springsteen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said Sunday that the Democrat has expanded the electoral map by aggressively campaigning in traditional Republican states like Virginia, Colorado and Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We did not want to wake up on the morning of Nov. 4 waiting for one state. We wanted a lot of different ways to win this election,&quot; Plouffe said on &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here we find ourselves two days out from the election with a lot of different ways to get to 270 electoral votes,&quot; Plouffe said. &quot;We do not have to pull an inside straight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be elected, candidates must win 50 percent plus one of the 538 electoral votes awarded to states based on population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain saw the weekend as a final opportunity to persuade voters to prove the polls and pundits wrong and sweep him into office. He made a quick trip to New York City to appear on NBC's &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; where he joked about his latest plan to win over voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought I might try a strategy called the reverse maverick. That's where I'd do whatever anybody tells me,&quot; McCain said. If that failed, he quipped, &quot;I'd go to the double maverick. I'd just go totally berserk and freak everybody out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men appealed to supporters to turn out on Election Day, saying the stakes could scarcely be higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you give me your vote on Tuesday, we won't just win this election together, we will change this country and change the world,&quot; Obama said Saturday in a nationwide Democratic radio address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice President Dick Cheney endorsed McCain, saying Americans &quot;cannot afford the high tax liberalism of Barack Obama and Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, in Colorado, pounced, saying McCain had earned the endorsement by supporting the Bush administration's failed social and economic policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early Sunday, Obama's campaign released a new, 30-second television ad with that message. An announcer says McCain earned Cheney's support by voting with the White House 90 percent of the time. &quot;That's not the change we need,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign responded by highlighting the issues on which McCain disagreed with the administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Associated Press-Yahoo News poll of likely voters showed Obama ahead nationally, 51 percent to 43 percent, outside the margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. McCain's campaign faults the public surveys, and says its internal polls show the race tightening.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBUS Ohio</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama and John McCain uncorked massive get-out-the-vote operations in more than a dozen battleground states Sunday, millions of telephone calls, mailings and door-knockings in a frenzied, fitting climax to a record-shattering $1 billion campaign. Together, they'll spend about $8 per presidential vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Go vote right now,&quot; Obama urged from the Ohio Statehouse steps, reminding people of a nearby polling location where they could cast ballots by sunset. &quot;Do not delay because we have work to do.&quot; A show of hands found most in the crowd already had. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With just two days to go, most national polls show Obama ahead of McCain. State surveys suggest the Democrat's path to the requisite 270 electoral votes and perhaps far beyond is much easier to navigate than McCain's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show the six closest states are Florida, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Nevada and Ohio. All were won by Bush and made competitive by Obama's record-shattering fundraising. The campaigns also are running aggressive ground games elsewhere, including Iowa, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Colorado and Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All that's left now for the candidates is make sure people vote Tuesday if they haven't already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Election Day is becoming a misnomer. About 27 million absentee and early votes were cast in 30 states as of Saturday night, more than ever. Democrats outnumbered Republicans in pre-Election Day voting in key states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That has Democrats and even some Republicans privately questioning whether McCain can overtake Obama, even if GOP loyalists turn out in droves on Tuesday. Obama may already have too big of a head start in critical states like Nevada and Iowa, which Bush won four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is off the charts in some of these states,&quot; said Michael P. McDonald, a political scientist at George Mason University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the campaign closes, voters were being inundated with a crush of television ads and automated phone calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new TV ad, Obama highlighted Vice President Dick Cheney's support for McCain. The ad features Cheney, an extremely unpopular figure among the general public, at an event Saturday in Wyoming, saying: &quot;I'm delighted to support John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not to be outdone, the Republican National Committee rolled out battleground phone calls that include Hillary Rodham Clinton's criticism of Obama during the Democratic primary. She is heard saying: &quot;In the White House, there is no time for speeches and on-the-job training. Sen. McCain will bring a lifetime of experience to the campaign, and Sen. Obama will bring a speech that he gave in 2002.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and McCain campaigned on each other's turf Sunday. Obama was in Ohio, a bellwether state Bush won four years ago and where polls show Obama tied or winning. McCain visited Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, states won by Democrat John Kerry in 2004. He trails in both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been in a lot of campaigns. I know the momentum is there,&quot; McCain told supporters at a rally in Pennsylvania. Overall, polls show Obama winning or tied in more than a dozen or so states won by Bush while McCain trails in every Kerry state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and the RNC dramatically ramped up their spending in the campaign's final days and now are matching Obama&nbsp;ad for ad, if not exceeding him, in key battleground markets in states such as Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia and Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After months of planning, the Republican Party launched the last stage of its vaunted &quot;72-hour program,&quot; when volunteers descend on competitive states for the final stretch. Democrats unleashed their &quot;persuasion army&quot; of backers scouring their own backyards to encourage people to back Obama in the campaign's waning hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 10,000 Obama volunteers in Ohio were knocking on doors and planning to hit their one millionth home Sunday after a five-day push.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign reported that Saturday was its largest volunteer day, with more volunteers showing up to work the phones and walk neighborhood precincts than ever before in the campaign. Said Obama spokesman Bill Burton: &quot;Our volunteers are completely engaged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's crew says theirs are, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no doubt that we've got an uphill battle,&quot; said Rich Beeson, the RNC's political director. But, he said: &quot;I'm not going into Election Day with any trepidation that they've put any state away&quot; by banking early votes. &quot;We still have a lot of voters that we can and will turn out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RNC reported making 5.4 million voter contacts last week, compared with 1.9 million in the same week in 2004, and it says it's volume has steadily increased since October began. Overall, it says 26 million voters have been contacted by volunteers over four months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday alone, the RNC says an estimated 3 million voters were contacted by phone or in person, and it saw so many volunteers show up to help that in at least one state, Colorado, the party ran out of canvassing packets. Some 180,000 were gone by midday Saturday; more were printed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the hype, Republicans and Democrats alike acknowledge that turnout operations usually only are determinative in contests that are close; they're good for gaining a few percentage points at the most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain planned visits to media markets that hit battlegrounds Florida, Virginia, Indiana, New Mexico, and Nevada on Monday. A repeat trip to Pennsylvania also was slated before McCain returns home to Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was getting help Sunday from rocker Bruce Springsteen in Cleveland and also was hitting Ohio's two other largest cities, Columbus and Cincinnati. He plans visits to Florida, North Carolina and Virginia on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exuding confidence, Obama told reporters he would hold a news conference on Wednesday. Later, Obama spokeswoman Linda Douglass walked back Obama's plans, saying he'll meet the press before the end of the week, but &quot;don't count on Wednesday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liz Sidoti reported from Washington.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the final Sunday before Election Day, volunteers for both presidential candidates fanned out to churches in competitive states, congregations bused worshippers to polls to vote early and a battle of wills erupted in church parking lots over the distribution of political literature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking political messages to places of worship carries risks. Churches can lose their tax-exempt status if they take positions for or against a candidate directly or indirectly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials with both the John McCain and Barack Obama campaigns said their efforts are careful to keep churches out of trouble, but it's hard to know whether lines are crossed in such large-scale operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign recruited church members to pass out literature, take part in peer-to-peer phone banks and participate in the Republicans' final 72-hour get-out-the-vote machine that began Sunday, said Bob Heckman, the campaign's director of conservative outreach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 15,000 people volunteered, he said. On Sunday and the past two weekends, volunteers in 14 states who belong to Protestant megachurches, politically active conservative churches and Catholic parishes distributed literature at their churches comparing McCain and Obama on hot-button issues like abortion, gay marriage and judges. &quot;Who Shares Your Values?&quot; the flier says. &quot;You decide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flier also suggests that Obama wants to provide sex education for kindergartners a claim from a disputed McCain&nbsp;ad about a failed bill from Obama's days in the Illinois Legislature. Obama has said kindergartners, under the bill, would have been taught to defend themselves against sexual predators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heckman said the literature was given out &quot;where appropriate,&quot; including church meeting space, tables outside or car windshields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether volunteers were told to get permission from clergy or church staff, Heckman did not directly answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We only urge them to do whatever they think is appropriate or customary within their congregation,&quot; he said. &quot;The one thing we always do make clear is that if a church official would prefer we not distribute literature on church property, we respect their desires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One conservative Catholic political activist questioned the effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this were truly a national effort, the way it was in 2004, it might turn the election,&quot; said Deal Hudson, who helped marshal Catholic support for President Bush. &quot;But it's too targeted and targeted because of the lack of resources. The grassroots are there, but it's a really missed opportunity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Obama side, members of black churches in battleground states were asked to read what an aide described as a nonpartisan letter from the Illinois senator during church announcements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign officials declined to provide a copy of the letter or discuss it. But during the primary campaign, volunteers and staffers read a similar letter from Obama at black churches in South Carolina that didn't explicitly ask people to vote for him but highlighted issues and encouraged voter participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last two weekends in Florida, meanwhile, Democratic activists helped churches bus members to early-polling places after services. Pastors in conservative churches were encouraged to show a video from the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission, urging Christians to vote and highlighting &quot;faith, family, marriage and life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an annual exercise, activists descended Sunday on church parking lots with campaign literature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the largest efforts was orchestrated by the anti-abortion group Priests for Life, which produced what it calls a nonpartisan guide contrasting McCain and Obama's positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Frank Pavone, the group's national director, said volunteers avoid taking literature inside churches without permission and place fliers in parish parking lots unless they encounter resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops advises that Catholic organizations should not authorize the distribution of &quot;partisan campaign materials or biased voter education materials&quot; in private parking lots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Michael Watson of St. Andrew parish in Columbus, Ohio, said he encountered people placing material &quot;paid for by the Ohio Republican Party&quot; on windshields in the church lot in violation of a diocesan policy barring distribution of any political literature on church property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watson said in an e-mail the activists wouldn't follow the policy, so police officers assigned to traffic control and other duties at the parish &quot;responded to it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Pennsylvania, an anti-Obama flier from an anti-abortion political action committee also appeared at churches. The flier features images of men holding hands on a wedding cake and photos of what appears to be a dismembered baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To push back, the left-leaning group Catholics United dispatched staff and volunteers to six cities Sunday to alert church officials about unwelcome material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our position is it's a violation of the sacred space of the church to have political and especially partisan propaganda in this space,&quot; said Chris Korzen, the group's executive director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Korzen said another goal was to protect parishes' tax-exempt status. Pavone accused the group of partisan motivations and said fliers from outside groups don't endanger churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Tuttle, a professor of law and religion at George Washington University, said IRS regulations on politics deal only with conduct by churches. So leafletting by outside groups, announcements from Obama backers or McCain volunteers handing out pamphlets are not problematic for the IRS, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What you're really looking for is the church itself endorsing or supporting a particular candidate,&quot; Tuttle said. &quot;That would take someone acting on behalf of the church.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days before Election Day, John McCain and Barack Obama are playing on each other's turf, with McCain dashing through Democratic states where he trails and Obama showing his strength in one that voted Republican in the last two presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's advisers predicted a come-from-behind win Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John's a closer. He always has been,&quot; former Sen. Fred Thompson said on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; &quot;He often is given up for dead literally and politically. People have been wrong about him before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the election has yet to be decided,&quot; Thompson added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said Pennsylvania, which Democrat John Kerry won in 2004, will be the most important state to watch Tuesday. Polls show the state leaning toward Obama, as were New Hampshire and Florida. McCain was campaigning Sunday in all three states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and running mate Sarah Palin have focused on Pennsylvania in the final days of the campaign, hoping to flip it into their column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was spending Sunday in Ohio, a traditional battleground that went for the Republican presidential candidate in 2004 and 2000. His events included an appearance in Cleveland with rocker Bruce Springsteen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said Sunday that the Democrat has expanded the electoral map by aggressively campaigning in traditional Republican states like Virginia, Colorado and Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We did not want to wake up on the morning of Nov. 4 waiting for one state. We wanted a lot of different ways to win this election,&quot; Plouffe said on &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here we find ourselves two days out from the election with a lot of different ways to get to 270 electoral votes,&quot; Plouffe said. &quot;We do not have to pull an inside straight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be elected, candidates must win 50 percent plus one of the 538 electoral votes awarded to states based on population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain saw the weekend as a final opportunity to persuade voters to prove the polls and pundits wrong and sweep him into office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're a few points down but we're coming back,&quot; he told supporters in Virginia on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also made a quick trip to New York City to appear on NBC's &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; where he joked about his latest plan to win over voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought I might try a strategy called the reverse maverick. That's where I'd do whatever anybody tells me,&quot; McCain said. If that failed, he quipped, &quot;I'd go to the double maverick. I'd just go totally berserk and freak everybody out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men appealed to supporters to turn out on Election Day, saying the stakes could scarcely be higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you give me your vote on Tuesday, we won't just win this election together, we will change this country and change the world,&quot; Obama said Saturday in a nationwide Democratic radio address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice President Dick Cheney endorsed McCain, saying Americans &quot;cannot afford the high tax liberalism of Barack Obama and Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, in Colorado, pounced, saying McCain had earned the endorsement by supporting the Bush administration's failed social and economic policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early Sunday, Obama's campaign released a new, 30-second television ad with that message. An announcer says McCain earned Cheney's support by voting with the White House 90 percent of the time. &quot;That's not the change we need,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign responded by highlighting the issues on which McCain disagreed with the administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Associated Press-Yahoo News poll of likely voters showed Obama ahead nationally, 51 percent to 43 percent, outside the margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. McCain's campaign faults the public surveys, and says its internal polls show the race tightening.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this tumultuous time our country faces, many Americans have tunnel vision. They blindly believe that a man who was sworn into the United States Senate on Jan. 4, 2005, is capable and experienced enough to serve as the commander-in-chief of the United States of America. They feel Barack Obama is the &quot;change&quot; that this country needs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, when asked repeatedly what &quot;change&quot; Obama would bring to Washington his answer is ambiguous at best. His idea of &quot;change&quot; is to choose a running mate who has been on Capitol Hill since 1973. Obama repeatedly points out his opposition to the Iraq War. He indicates that he did not support the war but fails to point out that at the time when a vote was taken in Washington to go to war he was only a state senator in Illinois. We also hear little mention that his vice-presidential nominee did vote for the war in Iraq. These contradictions are only a drop in the bucket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little doubt that our government is viewed with animosity and skepticism in many parts of the world. However, this hatred for our American way of life began long before our current administration. Few do not remember where they were on Sept. 11, 2001. However, how many people remember where they were during the bombings on the USS Cole and the U.S embassies in Kenya and Tanzania?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notion that Obama would reduce the hatred toward our country is ignorant. As Sen. Hillary Clinton suggested in her TV ad this past spring, &quot;Who would you want to answer the phone at 3 a.m.?&quot; Certainly not Barack Obama!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need a strong leader who would not appease the Islamic fanatical groups and Iranian governments of the world. Obama has indicated he would be willing to sit down with these groups. This shift in policy is dangerous and promotes appeasement, which would not be in the best interest of our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is a pipe dream. Those foolish enough to vote for him, be wary for you reap what you sow. I do not wish to see another administration similar to that of Jimmy Carter in which Democrats controlled both House and Senate and brought us double-digit inflation, high interest rates, oil shortages, high unemployment and slow economic growth. If you are truly concerned and believe that this is a defining moment in our nation's history, then please join me in voting for Sen. John McCain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 9/11 we should have been a country on a solid road to unity, but instead we have been on a rocky road to nowhere because of a Republican president who has divided the country between haves and have-nots, and who has damaged our image in the world. At a time of financial, health-care, environmental, and world crises, the would-be Republican replacement continues the downward spiral, spewing lies, fear, and divisiveness to win an election. It is time to put the people of this country first. Vote for Barack Obama on Tuesday! </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American voters are poised to take the biggest gamble in modern American history, but it's not too late to reconsider. At this juncture of extreme economic perils and mounting foreign dangers, the nation needs a strong, tested leader with a long record of accomplishments. Someone without a pattern of past troubling associations or questionable advisers. Someone who will not substitute rhetoric, however dazzling, for realistic approaches to problems, or countenance endless diplomatic dances leading nowhere. Someone who has practical proposals, not airy hopes, for moving this country toward energy security. Someone who would encourage, not tax away, entrepreneurship and encourage, not inhibit, foreign trade. That someone is John McCain. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is tempting to wish for a maverick to whip things into shape, but that is not realistic. A maverick on a school board can be a necessary thorn, but might find it difficult to build consensus and get things done if elected as chair. Leaders can bring about change, but they are rarely successful doing so by ruffling feathers, forming small, ad-hoc coalitions, and making comments to shake things up. An effective leader forms broad and lasting coalitions, and articulates well-thought-out plans. Mavericks play an important role in society, but they do not make good leaders. </SPAN></P>

He finds it acceptable for a volunteer army to defend us, to have underpaid day-care workers and teachers instruct his children, and to buy his wide-screen television from retail clerks without health insurance. He forgets that the Constitution's purpose is to provide for the common welfare. A graduated income tax is a fair sharing of the burden to pay for government services.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">History shows that when a president and Congress are of the same party, the president swings further to that party's extreme spectrum. We saw that with President Bush, who was far more conservative when he had a Republican-controlled Congress. To elect Barack Obama at a time when Democrats hold Congress means that there is no force holding them to bipartisanship. We need to consider what is best for the country right now and that would be coming together down the middle to reunite a fractured politic.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wake up America! After waking up at 3 in the morning, I find it very difficult to understand how anyone could vote for the John McCain/Sarah Palin ticket. McCain has demonstrated his strong alliance (voting record) with President George W. Bush. I am tired of people blaming Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi or the Democratic Congress for the war and the economy. The Republicans have filibustered any attempts by the Democrats to move us forward. Look at leadership -- the buck stops there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is running on a record that he fabricated. If you don't believe me, look up Capt. John Dramesi (another POW of real integrity), or read Tim Dickinson's article.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain talked to Sarah Palin one time on the phone before asking her to be his running mate (good decision-making). She found her niche -- &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; That is where she belongs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What kind of people would vote for this ticket? I came up with five categories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.) The Republican Forever Person; by virtue of birth right, I will vote Republican no matter what! (Never thinks outside the box.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.) The neo-con radio talk-show supporter -- everything I hear I believe, because Rush Limbaugh and Bob Durgan are so Christian and factual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.) The Words of Mass Destruction People. I am terrified and believe every negative ad that John McCain approves (a man of great integrity -- just investigate his first marriage and his service to our country.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.) Loyal Vets; I served and so did he, so I will support my brother, even if he voted no on every GI bill and underfunded properly arming the troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.) Lastly, people who still believe that all men are not created equal because of race, education, etc. The future of our country depends on a thoughtful electorate, and it is my hope that people will really think about the best choice who can lead our country out of this mess! Go Obama/Biden '08!</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">3284 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We consider ourselves to be moderate Republicans but pride ourselves on our political independence. Many who receive this letter have financially or otherwise supported Ken's local political reform efforts over the past two and one-half years through his former political action committee Vote For Integrity. Ken's former reform efforts were recognized and respected for impartiality and integrity. Also, Ken has twice voted for Democrats for President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have never before distributed a letter like this; however, we feel the economic, political and national defense stakes are so high this year that we should do our best to communicate our beliefs and recommendations. We are supporting the McCain/Palin ticket and following are seven of our many reasons why. In summarizing these reasons, we have tried to not get bogged down in minutia or political spin; rather we are trying to shoot straight and make our case as simple to understand as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since this letter is somewhat lengthy, you may wish to scan the topics and only read the ones of most interest to you. If you find our reasons honest and persuasive, please feel free to pass this letter on to your friends. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal Income Taxes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. We believe that on balance, McCain/Palin will do a better job than Obama/Biden of either reducing federal income taxes or holding any necessary federal income tax increase to a minimum. Obama and Biden are respectively rated as the most and third most liberal senators in the Senate. Obama is on record as saying to &quot;Joe the plumber&quot; that he wants to redistribute income and Biden is on record as saying that it is &quot;patriotic&quot; to pay higher income taxes. We believe that at heart, Obama/Biden are at the far-left of the political spectrum. They strongly believe in the socio/political agenda of the far-left, including the redistribution of income. As the Wall Street Journal editorial of October 13, 2008 indicated, Obama's tax cut for 95% of all Americans is an &quot;Illusion&quot;. We will be even more frank, the plan is nothing more than the redistribution of income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without getting into the mind-numbing minutia of the candidates' respective tax plans, as a former Certified Public Accountant with Price Waterhouse &amp; Co., Ken can state with confidence that Obama's redistribution plan does not reduce income tax rates. His &quot;tax cuts&quot; would primarily take the form of an addition to or expansion of a mind-numbing number of tax credits, many of which are to be &quot;refundable.&quot; In tax jargon, &quot;refundable&quot; means that certain people get the credit even if they owe no income taxes at all -- which means the government cuts them what in effect is a welfare check. The most distressing result from Obama's plan would be that his refundable tax credits are projected to increase the share of Americans who pay no federal income taxes to an estimated 48%, from an estimate 38% this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historically, our federal income tax system of raising revenue for necessary government programs has, by and large, relied on honest compliance by taxpayers believing the overall tax system to be relatively fair. With increasing numbers of workers paying no federal income taxes, these people will not only not have any vested interest in how tax dollars are spent, they will also come to rely on continued and increased support from those that do pay income taxes -- not a good thing in a democracy, the majority of which believe that all people should be treated equally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government Spending and the Deficit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. We believe that on balance, McCain/Palin will do a better job of reducing unnecessary and wasteful federal government spending than will Obama/Biden. We believe that McCain has a far superior record of attacking wasteful government spending and that Palin's brief executive career is promising in this regard. Conversely, nothing in Obama or Biden's careers remotely suggests any deviation from welfare-state programs. Quite the contrary, even Obama's campaign pledges and programs strongly suggest substantial increases in spending. With the economy headed into what appears to be a serious recession and our national debt exceeding $10 trillion dollars and growing, we need serious reductions in many wasteful and possibly unnecessary government programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Defense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. We believe McCain/Palin will continue to support world-class national defense efforts, including a strong and more effective Central Intelligence Agency, effective missile defense systems, increasingly effective NASA programs and a uniformed military second to none. This national defense capability is essential to safeguard our national interests (including our world-wide economic interests) from the threats of Islamic Fascism, rogue regimes such as North Korea and Iran and, more importantly but longer-term, China and Russia. Obama is on record</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(see HYPERLINK &quot; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0du8wMLzEY&quot;  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0du8wMLzEY) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as to the national defense programs he would cut and his far-left liberal base, including the &quot;&uuml;ber&quot; liberal &quot;MoveOn.Org&quot; will insist on these cuts. Conversely, McCain has been battle tested and has proved his mettle. If the North Vietnamese could not break his will over five years of unimaginable torture and suffering, the likes of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Kim Jong il are not going to make him blink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expanding on the foregoing, Obama has not spent one day in the military service of his country and has no experience whatever in military strategy or tactics and more importantly, the consequences of getting the strategy right. He and Biden evidenced their lack of political and military judgment by opposing the &quot;Surge Strategy&quot; in Iraq advocated by General Petraeus. Senator McCain vigorously supported that strategy which Senator Obama now reluctantly admits &quot;has been successful beyond our wildest dreams&quot;. The success of this strategy is laying the groundwork for the next president of the United States to conclude the liberation of Iraq and to bring our brave men and women in uniform home with the honor and sense of accomplishment they have earned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two final notes on the importance of national defense: In 1990 Senator Biden opposed the legislation authorizing the liberation of Kuwait from Saddam Hussein's invasion. Had the United States not led the coalition that liberated Kuwait in 1991, the entire geopolitical and world-wide energy situations may be dramatically different today. Also, Hillary Clinton's campaign commercial asking who do Americans want answering the White House &quot;Hot Line&quot; at 3:00 in the morning was right on; she was implying that Americans should not want Barrack Obama answering that phone. We agree with her!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy Independence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. This year, Americans were subjected to the economic realities of having an economy that consumes approximately 25% of the world's oil, while having only approximately 3% of the world's proven reserves of oil. One of these realities was $4.00/gal. gasoline for the first time in our history. A world economic reality contributing to higher energy costs is that the people of India and China (as well as many other &quot;developing&quot; countries) want to have the same standard of living that Americans enjoy. These countries will do everything in their power to see that their economies continue to grow. In so doing, their economies will consume increasing amounts of oil and natural gas, thus continuing the long-term trend toward higher costs for these sources of energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An American reality is that our economic and transportation infrastructures (and these are not mutually exclusive) are heavily dependent on petroleum-based products. Indeed, even with an all-out national effort, it may well take something on the order of 20 years to convert our economic and transportation infrastructures to cost-effective alternative sources of energy. Until that time, America will need oil, natural gas and nuclear energy in order to maintain a world-class competitive economy and maintain our standard of living. Also it is imperative that we achieve some semblance of energy independence since this is a national security as well as an economic concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain/Palin have endorsed an expansion of environmentally sensitive offshore drilling and a dramatic increase in nuclear power for the generation of electricity. These are short-term but necessary actions to help (but only help) achieve cost-effective energy independence. Democrats, including Obama/Biden have a long record of opposing offshore drilling and nuclear power, although Obama has recently said he is willing to &quot;look at&quot; increasing offshore production of energy sources ..whatever that means? The comparison here is reasonably simple and clear: McCain/Palin are far more likely to navigate a shorter path to cost-effective energy independence than are Obama/Biden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Party Domination of Federal Government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. It is widely believed that the Democratic Party will gain seats in both houses of Congress. Many times in our history one party has held all of the reins of power. However, with the trend over the past 10 or more years of both political parties becoming increasingly partisan and polarizing, the potential consequences of one-party domination are troubling. The Democratic party today is not the relatively moderate Democratic party of Presidents Franklin Roosevelt (NY), Harry Truman (MO), John Kennedy (MA), or of former Senators Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson (WA), Lloyd Bentsen (TX), Sam Nunn (GA), or former House members Speaker &quot;Tip&quot; O'Neill, Jr., (IL) and even more recently, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (MO). The Democratic Party today is, by and large, dominated by far left politicians, mostly from the East and West coasts, such as Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (CA), Chairman of the House Banking Committee, Barney Frank (MA), Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Charles Rangel (NY), Chairman of the HYPERLINK &quot; http://oversight.house.gov/&quot; \t &quot;_blank&quot; Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Henry Waxman (CA), Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (NV), Chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, Christopher Dodd (CT), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Patrick J. Leahy (VT), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Joe Biden (CT) and the very influential Senate Democrats, Hillary Clinton (NY), Charles Schumer (NY), Barbara Boxer (CA) and John Kerry and Edward Kennedy of MA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, should two of the three most liberal senators be elected, our federal government will be dominated by far-left leaning politicians and their supporting interest groups (trial lawyers, unions, environmentalists, special interest groups like ACORN, the higher education establishment, the welfare establishment in its broadest sense and the immigration establishment. Collectively, these interest groups have, over the years, achieved budgeted programs consuming hundreds of billions of dollars of spending annually. Without the check of a president representing, at least in part, the interests of average Americans who oppose unnecessary and wasteful spending, we can see no end to the spending supported by those dedicated to redistribution of income and an increasing array of social programs. The Wall Street Journal published an excellent summary of the very real possible consequences of an unchecked super-liberal agenda in its &quot;Review &amp; Outlook&quot; section on October 17, 2008 titled &quot;A Liberal Supermajority&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Balanced Judiciary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. We believe that our federal and state judges should stick to interpreting laws and regulations legislated by officials elected by the people and not make laws or regulations. Nowhere is this more important than on our Supreme Court and our Federal Appellate Courts. Many Supreme Court decisions in recent years have been split decisions, with five justices voting one way and four justices voting another way. Justices for the Supreme Court and Federal Appellate Courts are nominated by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate. The Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee is Senator Patrick J. Leahy (D.-VT). Senator Leahy, together with Senator Biden have voted against every Justice nominated by President Bush for the Supreme Court. In addition, Senator Biden has vigorously opposed Justices nominated for the Supreme Court by Republican Presidents, going back as far as his opposition to Clarence Thomas in 1991 when Senator Biden was then Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator Biden led what Justice Thomas at the time described as a &quot;high-tech lynching&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an example of Senator McCain's past bi-partisan efforts, it was the leadership of John McCain and Senator Liberman (D.-CT) to form the &quot;Gang of 14&quot;, the bi-partisan group of 14 Senators (7 Democrats and 7 Republicans), who successfully negotiated a Senate compromise in the Spring of 2005 to avoid the so-called &quot;nuclear option&quot; (or constitutional option) over continued organized use of filibusters by Senate Democrats to block President Bush's judicial appointments. Senators Obama, Biden and Leahy have never exhibited any such bi-partisanship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senators Leahy, Biden and Obama are expressed believers in what is called a &quot;living (or evolving) Constitition&quot;; namely one where provisions of the Constitution are interpreted as social changes occur. With Supreme Court nominees having liberal social agendas nominated by a President Obama and pushed through confirmation by a Democratically-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee led by Senator Leahy and supported by a Vice President Biden, we can expect many more Justices like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and none like the present Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, John G. Roberts, Jr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even more troubling is Obama's apparent long-term belief in achieving the redistribution of income for social and civil rights purposes (also see under Federal Income Taxes, above). In a telling Chicago Public Radio interview in 2001, Obama stated that &quot;One of the tragedies of the civil rights movement was because the civil rights movement became so court focused, there was a tendency to lose track of the political and community organizing activities on the ground that are able to put together the actual coalitions of power through which you bring about redistributive change&quot;. In other words, Obama flat-out said it is a tragedy that the civil rights movement did not achieve redistribution of income to benefit certain classes of people (listen for yourself @ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iivL4c_3pck} .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Real Obama?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Who is Barrack Obama and does it matter? We know that Obama is a 47 year old, first term junior senator from Illinois. We also know he has been judged the most liberal senator in the Senate and that he does not have a record of accomplishing anything of substance in the Senate since being elected to national office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In addition, a number of questions have arisen regarding his past associations with a variety of controversial individuals. One prominent mid-state Pennsylvania journalist characterized John McCain's campaign as &quot;nasty&quot; for raising doubts about Barack Obama and justified his characterization by saying: &quot;Whether or not such doubts are warranted&quot;. It seems to us that as a matter of fairness, voters have every right to fully evaluate every important aspect of Senator Obama's past. Moreover, the media has a professional responsibility to impartially examine all possible areas of &quot;doubt&quot; and bring such matters to the voters' attention, together with all relevant facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While any one of the disclosures regarding Senator Obama's past associations with controversial individuals may not be a game-changer, we find the cumulative effect of Obama's various&nbsp;alliances with the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, Minister&nbsp;Louis Farrakhan, convicted Chicago corruption peddler Tony Rezko, ACORN and the former, unapologetic, Weathermen terrorist Bill Ayers, to be troubling. Many of these alliances existed over various periods of many years, including his work for and support of ACORN (the community action organization to which Obama's campaign this year is reported to have contributed $850,000 and which organization is reported to currently be under investigation for extensive voter registration fraud in at least 11 &quot;battleground&quot; states), his close relationship with Reverend Jeremiah Wright and the direct and indirect financial support for the Senator from Tony Rezko. Minister&nbsp;Louis Farrakhan has even gone so far as to refer to Senator Obama as the &quot;Messiah&quot; (see http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=77539) .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of smoke arises from these alliances and many Americans do in fact believe that you can judge a person (in least in part) by the company they keep. What makes the Senator's past alliances doubly important is his brief experience and lack of any substantive accomplishments as a U.S. Senator. Indeed, it is said that since his election to the Senate in 2004, he has spent less than 100 days actually on the Senate floor doing what he is paid to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Americans have been impressed with Senator Obama's soaring rhetoric and his authoritative sounding pronouncements of what is wrong with our country and his prescriptions for a cure. He surely is an impressive speaker, but so was the fictional evangelical preacher, Elmer Gantry. Gantry, like many more modern-day real-life hustlers, could bring crowds to their feet shouting 'Halleluiah' while separating them from their money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, Senator McCain is not a particularly gifted speaker, but neither were President's Truman or Eisenhower. If, in this age of TV sound bites, limited attentions spans and political spin, spin, spin, elections can only be won by the most talented speakers, then a lot of our country's talent will be excluded from elected office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few Americans will evaluate all of the Senator's patented campaign speeches and highly-nuanced debating and interview responses. However, as reputable members of the media should attest in bold print, the Senator is a master of authoritative-sounding hyperbole and his record is one of nuanced changes in his position and his many promises to every interest group imaginable. Perhaps the most memorable example is how Obama, after attending the Reverend Wright's Trinity United Church of Christ for approximately 20 years and being on record that he attended church approximately twice per month, he flat-out denied ever being present during any of the Reverend's well-documented, social diatribes. When the political heat intensified, Obama gave a major TV speech on race in which he condemned Reverend Wright's inflammatory diatribes, but said, and this is a paraphrase, that he could no more disavow his relationship with Reverend Wright than he could disavow his relation to his white grandmother. When the political heat surrounding Reverend Wright and his comments continued and intensified, Obama threw the Reverend to the wolves and resigned his membership in the Trinity United Church of Christ. So much for Obama's loyalty and his believability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conclusion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have taken the time to summarize our rationale for supporting the less glamorous and less effective public speakers in this election, because the stakes this year are particularly high given the current economics climate and the threats to our national security. If you agree with only four of our seven reasons, hopefully you will be persuaded to vote for McCain/Palin. As you decide how to cast your vote for president next week, please don't be influenced by what Senator Obama says he is going to do; please take the time to look hard at what he has actually said and done and understand who he really is.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS MARK TWAIN once observed, &quot;A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest application is in Northeast Philadelphia, where state Rep. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">John Perzel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and House candidate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Matt Taubenberger</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been running misleading newspaper ads, accusing Taubenberger's opponent, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Brendan Boyle</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, of failing to pay real-estate taxes on a rental property owned by his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy is based entirely on a city bookkeeping error, according to an analysis by the city Revenue Commissioner </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Keith J. Richardson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Boyles bought the property last year, their settlement included $778 to cover the 2007 real-estate taxes. The city got the money, but mistakenly credited it to the property's water and sewer account instead of real-estate taxes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That led to an unpaid balance that Taubenberger discovered this year on a Web site set up by the Board of Revision of Taxes. The site itself cautions that its information may be inaccurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the issue arose, Boyle insisted that all his taxes had been paid. While struggling to get an explanation from the city, he gave the city another check to cover the unpaid bills, hoping to defuse the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Taubenberger launched a series of full-page newspaper ads in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Inquirer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Daily News</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> describing Boyle as a &quot;tax deadbeat.&quot; The ads were put together by Perzel's longtime consultant, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Marty</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">O'Rourke</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and paid for by Perzel's political-action committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days ago, the city finally took responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It appears the real-estate payment from the title company last year was applied to water-sewer in error by the department,&quot; Richardson told the Boyles in a letter. &quot;The problem has been resolved with regards to your real estate taxes and the file has been cleared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Taubenberger refuses to apologize. &quot;This is all highly questionable and suspect,&quot; he said. &quot;Commissioner Richardson's letter is not worth the paper it's written on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Halloween politics: Boo!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ooooooo, it's scary! Very, very scary!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And not just because today is Halloween.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, 75,000 Jewish voters in Pennsylvania got an e-mail that read, &quot;in the 5,769 years of our people, there has never been a more important time for us to take pro-active measures in order to stop a second Holocaust.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And who might be the agent of this second Holocaust? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Barack Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The e-mail was signed by former state Supreme Court Justice </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sandra Schultz Newman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a member of Republican presidential candidate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">John McCain's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> task force monitoring Election Day voting; real-estate developer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Mitchell L. Morgan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has raised money for McCain, and steel-industry executive </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">I. Michael Coslov</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newman wound up apologizing for the e-mail, saying that she hadn't read it closely before it went out. (Too busy fighting ACORN's threat to the fabric of democracy!)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign disavowed the e-mail, the consultant who wrote it was fired and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Abraham H. Foxman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Anti-Defamation League's national director, condemned it as &quot;an odious, false and repugnant analogy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, over the past two days, two slick pamphlets have arrived in the mail of local Jewish voters from the National Woman's Committee of the Republican Jewish Coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought the first one was bad, but the second one was even more incendiary,&quot; said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ellen Levinson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who lives near Graduate Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mailer shows Obama with the Rev. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Jeremiah Wright</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Zbigniew Brzezinski</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, saying that he &quot;surrounds himself with advisers who are hostile to Israel and American Jews.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats aren't innocent of this nonsense, either, as advocates raise fears of the return to the days of &quot;back-alley abortions&quot; if McCain gets to name justices to the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course the scariest Halloween ad of all time came the Friday before the 2004 election, when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Osama bin Laden</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> released a threatening videotape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tape swung the media spotlight onto the issue of terrorism, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">President Bush's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strength. Democrat </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">John Kerry</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> blames it for his narrow loss four days later. And the Bush campaign still hasn't listed bin-Laden as an in-kind contributor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Another candidate for D.A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Brian Grady</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 40, a former assistant district attorney, born in Olney and living in Roxborough, is joining next year's crowded race for D.A., hoping to succeed retiring </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Lynne Abraham</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the reason I went to law school,&quot; says Grady, a graduate of La Salle and of Notre Dame law school. He says that the different factions in the criminal-justice system - the police, the D.A.'s office and the courts - have to improve their relationships to deal effectively with problems like witness intimidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grady was one of the prosecutors involved in the Center City jogger case in 1996, but he's better-known for a 1997 incident in which he punched out a defense attorney </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">inside a judge's chambers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grady says that the other guy hit him first, but not as hard. It cost him $2,500 and a six-month suspension from practicing law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admits that he made a mistake. &quot;You can't go around punching people out,&quot; Grady told Clout. But, he promised, &quot;it's the same passion you'll see out of me as D.A.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sarah's Bedtime Prayer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poker-playing lady lawyer sent Clout the following creation:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Now I lay me down to sleepI pray that god will make me veepAnd let me keep these fancy clothesNot send me back to EskimosI don't know why the gotcha pressIs mocking me; I must confessI hate them and their snooty looksTheir smirking 'cause I don't read booksDon't they know I'm a beauty queenWho can kill a moose and strip him clean?That I was mayor of Wasilla(A town I sure have had my fill of)Who cares if I can't cite a case?I've got a photogenic faceBush Doctrine Shmush Doctrine, here's what I think:It's more important to look good in pinkA bridge to nowhere, books to be burned,Ex-in-law fired, diplomas unearned?None of that matters, that's what I say(And that's me talking, not Tina Fey)I'll come to town, first dude in towReady and eager to overturn RoeWinkin' and sayin' &quot;you betcha&quot; and thinkin:I could someday hold the same job as Lincoln!So here's my prayer: Lord, please let me winMake the polls wrong and I'll never sinPut me in office and I'll be euphoric(Even more so if you smite Katie Couric.) *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- With recession, countless natural disasters and a major terrorist attack, there has been one constant in the U.S. economy: American consumers have bought more stuff in any given quarter than they did in the previous one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not anymore. Personal consumption expenditures fell at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the government said yesterday, the worst decline since 1980. The data show that even before the financial crisis deepened in October, American households were being walloped to a degree that has no recent precedent. Conditions, economists said, are almost certain to get worse before getting better. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a major about-face in consumer spending,&quot; said Robert Dye, a senior economist with PNC Financial Services Group. &quot;It's no surprise why. We've had a drop in the value of houses and stock portfolios, a very weak labor market and a tightening of credit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, the nation's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic growth, declined at a 0.3 percent annual rate in the three months ended Sept. 30, the Commerce Department said. The economy would have shrunk even more had it not been for strong export growth and government spending, as well as a buildup in business inventories -- all factors poised to offer less of a boost in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts yesterday had been braced for even worse economic data, and the stock market rose following the announcement. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 190 points for the day, or 2.1 percent, amid some decent earnings reports and some signs of healing in the troubled credit markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many analysts think the country is already in a recession -- although the panel of economists that makes such determinations has not yet ruled as such -- and that the economy will contract at perhaps a 3 or 4 percent annual rate in the final three months of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDP figures gave new impetus to calls for a government stimulus package. Congressional Democrats are now considering crafting a spending proposal of around $100 billion, with the hope that -- if endorsed by President Bush and the president-elect -- the package could be passed next month and signed by the end of the year. Democrats may then consider another package in January, the third in 12 months, said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publicly, White House officials have not been particularly receptive to the idea of additional spending. But their rhetoric has softened in recent weeks, and political observers said there may be room for compromise, perhaps involving trade deals with Colombia and Panama, which are high priorities for Mr. Bush but opposed by many congressional Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House has some things they want, like Colombia and Panama. So I think the opportunity is there,&quot; said Business Roundtable President John Castellani. His association of 160 of the nation's largest companies joined the call for more stimulus spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's economic data became grist in the presidential campaign. Democratic Sen. Barack Obama attributed the weak growth to Mr. Bush's policies, arguing that GOP Sen. John McCain would continue them. A McCain aide said his rival's tax policies would only exacerbate the slump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The negative turn in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, shows how severely the financial crisis has affected Americans' ability to buy the goods they are used to buying. In the 2001 recession and aftermath of the terrorist attacks that year, by contrast, Americans kept spending money despite millions of lost jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's one major difference between then and now. In 2001, consumers could borrow money -- with credit cards, and home equity lines of credit -- to get through bad times without necessarily curbing spending. Now, credit is hard to get, which means many people cannot support standards of living artificially boosted by the now-ended lending boom. Those who suffer short-term setbacks have less ability to ride out the bad times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result: The freight train of U.S. consumption has derailed. Purchases of durable goods fell at a remarkable 14.1 percent annual pace, as Americans pulled back on demands for autos, home appliances and other big-ticket items that often require credit to purchase. Even spending on nondurable goods -- food, clothing and items expected to last less than three years -- fell 6.4 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exports proved to be a major bright spot in the report, rising at a 5.9 percent annual pace. But that growth was driven by two trends that seem to be dissipating. First, economies in the rest of the world are deteriorating rapidly, meaning foreigners will be less able to buy U.S. goods in months ahead. And the dollar's value has been rising relative to other currencies in recent weeks, making U.S. exports less competitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're entering a global recession, so it's hard to imagine net exports giving much of a positive boost down the road,&quot; said Jay Bryson, a global economist at Wachovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government spending, which grew by 5.8 percent, also kept the overall GDP number from being more negative. But the growth there could be misleading. The strongest gains were in defense spending, highly volatile quarter-to-quarter. State and local governments spent more money, a trend that may reverse itself as many face budget crunches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists testifying yesterday before Congress' Joint Economic Committee said the new GDP numbers reflect a recession that began earlier this year and is likely to last through 2009.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEFIANCE, Ohio -- Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Barack Obama of Illinois seized on yesterday's latest economic reports to attack each other, with the Republican calling Mr. Obama a shill for Big Oil and the Democrat calling his GOP rival a clone of President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With five days left before the election, Mr. McCain began a two-day bus tour of Ohio, a battleground state that Mr. Bush won twice, but where the Arizona senator finds himself trailing in most polls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain took note of the record earnings announced yesterday by Exxon Mobil and told a crowd outside the Defiance high school that Mr. Obama &quot;voted for billions in corporate giveaways to the oil companies. I voted against it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain was referring to Mr. Obama's vote for the 2005 energy bill. But the Republican's assertion that the Illinois senator had backed billions in corporate giveaways for oil companies has been called misleading by fact-checking organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill included $2.6 billion in tax cuts for the oil and gas industries along with $2.9 billion in tax increases on those industries, a net increase of nearly $300 million over 11 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. McCain crisscrossed the Buckeye State by bus, Mr. Obama had campaign stops in Florida, Virginia and Missouri -- all states that Mr. Bush won in 2004 and that polls find within Mr. Obama's reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a morning event in Sarasota, Fla., Mr. Obama told his audience the news that the economy declined in the third quarter. &quot;That means we're producing less and selling less, so our economy is actually shrinking,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said Mr. McCain would continue Mr. Bush's economic policies. Echoing the imagery of a new TV ad his campaign has released, he said, &quot;If you want to know where Senator McCain will drive this economy, just look in the rearview mirror. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After nine straight months of job losses and the largest drop in home values on record, with wages lower than they've been in a decade, why would we keep on driving down this dead-end street?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 30-second ad, a man who is driving a car tries to adjust its mirrors, only to see Mr. Bush's face repeatedly in the rear and side mirrors; eventually, Mr. McCain's and Mr. Bush's faces morph together. &quot;Look behind you; we can't afford more of the same,&quot; the announcer says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain had hoped to make a splash in Defiance with a living commercial: his first joint campaign appearance with Samuel Wurzelbacher, aka &quot;Joe the Plumber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Wurzelbacher's campaign-trail encounter with Mr. Obama, in which the candidate tried to explain his tax plan to the Ohio resident, has become the centerpiece of Mr. McCain's stump speech and his major theme in the closing days: that Mr. Obama would raise taxes on small businesses, hurting jobs and the economy. In fact, Mr. Obama would raise taxes only on individuals who earn more than $200,000 a year and families that earn more than $250,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mr. McCain introduced Mr. Wurzelbacher, however, there was no Joe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe, where are you? Is Joe here with us today?&quot; the GOP nominee asked. &quot;Joe, I thought you were here today. All right, well, you're all Joe the Plumber. ... Wherever you are, Joe, let's give him a round of applause.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Wurzelbacher did appear at Mr. McCain's second event yesterday, standing beside the Republican candidate under a giant gazebo in downtown Sandusky, Ohio. He urged those in the crowd, estimated at 8,000, to do their homework before voting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All right, guys, I didn't prepare anything; the only thing I've been saying is just get out and get informed,&quot; he said. &quot;Don't take everyone's opinions. I came to my own opinions by research. Get involved in the government. That way we can hold our politicians accountable and take back our government. It's all ours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mr. McCain's campaign critiqued Mr. Obama's 30-minute TV infomercial Wednesday night as a gimmick that smacked of hubris. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who is traveling with Mr. McCain, told the Defiance crowd that if they were to show the program to prisoners, it probably would violate the Geneva Convention prohibition against torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's program was watched by 21.7 percent of households, according to Nielsen ratings. That is less than the 38.3 percent household rating for this year's final presidential debate, but more than the 16.8 percent that independent candidate Ross Perot drew for his paid programming in 1996, the last time such programming time was purchased.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHIPPENSBURG, Pa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emily Daywalt decided to go to the first political rally of her life because she wanted to cheer Sarah Palin, who was here a few days ago to inspire the faithful. Ms. Daywalt said she likes it that Ms. Palin &quot;hunts and that she believes in God and that she is a strong, independent woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ask the 19-year-old from South Mountain, Pa., why she is voting against Barack Obama, and she hones right in on John McCain's closing argument. Mr. Obama, Ms. Daywalt said, &quot;wants to spread the wealth,&quot; which she interprets as meaning that he'd &quot;give it to people who don't do anything.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all of the McCain campaign's relentless use of guilt-by-association techniques right to the end, the 2008 campaign is concluding on a remarkably substantive argument. It is a debate about what constitutes social fairness and whether a top-down or a bottom-up approach to economic growth will define the country's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is often described as cautious, but he has been bold and unrelenting in his criticisms of trickle-down economics and tax cuts concentrated on the wealthy. He used yesterday's negative numbers on economic growth to press his case against theories that conservatives have been touting for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The decline in our GDP didn't happen by accident,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;It is a direct result of the Bush administration's trickle-down, Wall Street-first, Main Street-last policies that John McCain has embraced for the last eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, economic populism is thriving right now and if Mr. Obama wins, his election would not simply be a non-ideological verdict against the status quo. It would be a clear repudiation of conservative economic ideas and of Mr. McCain's claim that a more-egalitarian approach to growth constitutes &quot;socialism.&quot; Mr. McCain's attacks on Mr. Obama's thinking have been so forceful and direct that they require this election to be seen as a referendum that will settle a long-running philosophical argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has presented Mr. McCain with a problem. By endorsing tax cuts for Americans earning less than $200,000 a year -- i.e., the vast majority of taxpayers -- Mr. Obama has complicated the typical Republican claim that Democrats always support raising taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is candid in saying that he thinks the wealthy should pay more so that most Americans can pay less. He also thinks the government can help vulnerable members of the middle class and the poor secure health care and go to college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has complicated Mr. McCain's effort to root his argument on taxes in middle-class self-interest, since Mr. Obama already has that covered. So Mr. McCain has actually had to defend giving large tax benefits to the wealthy and to business, and engage in a wholesale argument against any sort of redistribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain regularly charges that Mr. Obama wants to be the &quot;redistributor in chief.&quot; Speaking at the rally here at Shippensburg University, Ms. Palin was forced to say this about Mr. Obama's support for a variety of tax credits aimed at helping the poor and middle class: &quot;He says that he is for a tax credit, which is when government takes your money in order to give it away to someone else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is, of course, a mighty peculiar definition of tax credits. It is also an odd argument from a ticket that itself is committed to a research-and-development tax credit for corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true that Mr. Obama favors &quot;refundable&quot; tax credits to help low-income workers, including some who may pay no income taxes but do pay many other taxes. Mr. McCain has argued that Mr. Obama's refundable tax credits amount to &quot;welfare.&quot; That, too, is a strange claim, since Mr. McCain favors refundable credits as part of his health plan. But the whole idea is to persuade voters such as Emily Daywalt that Mr. Obama really is just out to help those &quot;who don't do anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that is why Mr. Obama's 30-minute advertisement on Wednesday night was targeted directly to voters such as Ms. Daywalt, or at least to those like her who are still persuadable. It was Mr. Obama's tribute to the country's working people who seek nothing more than decent incomes, health care and a chance to see their children succeed. It was less a political ad than a documentary about the value of work and the responsibilities of family life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, Republicans have argued that the way to help struggling working people is to give more money to the wealthy. Mr. Obama is saying that we should cut out the middleman and help working people directly. My hunch is that Mr. Obama's argument will prevail, and that conservatives will then work overtime to try to deny the judgment the people have rendered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state is fining Democrat Tony Bompiani because he failed to provide timely finance reports for his 39th Senatorial District campaign since May, a state election official said Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While campaign finance reports show spending by Bompiani's opponent, Republican Westmoreland County Commissioner Kim Ward, is approaching $1 million, the Democratic nominee has missed the past two deadlines for reporting his campaign's contributions and expenditures. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jessica Myers, chief of the state Division of Campaign Finance and Lobbying Disclosure, said the state has sent a letter to Bompiani informing him that fines will be levied because the latest report -- covering Sept. 16 through Oct. 20 -- was not filed by last Friday's deadline. The previous deadline was Sept. 23.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We haven't seen anything from him since the primary,&quot; Myers said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The late fee is $20 per day for the first six days a candidate is late, and $250 a day after that. Nonpayment eventually results in a referral to the state attorney general, Myers said. Fines cannot be paid from contributions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bompiani and his campaign treasurer, Ken Stillwell, said they have delayed filing until state officials provide answers to some reporting questions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The voters shouldn't read anything into it,&quot; Bompiani said. &quot;We're not trying to hide anything.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd rather take the fine and do it right,&quot; he added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a barrage of glossy mailers and television commercials paid for by the state Republican and Democratic committees, spending this year is on pace to shatter the record-setting $1.7 million spent four years ago in the same Senate race between two-term incumbent Democrat Allen Kukovich and eventual winner Republican Bob Regola. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Records show that in the 2 1/2 months she has been in the race, Ward and state GOP sources have spent $936,900 -- $4,000 more than Regola and his contributors spent in 2004. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kukovich camp spent $772,291 in 2004. Ward entered the race after Regola announced that he would not seek re-election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance reports filed this month for Ward show the state Republican Party has made $371,991 in in-kind contributions for &quot;campaign literature and postage&quot; and the Senate Republican Campaign Committee has made $309,098.53 in in-kind contributions for &quot;media advertising.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contributions of things of value like advertising, office space or campaign supplies are considered &quot;in-kind.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ward's campaign reported $86,000 in political donations from the committees of Republican Sens. Pat Browne, Dominic Pileggi, Joe Scarnati, John Pippy, Don White and John Rafferty, and $25,000 from the Senate Republican Campaign Committee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stillwell estimated Bompiani's contributions this fall at $350,000, while another $300,000 was funneled into the campaign through in-kind contributions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bompiani's committee has spent about $296,000 this fall, Stillwell said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Oct. 20, Bompiani received a total of $66,500 from Democratic Sens. Mike O'Pake, Vincent Hughes, Anthony Williams, John Wozniak and Sean Logan and $25,000 from the Pennsylvania Democratic Party Campaign 2008 group.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contributions like those, made after the most recent deadline, are required to be reported within 24 hours. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP-paid ads have criticized Bompiani for raising taxes as a Hempfield Area school director, while Democratic committee fliers blame Ward for credit card abuse at the independent Hempfield Township Municipal Authority when Ward was a township supervisor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is an outrageous amount,&quot; Ward said of the spending by both sides. &quot;But if (Gov. Ed) Rendell's saying he's going to contribute $3 million for Senate Democrats' (campaigns), we've got to do what we have to do to keep control of this seat.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bompiani, a Youngwood chiropractor, said he too is stunned by the cost of the campaign.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a recent AARP debate with Ward in Unity, Bompiani took time in his opening comments to apologize to the audience and radio listeners for the amount of campaign &quot;garbage&quot; constituents find each day in their mailboxes and on TV. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's really unbelievable ... it really is. Spending between $2 (million) to $3 million for a seat that pays what ... $70,000 a year?&quot; Bompiani said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A state senator is paid $76,163 a year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the Oct. 18 death of GOP Sen. James Rhoades, Republicans hold a 28-21 majority in the Senate.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political analyst G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin and Marshall College Center for Politics and Public Affairs, said he is not surprised by the money being spent in the district against the backdrop of John McCain fighting an uphill battle to win Pennsylvania's electoral votes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you look around the rest of the regions in the state, Democrats are expected to have a 60-40 edge because of Obama in the presidential election. McCain still has a foothold there in Westmoreland, so the Republicans desperately want to keep that Senate seat, which I think is among one of the few, if any, that may change,&quot; Madonna said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's really no Senate race in the Philly area up for grabs, and even if there was, the cost of television advertising there would be prohibitive. But Republicans don't have that big of an edge in the state Senate ... and they are losing voter registration practically everywhere else in the state, so they see that seat as very important,&quot; Madonna said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Plus, you have the fact that the Republicans just won that seat finally in 2004, and don't want to lose it now,&quot; he added. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HONESTLY, it kinda creeps me out that Barack Obama bought all that TV time on all those networks last night - too much like a Big Brother thing, in the controlling Orwellian sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If not for ABC wanting to air its quirky &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot; - a sitcom, not a news report on John McCain's campaign - Obama would have scored a TV &quot;roadblock,&quot; meaning it'd be tough for almost any viewer to get around seeing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As is, he hog-tied 30 minutes starting at 8 p.m. on CBS, NBC, MSNBC, Fox (pre-empting the World Series pre-game show), BET, Univison and TV One. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was &quot;HEY, AMERICA, YOU CAN'T NOT LOOK AT ME! I COMMAND IT!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this barrage includes Obama interviews granted to NBC anchor Brian Williams, ABC anchor Charlie Gibson, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow and Comedy Central's Jon Stewart of &quot;The Daily Show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isn't there some overkill here?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's spent, what, $230 million on advertising, $100 million more than McCain?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a half-hour prime-time commercial for an estimated five million bucks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I guess it's better than Tom Cruise or Al Sharpton cutting Obama ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I just can't help thinking that oversaturation turns some off, the same way I pledge never to patronize local TV advertisers who run the same message ad nauseum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think anyone likes the hard sell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that Obama's message wasn't well-crafted. It was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High production values; an opening shot of amber waves of grain; moving, sometimes heart-tugging music, and touching stories of individual families in (as luck would have it) states important to Obama's campaign: Missouri, Ohio, New Mexico, Kentucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And these families, a nice mix of white, black, young, old and all middle class, were fighting problems tied to the economy and health care, two issues Obama pounded throughout his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And of four governors who spoke lovingly of Obama, three are from states Obama's fighting hard to carry: Ohio, Virginia and New Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had, in my view, two lines that stuck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Near the start he said, &quot;We've been talking about the same problems for decades and nothing's ever done to solve them.&quot; A good argument for change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Near the end, he said, &quot;I will open the doors of government and ask you to be involved in your democracy again.&quot; A nice pitch for a new beginning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It all ended with a live pick-up from a rally in another critical state, Florida, where Obama wrapped up his pitch to vote for him and &quot;change this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was nothing like the TV efforts of Adlai Stevenson, the first to buy 30-minute blocks, back in '52, though probably for, like, $150 a pop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody watched, and he was drubbed by Dwight D. Eisenhower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was nothing like the last, and most entertaining, candidate to buy 30-minute ads, H. Ross Perot in '92, in a three-way race with Bill Clinton and the first President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 16 million people watched Perot use a pointer and colorful charts to argue his case against a $4.1 trillion national debt (today, it's $10.5 trillion), which Perot back then called &quot;unconscionable.&quot; He won 19 percent of the vote that year, the most successful third-party candidate since Teddy Roosevelt in 1912.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Obama, sadly, wasn't much like what &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; envisioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend &quot;SNL&quot; suggested an Obama variety show featuring songs from actors playing Obama and wife, Michelle, with a guest appearance by Bill Clinton, who, accompanied by sexy dancers, sang &quot;Don't You Forget About Me,&quot; a 1985 pop-rock song performed then by a group named (appropriate to any campaign season) Simple Minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of which, I worry that big-buck shows by candidates, in this case Obama, convey a message that elections simply go to the highest bidder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And however true that is, it still creeps me out. *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KISSIMMEE, Fla. -- Illinois Sen. Barack Obama flooded the airwaves last evening to make his closing case to the nation with a half-hour network primetime commercial as well as high-profile television interviews and a rally with former President Bill Clinton timed for maximum exposure on local newscasts in the key swing state of Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His GOP rival, Arizona Sen. John McCain, also was in Florida, fighting for a state that once appeared securely his, but where Mr. Obama is now leading in polls. The Republican focused on national security -- the central issue of his campaign until the financial crisis -- surrounding himself with former military officers and arguing that Mr. Obama was unqualified to be commander-in-chief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question is whether this is a man who has what it takes to protect America from Osama bin Laden, al-Qaida and the other great threats in the world,&quot; Mr. McCain said. &quot;He has given no reason to answer in the affirmative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama infomercial, the first time a major-party candidate has purchased such an extended time period for a single commercial on network television, was a highly polished video presentation stressing economic themes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program highlighted the struggles of a few everyday Americans --among them, a Wal-Mart greeter, an auto worker and a grade-school teacher. Mr. Obama was featured describing how he, as president, would address their problems, bread-and-butter issues such as health care costs, job losses and retirement security. Interspersed were elements of his biography and testimonials from veteran party leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the ad followed a documentary format, heavy on visuals of Americana such as fields of grain, flags, views from a moving train, a small-town parade and high school football practice. It included close-ups of voters listening as Mr. Obama spoke at a town-hall meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm worried about the couple that's trying to figure out how they're going to retire. ... I'm worried about the guy who has worked in a plant for 20 years and suddenly sees his job shipped overseas,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;That's who I'm worried about, and that's who I'm going to be fighting for and thinking about every single day that I'm in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The culmination was a live cutaway to Mr. Obama speaking before a roaring crowd of 20,000 at an arena in Sunrise, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly afterward, Mr. Obama flew on his campaign plane to Orlando, where he planned to hold his first joint rally with Mr. Clinton, a Democrat who twice won Florida in his own presidential campaigns. That rally, in nearby Kissimmee, was timed to begin at 11 p.m., just as local newscasts went on the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's network television ad, estimated to cost more than $3 million, is a testament to his campaign's overwhelming financial superiority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when Mr. McCain has been forced to scrimp and carefully ration television commercial time for the most crucial regions, the Obama program offered the chance to make an extended case to a wide swath of America. It aired simultaneously on every major broadcast network except ABC and several cable networks as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even on ABC, he was prominently featured on the network newscast after sitting for an interview with anchor Charles Gibson. Later in the day, he appeared on John Stewart's &quot;Daily Show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some political commentators saw a potential risk of overexposure, recalling that the approach backfired on the only other candidate to use a similar national broadcast, independent Ross Perot in 1992. But several Democratic strategists said they saw little risk for Mr. Obama in a carefully controlled commercial, particularly given his unusual facility as a communicator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic consultant Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the party's last two presidential candidates, noted that voters have shown extraordinary interest in the current campaign, with entertainment shows such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and pop-culture magazines tackling the campaign to boost their audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last week tends to be when those soft undecided voters make their move. He wants to be in front of them when they make their decision,&quot; Mr. Devine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, he said, the ad also was clearly designed to reassure wavering supporters. With Mr. Obama receiving more than 50 percent support in polls of the key battleground states he needs to win the election, Mr. Devine said, his overriding goal must be simply to avoid any decay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within minutes of the Obama&nbsp;commercial, the McCain campaign sent out a response dripping with sarcasm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As anyone who has bought anything from an infomercial knows, the sales-job is always better than the product. Buyer beware,&quot; said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KISSIMMEE, Fla. - Their sense of urgency growing as the clock runs down, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain are spending their time - and their money - trying to win over the same voters in those few states still too close to call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the polls close on Tuesday, you don't want to say to yourself, 'Here's something I didn't do, here's an argument I didn't make, here's a hand I didn't shake,'&quot; Obama told ABC's &quot;Good Morning America&quot; in an interview broadcast Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was targeting Florida, Virginia and Missouri on Thursday while McCain was taking the fight to Defiance, Ohio, in a quest to tilt that swing state his way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama jumped on new data showing that the economy went backward in the third quarter of the year, as consumers cut back on their spending by the biggest amount in 28 years. It was the strongest signal yet the country has hurtled into recession. The gross domestic product shrank at a 0.3 percent annual rate in last quarter, the Commerce Department reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a direct result of the Bush administration's trickle down, Wall Street first, Main Street last policies that John McCain has embraced for the last eight years and plans to continue for the next four,&quot; Obama said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior McCain policy adviser, Doug Holtz-Eakin, said in a statement that Obama would only accelerate the economy's decline with &quot;ideologically-driven plans to redistribute income.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is change Americans cannot afford,&quot; Holtz-Eakin said, and he promised that a McCain presidency would get federal spending under control and &quot;clean up Wall Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illinois senator holds leads in polls nationally and in most of the states still in competition. McCain, an Arizona senator, has tried to erode Obama's advantage by raising doubts about his tax plan and his ability to protect the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, says there is nothing wrong with calling out Obama on his past associations or other controversial elements of his record. Besides Obama's association with '60s-era radical Bill Ayers - Palin has accused Obama of &quot;palling around with terrorists&quot; - both McCain and Palin have now brought up Obama's friendship with a Palestinian-American professor, Rashid Khalidi, who has been critical of Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by ABC if she was suggesting in any of her criticism that Obama is un-American, Palin said: &quot;No, not at all. Not calling him un-American.&quot; She added, &quot;I am sure that Sen. Obama cares as much for this country as McCain does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigns are famous for tightening and getting even more unpredictable at the end. McCain and Palin say they will surprise election predictors with a win. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama tried to lock up undecideds Wednesday with a prime-time informercial that seamlessly cut to some live comments he was making in Florida. The air time cost $4 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a capper, Obama got a big boost late in the evening from Bill Clinton. Pushing aside hard feelings over Obama's winning primary campaign against his wife, the former president got on stage with Obama for the first time and called him the future of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, in Florida, argued that Obama lacks &quot;what it takes to protect America from terrorists&quot; as he sought to shift attention away from the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Associated Press-GfK polls taken within the past several days showed Obama ahead in four states that supported Bush in 2004, and essentially even with McCain in two others. A separate survey suggested even McCain's home state of Arizona was not safely in his column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaigns will make a mad dash until Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a telling comment in describing his 30-minute television ad, Obama said Wednesday: &quot;At this stage, everything that needs to be said has probably been heard by a lot of voters. And what you want to do is just remind them one more time, 'Here's what I'm going to do.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The storm that put Game 5 of the World Series on hold played havoc yesterday with the latest round in the battle for Pennsylvania's 21 electoral votes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain had outdoor events scheduled in the Philadelphia area. Obama went ahead with his rally in Chester despite the cold, the wind and the rain; McCain, who started the day in Hershey, chose to postpone his event in Quakertown, where there also was snow. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the most part, the two candidates focused on economic issues. Obama accused McCain of having ridden &quot;shotgun as George Bush has driven our economy toward a cliff,&quot; while McCain said Obama's tax policies would hurt small businesses.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a morning rally at Widener University in Chester, Obama repeatedly hailed the perseverance of his listeners, who stood soaked and shivering in the mud, and urged them to show the same grit and determination next Tuesday. University officials estimated the crowd at 9,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just want all of you to know that if we see this kind of dedication on Election Day, there is no way that we're not going to bring change to America,&quot; Obama said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spoke on an uncovered stage, clad in a rain jacket and jeans instead of his usual business suit. Even though he couldn't go more than a few minutes without a reference to the weather, he did make other points. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to news reports about bonuses being awarded to executives at companies slated to receive federal assistance, Obama said: &quot;Well, they might call that a bonus on Wall Street, but here in Pennsylvania we call it an outrage.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one concession to the conditions, the Secret Service allowed attendees to bring their umbrellas through security. This did not help thousands of people who had read the rules in advance and assumed that umbrellas would be banned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is history, you can't be cold for this,&quot; said Marjorie Watson, 57, a mental-health counselor from Chester who had waited three hours in the great outdoors for Obama to arrive - without an umbrella. &quot;A little nippy,&quot; she said, &quot;but not so cold. It was worth every minute.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, at his event in Hershey, continued to criticize Obama's tax plan, which would raise rates for the top 5 percent on the income scale and give a tax cut to nearly everyone else who filed a tax return. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. Obama is running to be Redistributionist in Chief,&quot; McCain told a crowd that officials at the Giant Center, an indoor concert and sports arena, &quot;guesstimated&quot; at 7,500. &quot;I'm running to be commander in chief.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He continued: &quot;Sen. Obama is running to spread the wealth. I'm running to create more wealth. Sen. Obama is running to punish the successful. I'm running to make everyone successful.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking at the rally was Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who held rallies of her own later in the day in Shippensburg and State College. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interrupted at one point at the Hershey event by boos from some Obama supporters, Palin drew cheers when she told her partisans that she wished security personnel hadn't removed the hecklers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe they can learn a thing or two from people like you,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin is to be in Erie and Williamsport tomorrow. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite polls showing Obama with a lead of about 10 points in Pennsylvania, the GOP ticket continues to press hard in the state - which it virtually has to win to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to reach the White House. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's wonderful to fool the pundits, because we're going to win the state of Pennsylvania,&quot; McCain said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither McCain nor Obama has any return trips to Pennsylvania scheduled, which is not to say they won't return. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the day, McCain campaigned in Fayetteville, N.C., while Obama stumped in Harrisonburg, Va. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There, Obama sought to exploit comments made by Doug Holtz-Eakin, McCain's top economic adviser, concerning the McCain plan to give families a $5,000 tax credit for health insurance while taxing employer-provided health coverage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holtz-Eakin told CNNMoney.com that the coverage many workers now received through their employment was &quot;way better&quot; than what they could get if they took their $5,000 tax credit and tried to use it to purchase coverage on their own. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said he agreed with Holtz-Eakin and added: &quot;John McCain's health-care plan is radical, it's unaffordable, and it's not the change we need right now.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holtz-Eakin said his comments had been taken out of context. He said his point was that individuals could stay with employer-based coverage if it was better than what they could get with the credit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in Columbus, Ohio, McCain received the endorsement of Samuel J. Wurzelbacher. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As &quot;Joe the Plumber,&quot; Wurzelbacher has become a fixture in McCain's speeches and commercials.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonight, Barack Obama caps an unprecedented advertising campaign with the first half-hour presidential commercial on network TV since independent Ross Perot reached into his own deep pockets in 1992 and got higher ratings than some sitcoms. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's likely the 8 p.m. presentation will do that, too, given the sad state of TV sitcoms these days and the fact that Obama will be broadcasting in what is nearly an advertising &quot;roadblock,&quot; across three of the four major networks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seeking to pique curiosity, the Obama campaign has been tight-lipped about the ad, which will cost more than $3 million.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertising pros, however, have some ideas about what the candidate might do. &quot;I think it's a terrific idea,&quot; said AJ Khubani. &quot;I don't know why political candidates don't use infomercials more often.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The founder and CEO of TeleBrands, who has made millions from infomercials selling such wonders as the GoDuster, AmberVision Glasses and the First State Quarters Map over 25 years, may be slightly prejudiced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But marketers generally agree that the buy represents a great opportunity, though everyone contacted for this article also mentioned public fatigue with a presidential campaign cycle that has been raging for nearly a year. Because of that, some said, Obama could suffer a backlash. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's too much advertising,&quot; said Mary Meder, president of Harmelin Media in Bala Cynwyd, which helps market Tastykakes, Fords and other products. &quot;People are ready for the election. They're ready for these ads to be over.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brad Adgate, senior vice president and director of research for Horizon Media in Manhattan, mentioned the concept of &quot;commercial wear-out.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Marketers have a hard time getting their finger on the particulars,&quot; he said, &quot;but if a person sees an ad way too many times, it has more of a negative impact than a positive impact.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertisers combat that possibility by constructing an array of different spots, with different creative messages, behind a brand. In that context, Adgate said, Obama's new format could refresh public opinion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A half hour is different and unique,&quot; said Jon Seitz, managing director at Philadelphia's MayoSeitz Media, which represents the Phillies and Comcast SportsNet, among others. &quot;You can maintain interest if you switch up your content.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seitz also said that because Pennsylvania was one of the election's prime battlegrounds and Philadelphia was its most important market, folks around here could be suffering more campaign-advertising fatigue than those in such uncontested states as Illinois and Alabama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's&nbsp;ad will run on CBS, NBC, Fox, in Spanish on Univision (Channel 65 in Philadelphia) and on cable's BET. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not as if the networks are giving up valuable airspace. CBS3 will move </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The New Adventures of Old Christine</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to 8:30 and preempt </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Gary Unmarried</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. NBC10 will dump </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Knight Rider</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and go with 90 minutes of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Deal or No Deal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at 8:30. Fox29 plans to resume Game 5 of the World Series at 8:37. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABC, unwilling to break up its three-drama Wednesday block, initially would not sell the time to Obama and has been airing promos urging viewers to flee politics in favor of its charming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Pushing Daisies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at 8. By the time it decided to air the ad, and simply bump its lineup back a half hour, the campaign reportedly was no longer interested. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-network buy will cost about $3 million, less than might be expected because Federal Communications Commission regulations require TV entities to offer politicians time at their lowest rates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forgoing public funding and its campaign-finance limits - just as multimillionaire Perot did with his self-financed campaign in 1992 - Obama finds himself awash in advertising dollars, far eclipsing President Bush's $188 million spending spree in 2004. Obama is in line to spend $250 million in the campaign's final four months, a rate that outstrips such big advertisers as McDonald's and Wal-Mart and is beaten only by cell-phone companies Verizon and AT&amp;T. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only about $20 million will go to the national networks (Republican John McCain will spend about half that). But it's the first time since Bob Dole, in 1996, that any major-party candidate has spent on national advertising, after Bill Clinton, in 1992, honed a local-only ad strategy designed to maximize impact in battleground states and advertising markets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What should the candidate do with his time? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All agreed that negativity is a no-no. &quot;If you make too big of a deal of putting down something else, it has a negative impact on the response,&quot; said Khubani, who invented the &quot;As seen on TV&quot; retailing strategy and is sometimes called king of the infomercial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People want to see the product and how it would be used,&quot; Khubani said. &quot;He wants to be president, so people have to see him that way.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it's going to be an ad, per se,&quot; said Meder. &quot;I think he should use the half hour to try to unite the country and tell his story.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He could do anything,&quot; Adgate said. &quot;He could bring [staunch supporters] Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel in to play.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that would grab a few more ratings points than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Knight Rider</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Gary Unmarried.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">FEATURES; DN Yo! Features; Pg. 43</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">798 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">30 ROCK. 9:31 p.m. tomorrow, Channel 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TINA FEY wants out of the Sarah Palin business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if you're a Palin supporter, you'd probably like to see that happen, given that Fey's dead-on impression of the Republican vice presidential candidate helped shape some voters' opinions of the Alaska governor just as they were getting to know her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if you want what's best for Sarah Palin, you owe it to yourself to laugh yourself silly over the return of NBC's &quot;30 Rock&quot; tomorrow night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because this is no time for Fey to be losing her day job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The season premiere finds TV comedy producer Liz Lemon (Fey) scrambling to make her insane workplace look child-friendly to a social worker (Megan Mullaly) who's evaluating her as a prospective adoptive parent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a gutsy beginning, given that next week's show features a decent-sized cameo by Oprah Herself, but a good introduction to &quot;30 Rock,&quot; a screwball comedy that's married Fey's responsible and subversive sides and harnessed the power of Alec Baldwin for funny, not fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things have been going so well for Upper Darby's Fey lately that it might be hard to imagine that all those Emmys for the show she created and stars in, combined with the praise for pitching in to play Palin on &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; wouldn't push &quot;30 Rock&quot; closer to the top of the Nielsens in it third season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or even just higher up in the middle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's easier to imagine that not happening, though, if you follow NBC, which first lost an opportunity by holding &quot;30 Rock's&quot; premiere to the end of October, after all its other Thursday night comedies came back, and then last week decided to put it online before airing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take it from someone whose words hit the Web before the paper hits the front steps: This is the mainstream media equivalent of the Bridge to Nowhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, I love it that more and more I can find the shows I forgot to watch or record online the next day. Don't even mind the unzappable commercials. But there's something considerably less special about watching something in real time on my actual TV, knowing that it's been in the ether for a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, most of my advance screening's still done on good old-fashioned DVDs, which arrive with increasingly hysterical warnings about seizing firstborns - or barring that, family pets - should any critic be brazen enough to upload what the networks have already uploaded themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe they should just encourage us to share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Pushing' &amp; ObamaMalia Obama probably isn't the only TV viewer who doesn't want her daddy interfering with her freedom of choice tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her mother, Michelle, told Jay Leno Monday night on NBC's &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; that the couple's 10-year-old expressed concern that Barack Obama's plan to buy time on all the major networks and some cable channels at 8 p.m. might interrupt her viewing. She apparently was reassured to learn the half-hour buy didn't include the Disney Channel or Nickelodeon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of yesterday, it also didn't include ABC, which, according to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Washington Post </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">TV columnist Lisa de Moraes, did eventually offer to sell the time to the Obama campaign, only to be turned down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should this lead to the highest ratings ever for ABC's &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot; (8 tonight, Channel 6), the Disney-owned network will no doubt feel happy with its original decision to hold out - reportedly, it had offered the Obama campaign other time slots - and if it doesn't, the writing could be on the wall for one of my favorite shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either way, I'm not sure prime-time pre-emptions are the smartest move for Obama, who's also scheduled to appear tonight via satellite on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; (11 p.m., Comedy Central).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, record fund-raising has left his campaign with the kind of wealth he has no intention of sharing with John McCain - and he has to spend it somewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, it's hard getting beyond the soundbites of the typical political ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, yes, the pre-emption of NBC's &quot;Knight Rider&quot; might constitute a public service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it feels like piling on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe McCain, who's scheduled to appear on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; tonight (9 p.m., CNN), wouldn't have chosen to take a half-hour of prime time at any price (though his proposal for 10 &quot;town hall&quot;-style debates suggests he'd have grabbed all the free face time he could get).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think anyone should be forced to watch anything, ever - hey, I didn't even condone torture in support of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; - but I do think the broadcast industry, which is essentially subsidized by all of us through its use of the public airwaves, can afford to give a half-hour every four years to each of the major parties' candidates in the week before the election to say or do whatever he or she wants, regardless of how much money's been raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if that makes me a socialist, so be it. *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Illinois Sen. Barack Obama will use his prime-time half-hour infomercial tonight to make what is effectively a closing argument to a national audience of millions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times, the Democratic presidential nominee will speak directly into the camera about his 20-month campaign; at others, he will highlight everyday voters, their everyday troubles and his plans to address them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign agreed to provide The New York Times with a minute-long trailer for the 30-minute program, which is to run on four broadcast networks at 8 p.m. It will be the first time in 16 years that a presidential candidate has bought network time, in prime time, for a prolonged campaign commercial.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trailer is heavy in strings, flags, presidential imagery and some Americana filmed by Davis Guggenheim, whose father was the campaign documentarian of Robert F. Kennedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the screen flashes scenes of suburban lawns, a freight train and Mr. Obama seated at a kitchen table with a group of white, apparently working-class voters, the candidate says: &quot;We've seen over the last eight years how decisions by a president can have a profound effect on the course of history and on American lives; much that's wrong with our country goes back even farther than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, while standing before a stately desk and an American flag, Mr. Obama, in a suit, says: &quot;We've been talking about the same problems for decades, and nothing is ever done to solve them. For the past 20 months, I've traveled the length of this country, and Michelle and I have met so many Americans who are looking for real and lasting change that makes a difference in their lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Margolis, Mr. Obama's senior advertising strategist, said the program would then go on to feature &quot;the stories of four different Americans, or American families, and kind of what they're confronting.&quot; He said the stories would highlight &quot;the challenges people are facing and what we should do in terms of solutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Margolis said the senator would also share the story of his mother, &quot;who struggled through her bout with breast cancer and the difficulty she had with her insurance company, to help viewers understand why his health care reform program is what it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The telecast will also have a live component, featuring Mr. Obama at a rally in Florida. The infomercial has been under production for weeks in the Virginia office of Mark Putnam, whose firm, Murphy-Putnam, is part of the Obama advertising team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program is to be shown on NBC, CBS, Fox, Univision and two cable networks that cater to African-Americans, BET and TV One. Thus the ad will blanket all the major broadcast networks except one -- ABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempting to protect its struggling Wednesday lineup, ABC tried to reach an agreement with the Obama camp to air the commercial on a different night, said people familiar with the discussions, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABC later had a change of heart, but by the time it decided to make tonight's time slot available for the Obama spot, his campaign had already finalized its ad buy, those sources said. ABC instead will air an episode of the hourlong &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot; as scheduled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ross Perot, the last presidential candidate to run similar programming, broadcast eight long infomercials to an average of 13 million viewers, with one of them getting 16.5 million viewers. Costing the Obama campaign more than $3 million, the infomercial is the ultimate reflection of his team's spending flexibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's Republican rival, Arizona Sen. John McCain, with far less money in the bank, has been unable to produce a similar commercial. The McCain campaign has seized on the Obama advertisement as excessive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a campaign stop this week, Mr. McCain pointed to reports that the infomercial on Fox would bump back by 15 minutes resumption of the rain-suspended Game 5 of the World Series in Philadelphia. &quot;No one will delay the World Series with an infomercial when I'm president,&quot; he told an audience that likely included Phillies fans in Hershey, Pa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Website Politico.com yesterday quoted a Fox executive as saying the infomercial was not causing a delay of the game. Fox instead decided to pre-empt its pre-game show and will start baseball coverage after the Obama&nbsp;commercial's 8:30 p.m. conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For its part, the Obama campaign said it was not worried about turning off viewers. &quot;Many people have 150 channels; they've got plenty of other choices,&quot; Mr. Margolis said. &quot;Or they can drop into a video game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then again, Mr. Obama is advertising in video games, too.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over and over, we have slogged up one side of a debate and down the other, we have pushed hard against unfavorable political headwinds, we have stopped for liquid refreshment (energy drinks, i.e., beer), we have laughed, we have cried and we have seen our brains turned into mush by ridiculous TV commercials and robo-calls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But mostly we have laughed in our exhaustion -- that is, those of us who packed a sense of humor in our fanny packs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Has there ever been a more humorous race? As one who has been running in the pack behind Barack Obama, I and my fellow humorists have been treated to the ultimate running joke. As we approach the finish line, our leaden feet are light again remembering the hilarious moments in an otherwise wretched McMarathon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who can forget the smiling, skull-faced Rudy Giuliani at the Republican National Convention, making sport of community organizers the day after the convention had dedicated itself to &quot;Service?&quot; We peasants were meant to understand that Barack Obama was an oddball for choosing to help the poor when he could have been making millions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it happens, the desperate effort to make Sen. Obama into an elitist has been hilarious for connoisseurs of the genre who know that there's nothing more elitist than treating the voters like rubes. Here's a guy who spent much of his childhood being brought up by his grandparents and a single mother, yet he is painted as if he wears a top hat and tails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wacky fun continues now that Joe the Plumber has become the new philosopher of the age. Joe the Plumber turned out to be Joe the Great Pretender, not even licensed to wear his pants low enough to expose his buttocks in the time-honored way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But did that deter John McCain? Heck, no, because reality has never been allowed to intrude into his campaign, especially the reality of George W. Bush's long shadow. Apparently reality is not maverick enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe the Plumber's contribution was to elicit from Barack the Candidate the mild observation that it's good for everybody when wealth is spread around -- which, as The New Yorker pointed out, was not far away from what Adam Smith said in &quot;The Wealth of Nations,&quot; the alternative bible for conservatives. Still, the cry went up throughout the land: &quot;Socialist! Socialist! Marxist! Marxist!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once more the GOP has made a straw man out of a very thin reed. Never mind that this country is now owned by Communist China, that George Bush went to the Beijing Olympics so as not to offend the princes of Marxism, and that we have just handed over $700 billion to bail out Wall Street, the joke is that the moderate Barack Obama is the socialist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling Barack a socialist is like calling George W. Bush a fascist -- tempting perhaps, sort of fun to do, but this side of collective farming or new Nuremberg rallies, a certain proof of crackpot tendencies. The greater joke is that many people haven't got the faintest idea what socialism is. The classic definition includes the government taking over the means of production, but Mr. Obama hasn't suggested any such thing except in the fevered imaginations of the GOP (the Grumpy Old Party).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Obama campaign volunteer, who has been knocking on doors in the Pittsburgh area, related to me what one voter gave as her reason for not voting for the Democrat: She doesn't want &quot;anyone who is social in the job.&quot; I sympathize up to a point -- an endless round of cocktail parties is not good and there's no speaking with Putin with a mouth full of hors d'oeuvres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But way beyond this low comedy, nothing has been funnier than Sarah Palin, John McCain's perky but content-free running mate. It's just been one drollery after another with St. Sarah. How many of us hurt our ribs laughing when her absence of foreign policy experience was justified by reference to the fact that one can see Russia from a part of Alaska? Please stop, we said, you're killing us!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And how about learning that she was made witch-proof by some risible reverend? (Not a bad idea, actually, considering that the current vice president was long ago turned into a poisonous toad.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be that Mr. McCain and the patron saint of moose may yet have the last laugh at the end of the race. Why not? Voters could react well to having their collective intelligence insulted. Alas, the joke then will be on everyone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a purely technical standpoint, &quot;The Barack Obama Political Message&quot; was extremely well crafted with high production values. Sure, you can criticize it to some degree as a clip show since it used excerpts from Obama's speeches, convention biography film and commercials. Some of the scenes had a faint musty smell about them because they'd aired before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is no denying the power of the packaging and presentation. I'd love to know who put it together, especially the docu-drama segments. Obama narrated the hard luck stories of several American families over cinematography brought to mind high-minded PBS programs such as &quot;The Farmer's Wife&quot; or &quot;Country Boys.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This half-hour paid political advertisement, which aired on multiple broadcast and cable networks, began with those favorite political cliches: Images of golden wheat blowing in the breeze and big sky country. Obama spoke about the tough times the country has faced of late and then viewers saw him standing in front of the American flag, near a desk, in a wood-paneled office with a bay window to the outdoors in the background. (Anyone who crowed over the Greek columns at the Democratic convention is sure to howl that the set looked like a rustic version of the Oval Office.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama introduced viewers to the demographically diverse families -- white, black, hispanic -- and narrated their stories. You can argue with his policies, but the families in this half-hour ad came across as genuine. And they didn't lavish praise upon the candidate. I don't think any of them actually said anything about Obama. They just told their stories, which Obama used as examples of why a change is needed in Washington. Then he went about laying out why he's the right person to make those changes happen, seguing into the familiar talking points of his economic policies. When the show went to Obama's plans, it got boring but obviously his campaign felt it necessary to get these points across again. I'm sure it was designed for average Americans, not anyone obsessed with this election since those people know who they're voting for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(One possible flaw in the presentation: Obama said he will cut taxes for families making less than $200,000. On some message boards, conservative partisans are already jumping on that, claiming Obama has gone back on what he's said in the past. What I recall hearing in the past was Obama saying he would not raise taxes on those making more then $250,000, which would seem to be a different way of saying something similar. Look for the discrepancy -- or the perceived discrepancy depending on what has actually been said in the past -- to turn up in a McCain&nbsp;ad. Interestingly, I don't think Obama's 30-minute spot ever mentioned McCain or even alluded to Obama having an opponent. That's probably a smart tactical move.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What I found fascinating was the program's fluency with all the bells and whistles of prime-time network programming. The Web address for Obama's campaign site crept up in the lower right corner. An on-screen banner promised, &quot;Live Obama Event Later in the Program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program even played like a Very Special Episode for sweeps month with cameo appearances by Michelle Obama, VP nominee Joe Biden, Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius and Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's&nbsp;ad also made excellent use of music. Strings -- guitar mostly, I think -- underscored most of the program, especially the stories of real people. And then, as the time for the live portion of the show approached, the music suddenly shifted into a more rousing, upbeat tempo. By the end of the half-hour, the music made me think of the uplifting score from NBC's &quot;The West Wing,&quot; an intentional echo, no doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama discussed his mother, who died of cancer, as an emotional call for health care reform. And he offered a mini-biography of running mate Biden. Obama even took a risk in offering up a sound bite that could be used by his political adversaries, acknowledging, &quot;I am not a perfect man. I will not be perfect President but I can promise you this: I will always tell you what I think and where I stand. I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you when we disagree. And most importantly, I will open the doors of government and ask you to be involved in your own democracy again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the live portion of the program, Obama, to thunderous applause, proclaimed, &quot;In six days we can choose hope over fear, unity over division, the power of change over the power of the status quo. In six days we can come together as one nation, one people, and once more choose our better history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was stirring rhetoric, but did anyone watch? We'll see what Nielsen says tomorrow. And did this convince Americans to buy the product advertised -- Barack Obama -- by casting a vote for him at the polls? We'll find out on Tuesday. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday's Tuned In column previews the new syndicated fantasy series &quot;Legend of the Seeker,&quot; based on the Terry Goodkind book series. The show premieres Saturday at 5 p.m. on WPCW and stars Craig Horner (left) and Bridget Regan who seek to keep an evil force from ruling a &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;-like land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The show is from the executive producers of &quot;Xena&quot; and &quot;Hercules,&quot; Rob Tapert and Sam Raimi. In a teleconference with reporters last week, Raimi, the director of the popular &quot;Spider-Man&quot; films, said he was unfamiliar with the Goodkind books until this project came up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read it and I was just swept away like I am during the best of the original William Shatner 'Star Trek' episodes,&quot; Raimi said. &quot;It has all the classic elements of sword and sorcery types of adventures.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARRISBURG - Barack Obama is leading John McCain among likely voters in Pennsylvania, with the economy and concern about the country's overall direction weighing heavily on their minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Associated Press-GfK poll released Wednesday showed Obama with 52 percent to McCain's 40 percent in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll, taken over five days ending Sunday, found that nearly 90 percent of voters said they were worried about the state's economic conditions, and nearly three-quarters said they worried about their own family's financial situation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Pennsylvania's jobless rate is below the national rate, the state reported a loss of more than 12,000 nonfarm jobs in September - the biggest monthly loss in five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama supporter Dawn Allen said she and her boyfriend have seen their combined income drop by about $20,000 since last year. Allen, 44, is self-employed and cleans office buildings on weekends; her boyfriend works in commercial construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My grocery shopping's cut to once a week - if we run out, we run out,&quot; said Allen, who lives in rural Troy, near the New York border. &quot;I go without. I don't get my hair cut or dyed anymore, and new clothes are not an option.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allen, who describes herself as Democratic-leaning independent, said a Democratic president would be better equipped to improve the economy and access to education and health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, likely voters clearly preferred Obama as the candidate they trusted to improve the economy, handle the financial crisis and make the right decisions on health care. They were more evenly divided between Obama and McCain when it came to national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly eight in 10 voters surveyed said the country was headed in the wrong direction, and more than half strongly disapproved of the way President Bush is handling his job. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allan Wilkins, a moderate Republican from Bethlehem, said his dissatisfaction with Bush factored heavily into his decision to vote for Obama. Additionally, Obama running-mate Joe Biden would be an effective foreign-policy adviser and can draw on his extensive Senate experience to help Obama work effectively with Congress, Wilkins said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You never, ever vote for a president; you always vote for the people who surround him,&quot; said Wilkins, a 65-year-old information technology consultant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ralph Reiland, an associate economics professor at Robert Morris University in Pittsburgh, sided with the majority on the country's direction and Bush's performance. But he supports McCain, albeit reluctantly; Reiland said he is not convinced that either candidate can be trusted to handle the financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're both scripted, and I don't know if either one understands the complexity ... how to find the way out of this economic downturn,&quot; Reiland said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reiland, 67, who also owns a Middle Eastern restaurant, sees McCain's desire to limit government growth and cut taxes as a better remedy for the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's problem is that he would increase taxes on job-creators, and that's not good for the middle class or poor people,&quot; Reiland said. &quot;You don't help workers by crushing their employers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also enjoys a significant edge over McCain among women, with 60 percent saying they will vote for him or have already voted for him by absentee ballot, and he appears to have attracted a bare majority of independent voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania Democrats head into the Nov. 4 election with a voter-registration advantage of more than 1.2 million over Republicans, so McCain almost certainly needs to do well among independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AP-GfK survey in Pennsylvania consisted of telephone interviews with a nationally representative random sample of 607 adults deemed likely to vote. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NORFOLK, Va. - Barack Obama will be a one-man television blitz on Wednesday, saturating prime-time with a 30-minute ad and popping up on the buzzy late-night TV scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is also giving an interview to a prominent network news anchor, and appearing with fellow Democratic star Bill Clinton at a rally that is timed to hit the late-evening news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So that line in Obama's stump speech about how parents need to turn the television off more at home? He might make an exception this day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The TV campaign comes as Obama, ahead in national and swing-state polls over Republican John McCain, tries to win over teetering voters right from the comfort of their couches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election is six days away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centerpiece of the effort is Obama's infomercial. It is rare for a candidate to buy a block of prime-time real estate to tell his story. Plenty costly, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is expected to be a video montage of typical people talking about the challenges they face, with Obama explaining how he can help. A campaign adviser said the taped ad will feature a live cut-in to Obama, who is scheduled to be at a rally in Florida at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama team bought time on CBS, NBC and Fox for about $1 million per network. The spot airs at 8 p.m. EDT. It is also scheduled to run on Univision, BET, MSNBC and TV One.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flush with cash from his record-shattering fundraising, Obama uses that advantage by buying up media time in ways that McCain cannot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is purchasing loads of ad time, too. But the disparity between Obama and the Republicans is so wide that it has allowed Obama to spend in more states than McCain, appear more frequently in key markets and diversify his messages - some positive, some negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign planned to roll out another ad on Thursday, a 30-second spot aimed at key states that uses McCain's own words against him. The three quotes, one from 2005 and two from 2007, play off McCain's acknowledgment that he knows less about economic issues than others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is campaigning Wednesday in North Carolina and Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a stop in Raleigh, N.C., he will be interviewed by Charlie Gibson of ABC's &quot;World News.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, in Florida, Obama will tape an appearance on Comedy Central's irreverent &quot;The Daily Show&quot; with Jon Stewart. The segment will run at 11 p.m. EDT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama may even be competing with himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the same 11 p.m. slot, Obama is scheduled to appear at a campaign rally for the first time with Clinton, whose wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, lost to Obama in the primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uniting of the former president and the would-be president in Kissimmee, Fla., is sure to draw live local and national television coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's not all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Obama is giving interviews to Brian Williams, anchor of NBC's &quot;Nightly News,&quot; and to Rachel Maddow, the host of an evening show on MSNBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two viewers who don't seem excited about all the exposure are Obama's two young daughters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appearing on Jay Leno's talk show Monday, Obama's wife, Michelle, said 10-year-old daughter Malia got a little worried to hear that her dad's infomercial would blanket TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'You're going to be on all the TV? Are you going to interrupt my TV?'&quot; her mother said Malia asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michelle Obama said the presidential candidate assured his daughter that he hadn't bought time on the Disney Channel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The margin is wider among white voters earning less than $50,000 a year the kinds of voters who helped Hillary Clinton beat Obama in the state's April primary. Fifty-nine percent said they supported Obama, while 31 percent said they would vote for McCain. The two candidates' support among whites earning more than $50,000 a year was about even. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll, taken over five days ending Sunday, found that nearly 90 percent of voters said they were worried about the state's economic conditions, and nearly three-quarters said they worried about their own family's financial situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Pennsylvania's jobless rate is below the national rate, the state reported a loss of more than 12,000 nonfarm jobs in September the biggest monthly loss in five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama supporter Dawn Allen said she and her boyfriend have seen their combined income drop by about $20,000 since last year. Allen, 44, is self-employed and cleans office buildings on weekends; her boyfriend works in commercial construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My grocery shopping's cut to once a week if we run out, we run out,&quot; said Allen, who lives in rural Troy, near the New York border. &quot;I go without. I don't get my hair cut or dyed anymore, and new clothes are not an option.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allen, who describes herself as Democratic-leaning independent, said a Democratic president would be better equipped to improve the economy and access to education and health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, likely voters clearly preferred Obama as the candidate they trusted to improve the economy, handle the financial crisis and make the right decisions on health care. They were more evenly divided between Obama and McCain when it came to national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly eight in 10 voters surveyed said the country was headed in the wrong direction, and more than half strongly disapproved of the way President Bush is handling his job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allan Wilkins, a moderate Republican from Bethlehem, said his dissatisfaction with Bush factored heavily into his decision to vote for Obama. Additionally, Obama running-mate Joe Biden would be an effective foreign-policy adviser and can draw on his extensive Senate experience to help Obama work effectively with Congress, Wilkins said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You never, ever vote for a president; you always vote for the people who surround him,&quot; said Wilkins, a 65-year-old information technology consultant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ralph Reiland, an associate economics professor at Robert Morris University in Pittsburgh, sided with the majority on the country's direction and Bush's performance. But he supports McCain, albeit reluctantly; Reiland said he is not convinced that either candidate can be trusted to handle the financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're both scripted, and I don't know if either one understands the complexity ... how to find the way out of this economic downturn,&quot; Reiland said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reiland, 67, who also owns a Middle Eastern restaurant, sees McCain's desire to limit government growth and cut taxes as a better remedy for the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's problem is that he would increase taxes on job-creators, and that's not good for the middle class or poor people,&quot; Reiland said. &quot;You don't help workers by crushing their employers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll indicated that Obama had an overwhelming lead in Philadelphia and a probable advantage over McCain in the state's northeastern region and the Pittsburgh area. McCain appeared to have an edge in the Republican-leaning central and northern part of the state and was running about even with Obama in the Philadelphia suburbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also enjoys a significant edge over McCain among women, with 60 percent saying they will vote for him or have already voted for him by absentee ballot, and he appears to have attracted a bare majority of independent voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania Democrats head into the Nov. 4 election with a voter-registration advantage of more than 1.2 million over Republicans, so McCain almost certainly needs to do well among independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Robert Gleason said he believes statewide polls are generally skewed because of the Democratic Party's voter-registration dominance. He said recent surveys have been &quot;all over the lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now, we're so close to the election that most people will find the polls meaningless,&quot; Gleason said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Ed Rendell, who is campaigning across the state for Obama this week, questioned whether Obama's advantage over McCain was as wide as the poll suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This race is much closer, and no Obama supporter should believe (the polls),&quot; Rendell said Wednesday through a spokesman. &quot;We have too much work to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AP-GfK survey in Pennsylvania consisted of telephone interviews with a nationally representative random sample of 607 adults deemed likely to vote. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By TOM MURSE and AD CRABLE / New Era Staff Writers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HERSHEY - Republican presidential nominee John McCain vowed to &quot;fool the pundits&quot; and win Pennsylvania a week from today, while running mate Sarah Palin sharply criticized Democrat Barack Obama's spending and tax plan, referring to him as &quot;Barack the wealth spreader&quot; at a raucus rally here this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Raising taxes make a bad economy much worse,&quot; McCain said before some 8,000 cheering supporters, including many from Lancaster County, at the Giant Center. &quot;That's a lesson of history which our opponents ignore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He favors higher taxes for investment in 'fairness,'&quot; the U.S. senator from Arizona said. &quot;There's nothing fair about driving the economy into the ground. We'll suffer when that happens. He's more interested in controlling wealth than creating it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, delivering a vigorous closing argument in the race for Pennsylvania's 21 electoral votes in a state where polls show he is losing badly, said, &quot;Senator Obama is running to be redistributionist in chief. I'm running to be commander in chief. Senator Obama is running to spread the wealth. I'm running to create wealth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin referred to Joe Wurzelbacher, the plumber who became a symbol when he confronted Obama at an Ohio campaign rally earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really got to hand it to Joe the plumber there in Toledo, Ohio. Somehow Joe got our opponent to finally state his intentions, in plain language. Senator Obama is now saying he wants to spread the wealth,&quot; Palin said. &quot;What that means is government taking more of your money, more money from small businesses, and doling it out however they see fit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama calls it spreading the wealth. Joe Biden calls paying higher taxes patriotic,&quot; she said. &quot;Joe the plumber said it sounded to him like socialism. Now is not the time to experiment with that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's speech was interrupted briefly by Obama supporters, who were quickly drowned out by chants of &quot;McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alaska governor recovered quickly, saying, &quot;When we hear protests like that I'm always tempted to tell security, 'Let them stay. Maybe they could learn a thing or two from all of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Palin pulled into the arena in the Straight Talk Express bus, which edged slowly onto the floor at 10:15 as &quot;Eye of the Tiger,&quot; the &quot;Rocky&quot; theme song, played loudly over the public-address system. They were accompanied by their spouses, Cindy McCain and Todd Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. McCain referred to three Palin and McCain family members in the service and serving in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is just those reasons that when my husband took the stand he did, made the votes he did, it showed not only experience, leadership and character, but we had a vested interest in it,&quot; Mrs. McCain said. &quot;Our son was there. When we talk about someone who could or should be president, you look for those qualities - experience, leadership and most of all character.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Palin spoke from a stage surrounded by cheering supporters, including several dozen elementary and middle school-age children who stood on a riser behind them. The candidates were flanked by a &quot;Victory in Pennsylvania&quot; sign and massive American flag. Supporters waved home-made signs that read &quot;Families for McCain,&quot; &quot;Palin Power,&quot; &quot;McCain Nation&quot; and &quot;I am Joe the plumber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were also numerous campaign signs for local candidates -- Republican state Rep. Dave Hickernell, who represents northwest Lancaster County, and GOP state auditor general nominee Chet Beiler, a Manheim-area businessman - posted throughout the Giant Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the rally began, the crowd took turns chanting, &quot;Sarah&quot; and &quot;Palin.&quot; The crowd sang and danced to Shania Twain's &quot;Man, I Feel Like a Woman!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Palin hope rallies such as this boost turnout in the Republican-rich midstate and help offset typically large Democratic margins in Philadelphia. However, at least one recent statewide opinion poll, conducted by Franklin &amp; Marshall College, showed the race was a dead heat in Central Pennsylvania, historically the GOP's bread and butter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, however, said he was out to prove the polls - which have shown Obama leading by double digits - and pollsters wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's wonderful to be back in Pennsylvania,&quot; he said. &quot;It's wonderful to fool the pundits, because we're going to win Pennsylvania on November 4.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also made reference to reports that he and Palin, and their respective aides, have clashed in recent weeks. &quot;By the way,&quot; McCain told the crowd, &quot;when two mavericks join up, we don't agree on everything, but that's a lot of fun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of McCain's address, however, focused on taxes and spending, and reviewing federal programs and &quot;scrubbing&quot; ones that don't work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also chided Obama, saying the Democratic nominee described the &quot;tragedy&quot; of the civil rights movement as being that it didn't bring about a redistribution of wealth in society. &quot;He's more interested in controlling wealth than creating it,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also warned that Democrats would control the White House, as well as both chambers of Congress, if Obama is elected. Democrats hold a majority in both the House and Senate, and polls suggest they are likely to increase their edge in the election. Few have suggested Republicans can take either chamber back, and McCain and Palin argue that leaves only the White House to serve as a check on Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official crowd count was not immediately available. However, the Giant Center can accommodate 10,500 people. The facility, home to the Hershey Bears hockey team, was about three-quarters full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Hershey, Palin was traveling to Shippensburg for an afternoon event, and then State College for an evening rally. A planned late-morning rally at Memorial Stadium in the Philadelphia suburb of Quakertown was canceled due to rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, meantime, was speaking at Widener University in Chester this morning. Former President Bill Clinton is expected to campaign on Obama's behalf in State College and Harrisburg on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd, carrying signs such as &quot;Mac is back,&quot; &quot;Stand up and fight'' and &quot;Joe the Chocolate Maker,'' waited patiently in the cold rain before dawn until the doors to the arena opened at 7:25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once inside, supporters positioned themselves around the stage in the middle of the floor, beneath the center scoreboard which read, &quot;Country First.'' They exchanged cheers and sang along with music piped over the loudspeakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around the arena, large blue-and-gold signs read &quot;Victory in Pennsylvania,'' and huge American flags hung at either end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leslie Barton, 21, of Mountville, belted out the national anthem around 9 a.m. and the crowd responded with thunderous applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really like Sarah Palin,'' Barton said, before she took the stage. &quot;I think she brings a lot to the table. She represents a lot of Americans who come from small towns and small businesses.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Millersville University junior and self-described conservative Republican, Barton said she is a business major, but would prefer to pursue a singing career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To her long list of credits in that area, Barton sang the national anthem at the Philadelphia Eagles football game a few weeks ago and is a regular at the Hershey Bears hockey games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Raffensberger, 28, of Columbia, took off work today so he could see the candidates in Hershey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A plumber, Raffensberger said he can relate to the infamous &quot;Joe the Plumber,'' but the foremost reason he supports the McCain-Palin ticket is because of his faith and their pro-life stand on abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raffensberger said he was up at 2:30 a.m. to get his spot directly in front of center stage at the rally this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Patriotism never sleeps,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. John McCain served our country and did not leave his men behind. That proves his integrity and valor,'' Raffensberger said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Obama, Raffensberger said, &quot;He doesn't know the core value of the true American spirit.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as to Palin, Raffensberger added, &quot;How much more American can you get?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accompanying him this morning was Linda Jo Morrow, 50, of Columbia, who typically baby-sits Raffensberger's two children. (Mrs. Raffensberger stayed home to care for the children today).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morrow, a mother of a U.S. Marine, was recognized by President George W. Bush for her volunteer work for servicemen, including the &quot;Mums for Moms'' program, delivering chrysanthemums to military mothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think John McCain will do right by our servicemen and I don't think Obama will,'' Morrow said. &quot;We should finish what we started,'' she said, referring to the war in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A registered Democrat, Morrow not only supports McCain but came to the rally carrying a picture of her being hugged by Bush during a visit to Lancaster County in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wesley Copley, 65, and his wife, Diana, 63, traveled from Paradise this morning and waited outside the arena 45 minutes to get into the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copley served in the U.S. Navy for 26 years and proudly wore his Navy cap this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he's the right man for our country,'' Copley said of McCain. &quot;We need someone who's strong, decisive and a straight shooter.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. McCain will tell it like it is and that's the kind of president I want,'' Copley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The military doesn't need their budget cut by 25 percent right now with two wars,'' Mrs. Copley added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Palin, Mrs. Copley likes her, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think she's got a lot of spunk in her.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Raising taxes make a bad economy much worse,&quot; McCain said before some 8,000 cheering supporters, including many from Lancaster County, at the Giant Center. &quot;That's a lesson of history which our opponents ignore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He favors higher taxes for investment in 'fairness,'&quot; the U.S. senator from Arizona said. &quot;There's nothing fair about driving the economy into the ground. We'll suffer when that happens. He's more interested in controlling wealth than creating it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, delivering a vigorous closing argument in the race for Pennsylvania's 21 electoral votes in a state where polls show he is losing badly, said, &quot;Senator Obama is running to be redistributionist in chief. I'm running to be commander in chief. Senator Obama is running to spread the wealth. I'm running to create wealth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin referred to Joe Wurzelbacher, the plumber who became a symbol when he confronted Obama at an Ohio campaign rally earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really got to hand it to Joe the plumber there in Toledo, Ohio. Somehow Joe got our opponent to finally state his intentions, in plain language. Senator Obama is now saying he wants to spread the wealth,&quot; Palin said. &quot;What that means is government taking more of your money, more money from small businesses, and doling it out however they see fit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama calls it spreading the wealth. Joe Biden calls paying higher taxes patriotic,&quot; she said. &quot;Joe the plumber said it sounded to him like socialism. Now is not the time to experiment with that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's speech was interrupted briefly by Obama supporters, who were quickly drowned out by chants of &quot;McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alaska governor recovered quickly, saying, &quot;When we hear protests like that I'm always tempted to tell security, 'Let them stay. Maybe they could learn a thing or two from all of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Palin pulled into the arena in the Straight Talk Express bus, which edged slowly onto the floor at 10:15 as &quot;Eye of the Tiger,&quot; the &quot;Rocky&quot; theme song, played loudly over the public-address system. They were accompanied by their spouses, Cindy McCain and Todd Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. McCain referred to three Palin and McCain family members in the service and serving in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is just those reasons that when my husband took the stand he did, made the votes he did, it showed not only experience, leadership and character, but we had a vested interest in it,&quot; Mrs. McCain said. &quot;Our son was there. When we talk about someone who could or should be president, you look for those qualities - experience, leadership and most of all character.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Palin spoke from a stage surrounded by cheering supporters, including several dozen elementary and middle school-age children who stood on a riser behind them. The candidates were flanked by a &quot;Victory in Pennsylvania&quot; sign and massive American flag. Supporters waved home-made signs that read &quot;Families for McCain,&quot; &quot;Palin Power,&quot; &quot;McCain Nation&quot; and &quot;I am Joe the plumber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were also numerous campaign signs for local candidates -- Republican state Rep. Dave Hickernell, who represents northwest Lancaster County, and GOP state auditor general nominee Chet Beiler, a Manheim-area businessman - posted throughout the Giant Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the rally began, the crowd took turns chanting, &quot;Sarah&quot; and &quot;Palin.&quot; The crowd sang and danced to Shania Twain's &quot;Man, I Feel Like a Woman!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Palin hope rallies such as this boost turnout in the Republican-rich midstate and help offset typically large Democratic margins in Philadelphia. However, at least one recent statewide opinion poll, conducted by Franklin &amp; Marshall College, showed the race was a dead heat in Central Pennsylvania, historically the GOP's bread and butter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, however, said he was out to prove the polls - which have shown Obama leading by double digits - and pollsters wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's wonderful to be back in Pennsylvania,&quot; he said. &quot;It's wonderful to fool the pundits, because we're going to win Pennsylvania on November 4.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also made reference to reports that he and Palin, and their respective aides, have clashed in recent weeks. &quot;By the way,&quot; McCain told the crowd, &quot;when two mavericks join up, we don't agree on everything, but that's a lot of fun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of McCain's address, however, focused on taxes and spending, and reviewing federal programs and &quot;scrubbing&quot; ones that don't work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also chided Obama, saying the Democratic nominee described the &quot;tragedy&quot; of the civil rights movement as being that it didn't bring about a redistribution of wealth in society. &quot;He's more interested in controlling wealth than creating it,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also warned that Democrats would control the White House, as well as both chambers of Congress, if Obama is elected. Democrats hold a majority in both the House and Senate, and polls suggest they are likely to increase their edge in the election. Few have suggested Republicans can take either chamber back, and McCain and Palin argue that leaves only the White House to serve as a check on Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official crowd count was not immediately available. However, the Giant Center can accommodate 10,500 people. The facility, home to the Hershey Bears hockey team, was about three-quarters full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Hershey, Palin was traveling to Shippensburg for an afternoon event, and then State College for an evening rally. A planned late-morning rally at Memorial Stadium in the Philadelphia suburb of Quakertown was canceled due to rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, meantime, was speaking at Widener University in Chester this morning. Former President Bill Clinton is expected to campaign on Obama's behalf in State College and Harrisburg on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd, carrying signs such as &quot;Mac is back,&quot; &quot;Stand up and fight'' and &quot;Joe the Chocolate Maker,'' waited patiently in the cold rain before dawn until the doors to the arena opened at 7:25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once inside, supporters positioned themselves around the stage in the middle of the floor, beneath the center scoreboard which read, &quot;Country First.'' They exchanged cheers and sang along with music piped over the loudspeakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around the arena, large blue-and-gold signs read &quot;Victory in Pennsylvania,'' and huge American flags hung at either end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leslie Barton, 21, of Mountville, belted out the national anthem around 9 a.m. and the crowd responded with thunderous applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really like Sarah Palin,'' Barton said, before she took the stage. &quot;I think she brings a lot to the table. She represents a lot of Americans who come from small towns and small businesses.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Millersville University junior and self-described conservative Republican, Barton said she is a business major, but would prefer to pursue a singing career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To her long list of credits in that area, Barton sang the national anthem at the Philadelphia Eagles football game a few weeks ago and is a regular at the Hershey Bears hockey games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Raffensberger, 28, of Columbia, took off work today so he could see the candidates in Hershey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A plumber, Raffensberger said he can relate to the infamous &quot;Joe the Plumber,'' but the foremost reason he supports the McCain-Palin ticket is because of his faith and their pro-life stand on abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raffensberger said he was up at 2:30 a.m. to get his spot directly in front of center stage at the rally this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Patriotism never sleeps,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. John McCain served our country and did not leave his men behind. That proves his integrity and valor,'' Raffensberger said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Obama, Raffensberger said, &quot;He doesn't know the core value of the true American spirit.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as to Palin, Raffensberger added, &quot;How much more American can you get?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accompanying him this morning was Linda Jo Morrow, 50, of Columbia, who typically baby-sits Raffensberger's two children. (Mrs. Raffensberger stayed home to care for the children today).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morrow, a mother of a U.S. Marine, was recognized by President George W. Bush for her volunteer work for servicemen, including the &quot;Mums for Moms'' program, delivering chrysanthemums to military mothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think John McCain will do right by our servicemen and I don't think Obama will,'' Morrow said. &quot;We should finish what we started,'' she said, referring to the war in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A registered Democrat, Morrow not only supports McCain but came to the rally carrying a picture of her being hugged by Bush during a visit to Lancaster County in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wesley Copley, 65, and his wife, Diana, 63, traveled from Paradise this morning and waited outside the arena 45 minutes to get into the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copley served in the U.S. Navy for 26 years and proudly wore his Navy cap this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he's the right man for our country,'' Copley said of McCain. &quot;We need someone who's strong, decisive and a straight shooter.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. McCain will tell it like it is and that's the kind of president I want,'' Copley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The military doesn't need their budget cut by 25 percent right now with two wars,'' Mrs. Copley added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Palin, Mrs. Copley likes her, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think she's got a lot of spunk in her.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world of political advertising once seemed so simple, so easily navigable as campaigns used mainstream media to get out their message. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in this presidential race, the margins and the mainstream are overlapping, with candidates and their supporters looking to new media - really new media - to woo key voting blocs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're getting a life in the Second Life virtual world, where McCain/Palin boosters are promoting the ticket at the Straight Talk Cafe.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're upping their game by advertising in nine Xbox games, including Madden NFL 09 and NASCAR 09, where Barack Obama's vote-early message is prominent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind it all is a marriage of electronic wizardry and the Internet, whose ability to connect people in disparate locations, gather information about them, and feed them fresh images may signal the future of audience targeting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take the Xbox games. The titles in which Democrat Obama is advertising - the company making the ads said Obama was the only candidate doing so - are especially popular with males ages 18 to 36, an important demographic group for him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More precisely, the campaign hopes to attract those young men in 10 battleground states, Ohio and Florida among them, that have early voting. The ads will appear until election eve Monday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Need for Speed Carbon game, a car drives past a billboard bearing a picture of Obama and the text &quot;Early Voting has begun. VoteforChange.com.&quot; The car passes it quickly, but not too quickly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just another example of our campaign breaking down barriers,&quot; said Sean Smith, a spokesman for Obama in Pennsylvania. &quot;There's been a surge of young people who registered to vote and [got] involved for the very first time. We believe that most of those voters are supporting Sen. Obama, and we view this as an innovative way to reach them.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mystery, even to grizzled young gamers, may be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">the ads get there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In-game advertising companies, such as Microsoft's Massive, team up with game publishers, such as Electronic Arts, said Ian Ali, national sales manager for Massive. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Massive, which the Obama campaign used, works with Electronic Arts as a game is being developed to include coding for advertisements that could be on billboards or bus benches, vending machines or race cars. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a fixed ad, the promotion is permanently embedded in the game's coding. But that would not be of much use to political candidates like Obama, who did not know until the summer that he would be the Democratic nominee.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the campaign signed up for a dynamic ad, designed to be fed into a game played on a computer or an Xbox console connected to the Internet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once an Xbox-Internet connection is made, Massive's server detects what the gamer is playing, his location, and the time of day he is playing. Using that information, Massive sends back the appropriate advertisement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the gamer is in Brooklyn, the ad is in English, Ali said. If he's in Berlin, it's in German. If it's noon, he may get a lunchtime promo for McDonald's. If he's in one of 10 battleground states, it may be an Obama&nbsp;ad.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ali said Massive's first in-game ad campaign was for Coca-Cola in 2005. Dynamic ads are a newer phenomenon, about 18 months old. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Obama, Republican nominee John McCain also is using the Internet, though in platforms that are now electronically middle-aged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a whole e-campaign devoted to pushing the campaign through Web ads we set up through YouTube and other Internet sites,&quot; said Peter Feldman, a McCain campaign spokesman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidate's Web site, JohnMcCain.com, touts blogs, a Facebook page, and a social-networking feature. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Second Life, a 3-D interactive world where on-screen avatars represent computer users, there are no official campaign sites.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the candidates' supporters have organized virtual groups such as the Republican Party of SL or Americans for Obama and virtual sites such as the Straight Talk Cafe or the Obama/Biden Lounge and Unofficial HQ. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Straight Talk Cafe sports billboards of McCain and his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. This and other Second Life sites have candidate lawn signs avatars can plant, as well as virtual T-shirts and other campaign paraphernalia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An avatar representing a 33-year-old white Oregon mother of five children was walking around the Straight Talk Cafe recently, learning about McCain and Palin. (Second Life users go by virtual names and hesitate to reveal their real names.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through a text chat, she described herself as &quot;an independent conservative with strong libertarian leanings.&quot; She said she supported Texas Rep. Ron Paul in the Republican primary and was having trouble shifting her allegiance to McCain.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really like Palin,&quot; she said. &quot;I think she is the most un-Washington candidate.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman said she read about Second Life and decided to visit a McCain site on it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also at the Straight Talk Cafe was a 32-year-old British-Asian government policy adviser in the United Kingdom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like to hear what Americans think about the election firsthand,&quot; he said. &quot;I can actually learn a bit more than I can by reading the New York Times or watching CNN. It helps me understand what American voters actually are thinking.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes, sites not directly connected with a candidate host political events. Recently, Nancy Blake's Pub in Second Life invited its members, no matter their political preference, to a politics chat.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the conversation in a rapid-fire, real-time text is difficult, especially when the issues are as complicated as the U.S. economy, health care and energy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are advantages to having heated conversations in a virtual setting, where everyone is in a different real-life locale. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of our members [of a Second Life group] taught me specific campaign skills I use in real life,&quot; said a female California Democratic activist. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said a disenchanted Republican avatar, who in real life is a Florida software-support engineer in her 50s: &quot;You can stop, take a deep breath, step back for a second before responding.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HERSHEY, Pa. - Republican John McCain and running mate Sarah Palin told a Pennsylvania audience Tuesday that &quot;it's wonderful to fool the pundits&quot; and vowed to pull out an upset win over Democratic rival Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not afraid of the fight, I'm ready for it,&quot; said McCain, continuing his sharp assault on Obama in a noisy rally opening his campaign day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin defended the campaign's harsh attacks on Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our opponent is not being candid with you about his tax plans,&quot; said Palin. &quot;It is not mean-spirited, and it is not negative campaigning to call out someone on their record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally was interrupted briefly by Obama backers waving signs, a move Palin dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we get a protest like that I'm always tempted to tell security, 'let them stay, maybe they'll learn a thing or two,'&quot; said Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign day was complicated by wintry weather, which forced the cancellation of an outdoor event in Quakertown. McCain was heading to North Carolina and Florida before the day was over. Palin was heading on her own to other events in Pennsylvania after the rally in Hershey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sagging in polls nationally and in battleground states, McCain worked to light a fire under his supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing is inevitable, we never give up,&quot; said McCain. &quot;Let's go win this election and get this country moving again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most polls have shown Obama with a lead in the race for Pennsylvania's 21 electoral votes, but McCain dismissed those surveys and urged a sprint to the finish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's wonderful to be back in Pennsylvania,&quot; said McCain. &quot;It's wonderful to fool the pundits because we're going to win the state of Pennsylvania.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania is the only state won by Democrat John Kerry in 2004 where McCain is still mounting a full-scale campaign. Both the Republican and Democratic tickets are focusing heavily in the closing days on a few key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida and Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain continued to label Obama a traditional liberal Democrat seeking to redistribute the wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. Obama is running to be redistributor in chief, I'm running to be commander in chief,&quot; said McCain. &quot;Sen. Obama is running to punish the successful, I'm running to make everyone successful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also returned to the theme that he's the candidate who is ready to take office, seasoned by a military career and his experience as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. He brought up their differences over the Iraq war. McCain opposes and Obama favors a timetable for withdrawal of U.S. combat troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you ever heard the word 'victory' pass through Obama's lips?&quot; McCain asked backers. &quot;My friends, we're winning in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain left few openings untouched, even bashing Obama for airing a 30-minute commercial Wednesday night that will delay the opening of a World Series baseball game if the series goes to six games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one will delay a World Series game with an infomercial when I'm president,&quot; said McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Palin has caused some headaches for the ticket, she's very popular with the Republican base and she added energy to a rally before nearly 10,000 cheering backers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are such a welcoming and patriotic state,&quot; Palin said. &quot;I know we have many patriots in the crowd today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin also predicted a tight election: &quot;It's going to be a hard-fought contest and it's going to come down to the wire.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alaska governor reprised her standard criticism of Obama's economic plan. Labeling the Illinois senator &quot;Barack the wealth spreader,&quot; she said, &quot;Joe the Plumber said it sounded to him like socialism. Now is not the time to experiment with that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential election looms large, so the negative political ads are in heavy rotation. And you know what? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm a big fan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know it's not a popular position, but I adore negative ads. The more the merrier.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why? Because I write fiction for a living, and so do the people who write these ads. The truth can be so boring when you don't make it up.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also appreciate a good laugh, and I laugh every time one of those ads comes on. And wouldn't you rather see a good, old-fashioned smear of a political ad than yet another commercial for Cialis? Evidently, the stock market isn't the only thing going down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't matter which candidate you support, if any. I don't want to get into that, because both candidates have run ads that have accused the other of being dangerous, doddering, or criminally insane. One is allegedly a pal of terrorists, and the other hangs with - even worse - mortgage bankers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boooo! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But my absolute favorite negative ads aren't about the presidential candidates. They're the ones about the candidates running for the other offices, whatever they are. I never heard of any of these guys, but now I know they're liars, thieves, wastrels, killers, and closet watchers of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Project Runway</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. I don't know them, but already I hate them and am afraid of them. A scarier lot you never saw, and if they get elected, they'll bankrupt the entire world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oops, too late.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes I like to imagine what the negative ads for other politicians would have been. Consider, for example, the original change candidates, the founding fathers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You say you want a revolution? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take George Washington. The negative ads would tell you he had wooden teeth. Would you really vote for a man who doesn't floss? Plus I heard he got that tall by taking steroids. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And how about an ad for Thomas Jefferson? Dude had a ponytail, wore ruffled shirts, and spent way too much time in Paris. You know what I'm saying. Don't ask, don't tell that there were Manolos in his armoire.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Franklin. So he invented the printing press in his basement. You know what else he was making down there? Bombs, meth, and counterfeit copies of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Sex and the City</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So you see how much fun you can have, making negative ads for heroes. Some people would call that libelous and disrespectful, but they can't take a joke. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plus you have to look for the silver lining in the negative ads, and by that I mean that they create jobs for so many people. First, the scary voice-over people. You know who I mean. The whispery female voice threatening that Obama will spend us into oblivion, and the deep, rich bass of the man who warns that McCain will send us to war, armed only with duct tape. You don't hear those scary voice-overs except at election time, and those people need work.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest of the time, all those cheery and perky types get the voice-over jobs, like the housewife-voices sounding happy about a new floor wax or the hubby-voices sounding happy about a new car wax. If it weren't for negative ads, you would get the idea that the only difference between women and men is what they wax. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plus, what about scary bad photographers? Negative ads give them the only work they get. They're the ones who take the terrible photos of Obama, so blurry that he appears to be wearing a turban. Or McCain, so grainy that he appears to be wearing a coffin. Or sometimes they catch the ugliest moments and snap a picture, like of Hillary Clinton making googly eyes or Mitt Romney looking injection-molded. In the ads I saw today, they caught Obama looking like he needs a cigarette and McCain wearing the lunar surface on his right cheek. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The others who get work from negative ads are the horror music people. The other day, I heard the most terrifying music ever coming from the TV, but it wasn't an ad for the sequel to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Saw</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or even a rerun of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Jaws</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. It was those monsters, Obama and McCain. Nothing like a scary drumbeat to make you think of nuclear war, serial murder, or politics.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those scary musicians would be out of a job but for negative ads. So there you have it. Negative ads are proof that democracy creates jobs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next time you complain about a negative ad, consider the people who do the voices, take the pictures, and compose the music. They wait years for their job, and now it's their day to scare us.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Halloween. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Er, I mean, Election Day.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boo!  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wardrobe flapDemocrats are criticizing Sarah Palin as - guess what - a hypocrite for accepting a $150,000 wardrobe purchased by the GOP from high-end stores. They say accepting such rich duds proves she is not the hockey mom she claims to be. What it proves is the exact opposite - that she needed the GOP to purchase the clothing she would need for 60 days of continuous media and public attention because she doesn't own that kind of wardrobe. It shows that Gov. Palin really is a regular person. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bill Hickey</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MeadowbrookSorry, MichaelThis is an open apology to Michael Smerconish. In my faulted view, you were a right-wing zealot and undeserving of the public &quot;power of the pen&quot; you enjoy. Nonetheless, your article last Sunday, &quot;McCain fails the big five tests,&quot; stunned me and I am sure others. It was intelligent, articulate, and balanced with a breath of fresh air in the ad hominem atmosphere of this election.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Albert Whitehead</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PhiladelphiaMissing testIt's troubling that &quot;life&quot; was not among the &quot;big five tests&quot; that Michael Smerconish used to grade the presidential candidates worthy of his vote. If he had, Barack Obama would have failed this one miserably. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smerconish and others fail to see that our position toward life - including rights of the unborn - is a lens through which we must view all of our other concerns. The right to life upholds the fundamental principle of justice on which America itself is founded. When we fail to protect life, all other rights, such as health care, housing and education, are in jeopardy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Stephen Majewski</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MedfordFight complacencyTony Auth's political cartoon last Sunday was right on the money. It is a mistake to believe the polls and allow complacency to set in. If all the newly registered voters, and all the young people who protest but do not vote, actually turn out, complacency will be defeated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ralph D. Bloch</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warrington Shattered mythAt last, one myth about the Barnes Foundation can be put to rest. Gov. Rendell let the cat out of the bag, admitting that Ray Perelman suggested moving the Barnes out of Merion 14 or 15 years ago, long before any neighbors' complaints emerged. The truth remains that neighbors have long resisted, and continue to protest, removing the collection from its beautiful home. The massive financial resources that foundations are offering to relocate the Barnes would be better spent preserving this treasure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ina Asher</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merion StationVanity, not courageKevin Ferris should not confuse vanity with courage (&quot;Steadfast and courageous,&quot; last Sunday). Joe Lieberman, like John McCain, has lost his bearings. McCain is not what he was in 2000, and neither is Lieberman. I think their only common bond is on Iraq and Iran. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Juris A. Balodis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MarltonFood fightIs there a better example of how this Republican administration has bankrupted the ideals of America than killing a successful school food program in Philadelphia (&quot;USDA kills school food program,&quot; Wednesday)? The administration considers any program to help poor kids an expense, not an investment. It is willing to spend billions on a bailout of poorly managed financial institutions but turns its back on children. America is about giving everyone equal opportunity, and if you are young and hungry, you are not going to get that opportunity. </SPAN></P>

Sarah Palin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sestak has been a fine, and fiscally conservative, representative and is recognized as the most productive freshman congressman by his colleagues. Your endorsement of Williams is the weakest and strangest I have ever seen. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the first fruits of an Obama presidency will be an international crisis, his running mate said in Seattle last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mark my words. It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy,&quot; Sen. Joe Biden said at a fund-raiser. &quot;Watch, we're going to have an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy.&quot; Mr. Obama's response to the crisis may not seem adequate, Mr. Biden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to need you to use your influence, your influence within the community, to stand with him, because it's not going to be apparent initially, it's not going to be apparent that we're right,&quot; he told the Democratic fat cats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all are going to be sitting here a year from now going, 'Oh my God, why are they there in the polls? Why is the polling so down? Why is this thing so tough?' &quot; Mr. Biden said. &quot;There are going to be a lot of you who want to go 'Whoa, wait a minute, yo, whoa, whoa, I don't know about that decision.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the most remarkable thing a vice presidential candidate has ever said about the top of his ticket during a campaign. But Mr. Biden's remarks drew little attention from many mainstream journalists who are loathe to draw attention to information uncongenial to Mr. Obama's prospects in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This may in part be because Mr. Biden is given to saying remarkable things which aren't true: That Franklin Roosevelt (who wasn't elected until 1932) went on television (which didn't go into widespread commercial use until after World War II) to explain the causes of the stock market crash of 1929; that Hezbollah has been driven out of Lebanon; that J-O-B-S is a three-letter word. But Mr. Biden was picked for his alleged foreign policy expertise, and he has been receiving classified intelligence briefings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Kennedy had two foreign policy tests early in his presidency, flunking the first and passing the second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a summit meeting in Vienna in June 1961, Soviet Premier Nikita Khruschev concluded Kennedy could be pushed around. The immediate consequence was the building of the Berlin Wall. In response, Kennedy made his famous &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot; (I am a jelly doughnut) speech, but otherwise did nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Kennedy failed to come to the aid of Cuban exiles during the Bay of Pigs invasion, Khruschev concluded he could put ballistic missiles in Cuba. The result was the Cuban missile crisis. This time Kennedy stood firm. The missiles were removed. But we came very close to nuclear war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What tests might await a President Obama?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can give you four or five scenarios from where it might originate,&quot; Mr. Biden told the Seattle fat cats, mentioning the Middle East and Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported Wednesday that Iranian officials are urging a preemptive strike on Israel to head off an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. U.S. intelligence officials likely would have known this before the news media. Could this be what prompted Sen. Biden's musings?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Russia invaded Georgia in August, Mr. Obama's initial response was to urge Russia and its tiny victim of aggression to exercise &quot;restraint.&quot; Might Russia invade other neighbors? Ukraine? Azerbaijan?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implication of Mr. Biden's remarks is that voters will be buying trouble if they choose Mr. Obama in November, because America's enemies are unlikely to &quot;test the mettle&quot; of John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Biden, according to Michael Crowley of The New Republic, once suggested to staffers that an appropriate response to the 9/11 attacks might be to send a check, &quot;no strings attached&quot; for $200 million to the mullahs in Tehran. So I don't think much of his judgment. But I do think he's right in this instance. A President Obama will be challenged by our enemies, and he'll flinch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even if Mr. Biden's prediction is correct, to say such a thing three weeks before an election shows remarkably poor judgment. Having &quot;Slow Joe&quot; a heartbeat away is almost as disconcerting as an Obama presidency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MANCHESTER, N.H. -- It's already snowing on Mount Washington, but there's something about this state that warms Sen. John McCain's soul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a freezing ice hockey rink at Saint Anselm's College on Wednesday, the Republican presidential nominee seemed more elated than embattled, visibly relishing his underdog status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing tieless before a crowd of 1,600, Mr. McCain frankly declared his love for New Hampshire's voters, who rescued him from political oblivion in two presidential primaries -- 2000 and 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As new polling numbers show the race tightening here, clearly Mr. McCain hopes they'll do it again on Nov. 4.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't think of any place I'd rather be as the election draws close -- an underdog campaign in the state New Hampshire,&quot; Mr. McCain roared as the crowd roared back &quot;Some of my happiest memories are of this wonderful, wonderful state. I feel I know it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He should. In the 2000 primary, Mr. McCain thrashed George W. Bush here by 19 points; earlier this year, he bested former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney after the McCain campaign, basically broke, staged scores of town hall meetings up and down the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Usually, New Hampshire's star turn comes in snowy January's presidential primary, but this fall election season, as leaf-peepers clog the roadways gaping at the bronze and gold-washed mountains, the state finds itself in the political spotlight for the second time in a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain has visited five times since securing the nomination in February. Sen. Barack Obama was here two weeks ago, the day after the final debate -- and ran a Web ad recently touting five New Hampshire residents and former McCain supporters who had switched to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It isn't clear if Mr. McCain can win New Hampshire again, but the political math says he must. To get to 270 votes and the presidency, he needs not just the Republican states where Mr. Obama currently leads -- Florida, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia -- but also Pennsylvania or some mix of Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If John McCain can't win a state like New Hampshire, there's no way he can win the election,&quot; said Linda Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth College in Hanover. &quot;This state is sort of made to order for him, and during the primary, people liked the straight talk, even if they didn't agree with him on the war. It was a real love fest, but that doesn't seem to be happening this time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain's really been lashing out,&quot; said Hilary Cleveland, 80, a history teacher at Colby-Sawyer College and the widow of former U.S. Rep. James Cleveland. A classic Yankee Republican, she's economically conservative and socially moderate -- and unhappy, she says, with the tone of Mr. McCain's general election campaign, citing in particular its robocalls linking Mr. Obama to domestic terrorist William Ayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I'm not so much anti-McCain as pro-Obama,&quot; she said, noting that she's something of an outlier in her resolutely Republican town of New London, N.H.. &quot;Many of my friends don't understand me. They just think I'm a kook,&quot; she laughed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama have been vying for the state's sizable, volatile population of independent or &quot;undeclared&quot; voters and are, perhaps, the key to this contest. It's the undeclared who helped the Arizona senator win the 2000 and 2008 primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the electorate's three-way split here -- there are 333,000 undeclared voters, 271,000 Republicans and 265,000 Democrats, according to Dante Scala, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire -- Mr. McCain needs a sizable crossover to the GOP column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those would include people like Bill Terrill, a long-distance truck driver from Raymond, N.H., who is not sure yet who he's voting for, although he admires Mr. McCain's military background and his honesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He speaks from the heart,&quot; said Mr. Terrill, 64, while downing breakfast one recent Sunday at the Red Arrow Diner in Manchester. &quot;Of course, Mr. Obama basically speaks from the heart too, but we'll wait and see. Just a few more encouraging notes from either one of them will swing me one way or the other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another independent, Joanna Lemire, voted for Mr. Bush in 2004, but this year for the first time, she's considering a vote for the Democrat -- a &quot;scary&quot; prospect, the 42-year old Weare, N.H., resident said with a laugh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are only now starting to make up their minds -- maybe earlier this year now that the Red Sox aren't in the World Series,&quot; added Andrew Smith, a political scientist and director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center's Granite State Polls. He recently co-authored a study that found nearly a third of the state's 991,000 potential voters either weren't old enough to vote in 2000 or hadn't moved here yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new and the blue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While history runs deeply through New Hampshire's quaint villages and rusted mill towns, where many families go back generations, fewer than 45 percent of the state's residents were born here -- compared with a national average of 67 percent, making for one of the most mobile populations in the country. Over the past two decades, high-tech workers have migrated into southern New Hampshire, and affluent retirees have moved to the recreational or academic centers near the White Mountains or Hanover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, if you're new, chances are you're blue, Mr. Smith's study found: 53 percent of new young voters and 52 percent of new &quot;migrant&quot; voters were more likely to identify with Democrats than with Republicans, compared with 43 percent of established voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new and the blue are scattered mostly in three areas: along the Massachusetts border, on New Hampshire's short, crowded seacoast or clustered around Hanover and the Connecticut River valley. And they've, no doubt, contributed to recent gains made by Democrats -- not only by occupying the governor's office, but, in 2006, bt taking both congressional seats and sweeping the state House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The real question is, will these voters, who are furious with the Republicans for being spenders, about Iraq and on social issues -- will these people go back to the Republican Party this year or stay with the Democrats? Right now, it's impossible to know,&quot; Mr. Fowler said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the state's relatively low unemployment rate and economic prosperity, &quot;the fundamentals favor Sen. Obama,&quot; Mr. Smith said, with voters, shaken by the fiscal mess on Wall Street, the war in Iraq and general unhappiness with President Bush, citing the economy as their number one concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week a Concord Monitor poll showed Mr. Obama ahead by seven points, but by Friday, a Rasmussen Reports tracking poll revealed a tightening race, with the Democrat ahead by four. That slight movement toward Mr. McCain may be the direct result of Wednesday's visit, or it may be the first stirrings of a famous quadrennial phenomenon that veteran GOP strategist Tom Rath described as &quot;last-minute voting.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rath, who supported Mr. Romney in the primary, recalled that his candidate had a 10- to 12 -point lead the weekend before the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The independents looked at those numbers and said, 'Well, [Romney]'s got it, so I think I'm going to go vote for my friend John McCain. That voting group is the least reliable, most savvy part of the electorate,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libertarian streak</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This tax-loathing, government-averse state still has its share of staunch Republicans and libertarians, tucked away in the isolated hills and valleys, north of the White Mountains, in the state's lakes region and in its small, livable cities, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Sunday morning, Mr. McCain's state headquarters -- in the restored Waumbec Mill along Manchester's Merrimack River -- was buzzing with volunteers manning phone banks and walk-ins seeking campaign buttons and bumper stickers .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama &quot;is a little too liberal for me,&quot; said Kim Quinn, 42, of Manchester, who cited taxes as her number one issue, &quot;although there are a lot of Obama supporters, especially with the economy right now. My 401(k) isn't as pretty as it was two weeks ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, unpredictability reigns. Thirty miles outside of Hanover, in Grafton -- home to founding father John Hancock and, more recently, to a clutch of anti-government Free State Party members, who unsuccessfully sought to make the town their party's capital -- a shouting match broke out in the town's general store over whether Mr. Obama was a Muslim or not. And last Sunday afternoon, a woman named Nancy Niemi stood on her front porch and declared to an Obama canvasser, &quot;I would never vote for a pagan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is a Christian, the canvasser countered, but Mrs. Niemi was having none of it. &quot;I think anyone who is elected president should have served in the military,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just down the road, though, Roseanne Kramer stood on her front porch and said that when she watched Mr. Obama speak at the 2004 Democratic convention, she decided -- 30 years after moving to this country from New Zealand -- to become an American citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just love that guy,&quot; she said. &quot;Just the articulation and everything that he stands for. I think it's the hope, it's everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a state that crawls with pollsters, news media and campaign staffers every four years, where the phone rings at dinner and the doorbell sometimes rings a a half dozen times a day -- there remains a resistance, however, in some quarters to being quizzed and poked and diagnosed..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's not for you to know,&quot; snapped a salesman at Radio Shack in North Conway, a mostly Republican area in the White Mountains, when asked how he was leaning in the election. &quot;I make it a point not to discuss religion or politics,&quot; said the man, identifying himself only as Eric. Then he relented somewhat, saying he was for McCain, &quot;but I don't think either candidate really understands what average people go through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My policy is that I give my say every four years at the polls and I'm not getting into arguments into it,&quot; added Michael Shanks, 61, of Grafton, another Republican. &quot;I see cars on the road with all these bumper stickers plastered all over it for the Democrats, 'Impeach Bush,' that sort of thing, and then I see a nice car with one simple McCain sticker, and to me that says it all. I vote my feelings on election day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trouble 'letting go'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That core group that makes up its minds late often doesn't get picked up in polling, says former state Democratic Party chair Kathy Sullivan, but even if Mr. Obama only wins two-thirds of those who claim to support him, he'll still eke out a victory, she believes. At a debate last week at New England College between Republican Sen. John Sununu and his opponent, former Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, Ms. Sullivan wondered why Mr. McCain kept returning to New Hampshire, given that the campaign has trimmed new advertising buys here to conserve money for other states, like Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he's having trouble letting go,&quot; she said. &quot;The state was so good to him in 2000 and in this year's primary, and even though he's not the John McCain of those campaigns, I think he believes people will remember that and support him. I don't think it will work, though.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rath holds out hope that John McCain's unique history here -- a state second in importance, perhaps, only to Arizona in the senator's lengthy, colorful political biography -- will pull him through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a well-known line in Robert Frost's poem, 'The Death of the Hired Man,' &quot; Mr. Rath recalled, quoting another famous New Hampshire resident, &quot;where the farmer says, 'Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, when the time comes around again, maybe the voters will feel the same way about John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Sen. Obama caught in double play</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1268 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Tribune-Review staff </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all likelihood, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama doesn't care whether the Tampa Bay Rays or the Philadelphia Phillies wins the World Series. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's not what he has been telling fans of both teams. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend in Philadelphia, Obama told a crowd of supporters, &quot;Since the (Chicago) White Sox are out of it, I'll root for the Phillies now.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days later during a campaign stop in Florida, Obama flip-flopped mightily. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've said from the beginning that I am a unity candidate, bringing people together,&quot; he said. &quot;So when you see a White Sox fan showing love to the Rays, you know we are on to something right here.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That reversal did not go unnoticed by Republican presidential nominee John McCain, who made sure to mention it during a campaign stop Tuesday near the City of Brotherly Love. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to The Associated Press, McCain said, &quot;Now I'm not dumb enough to get mixed up in a World Series between swing states, but I think I may have detected a little pattern with Sen. Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's pretty simple, really. When he's campaigning in Philadelphia, he roots for the Phillies and when he's campaigning in Tampa Bay, he 'shows love' for the Rays.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign had no immediate comment on the duplicity. Score the entire episode &quot;E-'The One.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KERRY JOKE HITS HOME. We're betting his wife didn't find the joke funny. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a business summit in Boston last week, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., attempted a wisecrack aimed at Republican presidential nominee John McCain's age. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criticizing the silly questions often asked of politicians, Kerry noted that Democrat presidential nominee Barack Obama was asked the famous &quot;boxers or briefs&quot; question. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then they asked McCain, and McCain said, 'Depends,' &quot; Kerry said, referring to a brand of adult diapers often used by those of advanced age. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why don't we think Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz, was amused by the remark? Because the Pittsburgh ketchup heiress, who turned 70 on Oct. 5, is only two years younger than the 72-year-old McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We just hope the senator's lame attempt at humor hasn't triggered an incontinental divide in the Heinz-Kerry household. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEMS. For Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, this Halloween event has to be scarier than a haunted hayride. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City councilman Bill Peduto and state Rep. Chelsa Wagner, D-Beechview, are teaming up to host a Halloween party Friday at The Priory on the North Side. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peduto, you might recall, is one of Ravenstahl's most strident critics and briefly mounted a mayoral campaign last year in the special election Ravenstahl won to succeed the late Mayor Bob O'Connor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wagner has been mentioned as a possible challenger to Ravenstahl next year and possesses a powerful political pedigree. Her father is 19th Ward Democratic Chairman Pete Wagner, and her uncle is state auditor general and possible 2010 gubernatorial candidate Jack Wagner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Wagner runs, she already would have strong support in the city's South Hills neighborhoods. If Peduto backs her, that would immediately boost her standing in the city's East End. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Ravenstahl, that prospect has to be more frightening than greeting a trick-or-treater dressed in a Guy Costa mask. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DERMODY DESTINED FOR DEFEAT? After nearly two decades in the state House, Frank Dermody could have trouble retaining his seat next week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So says PolitickerPA.com, which has named the Oakmont Democrat's challenge by Republican Jason Davidek of Fawn in the 33rd Legislative District as the state's fifth most competitive House race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he wasn't charged or implicated in the ongoing Harrisburg Bonusgate investigation, PolitickerPA believes Dermody could become a victim of its fallout. Twelve people affiliated with the House Democratic caucus are facing criminal charges for allegedly funding a vast political operation with public money. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that Dermody defeated former Allegheny County councilwoman Eileen Watt by only two percentage points in 2006, PolitickerPA believes Dermody is extremely vulnerable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAMILY FEUD. Don't expect state Sen. Vince Fumo, D-Philadelphia, to invite his son-in-law to Thanksgiving dinner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not after Christian Marrone, who is married to Fumo's daughter, Nicole, testified against Fumo Thursday during his public corruption trial in Philadelphia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fumo, 65, who is not seeking re-election this year, is charged with spending $3.5 million in state and nonprofit money to support a lavish lifestyle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marrone, who worked as a Fumo aide from 1997 to 2002, testified that he spent his first 18 months as a public employee on the job supervising renovations on Fumo's 27-room mansion in Philly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marrone said he monitored the work of electrical, plumbing, painting, waterproofing and tiling contractors. His testimony followed that of W. Russell Faber, the Senate chief clerk, who noted that Senate staffers are not permitted to do personal or political errands on state time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're guessing Marrone wouldn't show at Fumo's on Thanksgiving even if he were invited. After that damning testimony, there's no way he would risk being around Fumo when he's holding a carving knife. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DETENTE? Westmoreland County commissioners Tom Balya and Tom Ceraso just couldn't stay away. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lure of appearing in the pages of the Trib was just too much to overcome for the Democrat commissioners, who earlier this year issued a temporary edict to county department heads demanding they go cold turkey in buying advertising in the newspaper. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Whispers couldn't be more surprised to see a recent political ad for 39th District Senate candidate Tony Bompiani of Youngwood that was paid for by Target Westmoreland, a political action committee formed by Balya-Ceraso in their campaigns for county commissioner. Bompiani's opponent is county Commissioner Kim Ward, a Hempfield Republican. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FROM THE SIDELINES. Although state Sen. Bob Regola, a Hempfield Republican, is observing the election from the sidelines after dropping out of the 39th District Senate race, that doesn't mean he's entirely distanced himself, according to campaign finance statements. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regola was nudged out of his bid for a second term because state Republicans said polls showed he could not win. Records show he had a campaign war chest of $193,882 at the time, according to campaign expense reports filed last week in Harrisburg. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports show that among his expenses, incurred less than a week before he dropped out, was $12,000 to the Senate Republican State Committee for unspecified &quot;research.&quot; As of last week, Regola had not made a donation to his substitute, Westmoreland County Commissioner Kim Ward, and there was no indication of a donation to Bompiani, who gave to Regola's campaign four years ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did donate $1,000 to Republican hopeful Susanna Lisotto, a Penn Township Republican challenging veteran state Rep. James Casorio of North Huntingdon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MONEY IN THE BANK. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and Sen. John McCain both were trying to raise money for the Republican presidential campaign following Palin's appearance eight days ago on &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's plea to supporters for money was almost as entertaining as the Alaskan rap bit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you caught my guest appearance on 'Saturday Night Live' this weekend, you may have seen an ad or two (or twenty) from Senator Obama's campaign. This barrage of advertising is adding up to the most expensive negative ad buy in political history,&quot; she said in an e-mail to supporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And these ads are funded with the nearly $200 million the Obama campaign and the DNC raised in September,&quot; the e-mail claims. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP campaign added they're grateful for any contribution. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Contrarian that I am, I'm voting for John McCain. I'm not talking about bucking the polls or the media consensus that it's over before it's over. I'm talking about bucking the rush of wet-fingered conservatives leaping to Barack Obama before they're left out in the cold without a single state dinner for the next four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I stand athwart the rush of conservative ship-jumpers of every stripe -- neo (Ken Adelman), moderate (Colin Powell), genetic/ironic (Christopher Buckley) and socialist/atheist (Christopher Hitchens) -- yelling &quot;Stop!&quot; I shall have no part of this motley crew. I will go down with the McCain ship. I'd rather lose an election than lose my bearings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, I'll have no truck with the phony case ginned up to rationalize voting for the most liberal and inexperienced presidential nominee in living memory. The &quot;erratic&quot; temperament issue, for example. As if Mr. McCain's risky and unsuccessful but in no way irrational attempt to tactically maneuver his way through the economic tsunami that came crashing down a month ago renders unfit for office a man who demonstrated the most admirable equanimity and courage in the face of unimaginable pressures as a prisoner of war, and who later steadily navigated innumerable challenges and setbacks, not the least of which was the collapse of his campaign just a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain the &quot;erratic&quot; is a cheap Obama talking point. The 40-year record testifies to McCain the stalwart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor will I countenance the &quot;dirty campaign&quot; pretense. The double standard here is stunning. Mr. Obama ran a scurrilous Spanish-language ad falsely associating Mr. McCain with anti-Hispanic slurs. Another ad falsely claimed Mr. McCain supports &quot;cutting Social Security benefits in half.&quot; And for months Democrats insisted that Mr. McCain sought 100 years of war in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's critics are offended that he raised the issue of William Ayers. What's astonishing is that Mr. Obama was himself not offended by William Ayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, the most remarkable of all tactical choices of this election season is the attack that never was. Out of extreme (and unnecessary) conscientiousness, Mr. McCain refused to raise the legitimate issue of Mr. Obama's most egregious association -- with the race-baiting Rev. Jeremiah Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dirty campaigning, indeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case for Mr. McCain is straightforward. The financial crisis has made us forget, or just blindly deny, how dangerous the world out there is. We have a generations-long struggle with Islamic jihadism. An apocalyptic soon-to-be-nuclear Iran. A nuclear-armed Pakistan in danger of fragmentation. A rising Russia pushing the limits of revanchism. Plus the sure-to-come Falklands-like surprise popping out of nowhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who do you want answering that phone at 3 a.m.? A man who's been cramming on these issues for the last year, who's never had to make an executive decision affecting so much as a city, let alone the world? A foreign policy novice instinctively inclined to the flabbiest, most vaporous multilateralism (e.g., the Berlin Wall came down because of &quot;a world that stands as one&quot;), and who refers to the most deliberate act of war since Pearl Harbor as &quot;the tragedy of 9/11,&quot; a term more appropriate for a bus accident?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or do you want a man who is the most prepared, most knowledgeable, most serious foreign policy thinker in the United States Senate? A man who not only has the best instincts, but has the honor and the courage to, yes, put country first, as when he carried the lonely fight for the surge that turned Iraq from catastrophic defeat into achievable strategic victory?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's just no comparison. Mr. Obama's own running mate warned this week that Mr. Obama's youth and inexperience will invite a crisis -- indeed a crisis &quot;generated&quot; precisely to test him. Can you be serious about national security and vote on Nov. 4 to invite that test?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And how will he pass it? Well, how has he fared on the only two significant foreign policy tests he has faced since he's been in the Senate? The first was the surge. Mr. Obama failed spectacularly. He not only opposed it. He tried to denigrate it, stop it and, finally, deny its success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second test was Georgia, to which Mr. Obama responded instinctively with evenhanded moral equivalence, urging restraint on both sides. Mr. McCain did not have to consult his advisers to instantly identify the aggressor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's economic crisis, like every other in our history, will in time pass. But the barbarians will still be at the gates. Whom do you want on the parapet? I'm for the guy who can tell the lion from the lamb.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One was that Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel are joining forces in a concert to raise money for Barack Obama's presidential campaign. James Taylor throws his support that way, too. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question I have is this: How much money does Sen. Obama need to run his election campaign and close the deal?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has already been widely reported that he leads in donations by millions of dollars as compared to the McCain campaign that opted for public money.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of us are not jumping ahead to Christmas, although I did see a commercial on television heralding its coming the other day. We should be thinking of carving pumpkins, trick or treating and the definitive potato-filling recipe. Christmas shouldn't be on our minds yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, I have been following politics -- or they have been following me. Each morning when I tune in to the cable news I'm told that there are so many days until the election. I write this column on a Wednesday and today there are 13 days until the election. When you read this, it will be down to 11 days. I always have a song in my heart and strangely enough I have been humming &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas.&quot; However, I am changing it to &quot;The Twelve Days Before Election.&quot; All the news reminds me of is how many days it is until the election and I am getting this paranoid feeling that I forgot to buy a candidate a gift. I don't think they are going to buy me anything. The candidates have spent all their Christmas club account money buying votes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, the tune goes through my mind. On the 13th Day Before Election, the candidates gave to me, two boring speeches and George Washington cutting down a cherry tree. We all know what we got from the candidates in the past: a stocking filled with redundant debates. We were gifted with insults, slander, more ads than any drug company could possibly air, more talking heads and experts than we could abide and celebrities, who make a zillion dollars, telling us who we should vote for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have no idea what the 11th Day Before Election may hold. We may have more red and blue rallies. The 11th may have more confusing polls. I actually respond to polls on line. I always vote for the guys and girls I don't believe in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Ninth Day Before Election I may write in George Clooney's name. Actually, I do believe in him. On the Eighth Day Before Election I may sign in as Mickey Mouse. On the Seventh Day Before Election we may all find out that our registrations are invalid and none of the voting machines will work. In some states early voting on computers has been found faulty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What shall happen on the Sixth Day Before Election? We will have six geese a-laying. Will they be presidential geese or vice presidential</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">geese and George Washington cutting down a cherry tree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Fifth Day Before Election will there be five golden rings? I can see 10 possibilities. Could they be Obama, Michelle, John, Cindy, Sarah, Todd, Joe, Jill, Hillary and Colin? &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our traditional Christmas carol calls for four calling birds on the fourth day. On the Fourth Day Before Election we will get more than four calls from people who want us to vote for their candidates. The third gives us three French hens. We don't like the French very much. The second gives us two turtledoves. McCain and Obama won't be coming to our door, but we still have George Washington cutting down the cherry tree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This still is the 13th Day Before Election. It was reported that Sarah Palin was given $150,000 to spruce up her wardrobe. The Republican National Committee has been criticized for sending Sarah to Saks Fifth Avenue, Macy's, Barneys New York, Bloomingdale's and Neiman Marcus. A cool $4,716.49 was spent on hair and make-up alone. Of course, in an unbiased report, it was documented that Hillary spent over three grand on two hair-dos and look what they got her. I hope the Democrats didn't spend a nickel on Hillary pantsuits. We won't even mention John Edwards' $400 haircuts. We are all too well aware that the Democrats didn't spend a dime on the Carters' attire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is still Day 13 and pundits are on Palin's case for taking her kids with her on official trips and having the Great State of Alaska foot the bill. A woman who arranges some of Palin's events, Jennifer McCarthy, said the governor enjoys trying to take her kids to every event she attends. One happened to be a 2007 Family Day Celebration. If you have as many kids as Sarah Palin does, it might be pretty embarrassing to show up without one. The free trip list for the kids goes on, but if you call yourself a hockey mom, it is tough to show up without the hockey kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I bet Joe the Plumber wouldn't show up without his kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe we should ask Sarah Palin to look up Josephine the Plumber. Some of us remember her:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speakin' as a lady plumber, New Extra Comet bleaches out tough food stains better than any other leading cleanser. Look!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And just between us girls, I couldn't keep house without it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCRANTON - Near the end of the weekly &quot;girls' night out&quot; of bowling at Idle Hour Lanes on Tuesday, Glenda Yablonski figured the score as her teammates tossed nickels into a plastic tub, covering their fines for each missed spare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the team's kitty grew, she paused to discuss the presidential race. She'll be voting for Republican John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just feel safer with McCain,&quot; said Yablonski, 52, a Democrat who works as a customer-service representative for United Parcel Service. As for her party's nominee, Barack Obama, &quot;I don't trust him,&quot; she said. &quot;Obama has too many radical views.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yablonski voted for Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary in April, helping Clinton crush Obama by 3-1 in Lackawanna County, which includes Scranton. Obama can't touch Clinton, Yablonski said, and she respects McCain's years of experience and patriotism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If McCain reverses his fortunes and wins the White House, it will be due to the support of thousands of white working-class voters like Yablonski in Pennsylvania and other Rust Belt battlegrounds such as Ohio. They are the swing voters of this election, polls show, and Obama has struggled for months to woo them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, Scranton has become political shorthand for Blue Collarville U.S.A., its voters studied much as were the soccer moms and NASCAR dads of earlier presidential contests. Joe Biden, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, is a native of the city, and Clinton's father grew up here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scranton voters have been bombarded with information as the candidates, their running mates and surrogates swarm the city. When they're not here, their ads are; a nonpartisan research group said more than 8,300 presidential campaign commercials had aired on local TV stations since June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats typically rely on big margins in Scranton, a former coal-mining town of 75,000, to help win statewide. Recent polls, and detailed interviews with voters here this week, suggest that anxiety over the economy has helped Obama convert skeptics. Many blame President Bush for their economic struggles and are reluctant to turn to another Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, there is a deep vein of support for McCain among voters who cite his experience, his record of military heroism, and his opposition to abortion rights. McCain strategists are counting on a silent majority of such backers to come from behind in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters in Scranton, many of them Catholics from Irish, Italian and Eastern European immigrant backgrounds, &quot;tend to be liberal on the economy and conservative on social issues,&quot; said Leonard Champney, a political scientist at the University of Scranton. Yet the county stays loyal to Democrats in presidential elections, he said. (Indeed, Lackawanna supported Democrat Walter Mondale over President Ronald Reagan in 1984, albeit narrowly.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melissa Yanchak, who was bowling with her grandmother, Yablonski, and a few other women Tuesday, said that she planned to back Obama because &quot;his policies are for everyone as a whole.&quot; She thinks McCain favors business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't feel he'll lead the country in the direction I want it to go,&quot; said Yanchak, 29, who works in a bank's call center. &quot;I didn't care for him in the debates, the way he was interrupting Obama, the facial expressions he was making. He seems very shady.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her grandmother, Reggie, 78, said McCain offered nothing for the economic struggles of working people. &quot;People are losing their jobs, they're going overseas,&quot; said Reggie, who declined to give her last name. &quot;Bush is worse than Herbert Hoover.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Chris Doherty, a Democrat who backed Clinton in the primary, said that he had lately found it easier to persuade skeptics to support Obama. &quot;The downturn in the economy has changed this election,&quot; he said. &quot;People are upset at Republican policies, and they vote their pocketbooks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Quinnipiac University poll released yesterday showed Obama leading 53 percent to 40 percent statewide, largely on the strength of his support in the Philadelphia suburbs, but found the two candidates running within a few percentage points of each other in northeastern Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the county Democrats for McCain headquarters on the west side, Maria Greco Syzmanski was making phone calls to identify registered Democrats or independents supporting the Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is a true patriot, and that has to count for something,&quot; said Syzmanski, 58, a retired educator who was a fervent volunteer for Clinton in the primary. &quot;Who is Obama? With his 143 days in the Senate before he started running for president, there wasn't much to look at. I just don't know about him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellow volunteer Ann Marie Derchak said she was disturbed at Obama's associations with William Ayers, a former leader of the radical Weather Underground. She also resents Obama's remark at a San Francisco fund-raiser last spring that voters in small-town Pennsylvania &quot;cling&quot; to guns and religion because they are &quot;bitter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I am patriotic and I don't hang out with terrorists,&quot; said Derchak, 56, &quot;but I guess we're just uneducated, stupid miners in a rust belt here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the Judge-n-Jury bar on the courthouse square downtown, some buddies discussed the election, razzing one another about their opinions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I generally identify more with the liberal side, so I'll probably vote for Obama,&quot; said Bob Hall, 23, a hotel clerk, drinking a draft beer after work. &quot;I'm not that impressed by Obama, but he seems half-decent to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bartender Justin Simonetti, 28, is an Army veteran who said he will vote for McCain. &quot;It's been about 3,000 days since there was a terrorist attack on the U.S.,&quot; Simonetti said, adding that he trusted McCain's military leadership. &quot;We have to keep what's working. The best defense is a good offense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walter Wood and his wife, Shirley, were enjoying the $2.75 ham-and-eggs special at the Glider, the west side diner where Obama ate a waffle in April, just before the primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't trust him [Obama] because he doesn't have the experience,&quot; said Walter Wood, 73, a registered independent. &quot;McCain has the experience, but President Bush didn't seem to do right by us; he sold our jobs up the river.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he also feared that a McCain administration might be too close to Bush in its policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got a lot of friends like us who don't know which way to go,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOR MONTHS, we've had to hear, ad nauseam, that a vote for McCain is a vote for four more years of Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the highlight for me was in the debate where McCain finally told Barack Obama that if he wanted to run against President Bush, he should have run four years ago. Obama's reaction - priceless. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What it comes down to is the Democrats are allowed to bash and say whatever they want, and the news media call this &quot;strategy.&quot; We the people are expected to nod our heads like bobblehead dolls in agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when Republicans do likewise, they are bashing and being negative and have nothing better to bring to the table. Whatever happened to what's good for the goose is good for the gander? And don't even get me started with Obama and ACORN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, who does Obama think he is interrupting the World Series for half an hour? He actually believes his own hype.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hasn't the American public been put through enough with these commercials from both sides? I don't know about you, but I've come down with a bad case of campaignitis. Why can't TV and the news media let us get away from all this for a while and enjoy the World Series in peace?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Phillies fans have waited way too long for our guys to be in the World Series. What does campaigning have to do with baseball anyway? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People, we are in time of war whether we like it or not. Now, do you want a thinned-skinned Obama heading the show, or someone with 20 years of experience? People need to wake up and do their homework before it's too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I'll give Obama credit for one thing - he sure is a smooth talker. He has all you guys hoodwinked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that's my opinion from the other side of things, and Obama drove me in the right direction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">233 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letters by Reid Joyce and Claudia Neely slamming the &quot;vacuity&quot; of Sarah Palin demonstrate the distortions that result from ideological blindness (&quot;Judging Sarah,&quot; Oct. 14 and PghTrib.com).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notion that Sarah Palin is a pinhead and Barack and Michelle Obama are polymath geniuses is laughable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, Barack Obama is a typical run-of-the-mill lawyer from Harvard who produced no noteworthy scholarship at Harvard. Moreover, as has been repeated ad nauseam, he has no real business experience, no military experience and not the slightest understanding of the world of science and technology. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A quick study is different from a profound intellect. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michelle Obama's undergraduate degrees are in African studies, a tendentious pseudo-subject as taught in our colleges, and sociology. There is no evidence she is widely read or broadly educated in any subject. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idiom she and her husband speak is largely a combination of post-'60s litigation liberalism married to the therapeutic culture and leavened with cliches from the now decrepit civil rights movement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To view the Obamas as profound Einsteins compared to the two dolts John McCain and Sarah Palin is laughable, and anyone not blinded by ideology can easily discern the ordinariness and pretentious vacuity that is the essence of the Mr. and Mrs. Obama. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OK, I'M A &quot;racist scumbag,&quot; an &quot;ignorant twit&quot; and Barack Obama's &quot;house cracker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I ought to be &quot;summarily fired,&quot; and the leftist, liberal &quot;rag&quot; I work for ought to fold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, it's disgraceful and insulting to use the word &quot;cracker&quot; in a headline and/or a column since all it does is fuel prejudice and unfairly label entire groups of whites. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the gist of hundreds of outraged comments, phone messages and e-mails that I continue to get after Tuesday's column on what I called Pennsylvania's &quot;cracker factor&quot; in the upcoming presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The column asked whether John McCain campaigns here so much - despite lagging in polls in a state that went Democratic in the last four presidential elections - because some of our voters, no matter what they tell pollsters, will not vote for a black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, I hit a nerve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the response from those saying that they're white McCain voters was so strong, so angry that I wonder whether some, you know, doth protest too much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I answered many, but couldn't get to all. Here's a sample:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who do you think you are referring to the white voters of Pennsylvania who decide not to vote for Obama as 'crackers?' &quot; writes Mike M. &quot;Amazing how you and the rest of the Anointees of Obama are trying to play the race card and the white guilt card. Well I am one white voter who has nothing to feel guilty about.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A common theme, as was this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Would you ever dare refer to black voters as the 'n----r factor?' Do you not understand that 'cracker' is just as offensive?&quot; writes Mark R. &quot;It's a good thing you guys in the press don't have to run for election or be certified with a license, as I do as a commercial pilot, you'd be selling fish instead of fish-wrap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First off, on topics such as racial politics people tend to read only what they want to read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The column did not broad-brush Pennsylvania's white voters as racists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It quoted two prominent veteran politicians, Gov. Rendell and U.S. Rep. Jack Murtha, of Johnstown, saying a black candidate can expect to lose four to five percent of Pennsylvania's vote because he or she is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, I called a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">factor</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the presidential race, and since the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Daily News</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has never been a slave to political correctness I labeled it the &quot;cracker factor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many readers took offense. Maybe they're used to blander newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to suggest that &quot;cracker&quot; and the N-word are similarly offensive is to suggest that white Americans (an 86 percent majority in Pennsylvania) and African-Americans (an 11 percent minority) share a similar history of racial bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a wise </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Daily News </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">editor puts it, when white people are in the minority in this country I'll try being a little more sensitive to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(By the way, though several readers refer to my race as black or mixed or indeterminate, I am white. Not that it matters.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To suggest, as others did, that the media never mentions blacks voting for black candidates is ludicrous. And to equate the &quot;cracker factor&quot; with such voting ignores the fact that blacks overwhelmingly vote FOR Democrats regardless of race whereas the voters Rendell and Murtha refer to vote AGAINST blacks regardless of party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I understand that race is a touchy topic, and I have taken heat when writing about it in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So be it. I hope to go on writing about touchy topics, no matter what others hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope I see you selling apples on the corner when your rag folds,&quot; writes Harry K. &quot;I will purchase as many as you have and proceed to make applesauce on your empty head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, Harry, it's nice to have hopes. *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Barack Obama has pulled ahead of Republican John McCain since the presidential debates and wild stock-market slides of the past month, a new nationwide poll by Franklin &amp; Marshall College shows. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama holds a 5-point lead among likely voters and an 11-point advantage among all registered voters surveyed with less than two weeks until the Nov. 4 presidential election, the poll released today shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results are relatively similar to those found in other national polls taken this week and suggest that, barring a national crisis, time is running out for the Republican ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For McCain, there needs to be some game-breaker. I don't know how he can inch his way back in,&quot; said poll director G. Terry Madonna, the director of F&amp;M's Center for Politics and Public Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no debates. There's nothing but campaigning and commercials, and Obama's spending three to four times as much as McCain, has a better ground organization and a much more excited electorate,&quot; he said. &quot;That's the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll clearly shows that voters believe Obama best understands the concerns of ordinary Americans, and can handle the troubled economy better than McCain and develop an energy policy than will reduce dependence on foreign oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters are a little more comfortable with Obama. He's moved over this hurdle about acceptability, and that means a lot,&quot; Madonna said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama leads McCain 50-45 among likely voters, with 2 percent undecided. His lead is much greater, 49-38 with 9 percent undecided, among all 1,365 registered voters surveyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results show that McCain's 2-point lead in last month's poll, based on a surge from his selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as a running mate, has been wiped away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll was conducted by F&amp;M's Center for Opinion Research from Oct. 13 through Sunday. The margin of error is 3.5 percent in the survey of likely voters and 2.7 percent in the broader poll of all registered voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's weaknesses continue to be the bloc of Democratic voters - 31 percent of those surveyed - who say they would be concerned if he gets elected, and the number of voters who have expressed worry about his policy views (36 percent) and lack of experience (28 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His experience, or lack thereof, and policy differences are probably the two most important reasons Obama hasn't broken this election wide open,&quot; Madonna said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other significant findings, a huge majority of voters - 82 percent - say the country is on the wrong track, and 40 percent say they are worse off financially this year than last. Obama is the choice of those who say the country is on the wrong track, 55-30, and those whose finances are worse, 60-26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forty-seven percent of those polled said the economy is the most important issue in their choice for president, followed by moral values and the Iraq war, at 10 percent each. Obama leads McCain 60-24 among voters primarily concerned with the economy, and 54-31 among those worried most about the Iraq war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain leads Obama 76-13 among values voters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone with a TV can see proof daily that the presidential public-financing system is broken and needs to be fixed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Barack Obama spent more than $3 million last month on TV ads in Pennsylvania, enabling him to run a wide variety of TV commercials seemingly nonstop.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Republican John McCain spent &quot;only&quot; $1.2 million in the Keystone State; the Republican National Commmittee spent an additional $800,000 on his behalf. The million-dollar gap between Obama and McCain has been noticeable on the airwaves, with the Democrat's ads appearing more frequently. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has a huge advantage in other key states, too. In Indiana, he is outspending McCain 20-to-1. In North Carolina, the Democrat has spent nearly six times as much as the Republican on TV commercials.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This unbalanced playing field was created by Obama, the first major-party nominee to reject public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1974. Democrat Hillary Clinton also would have turned down public money, had she won the nomination. Their party is accustomed to being outspent by the Republicans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama backed out of his earlier pledge to accept public money when it became clear just how much he could raise, helped by the Internet. He was already shattering presidential fund-raising records before he brought in a whopping $150 million in September. McCain has accepted public financing, allowing him to spend $84 million for the fall campaign. Of course, that doesn't include what his party is spending. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public financing was created after the Watergate scandal to limit the potential for corruption and allow candidates to focus on issues instead of raising money. The system is financed by taxpayers' $3 donations to a presidential fund. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has raised much of his total through small donations of $200 or less, but big donors and &quot;bundlers&quot; are prevalent, too. At least 324 bundlers have raised $100,000 or more for Obama's campaign, including 47 people who have each raised at least $500,000. A concert by Barbra Streisand raised $9 million in a single night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has 301 bundlers who've raised at least $100,000 each, including 65 supporters who have raised at least $500,000 apiece. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We criticized Obama in June when he flip-flopped on public financing. The damage has been done; the next president and the new Congress must commit to restoring the presidential funding system.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pending legislation would repair the program by providing $4 in public matching funds for every $1 raised, for contributions of $200 or less. Fred Wertheimer, president of the government watchdog group Democracy 21, said this provision would make small donors the &quot;key players&quot; for presidential candidates and increase citizen participation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internet fund-raising also is less costly for campaigns, and lessens the amount of time candidates need to spend soliciting in person. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spending limits also need to be raised, to discourage candidates from opting out. It remains to be seen whether Obama is a one-time fund-raising sensation, or merely the first of a series of candidates who will raise ever more fantastic sums via the Internet. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican nominee was returning Wednesday to the state whose primary he won in 2000 and again earlier this year. But there were signs it was tilting toward Democrat Barack Obama in the Nov. 4 general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent polls have shown Obama, an Illinois senator, with a lead no smaller than 7 percentage points, prompting speculation that McCain may have to surrender the state's four electoral votes and focus elsewhere if he hopes to cobble together the 270 needed to become president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior adviser Mark Salter dismissed such thinking Tuesday. He said McCain was visiting New Hampshire because &quot;we get a charge out of it. We think we're competitive there. They get it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With less than two weeks until Election Day, McCain and his wife, Cindy, were rallying those who &quot;get it&quot; at a rally at St. Anselm College in Goffstown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the scene of debates during both primaries and is at the center of the state the Arizona senator reveres for its tradition of retail politicking. He held more than 100 town-hall meetings in New Hampshire during this campaign cycle and has visited five times since securing the GOP nomination in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political consultant Dean Spiliotes said McCain's biography-heavy campaign has worked well in a small state where a candidate can meet a lot of voters face to face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet New Hampshire political trends are working against McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the only state to vote for Democrat John Kerry in 2004 after going for Republican George W. Bush in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats also swept both its congressional seats, the governor's office and both houses of the state Legislature in 2006. Those results were fueled in large part by anti-Bush and anti-Iraq war sentiment, but Spiliotes argues the shift is certainly more than a blip, if not a permanent trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After stopping in New Hampshire, McCain was headed to Ohio for two rallies with his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. He then was to break off and head to Florida, where Obama also is ahead in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their campaign also released a new television ad in which various people label themselves &quot;Joe the Plumber&quot; and accuse Obama of wanting to raise their taxes. McCain has leveled the same charge, most recently after Joe Wurzelbacher, an Ohio plumber, challenged Obama face-to-face about his tax plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign did not release the cost of the ad buy and said only that it would run in &quot;key&quot; states.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vandals over the weekend defaced a Barack Obama-Joe Biden billboard and a labor union building on Route 30 by spray-painting in red the word &quot;commies&quot; and a crude Soviet-style hammer-and-sickle symbol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Food and Commercials Workers Local 1776, erected the sign Thursday on the local's property, 3161 Chambersburg Road, near Biglerville. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union officials said passersby noticed the vandalism Sunday morning. In addition to vandalizing the billboard, vandals also spray-painted the union building with the word &quot;commies&quot; in red, apparently attempting to link both the Obama ticket and union to communism, union officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As unfortunate and ugly as this incident is, I'm not surprised that it happened given the mean-spirited rhetoric and hate-baiting language that the John McCain-Sarah Palin camp is using,&quot; Wendell W. Young IV, president of the 24,000 member Local 1776, said in a statement. &quot;McCain, Palin and their media commercials repeatedly have questioned Barack Obama's loyalty to our nation. They have falsely accused him of associating with terrorists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have also been reports of McCain signs stolen in this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interviewed later, Young, who is based in Plymouth Meeting near Philadelphia, said the union never has had any problems with vandalism in the 30 years it has been in Adams County. He said union leaders are guessing the vandalism probably took place either late Friday or Saturday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been a positive influence there, not a negative one,&quot; he said. &quot;We never had anything like this happen before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young said union members will try to clean up the graffiti, but given that the Nov. 4 election is only two weeks away, they might not have time to replace the billboard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the union called police to investigate. According to a spokesman for the Pennsylvania State Police at Gettysburg, which covers that part of the Adams County, the police report was not readily available Monday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walt Tuchalski, communications coordinator for the Adams County Republican Committee, said he hasn't heard of any &quot;widespread&quot; vandalism targeted toward either party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that four years ago, someone was caught spray-painting Republican headquarters in Gettysburg and more recently a man in Franklin County was arrested for stealing McCain-Palin signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are some people who get off on this kind of stuff,&quot; Tuchalski said. &quot;Probably up in Biglerville, it was somebody's idea of a joke or some misguided effort to make a statement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrea Mead, spokeswoman for the Obama for America campaign in Pennsylvania, said she hasn't heard of any similar vandalism, but, like Young, said there have been &quot;undercurrents&quot; during the campaign by Obama's opponents who falsely accuse him of being disloyal to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a new one,&quot; she said, when told about the vandalism. &quot;Unfortunately there are people out there who feel the need to do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union represents Knouse Foods Cooperative and Hanover Foods Corp. employees as well as numerous other food processing plants, supermarkets, government services, manufacturing plants, nursing homes, professional offices and Pennsylvania's Wine and Spirits Shops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young said the vandalism &quot;would not deter&quot; the local's support for the Obama ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a right to express our opinion in our nation and a right to expect that violence and property damage is not part of our political dialogue,&quot; he said. &quot;That's the American way. Not hateful language and middle-of-the-night attacks on property.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN A RADIO ad, Sen. Obama declares that he wants his daughters to have the same opportunities as our sons. This seems fair - but I just wonder, if he is elected, will he end affirmative action programs so that my son can have the same rights as his daughters?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Patrick McNulty, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Philadelphia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Vernon begins his letter by saying, &quot;Sen. McCain has chosen Gov. Palin, who is clearly unprepared to be the vice president . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if Sen. Obama, with four years of Senate experience (two of which have been spent running for president), is anywhere near prepared to run our country!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin is a governor, the top exec of a state in the union. Obama has never been in charge of anything. In fact, of the 29 leadership positions in his own party, he was not even considered for one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Rooney, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">King of Prussia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blame Fannie, Freddie execs, too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I agree with columnist Elmer Smith on how greedy and arrogant it was for the execs at Lehman to award themselves millions while workers got nothing but a pink slip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Elmer doesn't seem to mind that the execs at Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Countrywide made millions while common shareholders got wiped out and many workers were laid off. At least Lehman's collapse was the result of greed and stupidity, not fraud.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why are North Philly residents up in arms about Temple students renting in their neighborhood? How about giving the same attention to slumlords renting to crack dealers who decimate their neighborhood? There are zoning laws that prevent law-abiding students from living in their neighborhood, but nothing to deter drug dealers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Cullen, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Hatboro</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who's getting stopped?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can't understand the logic behind putting the blame for the recent death of a Philadelphia police officer on the shoulders of Judge Jacquelyn Frazier-Lyde or the parole board. As a judge, Frazier-Lyde must follow the sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the beginning, I wondered why this officer stopped Daniel Giddings in the first place. If he was wanted for an assault a month before, they couldn't have been looking for him very hard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's really disturbing when I hear that someone has been pulled over by a cop because that driver is almost always a black person. Why is that? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlotte Mears, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Philadelphia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all suffer for bad parolees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears that every time a paroled prisoner commits another crime, the blame is placed on all prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every prisoner, like every citizen in society, has different value systems. We've all made mistakes somewhere in life - some were more serious and warranted stricter punishments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having and showing remorse and redeeming themselves for what they've messed up should be the main focus placed on individuals. We are all unique and should be evaluated on our individual merits, not held accountable for others' bad behavior. Stop blaming all prisoners for the wrong things a few ex-cons do while on parole. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many articles have been printed about Officer McDonald's tragic death, which has affected all of society, including the prison population here at Graterford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many prisoners are waiting to go home, and want to do the right thing. But now they are depicted as being like Officer McDonald's killer. When do we as a humane society stop punishing others for the crimes of a few? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Punishing all prisoners for this tragic event is not the answer. When an officer kills an innocent person, do we punish the whole police department? </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Democratic Illinois Sen. Barack Obama is holding onto his lead in national and state polls as he and Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain focus on a handful of states that will be crucial in deciding the Nov. 4 presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race has tightened with a little more than two weeks to go before Election Day. Mr. Obama was ahead of Mr. McCain by 5 percentage points in the average of seven of the most recent polls compiled by the Web site Realclearpolitics.com. That's a 2-point decline from a week ago, when Mr. Obama led by an average of 7 percentage points. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In two polls released yesterday, from CNN-Opinion Research and Hotline-Diageo, Mr. Obama had a 5 percentage point lead. Mr. Obama got 51 percent support to Mr. McCain's 46 percent in the CNN survey; the Hotline-Diageo poll put Mr. Obama's support at 47 percent to Mr. McCain's 42 percent. A Gallup daily tracking showed Mr. Obama leading 52-43 among registered voters who say they plan to cast ballots on Election Day. All three were conducted Oct. 17-19, after the last presidential debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, bolstered by record fundraising and an endorsement yesterday by retired Gen. Colin Powell, is challenging Mr. McCain in what had been Republican territory, including Virginia and North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain is focusing on the traditional swing states of Florida, Ohio and Missouri, where he was campaigning yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think the race will tighten,&quot; Mr. Obama said this morning in an interview on NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show. &quot;In each of these battleground states, you've got a lot of close races. One of the messages that I've had to my team is that we don't let up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has at least a narrow lead in polls conducted in Colorado, Nevada and Virginia. All were won by Republican George W. Bush in the last two elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, meanwhile, was ahead in the Republican strongholds of Georgia, Texas, Mississippi and Wyoming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two surveys in Florida came up with opposite results as to who is in front. Polls in Ohio, Missouri and North Carolina show the race in a dead heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida began early voting yesterday, and Mr. Obama was spending the day there -- his sixth trip since clinching the Democratic nomination. He campaigned last night in Orlando with New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, his chief rival during the Democratic primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain campaigned in Missouri yesterday before heading to Pennsylvania for the night. The Republican is still competing for Pennsylvania's 21 electoral votes, even as polls here show Mr. Obama widening his lead. The Realclearpolitics.com average puts Mr. Obama's advantage at 13 percentage points in Pennsylvania, up from 8 points at the start of the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama may get a boost from Gen. Powell's endorsement among swing voters who have expressed concern about the first-term senator's ability to deal with foreign and national security affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. Powell served in three GOP administrations, most recently as secretary of state during President Bush's first term. He called Mr. Obama a &quot;transformational figure&quot; yesterday on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press&quot; program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said the Powell endorsement was significant. &quot;What that just did in one sound bite -- and I assume that sound bite will end up in an ad -- is it eliminated the experience argument,&quot; he said Sunday on ABC's &quot;This Week&quot; program. Mr. Obama said on NBC yesterday that if he wins the presidency, he would lean on Gen. Powell as an adviser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic candidate's campaign also reported raising $150 million in September -- the most ever brought in by a presidential candidate in one month -- and is on pace to spend as much as a half-billion dollars. That would be almost double the amount available to Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaigns are focusing on the state-by-state battle and collecting enough support to win majorities in enough states to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to gain the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Virginia, with 13 electoral votes, three polls taken in the past week show Mr. Obama with an average lead of about 6 percentage points. The state has gone Republican in the last 10 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Research 2000 poll conducted Oct. 14-15 in North Carolina found Mr. Obama leading Mr. McCain 46 percent to 44 percent, within the survey's margin for error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The state, with 15 electoral votes, has gone Democratic three times in the last 12 presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two are essentially tied in recent polls in Missouri, which has gone with the winning candidate in 25 of the last 26 presidential elections. A Suffolk University poll conducted Oct. 17-19 and released yesterday shows Mr. McCain with 45 percent and Mr. Obama with 44 percent statewide, with a margin for error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The state has 11 electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another major battleground is Ohio. The two most recent polls, by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research for NBC and Rasmussen, show the race is a dead heat. A poll there by Boston-based Suffolk gave Mr. Obama a 9-point lead, 51 percent to 42 percent. No Republican candidate has won the presidency without also winning Ohio, which will award 20 Electoral College votes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has at least a narrow lead in polls conducted in Colorado, Nevada and Virginia. All were won by Republican George W. Bush in the last two elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, meanwhile, was ahead in the Republican strongholds of Georgia, Texas, Mississippi and Wyoming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two surveys in Florida came up with opposite results as to who is in front. Polls in Ohio, Missouri and North Carolina show the race in a dead heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida began early voting yesterday, and Mr. Obama was spending the day there -- his sixth trip since clinching the Democratic nomination. He campaigned last night in Orlando with New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, his chief rival during the Democratic primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain campaigned in Missouri yesterday before heading to Pennsylvania for the night. The Republican is still competing for Pennsylvania's 21 electoral votes, even as polls here show Mr. Obama widening his lead. The Realclearpolitics.com average puts Mr. Obama's advantage at 13 percentage points in Pennsylvania, up from 8 points at the start of the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama may get a boost from Gen. Powell's endorsement among swing voters who have expressed concern about the first-term senator's ability to deal with foreign and national security affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. Powell served in three GOP administrations, most recently as secretary of state during President Bush's first term. He called Mr. Obama a &quot;transformational figure&quot; yesterday on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press&quot; program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said the Powell endorsement was significant. &quot;What that just did in one sound bite -- and I assume that sound bite will end up in an ad -- is it eliminated the experience argument,&quot; he said Sunday on ABC's &quot;This Week&quot; program. Mr. Obama said on NBC yesterday that if he wins the presidency, he would lean on Gen. Powell as an adviser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic candidate's campaign also reported raising $150 million in September -- the most ever brought in by a presidential candidate in one month -- and is on pace to spend as much as a half-billion dollars. That would be almost double the amount available to Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaigns are focusing on the state-by-state battle and collecting enough support to win majorities in enough states to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to gain the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Virginia, with 13 electoral votes, three polls taken in the past week show Mr. Obama with an average lead of about 6 percentage points. The state has gone Republican in the last 10 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Research 2000 poll conducted Oct. 14-15 in North Carolina found Mr. Obama leading Mr. McCain 46 percent to 44 percent, within the survey's margin for error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The state, with 15 electoral votes, has gone Democratic three times in the last 12 presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two are essentially tied in recent polls in Missouri, which has gone with the winning candidate in 25 of the last 26 presidential elections. A Suffolk University poll conducted Oct. 17-19 and released yesterday shows Mr. McCain with 45 percent and Mr. Obama with 44 percent statewide, with a margin for error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The state has 11 electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another major battleground is Ohio. The two most recent polls, by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research for NBC and Rasmussen, show the race is a dead heat. A poll there by Boston-based Suffolk gave Mr. Obama a 9-point lead, 51 percent to 42 percent. No Republican candidate has won the presidency without also winning Ohio, which will award 20 Electoral College votes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students on local college campuses are concerned about the nation's economy and the ongoing wars in the Middle East as the presidential election draws near.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the presidential election two weeks away, some area college students are still undecided on who they will vote for, or if they will vote at all. Others, however, have made up their minds and, in some instances, have already voted. Most said they have concerns about the economy and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and aren't sure which candidate would be best to address the issues. Austin Cromartie, a junior elementary education major At Shippensburg University from Fayetteville, said the election is &quot;pretty serious&quot; to him because the war in Iraq changed his life plans. He had planned to follow his father into the U.S. Army, but decided against it when the war in Iraq continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It affected my future,&quot; Cromartie said. &quot;I didn't feel we were there for the right reasons.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father retired from his Army career earlier than he had planned, concerned he could be placed on the ground in Iraq after more than two decades of service. He discouraged his sons from joining the military, instructing them to at least choose the U.S. Air Force instead of the U.S. Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It definitely affected my family,&quot; he said, which has a military tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cromartie will vote for Barack Obama because he wants a change from the politics of the last eight years, he said, and feels John McCain is too much like President George W. Bush. He wants to see the armed forces leave Iraq and change what the future will look like for the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we need a little more change than McCain can offer,&quot; Cromartie said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's stance on education was especially appealing to the elementary education major, who hopes to see him change different aspects of No Child Left Behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just want change in general,&quot; Cromartie said. &quot;He's not the white Christian Republican that everyone's used to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laura Feliciani, a freshman at Shippensburg from Newtown, said she isn't sure if she's going to vote at all in the election and her friend Sarah Styer from Lancaster said she's already voted for Obama, but isn't entirely sure why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack, just because,&quot; she said, but added that there are no major issues of importance to her. She also said she did not follow politics much during the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have, but I haven't,&quot; Styer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Cheryl Taylork, a senior at Wilson College from Frederick, Md. also voted by an absentee ballot for Obama because she likes his stance on wars and because he represents change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big thing for me is the economy and the war. I'm a Democrat, so I do side with Obama a lot because he wants to get us out of the war and has better ideas on the economy. He's a big change and we need someone totally different,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edward McCauley III, senior sociology major from Philadelphia said the country needs a great representative to take it in a new direction for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe in what Obama is preaching,&quot; McCauley said. &quot;He seems more genuine, (unlike the) political games on the commercials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCauley's fraternity, Iota Phi Theta Fraternity, Inc., has run voter registration drives on the Shippensburg campus and off campus, encouraging anyone who is 18 or older to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Wilson, the entire college has become more politically active. Jill Hummer, faculty advisor for the Political Science Association at Wilson College, said the college is planning a mock election on Oct. 28, one week before the actual election. The college hosted a debate-watching party and discussion during the debates and will host an election returns party on the night of the general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCauley believes Obama can improve the American economy by eliminating the outsourcing of jobs to other countries. He also likes Obama's anti-war stance, and would like to see him hand over control of Iraq to its government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCauley does like Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, because of her youth and her new attitude, though he disagrees with her conservative politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not conservative at all,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Laird, a freshman history secondary education major at Shippensburg, said his political awareness was enhanced by his college classes, with professors who have assigned election-related assignments for homework and forcing students to watch the presidential debates. The ill stock market has Laird concerned, so he hopes to see a president who can improve the economy and be a good representative of the country on the international scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this is a very important election,&quot; Laird said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many students, however, are still undecided. Steph Metzler, a freshman at Wilson from Fayetteville, is registered to vote, but she is not fond of either candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama is young and doesn't seem to have a set plan. McCain is a lot like Bush,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Wagaman of South Mountain is a student at Penn State-Mont Alto and can relate to Metzler's sentiments. Wagaman said he won't be voting for either candidate on Election Day and will more than likely be casting a ballot for third-party candidate Ron Paul. He has concerns that both candidates are out of touch with most residents and doesn't like the direction that either party has led the country in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think either of them know what Americans want,&quot; He asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ross Miller, a student at Penn State-Mont Alto, said that he's doesn't know who he will be voting for in November but has every intention of casting a ballot. He said that he has concerns about the nation's economy along with personal rights and is against gun control. Mostly, however, he's interested in seeing the economy rebound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a good time to be in school because I don't have to worry about a job,&quot; Miller said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They talked directly to Joe the Plumber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now it's time they talk directly to Joe the Dad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My name is Joe, which officially qualifies me as an Everyman of sorts. According to the McCain and Obama campaigns, I am an expert on the typical, average, middle-class dad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the plumber and the six pack, I am one angry Joe. My anger stems not from how the candidates stand on the issues. It's how they present - or should I say, &quot;mispresent&quot; - their stands on the issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am tired of the lies. And I'm tired of the negative campaigning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My kids are listening. My kids are watching. And I want this political madness to stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through Sept. 7 alone, the candidates aired more than 150,000 negative ads against their opponents, according to Nielsen Media Research. The breakdown is almost 50-50 - McCain's 76,238 to Obama's 75,246.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And I'm certain almost all of the negative commercials were rife with lies. Search any legitimate fact-checking website monitoring this campaign. It is appalling on both sides. Lies dominate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debates are over. But if there were one more ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just One More Debate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walter Cronkite: The audience behind me has promised to be quiet, except at this moment, when we welcome Barack Obama and John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gentlemen, are each of you tonight willing to sit at this vegetable stand and say to each other's faces what your campaigns and the people in your campaigns have said about each other? Senator, you first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: You know, just a few minutes ago, I was looking at eggplants over there. I met Joe the Dad, who was also looking for an eggplant to feed his two kids. Nice guy. He asked me why my opponent is running such a negative campaign. I agreed with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: I am not running the negative commercials. You are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: I am not. And Joe said it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: You're the one running a negative campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: Am not.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: Am not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: Am too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cronkite: Ummm. Gentlemen. Please.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: Sorry, Mr. Cronkite. Sorry, Joe. But my opponent started it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: Did not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: Did too. And you know you're lying. You don't even like eggplant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: Do too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: Do not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: Do too. I also like lettuce. Joe likes lettuce. But Joe doesn't like lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: You're the liar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: Am not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: Am too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: Am not. You know it. And Joe knows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: Liar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: Loser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: Loser liar ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walter Cronkite shakes his head, as the senators begin flinging lima beans at each other. Chaos ensues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">***</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, the debate would end, and I - Joe the Dad - would be famous for a few minutes. Until they find another Joe to pick on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the campaigns promised to leave their children out of it, and that is understandable. But I can't leave my own children out of it. They're exposed daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin is a mother. Obama is a father. McCain and Biden are fathers and grandfathers. It's time they start acting the parts. It's time they start being honest with the American people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An honest politician who can win by running a clean campaign?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe that's just Joe the Idealist talking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe. But it wasn't that long ago that the thought of an African-American president or a female vice president seemed idealistic, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someday we'll have the first candidate whose campaign was won on truth, not cheap assaults and lies. I would vote for that candidate, hands down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just recently, my son was running for student council at his school and had to write a speech. He brought home a checklist, which included, among others, three requirements:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nBe positive in your speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nDo not put down your opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nDo not make unrealistic promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I watched the 11-year-old write and later practice his speech, I couldn't help but think about our own presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What checklist do they use when they write their campaigns?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From all accounts, the candidates and their running mates are good people. They seem like caring citizens who want to make a difference. That gives me comfort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I only wish the atmosphere of their campaigns would reflect the atmosphere of their hearts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe the Idealist again? No, Joe the Dad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, Joe the Dad is tired of the lies. Joe the Dad is tired of the negative campaigning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Believe what you want about the candidate you support. I, for one, think it is a pitiful day when those campaigning to lead the most powerful nation in the world don't meet the minimal requirements necessary to make student council at my son's elementary school.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: Did too. And you know you're lying. You don't even like eggplant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator: Loser liar ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walter Cronkite shakes his head, as the senators begin flinging lima beans at each other. Chaos ensues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">***</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, the debate would end, and I - Joe the Dad - would be famous for a few minutes. Until they find another Joe to pick on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the campaigns promised to leave their children out of it, and that is understandable. But I can't leave my own children out of it. They're exposed daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin is a mother. Obama is a father. McCain and Biden are fathers and grandfathers. It's time they start acting the parts. It's time they start being honest with the American people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An honest politician who can win by running a clean campaign?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe that's just Joe the Idealist talking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe. But it wasn't that long ago that the thought of an African-American president or a female vice president seemed idealistic, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someday we'll have the first candidate whose campaign was won on truth, not cheap assaults and lies. I would vote for that candidate, hands down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just recently, my son was running for student council at his school and had to write a speech. He brought home a checklist, which included, among others, three requirements:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nBe positive in your speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nDo not put down your opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nDo not make unrealistic promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I watched the 11-year-old write and later practice his speech, I couldn't help but think about our own presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What checklist do they use when they write their campaigns?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From all accounts, the candidates and their running mates are good people. They seem like caring citizens who want to make a difference. That gives me comfort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I only wish the atmosphere of their campaigns would reflect the atmosphere of their hearts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe the Idealist again? No, Joe the Dad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, Joe the Dad is tired of the lies. Joe the Dad is tired of the negative campaigning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Believe what you want about the candidate you support. I, for one, think it is a pitiful day when those campaigning to lead the most powerful nation in the world don't meet the minimal requirements necessary to make student council at my son's elementary school.</SPAN></P>

When the audience's attention lags, bring out the big stick. How else to describe the timing of the announcement of the killing of al-Qaeda's No. 2 operative in Iraq on the same day as McCain's final debate? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what if No. 2 was actually killed 10 days earlier. The Bush team had no problem keeping him on ice if it would gain points for their desperate candidate. Don't be surprised if they pull Osama bin Laden out of the deep freeze just before Election Day. The GOP Show must go on!  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stacia FriedmanPhiladelphiaCampaign adviceWith Barack Obama the heavy favorite to win as Election Day nears, John McCain needs to make a bold move, one that could make up for the Sarah Palin selection. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He must revert to his maverick ways and tell the truth to the American voters. Many of us would welcome real straight talk that contained common sense and a respect for the intelligence of the electorate. Tell us the country must live within its means. Tell us there should be shared sacrifice - not just by military families. Tell us we're not &quot;entitled&quot; to free health care, long retirements, or college education. In short, tell us there is no &quot;free lunch.&quot; It sounds crazy, but what have you got to lose?  </SPAN></P>

If injecting lots of money into our banks will allow consumers to borrow and keep spending, then aren't we continuing to stake our economic health on indebtedness? Vast indebtedness is the thing most responsible for this economic failure, albeit &quot;easy credit&quot; caused it. No one wants to admit it, though. Our lifestyles should be based on wages, not credit limits. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yale Professors Marmor and Mashaw are correct on several points, including the compelling need to address health-care costs over more discussions on the mechanisms to finance an obviously broken health-care system. They are also correct in calling for restraining salaries in the health-care industry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the data may not be evident yet, they should not, however, give up on prevention. Also, they omitted the huge economic factor of compassionate and ethical rationing of health care, especially for the elderly and the dying. But politicians are even more loathe to address prevention and rationing than reining in salaries in the health-care sector. So we citizens must lead the way. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a three-night series starting tonight on NBC10's 11 p.m. news, morning anchor Terry Ruggles will talk about his battle with testicular cancer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a story without a clear ending. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruggles, who has worked for WCAU for 34 of his 62 years, told me that he had discovered a lump late in the summer while showering. The testicle was removed, and doctors are weighing chemo or radiation, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that he had considered keeping quiet about it, but that a network program on early cancer detection had made him want to speak out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a personal thing,&quot; he said. &quot;It's just part of the body, and it's a cancer. If I can tell my story and convince someone to take action, that's the right thing.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smerconish's surprise Talk-show host </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Michael Smerconish</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lit up the phones and filled his in-box Friday morning after the lifelong Republican disclosed that he'll vote for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Barack Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - the first time since he registered to vote 28 years ago that he'll pull the D lever for president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smerconish's GOP ties are deep. He was Philly's administrator for the Department of Housing and Urban Development under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">George H.W. Bush</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and introduced </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">George W. Bush</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> here in 2004.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smerconish, making his case in his column in today's Inquirer Currents section (Page C3), told me he was aware that this &quot;coming out&quot; might hurt his career nationally. He has been a frequent fill-in for big names such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Glenn Beck</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bill O'Reilly</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - both of whom wear their conservatism proudly. Smerconish, whose deal with CBS's Big Talker (1210) is up at the end of the year, is being courted by MSNBC. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smerconish, who said he had gotten heat in the spring for allowing Obama to appear on his show, said the talk industry was dominated by ideologues. &quot;Nobody who straddles [the local and national scenes] like I do has success at a national level unless they work at the ends of the political spectrum,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm never going to be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rachel Maddow</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> Keith Olbermann</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He agreed that making his decision public might not have been &quot;in my professional best interest, but it's how I see it. Mine is an opinion, purely based on a lot of circumspection. I'm fortunate that I've chatted with both [Obama and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">John </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">McCain</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">], been in their presence, so this is not an uninformed decision.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, &quot;I'm not telling people what they ought to do. Do whatever you want.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats have Sarah Silverman, mouthy comedienne, urging young Jewish voters in a video to &quot;schlep it&quot; to Florida to persuade their grandparents to vote for Sen. Barack Obama, the &quot;goodest person I know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republicans have Jackie Mason, mouthy comedian, who, in his own video, supports Sen. John McCain and calls Ms. Silverman -- while pictures of Barbra Streisand, Sen. John F. Kerry and other Democrats flash across the screen -- &quot; a sick yenta,&quot; and asks, &quot;What has Obama done? Nothing!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All attempts at humor aside, the battle for the Jewish vote this year is no laughing matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, it's gotten pretty tense out there. Democrats are complaining about Republican-sponsored &quot;push&quot; polls, rumor-mongering and attack ads that, they say, smear Mr. Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans, citing Mr. Obama's willingness to talk directly to leaders of Iran, are trying to sow doubts about Mr. Obama's support for Israel even though he has the same approval score -- 100 percent -- that Mr. McCain does from AIPAC, the influential America-Israel Jewish Political Action Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stakes this year are huge -- especially in a battleground state like Pennsylvania, where Jewish voters make up about 4 percent of the electorate and, in a tight race, could tip the balance either way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Obama has been moving ahead in national polls, his support among Jews lags behind past Democratic candidates, at 57 percent to 30 percent according to one recent poll by the American Jewish Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, Mr. Kerry's share of that vote was 75 percent, a number that has ranged from 64 to 90 percent since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt -- with the notable exception of Jimmy Carter in 1980, whose share of Jewish support hit rock bottom at 45 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since that poll's release in mid-September, the Wall Street crisis may have boosted Mr. Obama's numbers among this group. But the question remains: Why is Mr. McCain getting more traction this year among less religiously conservative and secular Jewish voters who might ordinarily vote Democratic?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's independent-minded,&quot; said Sen. Joe Lieberman of Mr. McCain, a longtime friend and fellow foreign policy hawk. &quot;He's a restless reformer with no patience for the partisan politics that pass for public service these days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Connecticut senator, a former Democrat re-elected as an Independent and the Democratic candidate for vice president eight years ago, spent a recent Friday touring synagogues and appearing at &quot;Bagels with Joe&quot; events in Philadelphia and its suburbs, stressing the Republican nominee's maverick image and citing Mr. McCain's break with the Bush administration on climate change and his support for closing Guantanamo Bay's detention center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Mr. Lieberman will introduce Mr. McCain at a tele-town hall with Jewish leaders from across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama supporters say it's not just Mr. McCain's positives that are resonating with Jewish voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b&gt;Dirty tricks charges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">/b&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think a lot of it is due to the smear campaign that's out there,&quot; said Naftali Kaminski, 48, a physician and researcher at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. A staunch Obama supporter and a native of Israel who lives in Squirrel Hill, he has seen anti-Obama ads running on English-speaking Web sites of Israeli newspapers &quot;trying to feed the suspicion that he is a Muslim or pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Besides being terrible distortions of the truth, these vile, hate-filled, Swift-Boating ads are everywhere in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida,&quot; he frets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lieberman says he doesn't like those ads, either, &quot;but I think ultimately people have enough common sense to separate out fact from fiction,&quot; he said in a recent telephone interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides stressing Mr. McCain's independence from Mr. Bush, Mr. Lieberman and other Republicans are hammering away at Mr. Obama and Iran -- repeatedly citing his statement that he'd meet with &quot;appropriate&quot; Iranian leaders after extensive diplomatic preparations. Republicans insist that means he would talk to Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a Holocaust denier who has called for the annihilation of Israel. The Obama campaign says that's not the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was the last straw, but not the only straw,&quot; said Richard Heideman, a Washington, D.C. attorney. Mr. Heideman spoke on behalf of Mr. McCain at a candidates forum last month at the Jewish Community Center in Squirrel Hill, describing him as &quot;the most experienced hand available to make judgments about life and death issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Heideman delivered a forceful brief for Mr. McCain to an audience of about 80 people -- most of whom appeared to be supporting Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposing him was Gary Ackerman, an acerbic Democratic congressman from Long Island, who told the crowd that, on Iran and other issues, Republicans &quot;are going around pushing our buttons. It's not as though Obama is going to sit down with [Iran President] Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and say, 'How about I give you all the Jews, serve them up on a silver platter.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. Obama didn't say he would talk to Ahmadinejad. He said he supports discussions with Iran, and so do I. Didn't we talk to Krushchev or Anwar Sadat without preconditions?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b&gt;Ground games in high gear</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">/b&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While these debates go on, both sides are vigorously working to target voters. The Obama campaign has set up Jewish &quot;leadership committees&quot; in various communities to hold training sessions with volunteers, who then go out and talk to their neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jewish voters go out and vote,&quot; said Clifford Levine, a Squirrel Hill attorney who has been active in those efforts, which include bringing in surrogates such as Anthony Lake, former national security adviser for President Bill Clinton, Mr. Lake appeared at Rodef Shalom Temple in Shadyside last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Levine nonetheless acknowledged that &quot;this is election is closer than a lot of people think it should be. Older, traditional Democrats aren't quite there yet, even as their children are enthusiastically working for Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are lots of older people there are going to work on folks living in the Squirrel Hill high-rises,&quot; added former radio talk show host Lynn Cullen, who is now campaigning for Mr. Obama. &quot;One lady sitting next to me said, 'I'm targeting the bubbes.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have been relying on surrogates like Mr. Lieberman and the Washington, D.C.-based Republican Jewish Coalition, which is not affiliated with the McCain campaign but runs Republican advertising and organizing efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Up until now Democrats have been able to take the Jewish vote for granted but not this year,&quot; said Matt Brooks, executive director of the coalition, whose ads in Jewish newspapers have described Mr. Obama as &quot;pro-Palestinian&quot; and &quot;anti-Israel.&quot; That ad campaign, along reports of telephone surveys suggesting that Mr. Obama had given money to terrorist groups, has enraged Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do these guys have any shame?&quot; asked Ira Forman, executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Council, who held a news conference last month claiming that the RJC was behind the surveys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I test messages,&quot; he said. &quot;The Republican Jewish Coalition is testing lies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can assure you we never asked any questions about Obama donating money to the PLO,&quot; Mr. Brooks said, noting that his group's survey was not a &quot;push poll&quot; -- short phone calls to thousands of voters which masquerade as surveys but are really designed to pass along negative messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, the coalition's most recent poll of 750 voters -- in Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania -- featured 82 questions on a wide range of issues, about 10 percent of them involving questions designed to test negative messages about Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deb Minden, a Squirrel Hill psychologist, said she received a call a few weeks ago from pollsters &quot;who asked me how I would feel if I knew Barack Obama was giving money to Hamas or spoke to Hezbollah. It actually sounded like a real poll at the beginning. They wanted names, demographics, were asking generic questions about the candidates,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when the questions turned to Mr. Obama's associations with terrorists, she felt disgusted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was just garbage,&quot; she said. &quot;I hate to think that people think you can scare somebody off and that Jews are only single-issue voters and the Jewish community is so flat in its outlook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, the single issue of Israel remains paramount for many, and Mr. Obama's surrogates have been working hard to dispel the notion that Mr. Obama is somehow weaker on the issue than Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I've been asking people, when I speak at synagogues, is to ask themselves is not just which candidate would be stronger friend of Israel, but which America would be,&quot; said Mr. Lake. &quot;An America that is coming together, that is more unified, that puts aside divisive tactics would be a stronger friend to the Jewish state. That, along with direct talks with Iran to back off its nuclear program, and negotiations with the Syrians would result in our having a stronger standing in the Middle East.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's also the complex, delicate issue of racial bias, says Jessica Emerson-Fleming, founder of Jewish Grandchildren for Obama, which, like Sarah Silverman's TheGreatSchlep.com, is trying to mobilize younger voters to persuade older relatives to vote for Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those younger voters are having to talk about race much more than they expected, she added, a task requiring some diplomatic skill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't have grandchildren calling their grandparents racist. On the other hand, we think it's very important to call out racism, especially when it's an undercurrent. A lot of people don't realize how what they're saying sounds until they're called out on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even McCain supporters say they're uncomfortable with the ads and e-mails that have been circulating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're &quot;unfortunate and blatantly not true,&quot; said Daniel Berkowitz, a former Department of Defense employee who is opening a kosher bakery in Squirrel Hill, &quot;and that's a shame because there is so much we can talk about on the issues that support Mr. McCain's candidacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given their relatively small numbers, though, it's not clear if Jewish voters like Mr. Berkowitz will engender a big enough shift toward the Republican to make a difference -- even as emotions on both sides are running high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My entire street is Obama,&quot; said Cheryl Moore, 43, of Squirrel Hill, and a staunch McCain supporter. Her congregation, Rodef Shalom, &quot;is about 90-10 for Obama, and that's fine, it doesn't bother me at all. This is America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I had a sign out for McCain and it was taken down. What's hard for me is the assumption that there is something wrong with my character and intelligence if I'm voting for McCain. I really do feel a little isolated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kaminski said he's never seen such interest in politics in his dozen years in the U.S. &quot;You never knew what the next person thought. Now, you go to the 61C Cafe in the morning, and you know what everyone thinks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHILADELPHIA -- Sen. Barack Obama is days away from breaking the $188 million advertising spending record set by President Bush in the 2004 general-election campaign, having unleashed an advertising campaign of a scale and complexity unrivaled in the television era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With advertisements running repeatedly day and night, on local stations and on the major broadcast networks, on niche cable networks and even on video games and his own dedicated satellite channels, Mr. Obama is now out-advertising Sen. John McCain nationwide by a ratio of at least 4 to 1, according to CMAG, a service that monitors political advertising. That difference is even larger in several closely contested states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The huge gap has been made possible by Mr. Obama's decision to opt out of the federal campaign finance system, which gives presidential nominees a dollar for every dollar they raise but limits to $84 million the amount they can spend between their party convention and Election Day. Mr. McCain is participating in the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, who at one point promised to participate in it as well, is expected to announce in the next few days that he raised more than $100 million in September alone -- a figure that would shatter previous monthly fundraising records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenneth M. Goldstein, director of the University of Wisconsin's Advertising Projec, said, &quot;We've certainly seen heavy advertising battles before. But we've never seen in a presidential race one side having such a lopsided advantage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Obama's decision to forgo the matching funds -- and the limits with them -- has given him a spending advantage throughout the election, his broadcast dominance has become most apparent in the past few weeks, as he has gone on a buying binge of TV time that has allowed him to utterly swamp Mr. McCain's campaign with concurrent lines of positive and negative messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama ads come as Republicans began a blitz of automated phone calls attacking the Democrat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign's advertising approach -- which has included ads of as long as two minutes, in which the candidate positively lays out his agenda, and even ads in video games like &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; -- has helped mask some of his rougher attacks on his rival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What Obama is doing is being his own good cop and bad cop,&quot; said Evan Tracey, CMAG's chief operating officer, who calls the ad war &quot;a blow out&quot; in Mr. Obama's favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disparity has come to the frustration of Mr. McCain, who traded accusations with Mr. Obama over the advertising battle during this week's debate, with the Democrat telling him, &quot;Your ads, 100 percent of them have been negative,&quot; and the Republican saying, &quot;Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The University of Wisconsin's most recent analysis of the presidential ads available before the debate -- based on a one week period from Sept. 28 through Oct. 4 -- found Mr. McCain's&nbsp;commercials had been &quot;nearly 100 percent negative,&quot; and that the same could be said for 34 percent of Mr. Obama's ads, which were more focused that week on promoting his own agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That finding reflected the McCain camp's strategy of trying to make Mr. Obama an unacceptable choice in the eyes of undecided voters and his rival's goal of making undecided voters comfortable with him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me get this straight. A couple of agitated yahoos in a rally of thousands yell something offensive and incendiary, and John McCain and Sarah Palin are not just guilty by association -- with total strangers, mind you -- but worse: guilty according to The New York Times of &quot;race-baiting and xenophobia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But should you bring up Barack Obama's real associations -- 20 years with Jeremiah Wright, working on two foundations and distributing money with William Ayers, citing the raving Michael Pfleger as one who helps him keep his moral compass (Chicago Sun-Times, April 2004) and the long-standing relationship with the left-wing vote-fraud specialist ACORN -- you have crossed the line into illegitimate guilt by association. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, it is tinged with racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that, when John McCain actually heard one of those nasty things said about Mr. Obama, he incurred the boos of his own crowd by insisting that Mr. Obama is &quot;a decent person that you do not have to be scared [of] as president&quot; makes no difference. It surely did not stop John Lewis from comparing Mr. McCain to George Wallace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The search for Mr. McCain's racial offenses is untiring and often unhinged. Remember Mr. McCain's Berlin/celebrity ad that showed a shot of Paris Hilton? An appalling attempt to exploit white hostility at the idea of black men &quot;becoming sexually involved with white women,&quot; fulminated New York Times columnist Bob Herbert. He took to TV to denounce Mr. McCain's exhumation of that most vile prejudice, pointing out Mr. McCain's gratuitous insertion in the ad of &quot;two phallic symbols,&quot; the Washington Monument and the Leaning Tower of Pisa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except that Mr. Herbert was entirely delusional. There was no Washington Monument. There was no Leaning Tower. Just photographs seen in every newspaper in the world of Barack Obama's Berlin rally in the setting he himself had chosen, Berlin's Victory Column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Herbert is not the only fevered one. On Tuesday night, Rachel Maddow of MSNBC and Jonathan Alter of Newsweek fell over themselves agreeing that the &quot;political salience&quot; of the Republican attack on ACORN is, yes, its unstated appeal to racial prejudice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This about an organization that is being accused of voter registration fraud in about a dozen states. In Nevada, the investigating secretary of state is a Democrat. Is he playing the race card too?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes the charges against Mr. McCain especially revolting is that he has been scrupulous in eschewing the race card. He has gone far beyond what is right and necessary, refusing even to make an issue of Mr. Obama's deep, self-declared connection with the race-baiting Jeremiah Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the name of racial rectitude, Mr. McCain has denied himself the use of that perfectly legitimate issue. It is simply Orwellian for him to be now so widely vilified as a stoker of racism. What makes it doubly Orwellian is that these charges are being made on behalf of the one presidential candidate who has repeatedly, and indeed quite brilliantly, deployed the race card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How brilliantly? The reason Bill Clinton is sulking in his tent is because he feels that Obama surrogates succeeded in painting him as a racist. Mr. Clinton has many sins, but from his student days to his post-presidency, his commitment and sincerity in advancing the cause of African Americans have been undeniable. If the man Toni Morrison called the first black president can be turned into a closet racist, then anyone can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mr. Obama has shown no hesitation in doing so to Mr. McCain. Just weeks ago, in Springfield, Mo., and elsewhere, he warned darkly that George Bush and John McCain were going to try to frighten you by saying that, among other scary things, Mr. Obama has &quot;a funny name&quot; and &quot;doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain has never said that, nor anything like that. When asked at the time to produce one instance of Mr. McCain deploying race, the Obama campaign could not. Yet here was Mr. Obama firing a pre-emptive charge of racism against a man who had not indulged in it. An extraordinary rhetorical feat, and a dishonorable one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes this all the more dismaying is that it comes from Barack Obama, who has consistently presented himself as a healer, a man of a new generation above and beyond race, the man who would turn the page on the guilt-tripping grievance politics of Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I once believed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CORRECTION -- Last week I wrote that in 1995 Bill Ayers gave Barack Obama a fund-raiser in his home. I should instead have called it a campaign event.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got to be macho!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know if I could picture Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a member of the Village People, but that ensemble is such an electric group, I don't see how a Russian prime minister could ruin the mix. I would go see him if he went on tour. He might be a little weak on &quot;YMCA,&quot; but he would fit right in with &quot;Macho Man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putin has a six-pack and he is one mean dude. I am not referring to his politics. I do not approve of his politics or his use of military force. I am not about to get into his invasion of Georgia or his other political power plays, but the dude is one mighty macho man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has proved that on countless occasions. He has been seen shirtless on a fishing expedition. He was at the wheel of an immense racing truck. He has flown in a Russian fighter jet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few months ago, dressed in camouflage, he was walking through the woods of a Russian wildlife preserve. He spied a Ussuri tiger intimidating photojournalists and confronted the animal, reportedly the largest cat on the planet, and saved the journalists by shooting it with a tranquilizer gun. He put a tracking device on the big cat's neck and petted it like it was a house pet. &quot;She will remember us.&quot; He was quoted as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, like any celebrity, Putin has gone commercial. He has released a video as a judo master. This instructional DVD is entitled (in translation) &quot;Let's Learn Judo with Vladimir Putin&quot; I think the title could have a bit more pizzazz. I believe it could have more strength, but it isn't &quot;Judo for Idiots&quot; or &quot;Let's Go Beyond Pilates.&quot; &quot;Let's Learn Judo with Vladimir Putin&quot; is a bit on the juvenile side. But then Barack Obama has expanded his advertising to put roadside billboards on the Xbox racing video game, &quot;Burnout Paradise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putin wants his people to get physical. Putin is a black belt and a former judo champion of his home city, St.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petersburg. The DVD was produced in collaboration with other judo experts and Olympic judo champion Yasuhiro Yamashita. It pictures Putin talking about the history of the martial art and later has him demonstrating moves with his practice partner. He shows his prowess by throwing his partner onto the mat several times. The Russians love to see their virile 56-year-old prime minister in action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DVD has taken off. French President NIcolas Sarkozy is a martial arts fan and would like to take some lessons. In the future Putin and Sarkozy will be training together. I wonder if our next president will be invited to the judo klatch?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a shame that &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger,&quot; is no longer in production. Chuck Norris could either put Putin on his team or have him as a long-running foe. Putin could be in the next Jackie Chan movie. Then we wouldn't be able to understand either of the main characters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think it's time for a Vladimir Putin action figure. Every politician has an action figure. Sarah Palin has three action dolls out. One depicts her as an executive. Another shows her as a school girl and still another has her as Sarah Palin, Super Hero. It is rumored that there is another Palin action figure dressed in a black bustier and sporting a Miss Alaska sash. I particularly like the Beach Blanket Obama action figure. Talk about broad shoulders and a six-pack stomach. I bet Michelle Obama wishes that he could look like that. John McCain has an action figure. John Edwards has an action figure. Even Elliot Spitzer has an action figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I searched the Net and couldn't find a Joe Biden action figure. Osama and McCain have Pez Dispensers. Biden doesn't even rate one of those, but he does have a bobble head doll. On that same sale offering I noticed that the John McCain bobble head doll was sold out. Now what does that say to the pollsters?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I began to wonder what instructional DVDs our fearless leaders could offer the voters? I am referring to instructional DVDs on their unique nonpolitical skills. Could Sarah Palin put one out on log-rolling? How about an instructional bowling DVD from Obama? It seems that Joe Biden likes Ping-Pong. That would make a great DVD. He also likes slip-sliding. I thought that is what he did at the debates. McCain likes hiking and fishing. That is not quite as exciting as judo. He also is a great barbecue grill chef. He could put out a cooking DVD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vladimir Putin does not have a bobble head doll. I'm sure that suits him just fine, but after his judo DVD he certainly does deserve an action figure or even an Xbox game. I wonder if Obama would advertise on that one?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempting to build on his performance in the final debate, underdog John McCain traveled to Chester County yesterday and hammered Barack Obama over the Democrat's plan to raise taxes on high-income individuals and small businesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama warned his own supporters against overconfidence. He did so during a visit to New Hampshire, where Hillary Rodham Clinton upset him in that state's Democratic primary in January. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the GOP rally at the United Sports Training Center in Downingtown, McCain told several thousand cheering supporters that the real winner in the debate Wednesday night was neither himself nor Obama but &quot;Joe the Plumber,&quot; a man whom McCain made a focus of his debate performance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That man, Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher, had a conversation with Obama in Holland, Ohio, last Sunday about taxes. Obama's tax plan would raise rates on families and small businesses making more than $250,000 per year while also proposing middle-class tax relief.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama told Wurzelbacher it was a good idea to &quot;spread the wealth around.&quot; McCain said it was not a good idea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama &quot;wants the government to take Joe's money and give it to someone else,&quot; McCain said. &quot;His hard-earned dollars. We're not going to stand for that. America didn't become the greatest nation on earth by spreading the wealth. We became the greatest nation on earth by creating new wealth.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign also launched a &quot;Joe the Plumber&quot; Web ad, reprising the original Obama-Wurzelbacher conversation and calling the Democrat's proposal &quot;welfare&quot; at the expense of &quot;hardworking families.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New Hampshire, Obama suggested that McCain's concern was disingenuous and that most plumbers would do better financially in a Democratic administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is &quot;trying to suggest that a plumber is the guy he's fighting for,&quot; Obama said. &quot;How many plumbers you know that are making a quarter-million dollars a year?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wurzelbacher said he wasn't one of them. So he would get a tax cut from Obama. But in an interview on ABC's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Good Morning America</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he called Obama's approach &quot;a very socialist view&quot; and &quot;incredibly wrong.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain was using the episode to help frame the presidential race as a contest between a small-government, low-tax conservative and a tax-and-spend liberal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Raising taxes makes a bad economy much worse,&quot; McCain said. &quot;Keeping taxes low creates jobs, keeps money in your hands, and strengthens our economy.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, McCain and Obama both appeared at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York to address the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, a generally lighthearted annual event hosted by the New York Archdiocese that raises money for medical causes. Smith was a Democrat who ran, unsuccessfully, for president in 1928 as the first Catholic major-party nominee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain joked to the dinner attendees that he had replaced his entire team of senior advisers with a man named &quot;Joe the Plumber.&quot; Obama said there was no other crowd in America he would rather be &quot;palling around with right now.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show McCain trailing nationally and in Pennsylvania, the only state the Democrats won four years ago in which he and the Republican Party appear to be waging a full-fledged campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts look at the Pennsylvania numbers - Obama leads by an average of 13 percentage points - and wonder how long McCain, who has visited the state three times in the last nine days, will keep pouring his limited resources into the battle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no signs of retreat. Tomorrow, Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin will be in Lancaster while McCain's wife, Cindy, visits Wilkes-Barre. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing is inevitable here,&quot; McCain told the crowd in Downingtown. &quot;We never give up.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Wadiak, 31, a stay-at-home father from Exton, wasn't feeling too optimistic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pennsylvania might be almost impossible; he's definitely the underdog,&quot; Wadiak said. &quot;But I always like the candidate who talks about lower taxes and smaller government. And I don't trust Obama, both because of his past associations and his views. I think he's a huge liberal.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, at his rally in Londonderry, N.H., had two prime goals in mind. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One was to reinforce, once again, the link between McCain and President Bush, which is the topic of a new Obama campaign ad.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not running against George Bush,&quot; Obama acknowledged yesterday in response to McCain's comments during the debate. &quot;I'm running against all those policies of George Bush that you support, Sen. McCain.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other was to battle complacency among his supporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are 19 days away from changing this country. Nineteen days,&quot; Obama said. &quot;But for those who are getting a little cocky, I've got two words for you: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">New Hampshire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I learned right here, with the help of my great friend and supporter Hillary Clinton, that you can't let up or pay too much attention to the polls.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today and tomorrow, Obama is to campaign in Virginia, Missouri and North Carolina, states once assumed to be safely in the Republican column. Obama leads in Virginia; Missouri and North Carolina are close. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that he is spending time in those places implies that his strategists believe a decisive, national victory for Obama is a realistic possibility - and that they have the money to try to make it happen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign also is reportedly launching a television campaign in West Virginia, which Bush won handily in 2004 and where Obama was beaten badly in the primaries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's next stops are in Florida, Virginia and Ohio, all states the Republicans won last time around. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, a Visit to Letterman </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, on CBS's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Late Show With David Letterman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last night, told the host &quot;I screwed up&quot; by canceling an earlier appearance on the show, then faced a sharp round of questioning about Sarah Palin and his campaign tactics.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">&quot;Can you stay?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Letterman asked after McCain sat down. &quot;Depends on how bad it gets,&quot; McCain said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Letterman seemed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to ridicule McCain about the implication that Barack Obama and former radical activist William Ayers had a relationship. &quot;Are they double-dating? Are they going to dinner? What are they doing?&quot; he asked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">&quot;Maybe going to Denny's,&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain replied.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Letterman had</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> kept up a relentless comic assault  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on McCain ever since the GOP nominee canceled his Sept. 24 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Late Show</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appearance, saying he had to deal with the economy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">McCain rented</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a helicopter to fly to New York in time for yesterday's show after a weather delay grounded his plane in Philadelphia. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHILADELPHIA IS smack in the middle of what presidential candidate John McCain calls &quot;one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or maybe not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's dramatic charge came midway through Wednesday night's debate with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Barack Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The Republican was referring to ACORN, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, which has been running massive voter-registration drives across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Philadelphia, ACORN has registered thousands of new voters - 78,376 applications here in just the past six months, according to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Tim Dowling</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a veteran in the City Commissioners Office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number includes thousands of applications for voters who already are registered, living in the suburbs or other states, or too young to vote. And there are hundreds that are missing some essentials - home addresses, dates of birth, or the voter signature that's supposed to help identify voters when they go to the polls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's charge was based on a relatively small number of cases, here and in other cities, where officials suspect that some ACORN workers intentionally submitted bogus voter applications, making up names and addresses or copying material from phone books. Deputy City Commissioner </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Fred Voigt</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he'd sent about 1,500 suspicious-looking applications - about 2 percent of ACORN's submissions - to federal prosecutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACORN organizers say that they flagged many of these forms themselves and fired any workers who were implicated in submitting bogus applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every person we register, we have a quality-control staff that calls that person three times to verify the information,&quot; said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ali Kronley</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, head organizer of Pennsylvania ACORN. &quot;If we can't verify, or believe there is a problem, we flag it and we put the form in a separate batch that we call 'suspicious.' But we're required to turn in every card we get, even if it's '</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Mickey Mouse</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.' . . . Occasionally we do have a problem with an employee. But they're not trying to commit voter fraud, they're trying to get paid for work they didn't do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Greetings from Vegas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic State Committee has printed 15,000 copies of what purports to be an oversized postcard from state Rep. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">John Perzel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, sending his greetings from Las Vegas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a bid to publicize a series of Vegas trips financed by payday-loan companies and Perzel's own campaign treasury, disclosed in Perzel's finance reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're not going to believe this, but I'm here in Las Vegas with my lobbyist buddies for the fifth time!&quot; says the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">faux</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> postcard. &quot;Nothing beats living high on the hog in Harrisburg and then getting to blow off some steam in Vegas - on their dime. What a ride!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perzel's spokesman, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Marty O'Rourke</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, had nothing to say about the gag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Palin puckers in Delco</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When John McCain and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sarah Palin</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> visited Media last month for a rally at the Delaware County courthouse, the Alaska governor left something behind for GOP congressional candidate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Craig Williams</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: a radio spot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams, a former federal prosecutor, attended high school in Anchorage, and his brother Scott was one of Palin's speechwriters. He says he's the only congressional candidate whom Palin has blessed with a personal campaign ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only thing that separates me from Craig Williams on reforming Washington is, well, lipstick,&quot; Palin says in the one-minute spot, which debuted this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams, a veteran of the first Gulf War in the early 1990s, is facing Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak, a retired admiral who knocked off 10-term Republican Curt Weldon in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, Sestak's campaign sent out a breathless fundraising appeal, worrying that the Palin ad could be a &quot;game changer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign-finance reports show that the congressman already had $3.2 million cash on hand at the end of last month, compared with Williams' $263,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Veteran ward leader steps down</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congratulations to former state Rep. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Norman Berson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has survived 36 years as Democratic leader of Center City's 8th Ward and is giving up his post the day after next month's election. &quot;The job requires a certain amount of physical energy, and the years are catching up with me,&quot; said Berson, who turns 82 next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berson became a ward leader in 1972, as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Frank Rizzo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took office as mayor and fought for several years to take control of the Democratic Party machinery. Rizzo never managed to control Berson or his wife, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Lenore</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who were among the leaders of the Stop Rizzo movement that blocked Rizzo's bid for a third term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Michael Stack Sr.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who'd spent 37 years as Democratic leader of the Northeast's 58th Ward, gave up his post last year to his son, state Sen. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Michael Stack Jr</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. That leaves state Rep. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Frank Oliver</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as the party's senior ward leader, 38 years and counting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Obama wins a lawn sign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Clout confederate spotted an Obama lawn sign at the Mount Airy home of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sam Katz</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has run for mayor three times and governor once, always as a Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have six voters in the house, a lot of points of view,&quot; Katz said yesterday, seeming to ponder how much candor to include in his explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In all honesty, it will probably be a unanimous vote in the Katz household . . . I was undecided and wanted to stay undecided. But the collapse of the economy and McCain's performance through that process pushed me a little bit over the other side. I tell people I don't think Obama's ready to be president and I don't think McCain should be. But I always try to vote for the guy I think will do the best job.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- It's an attention-grabbing claim: Americans each year are sending $700 billion to unfriendly countries for oil, as much as the entire cost of the Wall Street bailout plan. In rare agreement, both presidential candidates use the number. But is it real?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much,&quot; Republican John McCain said again Wednesday night during the candidates' final debate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Barack Obama joined the refrain recently, declaring at a Wisconsin rally that a push for alternative energy &quot;will stop us from sending $700 billion a year to tyrants and dictators for their oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim, however, wildly exaggerates the amount of money going to unfriendly nations. It also significantly inflates spending in general on petroleum imports, especially considering recent dramatic declines in oil prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number appears to have originated with Texas oil mogul T. Boone Pickens, who is campaigning hard to displace some of those imports with windmills and domestic natural gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An examination by The Associated Press of government oil import costs in 2007 and the first seven months of this year, the latest figures available, indicates that the $700 billion figure overstates total spending by nearly one-third -- and possibly as much as one-half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only about one-fourth of the imports come from countries that might be considered unfriendly, such as Venezuela and Iran, and from the politically volatile Persian Gulf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to government agencies that track energy imports, the United States spent $246 billion in 2007 for all imported crude oil; a majority came from friendly nations, including neighboring Canada and Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An additional $82 billion was spent on imported refined petroleum products, such as gasoline, diesel and fuel oil. A majority of the refined products came from refineries in such friendly countries as the Netherlands, Canada, the United Kingdom, Trinidad and Tobago and the Virgin Islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil prices zoomed in the first seven months this year, but even then, the cost of oil and refined product imports totaled $283.6 billion from January through July, according to the Census Bureau's Foreign Trade Division -- a hefty amount, but not near an annualized $700 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So where did the number come from?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Rogers, a McCain campaign spokesman, noted in an e-mail response that Mr. Obama had used it, and that Mr. Pickens had cited the $700 billion figure. &quot;It's in fairly wide circulation,&quot; Mr. Rogers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign could not say immediately where their candidate got the number. Obama spokesman Nick Shapiro said he was trying to find out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No official government or industry statistics on oil imports confirmed the annual $700 billion expenditure, much less the claim that the United States is sending that much money for oil to politically volatile or unfriendly nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all likelihood, the number had its genesis with Mr. Pickens. Since June, he has promoted his &quot;Pickens Plan&quot; for U.S. energy independence; it relies heavily on expanding domestic wind energy and natural gas projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Pickens has cited the $700 billion figure for imported oil on his Web site, in TV commercials and testimony before Congress. He plans to invest $58 million to promote his plan to build wind farms and expand natural gas production with an aim to reduce reliance on foreign oil. He has leased hundreds of thousands of acres in West Texas, where he plans to erect 2,700 wind turbines to produce power for Dallas and Fort Worth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his Web site makes clear that the oil reference is to all petroleum imports, not just from nations that, according to Mr. McCain, &quot;don't like us very much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the federal Energy Information Administration, last year the United States imported nearly 4.9 billion barrels of oil and refined products --16 percent of it from the Persian Gulf, and 10 percent from Venezuela, whose president has been hostile to the United States. Neighbors Canada and Mexico, by comparison, accounted for 30 percent of all such imports, with Canada at the top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Bradshaw, who works with Mr. Pickens in Dallas, confirmed that the Pickens group produced the $700 billion figure to &quot;draw attention to how big a problem this is.&quot; Mr. Pickens' analysis is based on calculations that sharply overstate the cost of petroleum imports, both crude oil and refined products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the calculation used a crude oil price of $145 a barrel -- the peak price of premium light crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange late last June. Oil prices on that exchange hovered around $70 a barrel yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FRANKLIN COUNTY -- Wednesday night's presidential debate between Sen. Barack Obama, D-Illinois, and Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, may have done little to persuade undecided voters, and even less to cause party faithfuls to switch allegiance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of people in Franklin County said they did not watch the third and final debate, although they had watched the first two. Most of those interviewed by Public Opinion said they were tired of the negative commercials by both candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Shabbar Hussain, initially undecided, said after this debate he decided to support Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hussain, Chambersburg, said the debate was a good one. His personal feeling is that McCain was getting &quot;a little short tempered on some things&quot; and was losing his patience. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were discussing issues appropriately,&quot; he said. &quot;At one time I felt that Obama was slightly angry with McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hussain said he would certainly vote for Obama because the nation is in need of good leadership. The past eight years of Republicans in power has resulted in problems with the economy and in foreign affairs, he said: &quot;We need proper leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought McCain was very aggressive with his opinions and goals,&quot; said Mark Richards of Chambersburg. &quot;I thought that Obama just sat on it. I thought McCain was more direct when he answered the questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richards thinks that Obama skated around some things. He also didn't appreciate what he called Obama rolling his eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was originally going to vote for Obama and switched to McCain,&quot; he said, adding he is afraid of Obama's skeletons in the closet and did not like that he didn't visit Colombia: &quot;I thought McCain did well with Joe the plumber, but I think Obama did, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richards said that out of all three debates, &quot;this was McCain's best debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lyle Adams of Shippensburg also described the exchange as a &quot;good debate&quot; between the two candidates: &quot;Both sides came across fairly well. Nothing surprised me about the debate. I thought facial expressions of Sen. McCain were unusual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams said he did not learn anything new from the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've been doing this for over a year,&quot; he said. &quot;We have already heard it, which is why I think people are uninterested in them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams believes McCain expressed his ideas rather well: &quot;However, I don't think he was able to change people's minds. I didn't think Obama made any huge mistakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams plans on voting for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negative campaign ads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sick and tired of it,&quot; said Wib Haugh, Waynesboro, of the campaign tactics. &quot;I can't sit down and watch TV before a commercial comes on it. They just cut each other up. I'm voting for Obama. If we have McCain in there, we'll have the same thing (as with Bush) for four to eight years. I lived long enough to retire and gas is so high. I don't get around as much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haugh also criticized McCain's running mate: &quot;That woman he has as a running mate, they need to ship her back to Alaska. She's a big mouth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I echo Wib's remark,&quot; said Ron Flegel, Waynesboro. &quot;The negativity of it is unbelievable. It's hard to tell what's true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They shouldn't be allowed to waste time and money bad-mouthing one another,&quot; added Earl Baker, also of Waynesboro. &quot;That isn't good. You get money but use it for something else. They ask for donations every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a staunch McCain supporter,&quot; said Randi Hartman, Waynesboro. &quot;I love the fact that he chose Palin as a running mate. As for the debate, it seems that everybody wants a fight. I don't mind the way debates have been set up this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last commercial I saw of Obama just blew me away. He was talking about how his grandfather served in Patton's army. That has nothing to do with (Obama).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harold Nichols, Greencastle, said he has been disappointed in both campaigns, and that there's too much bickering back and forth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's more to this than just the economy,&quot; he said. &quot;Too many Americans have short memories. In Washington, we have too many Republicans, too many Democrats, and not enough Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nichols said he will vote for McCain &quot;only because of his service to his country.&quot; Nichols also believes McCain will be strong on defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disability and undecideds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think John McCain sucks,&quot; said Gordon Fogg, Waynesboro. &quot;We don't want him in there. We're on disability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fogg shares a home with Cindy Huss, who also is disabled. Huss said that McCain &quot;wants to tax the insurance, which will make the premiums go higher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Huss also is bothered by McCain's wealth: &quot;He couldn't remember he had seven houses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fogg agreed. He said, &quot;It's getting to the point where anyone on disability can't afford to live.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a stop in Greencastle, Greg Ferris of Rhode Island said he remains undecided and does not like either candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Neither one will do any good for me,&quot; he said, adding it's like the previous election and choosing the lesser of two evils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a retired Marine and I think McCain has sold out the military,&quot; Ferris said. &quot;Obama was wearing a Marine T-shirt playing basketball. That's a no-no to a Marine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes time to vote, Ferris said he might just toss a coin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Krista Swanger, a Shippensburg University student, only watched part of it. She is not a fan of Obama: &quot;I think McCain did better than Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crystal Doyle, another SU student, only caught the end of the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's annoying how they mudsling at each other and interrupt each other,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doyle does not like McCain's ideas on education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Student Zach Madera, who's majoring in criminal justice, flipped back and forth between debate and the Phillies game. He plans to vote for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like no one talks about Iraq anymore,&quot; he said. &quot;I think we need a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reason he doesn't like McCain is because he thinks McCain will keep troops in Iraq. McCain came out very strong in the beginning of the debate, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain was very aggressive in the beginning of the debate, and I thought it was strange that Obama took it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To borrow a sports analogy or three, Republican presidential nominee John McCain, trailing badly in the polls, needed to land a knockout blow in the third and final debate Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he threw a few haymakers that didn't quite connect with the Democrat, Barack Obama, and grew visibly tired, frustrated and angry, local political analysts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, they say, the presidential debate did little to change the dynamics of the race with less than three weeks to go: McCain missed his chance as Obama ran the clock. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I felt McCain came out strong in the beginning, culminating with the 'I'm not George Bush' line, but then he punched himself out,&quot; said Fletcher McClellan, chairman of Elizabethtown College's political science department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the debate went on, he got angrier and crankier,&quot; he said. &quot;Obama was running out the clock. I didn't think this third debate would settle anything. When you get to the last debate, voters have just about made up their minds and are looking for confirmation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dickinson College political analyst Jim Hoefler said McCain missed his chance during the debate to swear off attacks on Obama's character and turn his campaign into one about issues such as the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was his big moment and he missed it,&quot; Hoefler said. &quot;He needed to challenge Obama on the high ground. He knows darn well these negative ads are hurting his campaign; he needed to come forward and say, 'Every single ad I'm running now is going to be pulled, and from this point forward we're going to focus on the issues.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He needs to throw that long pass,&quot; Hoefler said of McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there are too many old-style partisans helping to run this campaign who think they they're going to keep throwing stuff against him (Obama), hoping it sticks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, seemingly more prepared and definitely more aggressive than in past debates, did call Obama's tax plan &quot;class warfare,&quot; accused him of failing to stand up to his party's leaders and said the Democrat twisted his record in ads. With his repeated attacks, though, the Republican ran the risk of turning off voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In some ways he looked old, he looked tired, he looked irrascible, and he is running an old, tired, irrascible campaign,&quot; Hoefler said. &quot;He should have said, 'I don't want to hear any more of Bill Ayers. That's old, that's done, let's move on.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People don't care. It's inside baseball stuff,&quot; Hoefler said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama performed as he has throughout the fall campaign - calm, steady, clear spoken, and at times elusive. He refused, for example, to say where he might cut federal spending beyond the politics-as-usual promise to go through the budget page by page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A more polished debater than he was at the start of his long campaign - after three debates with McCain and more than 20 with Democratic primary rivals - he made no gaffes and did nothing to jeopardize his standing as the frontrunner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the end, the debate was sort of like a boxing match in the 10th round, where the guy who's ahead in points ---Obama - just parried and didn't get knocked out,&quot; said G. Terry Madonna, the director of Franklin &amp; Marshall College's Center for Politics and Public Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain threw good punches but Obama just counterpunched the whole time, reasonably effectively, and as a result there will probably be no change in the polls,&quot; Madonna said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madonna said he believes McCain missed several chances to capitalize on his opponent's association with violent 1960s radical William Ayers and to the community group ACORN, which Republicans accuse of widespread voter registration fraud, the analysts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain failed to explain the relationship, apparently assuming that undecided voters, like his supporters, know that Ayers was part of a group that planted bombs at the Pentagon and other government buildings to protest the Vietnam War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also brushed past the story of the ACORN community action group, then risked undermining his own argument by hyperbolically raising the threat beyond what the evidence so far supports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain doesn't effectively push his own best case,&quot; said Madonna. &quot;He missed several opportunities last evening to exploit some issues that certainly would have worked in his favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the few people who have yet to make up their minds, were they moved particularly by something that happened last night? I don't think so,&quot; said Madonna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This race has started to drift away from McCain, and I didn't see anything there last night that stops the drift.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To: John McCain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From: Campaign director Steve Schmidt </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Date: Nov. 5 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You fought the good fight. You lost because of a failed campaign strategy, not because of what you as an individ-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ual offered the nation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night's polling suggests this election wasn't about the GOP base. It was about the middle of the spectrum, not its fringes. Karl Rove's advice to drive our base by indirectly fueling the urban legends about Barack Obama's background with our own questions about his associations and fitness to lead appears to have backfired. We should never have run that ad with the tagline &quot;Too Risky for America.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exit polling suggests that our core regarded this election as a referendum on Obama. In other words, their votes were never in doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe we never had to placate the John Hagees or include language in the platform that opposed abortion even when the mother is raped because we would have gotten those votes anyway. We should have run like you did in 2000 - as a social moderate unafraid to call Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell &quot;agents of intolerance&quot; and unwilling to make a ban on gay marriage an issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was terrific when you interrupted the Minnesota woman when she said she thought Obama was Arab. Trouble is, she began by saying, &quot;I can't trust Obama,&quot; a notion she pulled right out of our media campaign. There were also those individuals who warmed up crowds by using Obama's middle name, and the Virginia GOP chairman who said bin Laden and Obama &quot;both have friends that bombed the Pentagon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters realized that the campaign couldn't control the knuckleheads who gravitated to our effort, but they concluded that we fostered an atmosphere that made these people think their behavior was appropriate. We should have acted sooner to rein in those supporters. Similarly, the William Ayers issue worked our base into a lather, as planned, but our bombardment of that charge at a time when the economy was imploding repelled those who were still trying to make up their minds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps no one event epitomizes our misstep like our VP selection. At the Republican National Convention, Sarah Palin delivered a stem-winder that energized the base, but over time distanced us from moderates and independents whose support should have been our target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frankly, you were ill-served by those of us who talked you out of taking Sen. Lieberman or Gov. Ridge. We should've recognized their pro-choice views were an asset, not a liability. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were a number of </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">missed opportunities. We could have reached those all-important moderate voters had you not said the fundamentals of the economy were strong, and instead offered a plan for recovery that showed your command of the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe we should've conceded Obama's point that the front line in the war on terror is the Af-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ghan-Pakistan border. Undoubtedly, we should've offered a serious plan for energy independence instead of an adage about drilling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take Pennsylvania, a microcosm of what went wrong nationwide, as an example. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama got an unprecedented level of minority support and beat us among Hispanics, 2-1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was no surprise. It does make me wish we'd talked more about border security instead of deluding ourselves into believing we'd get some Hispanic votes by remaining silent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's no surprise we lost Philadelphia by a huge margin. You ran well in Northeast and South Philadelphia, but we lost the rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We always knew we'd lose the city, but anticipated making up those votes among conservative whites. And while we did indeed win central Pennsylvania and the state's northern tier, our projected margins didn't anticipate the results in the southeast and southwest parts of the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In those areas, socially moderate suburbanites concerned about the economy and about ridding the world of terrorists went overwhelmingly for Obama. They are the votes that are always in play, the Republicans and Democrats who vote for candidates in both parties. They elect Arlen Specter to the Senate and Ed Rendell to the statehouse. Rick Santorum was too conservative for them. Suburbanites like these were ultimately our margin of defeat. You are a patriot. Your place in American history was secure long before this race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I regret that there will be debate over what the result would've been had you run as a maverick with moderate tendencies. *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke yesterday warned that the economic slowdown is growing worse and called for greater regulation to prevent future crises like the one now menacing the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stocks on all three major indices plunged soon after his speech, as new data confirmed a deep and wide national economic retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 733.08 points, or 7.8 percent, to 8,577.91. The S&amp;P 500 finished down 90.17 points, or 9.03 percent, to 907.84. The tech-heavy Nasdaq bled 150.68 points, or 8.47 percent, to 1,628.33. The second straight day of declines erased Monday's striking increases. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech to the Economic Club of New York that was followed by an unusual and frank question-and-answer session, Mr. Bernanke signaled that the U.S. economy is sure to get worse, hinted at further interest-rate cuts and implicitly criticized the economic rescue plans that both major presidential candidates are touting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, the Fed released its Beige Book, a report from its 12 district banks on economic conditions around the country. All 12 reported worsening conditions, yet another indicator that the economy appears to be in recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales fell 1.2 percent in September -- almost twice the consensus expectation and another clear sign, along with big September job losses, that the economy skidded to a halt as the global financial crisis worsened last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bernanke's speech focused on the economic outlook. He suggested that U.S. exports, which had helped keep growth going for much of the year, now are poised to fall as a global slowdown unfolds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also hinted that last week's coordinated trans-Atlantic half-point reduction in interest rates left room to cut even further. The Fed's benchmark federal funds rate now stands at 1.5 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under questioning, Mr. Bernanke answered with candor unusual for a man whose job usually requires he be vague in order to avoid spooking the markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to compare today to the handling of the Great Depression, Mr. Bernanke, a scholar on the period, said President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal fiscal stimulus failed to end the troubles. Roosevelt, however, didn't take office until 3 1/2 years after the stock market crashed in 1929.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Implicit in that answer was this: The stimulus spending suggested by Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama or the tax cuts proposed by Republican nominee John McCain are unlikely to end the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think contemporary scholarship argues that, at least in the case of the United States, fiscal policy was not the critical element, unless you count World War II, which obviously mobilized the entire economy,&quot; Mr. Bernanke said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hard lesson being learned now, he said, is that monetary policy -- the use of interest rates to accelerate or decelerate the economy's growth, as well as the Fed's aggressive push to recapitalize banks with easy loans -- has its limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We reached a point ... where the situation required additional firepower,&quot; Mr. Bernanke said, referring to the $700 billion rescue plan that Congress authorized. He added that &quot;monetary policy ultimately cannot always solve the problems, and you do sometimes need fiscal or financial intervention, and we're getting that currently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Existing law has tied the Fed's hands at times, Mr. Bernanke said. He cited last month's bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers. The Fed did everything possible to save Lehman, he said, but because it was an investment bank not subject to commercial banking laws, it couldn't qualify for the same kind of government rescue as Charlotte, N.C.-based national bank Wachovia, which sold itself to Wells Fargo this month after a silent run on it by fleeing depositors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Bear Stearns, another investment bank, fell on hard times in March, the Fed was able to broker its sale to J.P. Morgan Chase because Bear had adequate collateral to offer in exchange for Fed lending. There was no such collateral available with Lehman, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lehman was not allowed to fail,&quot; Mr. Bernanke said, rebutting suggestions by European leaders that he had done just that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. policymakers must ask, he said, how to prevent a replay of inflated asset prices such as those seen during the dot-com bubble in tech stocks of the late '90s and the subsequent housing bubble. Whether or not he meant to point fingers at his predecessor, these inflated prices occurred on the watch of former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who argued that it was the role of the market, not the Fed, to prick asset-price bubbles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, the last decade has shown that bursting bubbles can be an extraordinarily dangerous and costly phenomenon for the economy, and there is no doubt that, as we emerge from the current crisis, that we're all going to look at that issue and what can be done about it,&quot; Mr. Bernanke said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He suggested that a new supervisory and regulatory structure is needed, a rare move for a Fed chairman. Lawmakers must decide whether monetary policy or supervisory regulation should be the leading approach to prevent financial meltdowns, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early voting began Wednesday in West Virginia, with county clerks throughout the state reporting lines of people waiting to cast their ballots. Officials in Raleigh, Cabell, Kanawha, Monongalia and Berkeley counties all reported steady turnout, the first day of early voting. Early voting has only been part of one previous presidential election, but it proved popular. About 126,500 people, more than 10 percent of all registered voters, cast their ballots early in 2004, when President Bush carried the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can you hear me now?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, a senior member of the Senate committee that oversees the telecom industry, now has cell phone coverage at the family's ranch near Sedona, Ariz., following a request from his wife, Cindy, early in 2007. The Washington Post reported the story on its Web site Wednesday, and McCain's presidential campaign denounced it in the hours before the final presidential debate. The two cellular companies most often used by the campaign staff, Verizon Wireless and AT&amp;T, provided the coverage at the ranch, which is in a remote canyon where reception is difficult. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Waterboard' Obama? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A California county's Republican Party Web site encouraged readers to &quot;Waterboard Barack Obama&quot; and compared Obama to Osama bin Laden, drawing criticism from Democrats and Republicans in the state. The Web site of the Sacramento County Republican Party posted five illustrations saying the terrorist group Hamas supported Obama and &quot;the only difference between Obama and Osama is BS.&quot; Another attacked Michelle Obama, reading, &quot;Hey Obama! Want to see bitter?&quot; The graphics were removed from the site by Wednesday, after the state GOP urged the local group to take them down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quoting Jesse </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesse Jackson's comment that Barack Obama would change U.S. policy on Israel shows the Democratic nominee's real views, a McCain spokesman said. Jackson, as quoted by a columnist for the New York Post, said at a conference in France that the influence of the &quot;Zionists who have controlled America's policy for decades&quot; would end if Obama becomes president. Randy Scheunemann, a senior adviser on foreign policy to Republican presidential nominee John McCain, said while Obama claims to be a strong supporter of Israel, his supporters &quot;know better,&quot; CNN reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They report, who decides? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama riffs on his media image in an interview for the New York Times Magazine, which quotes him as suggesting Fox News has cost him a few points in the polls. The interview with reporter Matt Bai, to be published Sunday, features the Democratic presidential candidate lamenting a &quot;media narrative&quot; that has pigeonholed him as a liberal stereotype. &quot;I am convinced that if there were no Fox News, I might be two or three points higher in the polls,&quot; Obama says in the article. &quot;If I were watching Fox News, I wouldn't vote for me, right? Because the way I'm portrayed 24/7 is as a freak!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Switcheroo </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Ciptak says he went behind his wife's back and listed their newborn daughter's name as &quot;Sarah McCain Palin&quot; on her birth-certificate application because &quot;we are strong supporters of that ticket,&quot; according to the Kingsport Times-News in Tennessee. &quot;She wanted Ava Grace. So, with a clear conscience, even though I know I was sort of going around her back, I kind of secretively put down Sarah McCain Palin instead of Ava Grace on another set of forms that I acquired from the front desk,&quot; he told WBIR-TV.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Game delay </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least three of the major broadcast television networks have agreed to air a 30-minute ad from the Barack Obama campaign in late October, according to a report in Advertising Age. The article says if there is a sixth game of the World Series, Major League Baseball will push the game's start later by 15 minutes so the Fox network can air the ad Oct. 29. The start time was moved from 8:20 to 8:35 p.m. According to Advertising Age, the Obama campaign is spending close to $3 million to air the 8 p.m. program on Fox, CBS and NBC. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bet the house </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traders betting on future events in the political prediction markets are overwhelmingly predicting a Barack Obama victory in the presidential election, giving the Illinois Democrat a better than 80 percent chance of winning. The traders were betting Wednesday that Republican presidential candidate John McCain had less than a 20 percent chance of victory, a big change from a month ago, when the Arizona senator was seen as having a 47 percent chance of capturing the White House. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BIAS CLAIMS ABOUND<BR>Health tax worries<BR>If you don't like the results of polls, claim they are biased. It's a familiar way to get attention, as in the letter to the editor, &quot;Just Desserts&quot; (The York Dispatch, Oct. 8). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those polled following the debate were, in fact, registered Independents, Republicans and Democrats. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey, for example found that &quot;among Democrats, 85 percent said Obama won, with just 5 percent saying McCain did better. Among Republicans, 64 percent said McCain won, with 16 percent saying Obama did better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That they found Obama to be the more convincing reflects his performance and his policies, not some mysterious conspiracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The author may believe it was nitpicking to point out that McCain will be the first president to tax Americans on their employer-provided health care benefits -- a tremendous tax on the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To me, it is vitally important to know if my family might lose coverage under a McCain administration, if his tax credit convinces employers they no longer need to provide insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I, too, have been watching the debates, but I, along with many Americans, felt it was McCain and Palin who were dodging the issues and jumping to topics of their choosing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's time we have politicians who are able to speak fluently and with nuance about difficult policy positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Call it nitpicking if you will. I call it thoughtful consideration of the important issues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain planned to visit swing states but was being forced to go to Republican territory as polls show Obama with the edge in such places as Virginia, Colorado and Florida. Obama was heading in the next few days to Virginia and Missouri, states often out of reach for Democrats but up for grabs in a year with Republicans under fire. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain tried to blunt a familiar line of attack when he asserted during the debate Wednesday night, &quot;Sen. Obama, I am not President Bush.&quot; But Obama quickly turned that argument against his rival in a new TV spot. &quot;True,&quot; the ad's announcer responds, &quot;but you did vote with Bush 90 percent of the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instant polls showed viewers giving the final debate to Obama as they had the previous two debates. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll found 58 percent of debate watchers saying Obama did the best job and 31 percent saying McCain performed best. Favorable opinions of Obama rose slightly while those of McCain dropped slightly, the poll found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uncommitted voters named Obama as the winner by a margin of 53 percent to 22 percent in a CBS News/Knowledge Networks poll. On the question of whose image improved, 46 percent of uncommitted voters said their view of Obama changed for the better while 30 percent said that of McCain. Nearly as many - 26 percent - said their opinion of McCain was worse after the debate while 10 percent said that of Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 90-minute debate at Hofstra University marked the beginning of a sprint to Election Day. Obama leads in the national polls and in surveys in many battleground states, an advantage built in the weeks since the nation stumbled into the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking to shake up the race, McCain questioned Obama's character and his policies. He linked Obama to a 1960s radical, accused him of planning tax increases that would cripple the economy and said he was dishonest about a promise to accept public campaign financing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You didn't tell the American people the truth,&quot; the Arizona senator said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama ignored that charge and remained calm throughout the debate. He often turned the accusations against McCain, calling them examples of the petty politics harming the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit-for-tat and back-and-forth,&quot; the Illinois senator said. &quot;And what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain went on offense from the opening moments, accusing Obama of waging class warfare by seeking tax increases that would &quot;spread the wealth around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also demanded to know the full extent of Obama's relationship with college professor William Ayers, once a Vietnam War protester and part of a group that bombed government buildings, and the Democrat's ties with ACORN, a liberal group accused of violating federal law as it seeks to register voters. McCain said the group could be on the verge of &quot;destroying the fabric of democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama condemned Ayers' violent activities and denied any significant ties to ACORN, mocking McCain for bringing them up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Sen. McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama returned each volley from McCain, at one point brushing aside McCain's claim to full political independence after the Republican said: &quot;I am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama replied: &quot;If I've occasionally mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people - on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities - you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was channel surfing the other day, and, boy, was that a mistake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever happened to interesting television shows that had such innovations as characters and plots?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the worst shows I came across - and believe me, I had plenty to choose from - was &quot;Paris Hilton: My New BFF.&quot; The show features a group of young women whose only reason for existence, evidently, is to see how many times they can work the words &quot;like&quot; and &quot;ya know&quot; into their conversation. Even into the same sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, and they also want to be Paris Hilton's new BFF, or &quot;best friend forever.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, as history shows, with Hilton, forever is not an infinite measure of time. Her old BFF was actress Nicole Richie, and together they did that down-homesy &quot;The Simple Life&quot; program where they went out to mingle with real people - farmers, factory workers, Mafia hit men - and tried to blend in. Which, in their cases, was like trying to blend middle America with two space aliens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in almost all Hollywood partnerships, Richie and Hilton had a very public spat over, I don't know, perhaps who had the higher cheekbones, and the show ended. An attempt was made to revive it, but that did not last long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, there is a God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the thrill-a-minute episode of Hilton's new show that I viewed, the girls were seated around a large table with Hilton and a couple of young women who hang around Hilton much the way drone bees hang around the queen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I watched, the girls were discussing - and I can't tell you how taut and gripping this was - whether or not to &quot;go platinum.&quot; That is, to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dye their hair the same shade as Hilton's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One girl, who had lovely dark hair, said no. She liked her hair the way it was and seemed to balk at the phoniness, if you can believe such a thing in this day and age. Eventually, of course, she caved and went with the dye job because, after all, she is hoping to be Hilton's new BFF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hilton herself had the last word. Expressing disbelief at the girl's reluctance, she said, &quot;I mean, who doesn't want to be blonde?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that point, I turned off the TV. Hilton's BFF show made me STMS (sick to my stomach).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of unsavory TV, haven't the commercials plugging the two presidential candidates been spewing out the venom of late? Especially John McCain's. It's one thing for Barack Obama to suggest that McCain is out of touch with the people, which is, of course, untrue. McCain is all for the middle class, which, he once said, includes plain folks like you and me who make less than $5 million a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is totally something else, as McCain and Sarah &quot;I Can See Russia From My House&quot; Palin are doing, which is to delve into character assassination and even rile crowds to hatred and threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am especially intrigued about McCain's trying to link Obama to William Ayers, who was a member of the radical Weather Underground in the 1960s when Obama was 8 years old. In 1995 the two men, along with other people, Democrats and Republicans, worked on the nonprofit Chicago Annenberg Challenge, trying to obtain grant money to improve public education. Now the McCain campaign says the two are &quot;palling around&quot; and that makes Obama dangerous and disloyal, and possibly even a terrorist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hmmmm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few years ago, I attended a friend's wedding, and one of the guests came up to me and said, &quot;Larry. I wanted to tell you I enjoy your column.&quot; The guest was Charles Juba, who organized a Ku Klux Klan march in Lancaster in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since we attended the same wedding, I guess Juba, member of a hate group, and I were &quot;palling around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So by the McCain campaign criteria, that makes me dangerous, disloyal and a possible terrorist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I just wanted to warn you in case you plan to write me in for president.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if they held a presidential debate and hardly anyone watched? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That could be the case in the Philadelphia area tonight as the third and final meeting between Barack Obama and John McCain goes head-to-head with the Phillies' attempt to win a spot in the World Series. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viewers who opt for politics over baseball will get to see whether Republican McCain, still lagging in the polls, can find a way to launch a comeback with just 20 days left before the election.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To take advantage of what may be his last chance to shake things up, McCain will have to perform better than he has in the previous debates. According to the polls, he lost both to Democrat Obama, whom many voters saw as the steadier and calmer candidate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The distinction could not be clearer: One guy [Obama] is fighting for you, and the other guy is fighting mad,&quot; Obama's running mate, Joe Biden, told a crowd yesterday in Warren, Ohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain gave a debate preview of his own in Blue Bell, Montgomery County, saying of Obama: &quot;Perhaps never before in history have the American people been asked to risk so much based on so little.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonight's subject is domestic issues; the host is Bob Schieffer of CBS News; the site is Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The format is similar to that of the first debate Sept. 26. The moderator asks a question and gives each candidate two minutes to answer, followed by five minutes of conversation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, the candidates will sit together at a small table rather than stand at separate lecterns. Such proximity is likely to encourage more direct engagement between the two; in the first debate, McCain barely looked at Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the stock market down 16 percent since the first debate, the focus is sure to be on the economy and the plans laid out by the candidates this week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What remains uncertain is whether McCain will pursue the character issues about Obama - including the Illinois senator's association with William Ayers, a leader of the violent, radical Weather Underground of the 1960s and 1970s - that the Republican candidate has raised in commercials and speeches but not in the debates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, after the second debate, Obama said in a television interview that he had been surprised that McCain had not been willing to raise the matter &quot;to my face.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, in an interview with KMOX radio in St. Louis, McCain said he had been &quot;astonished&quot; to hear Obama say &quot;that I didn't have the guts&quot; to talk about Ayers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added McCain: &quot;I think he probably ensured that it will come up this time.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Valerie Jarrett, one of Obama's closest advisers, said in an interview Monday that McCain had damaged his own credibility through his frequent changes of tone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's indicated that he may go more positive, but he went so negative that it's hard to pull it back without looking like a tactic,&quot; she said. &quot;We keep seeing this erratic behavior, his trying to find what will work instead of just speaking to the interests of the American people.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the debate, Obama is likely to try to develop the idea that McCain has been erratic; the Obama campaign yesterday put out a memo alleging that &quot;McCain's response to the crisis has careened, sometimes changing course within a single day.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, in addition to working the theme that Obama's election would be risky for America, figures to try again to assert his own independence from President Bush, whose approval rating has fallen to 25 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's stump speech now includes this condemnation of the administration: &quot;We cannot spend the next four years as we have spent much of the last eight: waiting for our luck to change.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New surveys yesterday from the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute underlined how grim the political landscape has become for McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has double-digit leads in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin - three blue states for which the GOP once had high hopes - and a nine-point edge in the red state of Colorado. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also leads by an average of 13 points in Pennsylvania, where McCain campaigned yesterday and returns tomorrow. Using the debate to move the Pennsylvania numbers will be hard; 40 percent of the electorate lives in the baseball-distracted Philadelphia media market.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sept. 14, before the financial crisis broke, McCain led Obama in nationwide polls by about two percentage points. Now, it's Obama who is up, by an average of more than seven points. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any realistic chance of McCain coming from behind depends on scoring a knockout in debate,&quot; said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll. &quot;But given that he has been judged by the electorate to have lost both of the previous faceoffs, that would seem to be a very tall order.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BLUE BELL, Pa. -- A combative Sen. John McCain yesterday offered new proposals to buffer the effects of the credit crisis at a noisy rally in Montgomery County, the heart of a region crucial to his hopes of a come-from-behind victory in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I am elected president, I will help to create jobs for Americans in the most effective way a president can do this -- with tax cuts that are directed specifically to create jobs and protect your life savings,&quot; the Arizona Republican told hundreds of enthusiastic partisans after he had mounted a community college gymnasium stage to the obligatory strains of the &quot;Rocky&quot; movie theme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With just three weeks before the election, Mr. McCain spoke on the eve of his final debate with his Democratic rival, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, and the day after Mr. Obama had unveiled his own new package of economic relief plans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a state with one of the nation's largest blocs of older voters, the GOP nominee called for a variety of steps to ease the effects of the economic crisis, particularly for those near or beyond retirement age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain said Congress should provide more generous tax write-offs for investors forced to take losses in the current market and urged a temporary reduction in capital gains taxes to encourage investment. He also called for elimination of taxes on unemployment benefits, a proposal like one his opponent had made the day before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a conference call with reporters, McCain economic adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin estimated the measures' total price tag at $52 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain also repeated proposals he offered earlier to have the federal government directly purchase troubled home mortgages and suspend rules that mandate withdrawals from tax-preferred retirement accounts once their owners reach age 70.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's new proposals call for a two-year halving of the tax on capital gains, from 15 percent to 7.5 percent, as a spur to investment in turbulent markets. He also proposed a lower tax rate, 10 percent, on the first $50,000 in withdrawals from tax-sheltered retirement accounts, such as IRAs and 401Ks. He would also quintuple, to $15,000, the maximum tax deduction for losses from the sale of stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the Treasury Department's announcement that it would make $250 billion in direct investments in major banks, Mr. McCain said: &quot;We will not merely inject billions of dollars into companies and walk away, hoping for the best. We will require that those companies be reformed and restructured until they are sound assets again, and can be sold at no loss -- or perhaps even a profit -- to the taxpayers of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when that is accomplished,&quot; he continued, &quot;in each instance, government will relinquish its interest in these private companies. We're going to get government out of the business of bailouts and equity stakes, and back in the business of responsible regulation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign responded to their Republican foe's speech with a statement charging, &quot;McCain's unsteady responses over the course of this crisis have demonstrated how out of touch he is with the struggles facing working Americans, and how ill-equipped he is to implement the solutions and changes that we need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic campaign also circulated criticisms of the McCain initiatives from two of Pennsylvania's top officeholders, Gov. Ed Rendell and Sen. Bob Casey. &quot;McCain's plan would spend $300 billion to bail out the same irresponsible Wall Street banks that got us into this mess in the first place -- without doing anything to jump-start job growth for America's middle class,&quot; Mr. Casey said in a reference to the earlier McCain plan for the government to purchase troubled mortgages directly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to his financial ideas, Mr. McCain renewed his criticisms of Mr. Obama, asserting: &quot;Perhaps never before in history have the American people been asked to risk so much based on so little.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can look at the record of what he's done, or you can just go with your gut,&quot; the Republican said. &quot;But either way, you're left with the same conclusion: Senator Obama is going to raise your taxes. And in this economy, raising taxes is the surest way to turn a recession into a depression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's event, in a sharply contested county within the state, was originally billed as a town hall meeting focusing on women's issues. The stage behind the nominee and his wife, Cindy McCain, was indeed filled with women. But in the face of the nation's continuing financial turmoil, the campaign pivoted instead to the new economic recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some reports, denied by the campaign, had said the new McCain plan was to have been unveiled Monday, when Mr. Obama offered his own package to address the economic crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A friendly crowd cheered Mr. McCain yesterday in Blue Bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a small-business owner, and when I look at the Obama plan, it would put me out of business,&quot; said Anthe, an artist who goes by one name, as she watched Mr. McCain greet supporters following his speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claire Snell, of nearby Lansdale, said Mr. McCain had captured her vote because &quot;the most important thing is he's a pro-life candidate. That's what America needs today, someone who thinks every life has meaning and purpose.&quot; As she held her 20-month-old son Christian, she added: &quot;I think he has a great running mate, too. She's inspiring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She spoke as Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was campaigning in Scranton, continuing a series of appearances across the state in recent days. Underscoring his focus on Pennsylvania's 21 electoral votes, Mr. McCain will return for a rally tomorrow in Chester County, another of Philadelphia's bedroom suburbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both presidential candidates were preparing yesterday for their third face-to-face encounter tonight at Hofstra University in Long Island, N.Y. While their two prior meetings ranged from substantive to somnolent, tonight's event gives the Republican a chance to recapture the momentum of a race in which Mr. Obama has assumed polling leads nationally as well as in pivotal states such as Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous debates have failed to produce dramatic campaign turning points, in part because they were overwhelmed by news of the credit crisis and turbulent stock market. Yet a variety of polls suggested that more voters thought the Democrat had prevailed in both. Their meeting last week in Nashville, in particular, failed to live up to expectations that the trailing Republican would launch a sharp assault on his rival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One subject Mr. McCain avoided then was the frequent GOP criticism of Mr. Obama's association with William Ayers, an education professor who was a member of a 1960s radical group, the Weather Underground. Mr. Obama has described Mr. Ayers as a casual acquaintance whom he knows from his neighborhood and their joint tenure on a Chicago school reform foundation's board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the last debate, Mr. Obama and his allies -- including his running mate, Delaware Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., and former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack -- practically dared Mr. McCain to raise the Ayers issue, remarking in interviews that the Republican had cited it in speeches but not to his rival's face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was astonished to hear him say that he was surprised that I didn't have the guts&quot; to bring up Mr. Ayers, Mr. McCain said in a St. Louis radio station interview cited on the Time.com Web site. &quot;I think he is probably ensured that it will come up this time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- John McCain assailed Barack Obama's character and campaign positions on taxes, abortion and more Wednesday night, hoping to transform their final presidential debate into a launching pad for a political comeback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You didn't tell the American people the truth,&quot; he charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unruffled, and ahead in the polls, Obama parried each charge, and leveled a few of his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One hundred percent, John, of your ads, 100 percent of them have been negative,&quot; Obama shot back in an uncommonly personal debate less than three weeks from Election Day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not true,&quot; McCain retorted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It absolutely is true,&quot; said Obama, seeking the last word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is currently running all negative ads, according to a study by the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But he has run a number of positive ads during the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 90-minute encounter, at a round table at Hofstra University, was their third debate, and marked the beginning of a 20-day sprint to Election Day. Obama leads in the national polls and in surveys in many battleground states, an advantage built in the weeks since the nation stumbled into the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2004 red states: With few exceptions, the campaign is being waged in states that voted Republican in 2004 -- Virginia, Colorado, Iowa -- and in many of them, Obama holds a lead in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain played the aggressor from the opening moments of the debate, accusing Obama of waging class warfare by seeking tax increases that would &quot;spread the wealth around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator also demanded to know the full extent of Obama's relationship with William Ayers, a 1960s-era terrorist and the Democrat's ties with ACORN, a liberal group accused of violating federal law as it seeks to register voters. And he insisted Obama disavow last week's remarks by Rep. John Lewis, a Democrat, who accused the Republican ticket of playing racial politics along the same lines as segregationists of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Struggling to escape the political drag of an unpopular Republican incumbent, McCain also said, &quot;Sen. Obama, I am not President Bush. ... You wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama returned each volley, and brushed aside McCain's claim to full political independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I've occasionally mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people -- on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities -- you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attack on funding: McCain's allegation that Obama had not leveled with the public involved the Illinois senator's decision to forgo public financing for his campaign in favor of raising his own funds. As a result, he has far outraised McCain, although the difference has been somewhat neutralized by an advantage the Republican National Committee holds over the Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He signed a piece of paper&quot; earlier in the campaign pledging to accept federal financing, McCain said. He added that Obama's campaign has spent more money than any since Watergate, a reference to President Nixon's re-election, a campaign that later became synonymous with scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama made no immediate response to McCain's assertion about having signed a pledge to accept federal campaign funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about running mates, both presidential candidates said Democrat Joseph Biden was qualified to become president, although McCain added this qualifier: &quot;in many respects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain passed up a chance to say his own running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, was qualified to sit in the Oval Office, though he praised her performance as governor and noted her work on behalf of special needs children. The Palins have a son born earlier this year with Down Syndrome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama sidestepped when asked about Palin's qualifications to serve as president, and he, too, praised her advocacy for special needs children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spending freeze: But he quickly sought to turn the issue to his advantage by noting McCain favors a spending freeze on government programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding if we're going to get serious in terms of research. ... And if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, we're not going to be able to do it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to differences on taxes and spending, McCain said Obama advocated trade policies that recalled those of Herbert Hoover, who presided over the start of the Great Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has called for tougher provisions in trade negotiations, arguing that is necessary to avoid undercutting the wages paid American workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also said Obama has aligned himself with &quot;the extreme aspect of the pro-abortion movement in America&quot; and had voted present while in the Illinois Legislature on a measure to ban one type of procedure late in a woman's pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said the bill would have undermined Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that granted abortion rights, and had been opposed by the Illinois Medical Society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there's an exception for the mother's health and life, and this did not contain that exception,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain sarcastically paid tribute to &quot;the eloquence of Senator Obama. He's (for) health for the mother. You know, that's been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe the plumber: McCain's allegation about class warfare stemmed from one of Obama's campaign appearances last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ohio on Sunday, Obama was approached by a man who said, &quot;Your new tax plan's going to tax me more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A video clip caught by Fox News shows Obama replying, &quot;It's not that I want to punish your success. I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you, that they've got a chance at success, too. And I think that when we spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain referred repeatedly to that voter, Joe Wurzelbacher, a plumber from Toledo, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wurzelbacher watched Wednesday night's debate and said he still thinks Obama's plan would keep him from buying the small business that employs him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's reference to Ayers reprised campaign commercials he has run to try and raise doubts about Obama's fitness to serve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayers, who was a member of the violent Weather Underground in the 1960s, hosted a meet-the-candidate event for Obama in an Illinois race many years later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Sen. McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me,&quot; Obama replied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- For 30 years, the nation's political system has been tilted in favor of business deregulation and against new rules. But that is about to change, now that the government has been forced to intervene in the once-high-flying financial industry to avert an economywide crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An expansion of the government's role in financial markets is certain: On Friday, the Treasury Department updated its recommended reforms of the existing regulatory structure, which it will leave to the next president and Congress. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressional leaders and both presidential candidates already have their own, more far-reaching ideas -- from further restricting executives' pay to remaking the entire regulatory structure, so that it better supervises both traditional activities and newer ones like credit default swaps that are now unregulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pro-regulation climate will probably spill over into other sectors. That seems especially likely now that the Treasury and the Federal Reserve are pumping money into corporations of all types, to shore up their capital and to finance day-to-day operations until the credit markets recover, and with the auto industry separately getting billions in government assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That will give impetus to those who seek new emission curbs and energy limits to address climate change; or who want health care mandates to expand insurance coverage and restrain costs; or who are calling for new safeguards for food, prescription drugs and toys from China and other less-regulated trading partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We now have a collective anger, disgust, over our whole financial system, and it's obvious we're going to get a regulatory backlash,&quot; said Brookings Institution economist Robert E. Litan, who has studied regulatory issues for decades. &quot;And we know it's going to come in a big way in 2009.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Litan predicts a spillover effect to other industries, because voters have the perception that &quot;big companies are animals, and they need to be put in their cages.&quot; He added: &quot;The only open question going forward in this new era is, are we going to overdo it? Is the pendulum going to go completely over in the other direction?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political fallout of this renewed respect for government regulation is evident in the current election campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats, typically on the defensive in recent decades as the more pro-regulatory party, are playing offense. Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, is blaming Republicans and his rival, Arizona Sen. John McCain, for supporting an economic theory &quot;that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, unexpectedly fighting for re-election in Kentucky, is the target of a TV ad that says, &quot;Wall Street and the big banks gave Mitch McConnell $4.4 million for his campaigns, and he fought for less regulation of Wall Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Republicans, led by Mr. McCain, are pledging that they, too, will back toughened government regulations. &quot;I think we're going to have to see smarter regulation,&quot; chief McCaineconomic adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be no delaying action on re-regulating finance. Both presidential candidates and congressional leaders such as Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, Mass., would go further than the Bush Treasury. They want to overhaul the current system next year to rid it of overlapping regulatory agencies, give other agencies new powers and perhaps create a new overseer for the whole system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financial institutions are likely to face tougher rules on maintaining capital and liquidity. Companies and instruments that currently are not regulated could be brought under the government's thumb; unregulated derivatives, hedge funds, mortgage brokers and credit-rating agencies all have been implicated in the current crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats and Mr. McCain talk of limiting executives' compensation, while Democrats would also give shareholders more say about who sits on corporate boards. Mr. Obama, if he is elected president, would join with the congressional Democrats, who are likely to increase their majorities in the House and Senate, to revive their unsuccessful proposals to impose new penalties for predatory lending, including mortgage lending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are proposals for a new agency to protect consumers against a variety of financial abuses, involving mortgages, auto and student loans and credit cards. Credit card companies' marketing, billing and interest rates will very likely be reviewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The insolvency of insurance giant American International Group is reviving talk in Congress of federal regulation of the insurance industry, which prefers its current, mostly friendly patchwork system of state oversight.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, for the first time, the presidential campaign is waged not just in the whistlestops and hustings of America, but also on YouTube and the viral video world.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidates, partisans and citizens are uploading, downloading and distributing ads, &quot;gotcha&quot; moments, parodies and video bites in an endless series of sliced-and-diced mutations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If 2004 was the Year of the Blogger, 2008 is the Year of YouTube. And in the last seven days, the GOP and Democratic campaigns have stepped up their fierce online-video battle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dangerous,&quot; a John McCain&nbsp;ad released Oct. 6, asks, &quot;Who is Barack Obama?&quot; It had drawn more than 200,000 views on YouTube as of Friday. Another midweek McCain video, &quot;Ayers,&quot; seeking to tie Obama to former Weatherman Bill Ayers, had about 640,000 views.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama responded the next day with &quot;Keating Economics,&quot; a 13-minute epic recalling McCain's involvement with the Keating Five savings-and-loan corruption scandal of the 1980s and 1990s; that video has had more than 1.4 million views, with the trailer alone topping 800,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So just who is winning the political Web wars? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edward Lee, associate professor at Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University, tracks campaign &quot;vids&quot; (short for &quot;videos&quot;) and their popularity. He says the early leader on YouTube was someone who isn't in the race anymore: libertarian Ron Paul. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since at least June, however, Obama has held a big advantage. The Obama strategy: Release as many vids as fast as possible (and you can make them in minutes, as Lee points out, to respond to events). As of September, his campaign had released more than 1,200 vids, attracting more than 62 million views, compared with McCain's 259 vids and 14.6 million views. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most-viewed Obama vid, with more than seven million views, is of his March 18 &quot;A More Perfect Union&quot; speech at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By midsummer, Obama vids threatened to swamp the Web. But the McCain campaign fought back, with two breakthroughs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first was a 30-second vid titled &quot;Celeb,&quot; released July 30. Its famous beginning: &quot;He's the biggest celebrity in the world.&quot; Shots flash of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, then: &quot;But is he ready to lead?&quot; (Both Obama's and McCain's videos, Lee observes, star Obama.) One of the most-viewed vids of the campaign, it has more than two million views, drawing viewers to other McCain vids. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second breakthrough was Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Lee reports that Palin's nomination boosted McCain-vid interest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you look at the number of views of the convention speeches,&quot; Lee says, &quot;you see Obama out in front with 450,000 views, but Palin's speech has 250,000, with McCain's just above 100,000 and [Democrat Joseph R.] Biden's just below.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Grove, head of news and politics for YouTube, says: &quot;The candidates are creating several videos a day, on the fly, creating an ongoing dialogue, a documentary of their campaigns.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Closely parallel to the video wars is the battle to create products that can reach viewers through Facebook and other social networking sites. On Facebook, the McCain campaign offers &quot;Pork Invaders,&quot; a video game about earmarks and pork-barrel spending, and &quot;Campaign Cribs: Straight Talk Express,&quot; a behind-the-scenes look at McCain's road show. And then there's &quot;the Obama app,&quot; a program for iPhones and iPods, which allows Obama recruiters to call everyone on the user's list of contacts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of Friday, Obama's Facebook page had more than two million supporters, McCain's over 560,000, Palin's about 425,000, and Biden's about 160,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YouTube's rise to political prominence began almost as soon as there was a YouTube, which launched in May 2005. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People first realized the potential of online video in the 2006 elections, when [U.S. Sen.] George Allen was caught saying 'Macaca' to an Asian American questioner,&quot; says YouTube's Grove. Sent far and wide within hours, the &quot;Macaca&quot; video sprained the Virginian Republican's soon-to-be-failed reelection bid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main difference this year,&quot; says blogger Ben Smith of Politico.com, &quot;is that in 2004, online politics was largely about the elite and the media, and now it's really a mass communication tool.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Bogost, videogame designer and associate professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, says that &quot;online video is probably the main&quot; difference. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real innovation is what users can do with their vids. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's time-shifting: People who miss big speeches, debates, ads or send-ups (such as on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Saturday Night Live</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">David Letterman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) can view the vid at their own convenience, not by any network's or party's schedule. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big TV is now encouraging time-shifting, through sites such as Hulu, a partnership between NBC and Fox that lets users download and share TV shows and movies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most important, anyone can &quot;mash&quot; or manipulate vids before sharing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Viral e-mails are probably the most powerful online phenomenon&quot; in this election cycle, says Smith of Politico.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It doesn't matter whether you're a kid in your bedroom in Tennessee or a politician on K Street in Washington,&quot; says Grove of YouTube. &quot;Now you can create and upload your own message. . . . It has changed the political ecology in a big way.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this excerpting and sharing means many viewers see only the highlights, the gotcha moments. Tuesday's debate was generally a well-behaved affair, but it may be remembered chiefly for McCain's &quot;that one&quot; remark and Obama's &quot;green behind the ears&quot; riposte to charges of naivete - as if the entire debate consisted of grumpy remarks and countercharges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Champions of online video say we're seeing a revolution, the &quot;democraticization&quot; of media. But there's a nagging question: Is greater access enough to produce a more informed citizenry? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think the citizens are winning . . . nor the candidates,&quot; says Bogost, of the Georgia Institute of Technology. &quot;I think we must distinguish between making media easier to create and democratic concerns.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Bogost wrote in a recent essay, these may be democratic means, &quot;but whether or not they deserve to be confused with self-governance and citizenship is another matter.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a statement in John McCain's stump speech last week that sounded almost like a plea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The status quo,&quot; he said, &quot;is not on the ballot.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the Republican presidential candidate is fully aware, the status quo always is on the ballot in a presidential election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this year, the increasingly grim economic state of the union is dragging McCain down - and boosting the electoral fortunes of Democrat Barack Obama.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the broad sense, this is a pretty simple election and has been since the primaries ended. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's all about the push and pull between two basic forces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One is the desire of a big chunk of the electorate to bring change to Washington and throw out the Republicans for having brought America eight years of President Bush. The disturbing state of the economy has intensified that desire like nothing else. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other is the uneasiness felt by millions of voters about Obama himself - his background, his associations, his record, and his level of experience in Washington. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In trying to exploit or mitigate those two forces, the two campaigns have pursued strategies that have been straightforward and obvious. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Obama, the goal has been to link McCain to the unpopular incumbent as much as possible, to remind voters of all that has gone wrong - which hasn't been hard lately - and to offer reassurances that the Democratic nominee, despite his unusual name, truly is part of the American mainstream. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence, the current Obama&nbsp;commercial in which the candidate recalls being a child in Hawaii and going with his grandfather, a World War II veteran, to attend a flag-waving ceremony for astronauts whose space capsule had just been plucked out of the Pacific Ocean. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For McCain, the imperative has been to assert his independence from Bush on the economy and other issues, to talk about his own history as a maverick, and to feed the doubts about Obama's suitability to lead the nation in troubled times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence, the McCain&nbsp;ad now on the air that highlights Obama's connections to William Ayers, the former leader of the Weather Underground, a violent, radical organization responsible for a number of bombings in the 1960s and 1970s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's no stretch to say that virtually everything that has happened since Obama wrapped up his party's nomination in June can be explained in terms of those two underlying factors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the summer, the McCain campaign gained ground by feeding the doubts about Obama through a series of commercials done after Obama's European trip. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads called him &quot;the world's biggest celebrity&quot; and made reference to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. The implication: no substance behind the sizzle.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama rallied with a strong Democratic convention, tying McCain to Bush by hammering home the point that McCain had voted with the administration 90 percent of the time since 2001. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, McCain chose Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate. Her presence on the ticket countered the Democrats' argument that McCain was seeking a third Bush term; Palin didn't look or sound like more of the same. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, though, the balance has shifted yet again.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the debates, if the polls are to be believed, Obama has struck many voters as calm, solid and reassuring, not the &quot;too risky&quot; alternative described by McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the economic crisis has reminded voters, rightly or wrongly, why they wanted to throw the Republicans out of the White House in the first place. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much has been made of how the two candidates have handled the Wall Street mess so far. But the polls indicate that the facts of the meltdown itself, and the financial setbacks millions of Americans have suffered in the last few weeks, have done most of the damage to McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To counter, the McCain campaign is again trying to play to the doubts about Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has escalated its attack on Obama's past and his character, doing much of it via Ayers - who hosted a fund-raiser for Obama during his first campaign in the mid-1990s and with whom the Illinois senator served on the boards of two nonprofits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who is the real Barack Obama?&quot; McCain asked at rally after rally last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend, the Republican nominee toned down his rhetoric after an incident at a town-hall meeting in Minnesota that clearly bothered him. There, he got booed for calling Obama &quot;a person that you do not have to be scared of as president of the United States.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama says the discussion of his past associations is an attempt to distract voters from the economic crisis and the role of Republican policies in making it happen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that Sen. McCain wants to make this the centerpiece of his campaign is pretty remarkable,&quot; Obama told radio host Michael Smerconish of WPHT-AM (1210) last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment, the impulse to blame the Republicans is overwhelming the worries that remain about Obama, his character or his policies, giving him a lead averaging 7 points in national polls.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 22 days left for the balance to shift once more. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With modernity crumbling, our thoughts turn to antiquity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decline and fall of the American Empire echoes the experience of the Romans, who also tumbled into the trap of becoming overleveraged empire hussies. As our sand-castle economy washes away under the tide of bad gambles and debts, this most self-indulgent society lurches toward stoicism (even bankrupt Iceland gives us the cold shoulder and turns to a solvent superpower). It's going to require more than giving up constant infusions of stocks, Starbucks and Botox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Seneca, the Roman Stoic who advised treating the body &quot;somewhat strictly,&quot; wrote in a letter: &quot;Avoid whatever is approved of by the mob, and things that are the gift of chance. Whenever circumstance brings some welcome thing your way, stop in suspicion and alarm ... They are snares. ... We think these things are ours when in fact it is we who are caught. That track leads to precipices; life on that giddy level ends in a fall.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study of Latin and Greek, with illuminations on morality, philosophy, mob rule and chariot races, reached a nadir in the greedy '80s and '90s, when it seemed irrelevant for kids who yearned to be investment bankers and high-tech millionaires. But now we've learned the hard way that greed is bad -- avaritia mala est -- and the classics have staged a comeback. Amo Latinam, so I was happy to see last week's New York Times story about the soaring enrollment for Latin classes in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In high school, I translated swatches of Julius Caesar's &quot;The Battle for Gaul&quot; from Latin to English while nibbling cheese crackers. To boost the felicitous new trend toward Latin, I enlisted Gary D. Farney, an associate professor of history at Rutgers University, to translate (loosely and creatively) from English to Latin &quot;The Battle of Gall,&quot; my take below on why the hyperventilating Republicans are not veni, vidi, vici-ing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bellum Gallium</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manes Julii Caesaris paucis diebus aderant -- &quot;O, most bloody sight!&quot; -- cum Ioannes McCainus, mavericus et veteranus captivusque Belli Francoindosinini, et Sara Palina, barracuda borealis, qui sneerare amant Baracum Obamam causa oratorii, pillorant ut demagogi veri, Africanum-Americanum senatorem Terrae Lincolni, ad Republicanas rallias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rabidi subcanes candidati, pretendant &quot;no orator as Brutis is,&quot; ut &quot;stir men's blood&quot; et disturbant mentes populi ad &quot;a sudden flood of mutiny,&quot; ut Wilhelmus Shakespearus scripsit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cum Quirites Americani ad rallias Republicanas audiunt nomen Baraci Husseini Obamae, clamant &quot;Mortem!&quot; &quot;Amator terroris!&quot; &quot;Socialiste!&quot; &quot;Bomba Obamam!&quot; &quot;Obama est Arabus!&quot; &quot;Caput excidi!&quot; tempus sit rabble-rouseribus desistere &quot;Smear Talk Express,&quot; ut Stephanus Colbertus dixit. Obama demonatus est tamquam Musulmanus-Manchurianus candidatus -- civis &quot;collo-cerviciliaris&quot; ad ralliam Floridianam Palinae exhabet mascum Obamae ut Luciferis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama non queretur high-tech lynching. Sed secreto-serventes agentes nervosissmi sunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vix quisque audivit nomen &quot;Palinae&quot; ante lunibus paucis. Surgivit ex suo tanning bed ad silvas in Terram Eskimorum, rogans quis sit traitorosus, ominosus, scurrilosus, periculosus amator LXs terroris criminalisque Chicagoani? Tu betchus!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Caeca ambitio Obamana,&quot; novum rumorem Palina McCainusque dixit. &quot;Cum utilis, Obama laborat cum amatore terroris Wilhelmo Ayro. Cum putatus, perjuravit.&quot; McCainianus bossus maximus Francus Keatinx vocat Obamam, &quot;plebeium,&quot; et ut iuvenum snifferendum cocaini minimi (&quot;a little blow.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cum Primus Dudus, spousus Palinanus, culpari attemptaret &quot;Centurionem-Gate,&quot; judices Terrae Santae Elvorumque castigat gubernatricem Palinam de abusu auctoritatis per familiam revengendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tamen Sara et Ioannes bury Obama, not praise him. Maverici, ut capiunt auxilium de friga-domina, hench-femina, Cynthia McCaina Birrabaronessa, (quae culpat Obamam periculandi suum filum in Babylonia), brazen-iter distractant mentes populares de minimissimis IV o I K.ibus, deminutione &quot;Motorum Omnium,&quot; et Depressione Magna II.o. Omnes de Georgio Busio Secundo colossale goofballo. &quot;V&quot; (because there's no W. in Latin) etiam duxit per disastrum ad gymnasium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gubernatrix (prope Russia) Palina, spectans candidaciam MMXII, post multam educationem cum Kissingro et post multam parodiam de Sabbatis Nocte Vivo atque de Tina Feia, ferociter vituperat Obamam, ut supralupocidit (aerial shooting of wolves) in Hyperborea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vilmingtoni, in Ohionem, McCain's Mean Girl (Ferox Puella) defendit se gladiatricem politicam esse: &quot;Pauci dicant, O Jupiter, te negativam esse. Non, negativa non sum, sed verissima.&quot; Talk about lipsticka in porcam! Quasi Leeus Atwater de oppugnatione Busii Primi ad Dukakem: &quot;non negativus, sed comparativus.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARTS &amp; ENTERTAINMENT; TV REVIEW; Pg. C-6</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">454 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're sick of campaign commercials on TV -- and who isn't at this point? -- PBS's &quot;Frontline: The Choice 2008&quot; (9 p.m. Tuesday, WQED) provides a worthwhile tonic as it strips away the finger-pointing and political hatchet jobs to offer biographical profiles of the two presidential candidates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This two-hour program on the two nominees, presented every four years since 1988, doesn't attempt to compare their policies or fact-check one's distortions about the other. Instead, it tries and largely succeeds at getting back to basics and answering the question: Who are these two guys who want to be president of the United States?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the process, &quot;The Choice&quot; conducts a valuable service in these highly partisan times: It shows that U.S. Sen. Barack Obama is not nearly the radical rabid Republicans would make him out to be, and that U.S. Sen. John McCain is not the mere &quot;sidekick&quot; demagoguery-spouting Democrats suggest. More than anything, it shows them both to be smart tacticians with presidential aspirations that have been years in the making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Choice&quot; gives a sense of the character of both men. It shows Obama as a deliberative, post-Civil Rights leader, who, when he became the first African-American editor of Harvard's Law Review, didn't populate the editor's ranks with those who thought and looked like him. Instead, he put more conservatives than progressives in top positions, garnering more grief from those on the left than on the right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program also traces the history of McCain's dissent with his fellow Republicans (&quot;the struggle for McCain's heart and soul&quot;), suggesting that he considered switching parties following his failed 2000 presidential nomination bid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Choice&quot; shows the contrasting temperaments of these two men, using their vice presidential picks as emblematic of their personalities: Obama took a safer, more conservative approach by picking U.S. Sen. Joe Biden; McCain played to the non-conformist side of his personality by picking little-known Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Choice&quot; covers the assorted talking point scandals associated with each candidate -- The Rev. Jeremiah Wright and '60s radical William Ayers for Obama; The Keating Five mess and marital infidelity for McCain -- but it doesn't dwell on them. At times &quot;The Choice&quot; allows the candidates to tell their own stories, using sound clips from the audio books of their autobiographies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if you think you know everything about McCain and Obama, &quot;The Choice&quot; reminds voters of the two men beneath the attacks. It draws no conclusions, but it offers insights about the men who are often obscured beneath dueling accusations, promises and slogans.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wild ride that is Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign, Steve Schmidt has been at the wheel, steering, some say careening, from Paris Hilton to Sarah Palin, from abrupt &quot;suspension&quot; to abrupt restart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Schmidt is Mr. McCain's day-to-day operations boss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retained in a summer shake-up intended to right Mr. McCain's faltering campaign, Mr. Schmidt, 38, quickly put his stamp on the operation, aggressively attacking Democratic nominee Barack Obama, often with biting ridicule, and vying to dominate every day's news cycle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's an approach that has left pundits and Republicans confused about Mr. McCain's strategy, particularly after Mr. McCain, in a head-spinning 72-hour period, canceled campaign appearances to work on the Wall Street bailout plan and tried unsuccessfully to postpone the first debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Schmidt tends to shrug off the criticism. When two high-profile Republicans, unaware their microphones were hot, disparaged Ms. Palin, the governor of Alaska and Mr. McCain's running mate, on national cable television last month, he offered a two-word response: &quot;Who cares?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a time, Mr. Schmidt's tactics seemed to work. Team McCain was practicing a political jujitsu that kept the Republican close when the Democratic standard-bearer, given George W. Bush's unpopularity, should have a significant lead in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort peaked with the choice of Ms. Palin as Mr. McCain's running mate. Convinced Mr. McCain needed a dramatic gesture to make the race competitive, Mr. Schmidt pressed Mr. McCain to pluck the Alaska governor from obscurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other than the candidates, no one in the operation has more riding on that decision than Mr. Schmidt. And no one has worked harder to turn the decision into a success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He defended her against what he called sexist attacks, and traveled to Alaska to brief Ms. Palin before her first television interviews. For three days, he was ensconced at Mr. McCain's spread in Arizona, helping Ms. Palin prepare for her successful performance in the biggest night of her career, the debate against Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a month from election day, Mr. Schmidt now faces his most difficult professional challenge. Mr. McCain has dropped in polls as Washington, D.C., struggled to find a solution to a reeling Wall Street. Polls show voters trust Mr. Obama more than Mr. McCain to fix the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He could run the greatest campaign in the history of campaigns and still lose by a landslide,&quot; said consultant Chris Lehane, a California Democrat who has worked on several projects for corporate clients with Mr. Schmidt. &quot;Given the current political environment, the Democrats could nominate a refrigerator and still win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Schmidt, 6 feet tall, 220 pounds, his head shaved, is fully aware that his presence can be intimidating. No less a figure than Bush strategist Karl Rove bestowed on Mr. Schmidt the nickname Bullet, though he and Rove dismiss accounts that he is a Rove protege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, Mr. Schmidt paused from a conversation in his office in Arlington, Va., and turned up the volume on CNN. Mr. Obama was delivering his speech to 200,000 people in Berlin, and Mr. Schmidt winced, acknowledging that Mr. Obama is a very polished speaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A map of the United States on the wall over Mr. Schmidt's shoulder served as a low-tech tracking system. A photo of Mr. McCain's mug was pinned to the state of Ohio, showing the candidate was in the state that could decide the election making a low-profile appearance at a German restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Schmidt saw Mr. McCain's appearance at the restaurant as far more valuable than the international acclaim showered on Obama's turn on a German stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after, Mr. McCain employed the classic tactic of turning his foe's strength -- his oratory skills and popularity -- against him. Mr. Schmidt took a direct hand in the ads that ridiculed Obama by likening his celebrity to Paris Hilton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had been discussing the necessity of digging underneath the Obama facade,&quot; said Bill Kenyon, a partner in the firm Strategic Perception, which produces Mr. McCain's&nbsp;commercials. &quot;The celebrity thing is something that he suggested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Mr. Schmidt, the campaign is a tightly run operation. Previously, Mr. McCain allowed reporters almost unfettered access. Under Mr. Schmidt, the candidate went 40 days without a news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Schmidt's hard-nosed determination to control the slightest detail is irksome to some members of Mr. McCain's staff. One senior aide referred to Mr. Schmidt as &quot;message Nazi.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHILADELPHIA -- Sen. Barack Obama criss-crossed this city as though he were running for mayor yesterday, nurturing what he hopes will be a massive voter turnout just over three weeks from now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a pretty good turnout,&quot; Mr. Obama said, without fear of contradiction as he gazed over a crowd estimated at 20,000 that stretched for blocks down 52nd Street in West Philadelphia. &quot;We have just had a spectacular day today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was largest of four successive rallies, under brilliant blue skies, in which the Illinois Democrat drew big crowds in neighborhoods throughout a city essential to his hopes of capturing the state. If successful -- and state polls are tilting increasingly in Mr. Obama's favor -- his efforts would frustrate a major expenditure of time and money by Sen. John McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania is the largest state carried by Sen. John F. Kerry in 2004 that is seriously targeted by the McCain camp. The GOP nominee has spent almost twice as much time in the state -- 16 appearances to Mr. Obama's eight before yesterday's quartet -- than the Democrat. For much of the campaign, Mr. McCain had also led in television spending in the state, although a recent upsurge in Mr. Obama's&nbsp;commercials has erased that edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has made a significantly heavier investment in the state in grass-roots organizing and, particularly, in voter registration. When Mr. Kerry won the state four years ago, the Democrats had a voter registration edge of roughly 600,000. Now, in large measure due to the Obama candidacy, the advantage has swollen to nearly 1.2 million. But for those numbers to matter, the new voters have to show up on Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the message repeated by Gov. Ed Rendell, the former partisan of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, at each of yesterday's stops. Noting that voter turnout in the city had been 53 percent during the primary, he said, &quot;If we do 53 percent, we're going to lose,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to do 70 percent, 75 percent. Can you do that? ... I don't care how long the lines are -- nobody leaves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back to his base</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was, in one sense, an atypical day for Mr. Obama compared to the pattern of his recent campaigning. The Illinois Democrat has spent more time in recent weeks in states carried by President Bush four years ago as his rising poll numbers have allowed him to widen his reach. Yesterday, in contrast, was a serial appeal to the core of the Democrats' Pennsylvania base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he spoke yesterday, Mr. Obama once again assailed Mr. McCain's policies, but he also made a point of praising his rival for cautioning Republican partisans against incendiary anti-Obama rhetoric. At a town hall meeting in Minnesota Thursday, Mr. McCain had emphasized that Mr. Obama was a &quot;decent man,&quot; and a &quot;family man,&quot; in response to questioners who had urged him to go after the Democrat as a frightening, somehow foreign figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to acknowledge that Sen. McCain tried to tone down the rhetoric yesterday, and I appreciated his reminder that we can disagree while still being respectful of each other. I've said it before, and I'll say it again -- Sen. McCain has served this country with honor, and he deserves our thanks for that,&quot; Mr. Obama said in language that he repeated at each stop. &quot;But when it comes to the economy, and what families here in Pennsylvania are going through, Sen. McCain still doesn't get it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pushed by Rendell</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know these are difficult times,&quot; Mr. Obama said at another point in the speech that he repeated with minor variations at each stop. &quot;I know folks are worried. But I also know that now is not the time for fear or panic. Now is the time for resolve and steady leadership -- because I know we can steer ourselves out of this crisis. This is a nation that has faced down war and depression, great challenges and great threats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for the McCain campaign, dismissed Mr.Obama's call to &quot;disagree without being disagreeable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The tone of this election is not fueling voter outrage,&quot; Mr. Bounds said in a statement. &quot;It's that Americans are frustrated knowing that Barack Obama's plans to raise taxes during a down economy and his proposal for a trillion dollars in new government spending are the absolute wrong answers to our economic crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At three of Mr. Obama's stops -- in North Philadelphia, Germantown and West Philadelphia -- he faced crowds that were heavily African-American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Progress Plaza in North Philadelphia, Demetrius Robinson, waited for the senator with his 19-month-old daughter Safa, held in one arm and his son, Jibril, 4, in the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm voting for Barack Obama because I want the next president to be someone my children can relate to, someone who looks like their father,&quot; he said. &quot;I want them to say, 'I can grow up to be president. I can aspire to be something great.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the Mayfair Diner, in Northeast Philadelphia, however, the crowd was more heavily white, many carrying union signs, reflecting a working class community that voted heavily for Mrs. Clinton in April's Pennsylvania primary. Republicans concede that Mr. Obama will carry the city on Nov. 4, but these neighborhoods are among those in which they hope to score well enough to hold down the Democrat's margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters at one stop, Mr. Rendell said yesterday's barnstorming would help prevent that from happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He hadn't been in Philly since the rally right before the primary, and we felt it was important ... for him to come to the neighborhoods,&quot; said the former mayor. &quot;The buzz is out,&quot; he added. &quot;By tonight, everyone in Germantown is going to know that Sen. Obama was in Vernon Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No question that [Mayor Michael Nutter] and I were clamoring to get him to Philadelphia, clamoring to do this type of day,&quot; he said. &quot;We had a little bit of a tug with [Obama headquarters in] Chicago but I think they're pretty happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sean Smith, spokesman for the Obama Pennsylvania campaign, disputed any suggestion of a tactical dispute between the campaign and local politicians. Emphasizing that they had been eager to get their candidate to Philadelphia, he said, &quot;It was just a matter of finding time on the schedule,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. J. Brian Adams could tell you who's going to win the presidential election right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a 99.901 percent chance that Democrat Barack Obama would win, and a .086 percent probability that Republican John McCain would win. The odds of an electoral vote tie are .013 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what happens when a math professor is into politics, as Adams (no relation, as we always say) is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams has developed a simulation model to provide a statistical picture of the presidential race, based on early October poll numbers. The model involves running 500,000 simulated state-by-state races, using the poll results for each state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the assistant professor of mathematics and computer science at Franklin &amp; Marshall College fed the numbers into his computer, the model showed Obama getting 270 electoral votes or more 99.901 percent of the time - 499,505 times out of 500,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Adams said, the simulation had Obama winning more than 336 electoral votes half the time, and more than 300 electoral votes 97 percent of the time. Based on those outcomes, Adams, a Democrat, projects Obama would win a median 336 electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;None of this is opinion,&quot; he said. &quot;It is all based upon polling data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The catch is that polls are a snapshot of the race at any point in time, and we can expect the campaign to change between now and Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams said his simulation &quot;could also be applied to the Senate races to predict which party might control the Senate next year, or to Congress for the same reason. The same would apply to the Pennsylvania Senate or Pennsylvania House. It is not very useful in predicting individual races, other than president, because the race itself is run in only a single state or district, and thus it would simply mimic the individual poll.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has been rebuilding his lead over McCain since the economy started to tank and McCain's post-convention bounce began to dissipate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams ran the simulations after subtracting each poll's margin of error from the percentage of the candidate who was ahead, to determine how solid the lead was. The 500,000 &quot;runs&quot; allowed him to calculate all the different combinations of electoral votes that might result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By doing it this many times, even long shots, such as a Democrat winning Texas or Wyoming, might be expected to occur,&quot; he said. &quot;But the long shots occur in very small numbers compared to the number of times that the more likely outcomes occur.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most states' Electoral College votes go to the winner of the popular vote, although Maine and Nebraska apportion their electors both statewide and by congressional district. A total of 270 is needed to win the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams counts 20 states as strongly in McCain's column, based on October poll results, and two leaning toward the Republican. Obama has 17 states firmly for him (including Pennsylvania) and 11 leaning to him. Ohio is rated a tossup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem for McCain is that many states in Obama's column are larger ones with more electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Counting only the 'sure things,' &quot; with a greater than a 95 percent chance of winning the state, Adams said, &quot;Obama has 221 electoral votes. Including the 'leaners' ... he is way over the top at 345.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the McCain side, the 'sure thing' states give him 155 electoral votes, with an additional 19 for the 'leaners,' for a total of 174. He would need much more than Ohio's 20 electoral votes to even remain competitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His most likely scenario is Virginia, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Missouri. Taking more than one or two of these, let alone all of them, would be a long shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Translation for math illiterates like me: McCain has a tough road ahead to calculate a strategy that gets him to 270.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, as Adams noted, &quot;By election day, the polls will have changed. As they do, the simulation model can be repeated and a new set of outcomes determined.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain isn't giving up on Pennsylvania: His national coordinator for evangelical outreach, Marlys Popma, was in town Saturday to stir up evangelical excitement at the Lancaster County ACTION quarterly breakfast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Popma, from Iowa, argued that McCain shares evangelicals' values on &quot;non-negotiable&quot; issues, including the right to life, traditional definitions of marriage and appointing &quot;judges who interpret the law and not make the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One more conservative Supreme Court justice, she said, and &quot;Roe v. Wade [the 1973 ruling legalizing abortion] is gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the polls aren't looking good now, Popma said, &quot;we've got 24 days and a mighty God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other McCain supporters at the breakfast at the Leola Restaurant were frustrated at what they see as media bias toward Obama, including coverage of voter registration fraud allegations involving the Association of Community Organizers for Reform Now, or ACORN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressman Joe Pitts, R-16th District, charged that ACORN gets $500 million a year in federal funding from the Democratic-controlled Congress and was involved in lawsuits against banks to force them to make subprime loans, which contributed to the collapse on Wall Street. Obama was ACORN's attorney at one time, Pitts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chuck Trupe was frustrated on a different issue. The Elanco school board member, a GOP committeeman, asked ACTION supporters for help in distributing literature Nov. 4 explaining the local referendum over whether Elanco should accept gambling revenues to lower property taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elanco was the only board statewide to turn down slots revenue, which would have given each homeowner a tax reduction of $66 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Trupe noted that the county elections board would not allow Elanco to explain in the referendum question that the money comes from slots, or permit an interpretive statement about the issue to accompany the question. The statement will be at the polling place but not on the ballot, Trupe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school board hires teachers, approves curriculum, authorizes $40 million for school construction, and no one comes to board meetings, Trupe said - but when Elanco turned down the $66, 200 people turned out to protest, and 800 signed a petition asking the board members to resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gambling destroys individuals, families and communities,&quot; Trupe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican auditor general candidate Chet Beiler is running uphill, at least in terms of cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beiler, the Penn Township businessman and former county Republican chairman, had $121,912 at the close of the last campaign finance reporting cycle, according to his report, which was posted online by the state elections office last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incumbent Democrat Jack Wagner finished the last cycle with $511,856.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beiler's report shows he raised $194,299 and spent $138,087 in the period. He listed $135,282 in debts, including loans from himself of $73,000 and $32,606 owed to his campaign consultant, Arena Strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beiler's biggest contributors were Dr. John Templeton Jr., of Bryn Mawr, $20,000; GOP national committeewoman Christine Olson and James McErlane, of West Chester, $10,000 each; and Kreider Farms chairman Noah Kreider Jr., his father-in-law, $7,000. The Noah W. Kreider &amp; Sons Partnership gave another $5,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donors who gave $5,000 included High Industries CEO S. Dale High; Lancaster Newspapers director Beverly Steinman; Myles Tanenbaum, of King of Prussia; Martha Herr, of Lancaster; Greiner Industries owner Franklin Greiner; builder J. Elam King, of Manheim; and Willow Valley Associates executive Marlin Thomas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wagner's campaign announced last week that he has been endorsed by the Pennsylvania State Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, which represents more than 41,000 law enforcement officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Ed Rendell on Friday signed House Bill 2034 into law, ending a long odyssey for the legislation that aims to ensure lower-cost prescription drugs for veterans in long-term care facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill, sponsored by Rep. John Bear, R-97th District, now is Act 114 of 2008; it goes into effect in 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veterans pay $8 a month for prescriptions from the federal Veterans Administration, but state law required that long-term care homes must dispense medications in unit doses that their pharmacies buy from the drug industry.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. J. Brian Adams could tell you who's going to win the presidential election right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a 99.901 percent chance that Democrat Barack Obama would win, and a .086 percent probability that Republican John McCain would win. The odds of an electoral vote tie are .013 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what happens when a math professor is into politics, as Adams (no relation, as we always say) is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams has developed a simulation model to provide a statistical picture of the presidential race, based on early October poll numbers. The model involves running 500,000 simulated state-by-state races, using the poll results for each state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the assistant professor of mathematics and computer science at Franklin &amp; Marshall College fed the numbers into his computer, the model showed Obama getting 270 electoral votes or more 99.901 percent of the time - 499,505 times out of 500,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Adams said, the simulation had Obama winning more than 336 electoral votes half the time, and more than 300 electoral votes 97 percent of the time. Based on those outcomes, Adams, a Democrat, projects Obama would win a median 336 electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;None of this is opinion,&quot; he said. &quot;It is all based upon polling data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The catch is that polls are a snapshot of the race at any point in time, and we can expect the campaign to change between now and Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams said his simulation &quot;could also be applied to the Senate races to predict which party might control the Senate next year, or to Congress for the same reason. The same would apply to the Pennsylvania Senate or Pennsylvania House. It is not very useful in predicting individual races, other than president, because the race itself is run in only a single state or district, and thus it would simply mimic the individual poll.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has been rebuilding his lead over McCain since the economy started to tank and McCain's post-convention bounce began to dissipate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams ran the simulations after subtracting each poll's margin of error from the percentage of the candidate who was ahead, to determine how solid the lead was. The 500,000 &quot;runs&quot; allowed him to calculate all the different combinations of electoral votes that might result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By doing it this many times, even long shots, such as a Democrat winning Texas or Wyoming, might be expected to occur,&quot; he said. &quot;But the long shots occur in very small numbers compared to the number of times that the more likely outcomes occur.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most states' Electoral College votes go to the winner of the popular vote, although Maine and Nebraska apportion their electors both statewide and by congressional district. A total of 270 is needed to win the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams counts 20 states as strongly in McCain's column, based on October poll results, and two leaning toward the Republican. Obama has 17 states firmly for him (including Pennsylvania) and 11 leaning to him. Ohio is rated a tossup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem for McCain is that many states in Obama's column are larger ones with more electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Counting only the 'sure things,' &quot; with a greater than a 95 percent chance of winning the state, Adams said, &quot;Obama has 221 electoral votes. Including the 'leaners' ... he is way over the top at 345.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the McCain side, the 'sure thing' states give him 155 electoral votes, with an additional 19 for the 'leaners,' for a total of 174. He would need much more than Ohio's 20 electoral votes to even remain competitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His most likely scenario is Virginia, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Missouri. Taking more than one or two of these, let alone all of them, would be a long shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Translation for math illiterates like me: McCain has a tough road ahead to calculate a strategy that gets him to 270.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, as Adams noted, &quot;By election day, the polls will have changed. As they do, the simulation model can be repeated and a new set of outcomes determined.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain isn't giving up on Pennsylvania: His national coordinator for evangelical outreach, Marlys Popma, was in town Saturday to stir up evangelical excitement at the Lancaster County ACTION quarterly breakfast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Popma, from Iowa, argued that McCain shares evangelicals' values on &quot;non-negotiable&quot; issues, including the right to life, traditional definitions of marriage and appointing &quot;judges who interpret the law and not make the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One more conservative Supreme Court justice, she said, and &quot;Roe v. Wade [the 1973 ruling legalizing abortion] is gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the polls aren't looking good now, Popma said, &quot;we've got 24 days and a mighty God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other McCain supporters at the breakfast at the Leola Restaurant were frustrated at what they see as media bias toward Obama, including coverage of voter registration fraud allegations involving the Association of Community Organizers for Reform Now, or ACORN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressman Joe Pitts, R-16th District, charged that ACORN gets $500 million a year in federal funding from the Democratic-controlled Congress and was involved in lawsuits against banks to force them to make subprime loans, which contributed to the collapse on Wall Street. Obama was ACORN's attorney at one time, Pitts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chuck Trupe was frustrated on a different issue. The Elanco school board member, a GOP committeeman, asked ACTION supporters for help in distributing literature Nov. 4 explaining the local referendum over whether Elanco should accept gambling revenues to lower property taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elanco was the only board statewide to turn down slots revenue, which would have given each homeowner a tax reduction of $66 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Trupe noted that the county elections board would not allow Elanco to explain in the referendum question that the money comes from slots, or permit an interpretive statement about the issue to accompany the question. The statement will be at the polling place but not on the ballot, Trupe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school board hires teachers, approves curriculum, authorizes $40 million for school construction, and no one comes to board meetings, Trupe said - but when Elanco turned down the $66, 200 people turned out to protest, and 800 signed a petition asking the board members to resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gambling destroys individuals, families and communities,&quot; Trupe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican auditor general candidate Chet Beiler is running uphill, at least in terms of cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beiler, the Penn Township businessman and former county Republican chairman, had $121,912 at the close of the last campaign finance reporting cycle, according to his report, which was posted online by the state elections office last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incumbent Democrat Jack Wagner finished the last cycle with $511,856.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beiler's report shows he raised $194,299 and spent $138,087 in the period. He listed $135,282 in debts, including loans from himself of $73,000 and $32,606 owed to his campaign consultant, Arena Strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beiler's biggest contributors were Dr. John Templeton Jr., of Bryn Mawr, $20,000; GOP national committeewoman Christine Olson and James McErlane, of West Chester, $10,000 each; and Kreider Farms chairman Noah Kreider Jr., his father-in-law, $7,000. The Noah W. Kreider &amp; Sons Partnership gave another $5,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donors who gave $5,000 included High Industries CEO S. Dale High; Lancaster Newspapers director Beverly Steinman; Myles Tanenbaum, of King of Prussia; Martha Herr, of Lancaster; Greiner Industries owner Franklin Greiner; builder J. Elam King, of Manheim; and Willow Valley Associates executive Marlin Thomas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wagner's campaign announced last week that he has been endorsed by the Pennsylvania State Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, which represents more than 41,000 law enforcement officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Ed Rendell on Friday signed House Bill 2034 into law, ending a long odyssey for the legislation that aims to ensure lower-cost prescription drugs for veterans in long-term care facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill, sponsored by Rep. John Bear, R-97th District, now is Act 114 of 2008; it goes into effect in 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veterans pay $8 a month for prescriptions from the federal Veterans Administration, but state law required that long-term care homes must dispense medications in unit doses that their pharmacies buy from the drug industry. Veterans who had been getting VA prescriptions were forced to pay substantially more when they entered a long-term care facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation allows pharmacies in long-term care homes and pharmacies that contract with such homes to receive drugs directly from the VA and to repackage and relabel them so they can be dispensed in unit doses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Legislature approved a bill sponsored by state Sen. Mike Folmer, R-48th District, protecting the child custody rights of military personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Bill 1107 provides that if a petition to change the custody of a child of a serviceman or servicewoman is filed while the service member is deployed for active duty, courts cannot change the custody arrangement during the deployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Scott Boyd said he hopes a wave of metal thefts will diminish with passage of new legislation to regulate the scrap metal industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;High prices, often in cash, paid for scrap metal have fueled a skyrocketing level of metal theft crime in Pennsylvania and across the country,&quot; Boyd, R-43rd District, said in a statement. &quot;The thefts of items like electrical cable, copper wiring and flashing, air conditioner coils, metal down spouts and light fixtures can cause staggering losses for local governments and businesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Bill 1742, which passed the House and Senate on Wednesday and is awaiting Rendell's signature, requires a registry for scrap metal sellers, penalizes people who steal scrap and establishes a time frame in which processors or recycling facilities must hold stolen materials. Any dealer who gets more than $100 worth of scrap must keep a copy of the seller's driver's license, signature and license plate number. Boyd co-authored the bill with Rep. Eddie Day Pashinski, D-Luzerne County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Mike Brubaker, R-36th District, has been named a &quot;Guardian of Small Businesses&quot; by the National Federation of Independent Business for his voting record on bills in the 2007-08 session. The award goes to lawmakers who voted favorably on key small-business issues, including health care, property rights, competition and taxes, 75 percent of the time or more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County Commissioner Scott Martin has been appointed to the Human Services and Education Steering Committee of the National Association of Counties. The committee helps NACo develop policy relating to federal laws on social services.</SPAN></P>

AFSCME joins the AFL-CIO of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Council of Service Employees International Union, International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 771, Communications Workers of America Local 13000, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 126 and United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1776 in backing Slater, who is running against incumbent Pitts, Constitution Party nominee Dan Frank and independent candidate John Murphy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I am older now, and wiser in a cynical rather than a good way. That cockeyed optimist dream of a clean campaign has been replaced by the all too real nightmare that is the 2008 presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Didn't these two guys shake hands and agree that this time things would be different?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aren't these the two guys who both promised to forgo private funding in the general election and participate in the presidential public financing system? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Didn't John McCain and Barack Obama each make very public promises to run clean campaigns, to stay out of the mud, to focus on their respective platforms and the positive plans they hoped to implement?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened? They are batting one-for-four on those promises, with only John McCain sticking to the financing pledge, and both of them so deep in the muck and mire, it is like watching the 1997 Mud Bowl at Lambeau field, where you couldn't tell a Green Bay Packer from a 49er in the first quarter!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps what we need in politics is referees - a full crew of officials. A referee will be the general supervisor as well as the final authority on all rulings. Umpires will observe the offensive plays - speeches, ads, press releases, and all public statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will need a head linesman to decide what is out of bounds, and line judges to rule on off-sides and encroachment. as well as keeping track of both teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Field, side, and back judges will call interference, incompletions, determine whether scoring attempts are good or not, and will enforce delay of game rules. Unnecessary roughness, chop blocks, illegal blocks in the back and unsportsmanlike conduct are just as real in politics as on the gridiron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please do not too quickly dismiss my little sports analogy! Sports work because of rules. Rules require enforcement. And enforcement works when it includes penalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if there were actual enforceable campaign laws? What if we established an independent judiciary-based team of officials? And what if we set in place predetermined penalties with teeth for infractions, penalties?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if we had officials actually throwing flags, blowing whistles and stopping the action at political debates when lies are told? Fact-checking is a fairly quick and easy operation in this computer age and, with daily entry of speeches and statements and press releases, it is certainly feasible to establish a solid data base from which to judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The threat of instant-replay scrutiny would surely cause candidates to rein in their exaggerations and distortions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if every campaign ad was scrutinized by those same officials? We all understand campaign rhetoric and spin as no harm/no foul good, aggressive political play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if an ad was judged to be a lie, perhaps the penalty should be that the ad is ejected from the game, and in its place, at the offending campaign's expense, each network that ran the ad will run a disclaimer pointing out each falsehood to the American people. which would include at the end a personal mea-culpa apology by the candidate himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we are really serious about true campaign reform. we will codify the fact that families and personal lives are strictly off limits. Mention the spouse or the kids and there will be a fine, garnished from the Senate salary check, not paid for with campaign donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if similar fines were levied against the campaigns for the lies of 527 groups and political bloggers, perhaps we could extinguish the raging forest fires now tearing through our national airwaves, as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sound unfair? Perhaps if supporters knew that spreading blatant lies would financially damage their own chosen candidate's coffers, we could all return to a measure of sanity and truth and trust once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just one more suggestion: Now more than ever we need a national movement to include &quot;None Of The Above&quot; or NOTA on the ballot, both in the primaries and in the general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have been settling for the lesser of two evils for much too long. The electorate needs to have a way to force the parties to go back to the drawing board and give us a candidate for whom we could proudly, happily vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And NOTA would put the power back into the hands of the American voter and would go a long way toward keeping the candidates honest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too many lies on both sides? Tick the box next to NOTA, and let's have a do-over instead of four years of carnage by a man or woman from either party whose campaign tactics have proven them unworthy of our trust.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Didn't these two guys shake hands and agree that this time things would be different?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aren't these the two guys who both promised to forgo private funding in the general election and participate in the presidential public financing system? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Didn't John McCain and Barack Obama each make very public promises to run clean campaigns, to stay out of the mud, to focus on their respective platforms and the positive plans they hoped to implement?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened? They are batting one-for-four on those promises, with only John McCain sticking to the financing pledge, and both of them so deep in the muck and mire, it is like watching the 1997 Mud Bowl at Lambeau field, where you couldn't tell a Green Bay Packer from a 49er in the first quarter!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps what we need in politics is referees - a full crew of officials. A referee will be the general supervisor as well as the final authority on all rulings. Umpires will observe the offensive plays - speeches, ads, press releases, and all public statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will need a head linesman to decide what is out of bounds, and line judges to rule on off-sides and encroachment. as well as keeping track of both teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Field, side, and back judges will call interference, incompletions, determine whether scoring attempts are good or not, and will enforce delay of game rules. Unnecessary roughness, chop blocks, illegal blocks in the back and unsportsmanlike conduct are just as real in politics as on the gridiron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please do not too quickly dismiss my little sports analogy! Sports work because of rules. Rules require enforcement. And enforcement works when it includes penalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if there were actual enforceable campaign laws? What if we established an independent judiciary-based team of officials? And what if we set in place predetermined penalties with teeth for infractions, penalties?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if we had officials actually throwing flags, blowing whistles and stopping the action at political debates when lies are told? Fact-checking is a fairly quick and easy operation in this computer age and, with daily entry of speeches and statements and press releases, it is certainly feasible to establish a solid data base from which to judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The threat of instant-replay scrutiny would surely cause candidates to rein in their exaggerations and distortions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if every campaign ad was scrutinized by those same officials? We all understand campaign rhetoric and spin as no harm/no foul good, aggressive political play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if an ad was judged to be a lie, perhaps the penalty should be that the ad is ejected from the game, and in its place, at the offending campaign's expense, each network that ran the ad will run a disclaimer pointing out each falsehood to the American people. which would include at the end a personal mea-culpa apology by the candidate himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we are really serious about true campaign reform. we will codify the fact that families and personal lives are strictly off limits. Mention the spouse or the kids and there will be a fine, garnished from the Senate salary check, not paid for with campaign donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if similar fines were levied against the campaigns for the lies of 527 groups and political bloggers, perhaps we could extinguish the raging forest fires now tearing through our national airwaves, as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sound unfair? Perhaps if supporters knew that spreading blatant lies would financially damage their own chosen candidate's coffers, we could all return to a measure of sanity and truth and trust once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just one more suggestion: Now more than ever we need a national movement to include &quot;None Of The Above&quot; or NOTA on the ballot, both in the primaries and in the general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have been settling for the lesser of two evils for much too long. The electorate needs to have a way to force the parties to go back to the drawing board and give us a candidate for whom we could proudly, happily vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And NOTA would put the power back into the hands of the American voter and would go a long way toward keeping the candidates honest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too many lies on both sides? Tick the box next to NOTA, and let's have a do-over instead of four years of carnage by a man or woman from either party whose campaign tactics have proven them unworthy of our trust.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convicted felon Tony Rezko. Unrepentant terrorist Bill Ayers. And the race-baiting Rev. Jeremiah Wright. It is hard to think of any presidential candidate before Barack Obama sporting associations with three more execrable characters. Yet let the McCain campaign raise the issue, and the mainstream media begin fulminating about dirty campaigning tinged with racism and McCarthyite guilt by association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But associations are important. They provide a significant insight into character. They are particularly relevant in relation to a potential president as new, unknown, opaque and self-contained as Mr. Obama. With the economy overshadowing everything, it may be too late politically to be raising this issue. But that does not make it, as conventional wisdom holds, in any way illegitimate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain has only himself to blame for the bad timing. He should months ago have begun challenging Mr. Obama's associations, before the economic meltdown allowed the Obama campaign (and the mainstream media, which is to say the same thing) to dismiss the charges as an act of desperation by the trailing candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain had his chance back in April when the North Carolina Republican Party ran a gubernatorial campaign ad that included the linking of Mr. Obama with Jeremiah Wright. The ad was duly denounced by The New York Times and other deep thinkers as racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was patently absurd. Racism is treating people differently and invidiously on the basis of race. Had any white presidential candidate had a close 20-year association with a white preacher overtly spreading race hatred from the pulpit, that candidate would have been not just universally denounced and deemed unfit for office but written out of polite society entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, John McCain in his infinite wisdom, and with his overflowing sense of personal rectitude, joined the braying mob in denouncing that perfectly legitimate ad, saying it had no place in any campaign. In doing so, Mr. McCain unilaterally disarmed himself, rendering off-limits Mr. Obama's associations, an issue that even Hillary Clinton addressed more than once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's political career was launched with Mr. Ayers giving him a fund-raiser in his living room. If a Republican candidate had launched his political career at the home of an abortion-clinic bomber -- even a repentant one -- he would not have been able to run for dogcatcher in Podunk. And Mr. Ayers shows no remorse. His only regret is that he &quot;didn't do enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why are these associations important? Do I think Mr. Obama is as corrupt as Mr. Rezko? Or shares Rev. Wright's angry racism or Mr. Ayers' unreconstructed 1960s radicalism?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. But that does not make these associations irrelevant. They tell us two important things about Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, his cynicism and ruthlessness. He found these men useful, and use them he did. Would you attend a church whose pastor was spreading racial animosity from the pulpit? Would you even shake hands with -- let alone serve on a board with -- an unrepentant terrorist, whether he bombed U.S. military installations or abortion clinics?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Americans would not, on the grounds of sheer indecency. Yet Mr. Obama did, if not out of conviction then out of expediency. He was a young man on the make, an unknown outsider working his way into Chicago politics. He played the game with everyone, without qualms and with obvious success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is not the first politician to rise through a corrupt political machine. But he is one of the rare few to then have the audacity to present himself as a transcendent healer, hovering above and bringing redemption to the &quot;old politics&quot; -- of the kind he had enthusiastically embraced in Chicago in the service of his own ambition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, and even more disturbing than the cynicism, is the window these associations give on Mr. Obama's core beliefs. He doesn't share Rev. Wright's poisonous views of race nor Mr. Ayers' views, past and present, about the evil that is American society. But Obama clearly did not consider these views beyond the pale. For many years he swam easily and without protest in that fetid pond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now. Today, on the threshold of the presidency, Mr. Obama concedes the odiousness of these associations, which is why he has severed them. But for the years in which he sat in Mr. Wright's pews and shared common purpose on a board with Ayers, Mr. Obama considered them a legitimate, indeed unremarkable, part of social discourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you? Mr. Obama is a man of first-class intellect and first-class temperament. But his character remains highly suspect. There is a difference between temperament and character. Equanimity is a virtue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tolerance of the obscene is not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Saturday Night Live</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cast last night became the Ready for Prime Time Players with the first of three Thursday specials focused on politics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And you didn't need exit polling to conclude that the early results were . . . um, disappointing.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Tina Fey nor her parody target, Sarah Palin, each of whom was falsely rumored to appear. The only drop-in was SNL legend Bill Murray - and even he wanted to talk baseball, not policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even at its condensed half-hour length, the show was sketchy, in a bad way. It consisted of two elements: an opening spoof of Tuesday night's debate between John McCain and Barack Obama and an egregiously extended version of Update, the fake-news skit anchored by Seth Meyers and Amy Poehler. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate satire was long, thin and absurdly off-target. Fred Armisen's Obama imitation continues to be unconvincing and unamusing. And Darrell Hammond, a master impersonator, hasn't nailed McCain either. The voice and the mannerisms were both off. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter who wins the election, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Saturday Night Live</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fans will lose because the show lacks a comedian to play either candidate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were really only a couple of funny things that stood out in this first sketch: returning cast member Chris Parnell, who did a devastating imitation of moderator Tom Brokaw, and McCain as a restless wanderer, drifting around the stage whenever it wasn't his turn to speak. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extended Update had some sharp humor but couldn't hold serve. After a few political salvos, Meyers and Poehler veered off into random jokes about everything from O.J. Simpson to frozen TV dinners. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It included a gratuitous mockery of local boys Hall &amp; Oates. But the reworked version of &quot;You Make My Dreams&quot; was painful, with Armisen (as Oates) and Will Forte (as Hall) singing loudly and off-key. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The special mainly consisted of lots and lots of commercials. That may be fitting for this ad-saturated election, but a more fitting title for the show would have been &quot;We're Saturday Night Live and We Approved These Messages.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I am a fan no longer. It is dead wrong for Flyers owner Ed Snider to inject politics into sports (&quot;For Palin, the puck stops here,&quot; yesterday). Sarah Palin has no place participating at the opening game tomorrow. Snider brings disgrace to the Flyers, their fans and the NHL. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jerry GordonMilltown, NJShame on FlyersI am a lifelong Flyers fan, but if Sarah Palin drops the puck at the opener as scheduled, I will not attend the game nor will I sell or give my tickets away.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat or Republican, keep politics out of hockey. Sports should be a community event where people of different backgrounds and beliefs can come together for a common cause. This is the first time I am truly embarrassed to be a Flyers fan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Christopher Campbell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PhiladelphiaAttack adsI can only surmise that Tony Auth's cartoon Tuesday singling out Republicans for attack ads was a joke. If it wasn't, then Auth apparently has no problem with Sen. Barack Obama's&nbsp;ad that falsely asserts that Sen. John McCain doesn't know how to use the Internet. Or the one that took a radio host's words out of context to misrepresent McCain's views on immigration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Obama's relationship with unrepentant terrorist Bill Ayers is far from irrelevant and tangential. Obama may have been 8 years old when Ayers' group carried out its bombings, but he was far older than that when he willingly associated with Ayers. Obama's ties to Tony Rezko, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and ACORN - the last three of these directly related to our nation's economic crisis - are equally relevant to voters. </SPAN></P>

It was a joy to see the refurbished carousel working once again. Most important, the staff members were friendly and helpful. I'm not sure who had more fun, the children or their elders. </SPAN></P>

If they feel this works, I'm not sure why they don't also post their choice of religion, ISP provider, and position on global warming.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's TV Q&amp;A responds to questions about network movies nights, &quot;Heroes&quot; and sound on The CW. As always, thanks for reading, and keep those questions coming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Rob Owen, Post-Gazette TV editor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What ever happened to network movie nights? Whether the network produced a made-for-TV movie or ran theatrical release film, there was still the &quot;NBC Sunday Night Movie&quot; or the ABC/CBS version. Just curious... what happened?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Matt, 34, Pittsburgh</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob: ABC still has movies on Saturday night after fall football wraps up, My Network TV has movies on Thursday night and Fox occasionally airs a movie, but for the most part, broadcast networks have ceded movies to cable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are certainly a lot of factors at play -- cost, ratings, demographics, etc. -- but probably the primary reason for fewer movie nights on the broadcast networks is that the windows of distribution for theatrical releases have moved so close to each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It used to be that a movie would be in theaters and then not on home video until six months later. Now a hit movie can turn up on DVD just a couple of months after it's in the theaters. That also means the movie turns up on On Demand faster and then on premium cable faster. The movies are also seen on so many more platforms now (including Internet downloads) that by the time the broadcast network window is open, it seems like most people who wanted to see the movie already saw it, depressing movie ratings on the broadcast networks even further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for made-for-TV movies, networks decided to concentrate their energies and spending on series rather than one-shot events. CBS still has the Hallmark Hall of Fame productions on a few times a year, but as we noted two years ago just before CBS dropped its weekly Sunday night movie (http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06113/683082-237.stm), it's just not an investment that pays off for networks anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: How about some jokes about Obama instead of McCain &amp; Palin on late night TV ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Rich, 74, Negley, Ohio</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob: I'm sure when U.S. Sen. Barack Obama and U.S. Sen Joe Biden make some of the gaffes made by the Republicans -- particularly Palin's non-answers to non-gotcha questions (objectively, there's no way asking what newspapers a person reads can be considered a &quot;gotcha&quot; question) -- the late night hosts will tease them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden was mocked, along with Palin, on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; this past weekend. And the liberal &quot;Daily Show&quot; on Comedy Central has been mocking Obama for months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: On the premiere episode of &quot;Gary Unmarried&quot; the little girl who played his daughter was the girl from one of the &quot;classes&quot; of &quot;Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader&quot; I think her name was Laura. She's the girl who left &quot;Smarter&quot; to get a character on the ill-fated &quot;Back to You&quot; last year, where she was also replaced. On last Wednesday's episode of &quot;Gary Unmarried,&quot; another girl played his daughter. Any reason why Laura was replaced this time?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- John, 52, Delmont</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob: Networks will never say why an actress was re-cast but it is odd that Laura Marano has been replaced on two series in a row, especially considering that her performances seemed fine. Makes me wonder if something else may be going on behind the scenes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She was re-cast and replaced by actress Kathryn Newton who now plays the role of Gary's daughter, Louise, on the show,&quot; a CBS publicist explained. &quot;They did not re-shoot the pilot scenes using Kathryn, which is why there were two separate actresses from week one to week two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Just started watching the new &quot;Survivor&quot; for this season. I know HD is the big thing these days, but WHAT THE HECK have they done with &quot;Survivor&quot;? It looks funky. It looks muffled or muted somehow. HD is nowhere to be found on this series. Plus they must have told the editor to &quot;speed-things-up.&quot; There was no scene on screen longer than 3 seconds! I generally like to watch &quot;Survivor,&quot; but I don't know if I can continue to watch this 3-second roller-coaster ride each week. I had to take a dramamine after last night's episode! What have they done? Let's go back to when TV was standardized and it ALL LOOKED THE SAME! No stretched pictures, no wide screen, no HD, non-HD etc. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Bryan, 43, Bethel Park</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob: Sorry, but I have no idea what you're talking about. I've watched &quot;Survivor&quot; this season and it looks fine to me. The editing seems no different from usual. Perhaps there's an issue with your TV set or cable connection?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: My wife and I watched &quot;Holmes On Homes&quot; when it was on the TLC network. Did TLC cancel &quot;Holmes&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Bob, 53, Brentwood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob: It sounds like TLC has not yet made a decision on the future of &quot;Holmes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;TLC did air a season of episodes of 'Holmes on Homes' this past summer,&quot; said a TLC representative. &quot;We are still evaluating our schedules for next year, and know that Mike has a eager fan base who are looking for more episodes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: I noticed in the program description for &quot;90210&quot; (I have Verizon, though not sure that makes a difference) that Tori Spelling is listed in the cast. That surprised me since I did not think she ever actually joined the show, just that she was supposed to (money was the reason, I think). I understand that program descriptions and even programs themselves are often incorrect as schedules change. But it seems odd to me to have a person who was never actually in a show listed as being in that show. Is that typical? I don't think I am missing her in the show (although I tend not to watch the entire show).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Faith, Penn Hills</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob: That is an odd one. The only thing I can guess is that someone at the listings service used by Verizon mistakenly input Spelling's name into the cast list. The CW indicated she would be in the series back in July before she dropped out but she hasn't been mentioned in CW press materials since then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: After watching the season three premiere of &quot;Heroes,&quot; I can safely say that I am finished with this show. The first season was great, the second was decent and the third looks to be a mess. Too many characters, plot lines and weak visuals to determine past, present and future. Look, Peter has a scar! Now he doesn't! Claire is now a brunette! I can't even remember what they are trying to accomplish. I love serialized shows like &quot;24&quot; and &quot;Lost&quot; but &quot;Heroes&quot; has become a joke. This show will be on for at least two more dreadful seasons. I can't even imagine where they are going with this plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do you think of &quot;Heroes&quot; thus far this season?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have replaced &quot;Heroes&quot; with &quot;Mad Men&quot; on my DVR and am not looking back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Matt, 32, Scott</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob: I am so with you on this one, Matt. &quot;Heroes&quot; has devolved into a complicated mess and one that I'm no longer interested enough in to attempt to figure out. I'm still watching because I feel like I have to but my drift factor -- when I find myself losing interest and drifting away to thumb through a magazine or check e-mail online -- is getting higher by the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Who replaced Al Vanik as the voiceover for KDKA's news promos and opens?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- J. P., South Fayette</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob: The male voice is Jeff Collins. The female voice is Molly O'Brian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: A lot of Pittsburgh TV stations are undergoing anchor changes. When do you think KDKA will finally make a change with the 5 p.m.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are my lineup suggestions for them. What do you think?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morning: Keith Jones and Sonni Abatta</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pittsburgh Today Live&quot;: Kristine Sorensen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noon -- Jones and Abatta</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4 p.m. -- Patrice King Brown and Stacy Smith</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5 p.m. -- Stephanie Watson and Ken Rice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6 p.m. -- Brown and Smith</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11 p.m. -- Watson and Rice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any chance?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Doug, 26, Greentree</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob: Anything is possible, but I get the sense that KDKA plans no changes to its anchor lineup at this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the time for change comes, I doubt they'll take your suggestion and keep everyone on currently and add Watson to the weekday lineup. I think viewers are more likely to see fewer different anchor teams in the future. There will probably be more stations with lineups similar to what we see evenings on WPXI, simply because it's a less expensive approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: There has been one of those annoying &quot;Gus the groundhog&quot; Pennsylvania Lottery ads running for a Halloween scratch-off game. In features two people who hear noises in the basement and creep down there only to find the groundhog. I am convinced that the female in the commercial is our own Kelsey Friday, formerly of Brownie Mary. I have been a big fan of hers and I recognize that face. Any help on this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- John, 52, Delmont</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob: Good eye, John! It is Friday in the spot, which she said she filmed in Philadelphia several years ago. The ad ran shortly after it was filmed and has now been revived, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: We get KDKA on TimeWarner Northeast Ohio. For some reason, the sound goes out on a regular basis. This is just for a few seconds, but occurs as often as every minute or so. TimeWarner NEO insists that it's something on KDKA's end. None of the other channels, including the other Pittsburgh channels carried, has this problem. Any chance you can find out what's going on? It's bad enough that I usually end up watching the Youngstown CBS channel instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Rick, 50, Greenville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob: In an approximation of what chief engineer Montgomery Scott would say, I'm a TV critic, not an engineer!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to KDKA, the station's engineering department will follow up with Time Warner to try to isolate the problem and correct it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since we have not experienced this problem on any other system we have to believe that it has something to do with how they are receiving/decoding our signal,&quot; said KDKA general manager Chris Pike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Two of the last three weeks on Thursday night, while watching &quot;Supernatural&quot; on the CW, the show has been very blurry and the screen has been unwatchable. The most you could do was listen to it like it was a radio show. Is there something wrong with the feed to the local station or is the local station having problems? I love &quot;Supernatural&quot; and it has been frustrating to try to watch it. I am watching in Standard Definition on Comcast Channel 15 in Moon Township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Michael, 32, Moon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: I have a question for you about &quot;Smallville&quot; on The CW. Twice I've had the show be scrambled for me and it was to the point of being unwatchable, both the season premiere on Sept. 18 and then again last Thursday night. I have Comcast digital cable, watching on Channel 15 (not HD). No other show on any station did this but &quot;Smallville.&quot; Funny thing: When The CW repeated &quot;Smallville&quot; on Sunday, it didn't do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Jim, Ingram</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob: According to Pike, WPCW's engineer has been working with Comcast to try to solve this problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have just added a time base corrector on the WPCW feed to try to correct the problem which appears to be tied to the older style decoder boxes in some homes,&quot; Pike said. &quot;For some reason this problem seems to be unique to some CW Network programming. We and Comcast are working to try to solve this issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: I'm sure you're getting really tired of Comcast questions but no one at Comcast ever has an answer to the question of when is the Ross/Castle Shannon area going to get the same number of channels other areas have. Back in July most of the Comcast areas received an additional dozen or so HD channels but not our area. Then we received a message saying we would get the channels in August but shortly after that we were informed we would not be getting the channels in August and almost 2 months later there has been so new information. I spoke to someone at Comcast last week and all I got was the usual Comcast answer &quot;we will get to it as soon as we can.&quot; I want to know how soon that will be. Do you have any insights into the inner workings at Comcast?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Linda, 57, McCandless</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob: Alas, I do not know when that will come to pass. I had hoped to have an update on our August report on the delay (http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08229/904639-67.stm), but the folks at Comcast have no new information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can say it will be at least a month from today. And if they announce nothing Monday, it will be a month from Monday. Some franchise agreements dictate a 30-day period between an announcement of a cable system change to implementation, so until they make that announcement, it will always be at least a month of more before Ross and Castle Shannon get the upgrade. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What is up with Comcast? Five times, if not more, between 12:30 and 1 p.m. on Sept. 26 the &quot;Required Weekly Test of the Emergency Broadcast System&quot; ran. When did the weekly test move to five times or more a half-hour? By the fourth and fifth time I didn't even bother to look at the TV. What if this had been an actual emergency? Would I have been told to tune....just kidding. Seriously, I did start to ignore it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Scott, 35, Dormont</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob: According to Comcast, this was an anomaly due to an equipment issue that has been corrected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FEEDBACK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the shake-up at WTAE, I'm sure I'm not the only one who saw the irony in one of the segments on their 50th anniversary special. In the interview with Eleanor Schano, she talked about the transition from black and white to color and the concerns at the time that some talent might not look good in color and would lose their jobs as a result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the special went on to tout WTAE's shift to high definition, I could not help but think about stories I've seen warning that HD might be unflattering to some talent and make it especially difficult for older people to stay on the air. I doubt the relevance of Shano's memories and the situation today was lost on Sally Wiggin -- she was probably biting her tongue the whole time. I realize that TV has always had a youth bias, although I had hoped that the success of some slightly older women anchors -- such as Meredith Vieira on &quot;Today&quot; -- would filter down to benefit others like Sally Wiggin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shares of National City Corp. rose as much as 60 cents yesterday before falling back after reports that the Cleveland-based bank was in talks about a possible sale. National City, the Pittsburgh region's second biggest bank, was in discussions with a number of potential suitors including PNC Financial Services Group and Toronto-based Bank of Nova Scotia, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed sources. Shares of National City, which have been pounded by its exposure to the subprime mortgage market, rose as high as $2.83 yesterday but retreated to close at $2.15, down 8 cents from Wednesday's close. A year ago, shares were trading in the $25 range. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales growth lowest since September 2001</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. chain store sales growth last month was the weakest of any September since 2001, according to an industry trade group. Sales at established stores rose 1 percent compared with the same period last year, said the New York-based International Council of Shopping Centers, which bases its tally on results from 36 chains. A preliminary estimate on Wednesday, before all the numbers were in, had been a bit higher. Wholesale clubs and drugstores did well, but the economy and financial crisis hurt department stores and luxury retailers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comcast offers deals as digital TV era nears</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Feb. 17, when digital broadcasts make analog TV sets obsolete, consumers will be forced to buy either a digital converter box, a new digital TV set or service from a provider. For shoppers choosing the latter route, Comcast Corp. is offering free basic cable for 12 months to new customers who sign up for at least one additional Comcast service, such as Internet or phone. New customers who choose not to subscribe to additional services can get basic cable for $10 a month for a full year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WTO sides with U.S. on China piracy dispute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Trade Organization has partly sided with the United States in a dispute with China over product piracy, officials said yesterday. The WTO panel faulted China for not prosecuting pirates who copy CDs and DVDs before they are passed by censors, one trade diplomat who had reviewed the interim ruling said. But Washington suffered a setback as the panel found that Chinese thresholds for prosecuting piracy did not break WTO rules. The U.S. claims the thresholds allow pirates of everything from designer clothes to medicines to tailor their operations to avoid prosecution by staying just below the minimum level of 500 infringing copies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in business ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specialty retailer Linens 'n Things, which filed for bankruptcy in May, said it would scrap its reorganization plan and put itself up for sale in an auction Tuesday. ... A Chief Executive magazine poll of 751 U.S. CEOs found that they supported Republican presidential candidate John McCain by a 4-to-1 margin. The poll, conducted last month, also found that 69 percent of respondents feared that a victory by Democrat Barack Obama would be a disaster. ... Toyota Motor Corp.'s top U.S. sales executive says the company won't make more production cuts despite a sales slump that may not end until after next year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mong Kong's cash </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's campaign has shattered just about every fundraising record out there, leading to a potential new problem: The law can't keep up. It can be tough to figure out whether someone's giving a phony name -- like Mong Kong or Derty Poiiuy, listed as Obama donors -- when they're among 2.5 million other donors. Plus, federal law says donors who give less than $200 don't have to give their identities. But many of those millions of donors repeatedly give small donations, making it tough to track who's gone over that limit and remained anonymous, the Los Angeles Times reports. Several donors, some giving as little as $10 at a time, donated more than 100 times, the Times found. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, alleging Obama has knowingly violated the law, and accuses them of taking money from foreign nationals. The Obama campaign says it has returned money from sources it can't verify.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden on Ayers attacks </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain's campaign released a new 100-second Web advertisement again linking Obama to former Weather Underground leader William Ayers and his wife. It reprises Ayers' comments about not regretting the group's decision to set off bombs at the Pentagon and U.S. Capitol, and criticizes Obama's judgment for associating with Ayers. Obama's running mate, Joe Biden, noted during a rally in Missouri Thursday that McCain and Obama shared a stage during the debate Tuesday night. According to NBC, Biden said, &quot;In my neighborhood, when you've got something to say to a guy, you look him in the eye and you say it to him.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday night liberal? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wall Street Journal columnist and political reporter John Fund says NBC defended some off-color humor in a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skit directed at Sarah Palin's husband, Todd, but didn't wait for similar criticism of a skit attacking supporters of Democrats before pulling the clip from its Web site. In the first skit, an actor playing a New York Times reporter joked that Todd was &quot;doing&quot; his daughters. The other skit showed mortgage financiers Herb and Marion Sandler, who made billions off the subprime mortgage boom that sank the rest of the economy, with the caption &quot;People who should be shot.&quot; The clip has since returned to the Web site, Fund says, sans caption. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obamamercial </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hollywood Reporter says Obama bought a half-hour of air time on two national networks for a prime-time infomercial just days before the election. CBS and NBC have reached an agreement on the air time purchase, which is about 60 times longer than the average campaign commercial. The election ad (show? special?) will air at 8 p.m. on Oct. 29, the Wednesday before the election, the Reporter reports. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poll positions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A CNN poll found 47 percent of people are concerned McCain wouldn't finish his first term as president in good health. At 72, he'd be the oldest inaugurated to a first term, in contrast to the 47-year-old Obama. McCain has sought to blunt criticism of this by opening 1,100 pages of medical records to reporters and getting his doctor to attest to McCain's fitness for office.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reality-challenged </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veteran Washington Post columnist David Broder accuses both McCain and Obama of ignoring the reality they'll face when one of them wins the presidency. With two wars and an economy that shrinks seemingly by the minute, neither will be able deliver on many of the promises they've made. That hasn't stopped the candidates from continuing to make those promises, Broder notes. &quot;If either of them has a clue about what to do to help stabilize the tottering economy, they are keeping it to themselves,&quot; he lamented. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other 'L' word </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emboldened by polls showing Obama with a wide lead in the Electoral College vote, and heartened that the economy has taken center stage in the race, Democrats are wondering aloud whether Obama is headed for a landslide victory. The Politico's David Paul Kuhn reports that the party's strategists are looking at an electoral map that could deliver 350 electoral votes to Obama (270 are needed to win). Despite all the talk in the primaries about Obama's potential to &quot;change the map,&quot; the real game-changer might be the country's economic skid, Democratic strategist Paul Maslin told Kuhn. Voters give Obama a lead over McCain on economic questions. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BETHLEHEM - As Democrat Barack Obama pulled away in Pennsylvania polls, Republican John McCain tried to outflank him Wednesday on the housing crisis during a boisterous rally at Lehigh University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, comments by one of the rally's speakers about Obama's middle name threatened to overshadow McCain's rally with running mate Sarah Palin, an event designed to sway a heavily Democratic area reluctant to support Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the introduction, Lehigh County GOP chairman Bill Platt twice referred to &quot;Barack Hussein Obama,&quot; a practice McCain himself has slammed as out of line. The McCain campaign released a statement after the rally saying Platt's comments represented &quot;inappropriate rhetoric&quot; that it did not condone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign said the McCain campaign's response was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a continued attempt to distract people from the issues at hand,&quot; Obama spokeswoman Andrea Mead said. &quot;That is what McCain's supporters are doing and continue to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's rally came at a time when he's seeing Pennsylvania slip away from him in voter polls. RealClearPolitics.com in an analysis of registered voter surveys says Obama is up in Pennsylvania by 12 percent when only a few weeks ago the two candidates were locked in a dead heat. The economy is the dominant issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bethlehem crowd of 7,000 people threw out shouts of &quot;socialist,&quot; &quot;terrorist&quot; and &quot;liar&quot; in referring to Obama throughout the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest of McCain's rally, though, avoided any reference to the incendiary topics the campaign has raised during the last week to sow doubts about Obama's experience and judgment. Neither McCain nor Palin referred to alleged ties Obama once had to a Vietnam-era radical or a comment Obama made more than a year ago about U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, McCain tried to paint Obama as wishy-washy on the housing foreclosure crisis while touting his new plan to rescue bad mortgages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain began Tuesday night's debate with Obama calling for the federal government to buy up to 400,000 troubled mortgages, renegotiate principle and use the federal government to back the loans. The cost would be $300 billion, and funds would come out of the recently passed federal bailout plan for Wall Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mead said McCain's plan would lead to the federal government grossly overpaying for those mortgages, although it was not clear how that would happen. &quot;The biggest beneficiaries of this plan will be the same financial institutions that got us into this mess,&quot; Mead said. &quot;This is not the change we need to strengthen our economy, create new jobs and keep Americans in their homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not clear how fiscally conservative voters who opposed the federal bailout legislation as a big-government program would feel about McCain's proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">G. Terry Madonna, director of Franklin &amp; Marshall College's Center for Politics &amp; Public Affairs, said McCain's plan appeals to those who thought they were left out of the federal bailout plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also tried to paint Obama as oversensitive to criticism and inexperienced, a parallel to a new television ad the campaign put out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rather than answer his critics, Sen. Obama will try to distract you from noticing that he never answers the serious and legitimate questions he has been asked,&quot; McCain said. &quot;He has even questioned my truthfulness. And let me reply in the plainest terms I know. I don't need lessons about telling the truth to the American people. And were I ever to need any improvement in that regard, I probably wouldn't seek advice from a Chicago politician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin tried to describe Obama as the inexperienced candidate with no place to tell McCain, who has served in Congress since 1983, how to be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last night in the debate, we heard again Barack Obama lecturing John McCain about the stakes involved in going to war,&quot; Palin said. &quot;Wait a minute. May I remind Sen. Obama that Sen. McCain served America in uniform for 22 years?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cindy McCain, the candidate's wife, noted how Obama cannot relate to families like the McCains and Palins who have children serving in the military. Obama's daughters are 10 and 7 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cindy McCain said she wanted Obama to &quot;change shoes with me for just one day. I suggest he take a day and go watch our men and women deploying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, a Philadelphia-area Democrat and Iraq war veteran, called Cindy McCain's attack &quot;baseless&quot; and a &quot;predictable partisan attack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bethlehem is in the center of the Lehigh Valley, a two-county region of blue-collar workers, shuttered steel plants and new suburban developments. Of about 420,000 registered voters as of this month, about half are Democrats and 35 percent Republicans, making it one of the most reliable areas for Democratic presidential candidates. The last Republican presidential candidate to win this area was George H.W. Bush in 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Obama lost badly to Hillary Clinton in this area by a 60-40 margin, about 20,000 votes, or 10 percent of Clinton's victory margin statewide.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of John McCain's friends, from the good old days when he talked straight, feared that his Greek tragedy would be that he would be defeated by George Bush twice: once in 2000, because of W.'s no-conscience campaigning, and again in 2008, because of W.'s no-brains governing. But if Mr. McCain loses, he will have contributed to his downfall by failing to live up to his own standard of honor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right now, his drive to succeed is trumping any loftier aspirations. He cynically picked a running mate with less care than theater directors give to picking a leading actor's understudy. And he has been running a seamy campaign originally designed by the bad seed of conservative politics, Lee Atwater. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was adapted in 2000 in Mr. Atwater's home state of South Carolina by Atwater acolytes in W.'s camp to harpoon Mr. McCain with rumors that he had fathered out of wedlock a black baby (as opposed to adopting a Bangladeshi infant girl in wedlock). Such sulfurousAtwater-style rumor-mongering aimed to stop him during that primary after he had zoomed in New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Atwater relished teaching rich white Republicans to feign a connection to the common man so they could get in office and economically undermine the common man. In 1988, the elder George Bush defeated Michael Dukakis with this unholy quintet of charges:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrat was a '60s-style liberal who would raise taxes and take away guns. He would not protect the country militarily. He was a member of the elite &quot;Harvard Yard boutique.&quot; He had a foreign-sounding name and was not on &quot;the American side.&quot; He was on the side of the Scary Black Man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sound familiar?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, at some level, John McCain must be disgusted with himself for using the tactics perfected by the same crowd that used them to derail him in 2000. He's now curmudgeonly, even hostile, toward the press -- the group he used to spend hours with every day and jokingly described as his base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He unleashed Sarah Palin to slime their opponent and suggested that the Democrat with the foreign-sounding name who came from the Harvard Yard boutique is not on the American side. Campaigning last weekend, Ms. Palin cast their Democratic rival as &quot;someone who sees America, it seems, as being so imperfect that he's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Atwater gleefully tried to paint Willie Horton as Mr. Dukakis' running mate. With a black man running, it's even easier for the Atwater disciple running Mr. McCain's campaign to warn that white Americans should not open the door to the dangerous Other, or &quot;That One,&quot; as Mr. McCain referred to Mr. Obama in Tuesday night's debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Mr. McCain made Mr. Obama, who has been campaigning for almost two years now, sound like an ominous intruder, questioning his character and motives, telling a New Mexico crowd that &quot;even at this late hour in the campaign, there are essential things we don't know about Sen. Obama. ... Who is the real Barack Obama?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new McCain TV ad, &quot;Dangerous,&quot; calls Mr. Obama &quot;dishonorable,&quot; &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;too risky for America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain aides have been blunt about their need to change the subject from the economy. But, as with Bush Senior's re-election campaign, slithery character attacks don't scare as well when Americans are already scared about keeping their jobs and retirement savings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Palin finally took questions on Tuesday from the traveling press corps on her campaign plane. Asked if she thought Mr. Obama was dishonest, Mr. McCain's Mean Girl meandered:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not saying he's dishonest, but in terms of judgment, in terms of being able to answer a question forthrightly, it has two different parts to this. The judgment and the truthfulness and just being able to answer very candidly a simple question about when did you know him, how did you know him, is there still -- has there been an association continued since '02 or '05, I know I've read a couple different stories. I think it's relevant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course she does. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Barack Obama spent $3.3 million in TV advertising on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that rate the Democrat will spend more than $90 million on ads through Election Day - more than all the money Republican rival John McCain has to spend on his entire fall campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's&nbsp;ad spending Monday totaled about $900,000 and the Republican National Committee weighed in with about $700,000 worth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All whopping numbers, but the disparity between Obama and the Republicans is so wide that it has allowed Obama to spend in more states than McCain, to appear more frequently in key markets and to diversify his message by both attacking McCain and promoting his own personal story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With national and state polls showing him building a broader lead over McCain, Obama has switched to a more positive pitch. Last week, only 34 percent of his ads attacked McCain directly while virtually all of McCain's ads attacked Obama, according to a study by the Wisconsin Advertising Project at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Obama's most recent ads came as Sarah Palin, McCain's running mate, made an issue of Obama's connections to 1960s radical Bill Ayers and argued that Obama &quot;is not a man who sees America like you and I see America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad bespeaks Americana. In it, Obama recalls being a child, sitting on his grandfather's shoulders and waving an American flag as they watched astronauts return from a splashdown. &quot;And my grandfather would say, 'Boy, Americans, we can do anything when we put our minds to it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad offers a direct response to Palin. But it also illustrates Obama's continuing need as an African-American to reassure voters about his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boosted by an economy in crisis and a saturation of advertising, Obama has built up his margins over McCain in Democratic-leaning battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania and Michigan. He has tilted Republican-leaning states such as Colorado and New Mexico toward his side. And he has created contests in such reliably Republican states as Indiana, Virginia and North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, outside groups have weighed in on both sides. VoteVets.org, a group critical of Bush war policies, on Wednesday began spending $350,000 on ads in Virginia criticizing McCain for opposing full college scholarships for those who serve three years in the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health Care for America Now, a coalition that includes unions and patient advocates, is airing an ad in Ohio and on national cable criticizing McCain's health care plan, echoing a similar message in an Obama&nbsp;ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By now, McCain's allies had hoped the Arizona senator would have established his dominance in states won by President Bush in 2000 and 2004 and would have focused on winning two of the three key Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain stopped advertising in Michigan, Obama leads in Pennsylvania and he has the edge in Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Money doesn't always mean victory, but it means that you have more options to cover more of the battlefield,&quot; Republican strategist Terry Holt said. &quot;We're going to have to win with less.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less is right. Obama is outspending McCain in practically every one of the 14 states the two camps are contesting. One exception is Iowa, where McCain spent more than Obama even though Obama has been sitting on a comfortable lead in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest discrepancy exists in North Carolina, where Obama spent eight times more than McCain on ads, according to the Wisconsin Advertising Project and TNS Media Intelligence/CMAG, which tracks political ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's spending advantage in North Carolina might reflect the McCain campaign's reluctance to devote resources to a state that might ultimately follow precedent and vote Republican anyway. But polls in the state show Obama closing the gap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Obama's ability to spend is restrained only by his ability to raise money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is the first major party candidate to decline public financing in the general election, leaving him free to spend as much as he can raise. McCain, on the other hand, is limited to spending only the $84 million in public funds he accepted to cover all his costs in September and October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RNC is helping with its own resources. It raised a record $66 million in September. Obama has not disclosed his September finances; he doesn't have to until Oct. 20, when financial reports are due to the Federal Election Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even with their combined resources, McCain and the RNC trailed Obama in ad spending last week by more than $6 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is a message imbalance that you just can't overcome,&quot; said Evan Tracey, head of TNS/CMAG. &quot;That's like one side of the stadium yelling, 'Tastes Great!' and the other side, you can't hear them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAYTON, Ohio - Democrat Barack Obama told a campaign audience Thursday that Republican John McCain's mortgage buyout plan would cost taxpayers billions of dollars and reward bad behavior by lenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Dayton as he started a two-day bus tour of hotly contested Ohio, Obama said McCain's plan would force the government to absorb the full cost of renegotiating mortgages to prevent borrowers from losing their homes. Lenders should share some of the costs, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic presidential candidate's campaign also criticized McCain's mortgage plan in a new 30-second ad to air nationally on cable TV, a relatively inexpensive way of drawing media attention to an issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates are competing hard for Ohio's 20 electoral votes which were pivotal in President Bush's victory four years ago. Obama plans five Ohio rallies Thursday and Friday, and will return next week to Toledo to prepare for Wednesday's debate on Long Island, N.Y.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama took another jab at McCain, whose family owns several houses, when he renewed his call to change bankruptcy laws to help hard-pressed borrowers keep their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now, the law lets bankruptcy judges write down your mortgage if you own six or seven homes,&quot; he said, &quot;but not if you have only one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That might help Sen. McCain sleep easier at night, but it won't do anything for folks like you,&quot; Obama told thousands at a baseball stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said McCain's mortgage plan &quot;punishes taxpayers, rewards banks, and won't solve our housing crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it would &quot;guarantee that American taxpayers lose by handing over $300 billion to underwrite the kind of greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street that got us into this mess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign, meanwhile, has changed its mortgage plan. When the campaign distributed its description of the plan, it said the government would buy failed mortgages at discounted rates. Conservatives had pushed for that language because many of the homes are not worth the amount mortgaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Wednesday, the campaign deleted that line, which would mean the government would pay the full value of the mortgage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said the policy didn't change, but an edit was made to remove &quot;excess and confusing language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move would make the plan more costly than the $300 million initially cited to pay additional funds to financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has said his plan is expensive but necessary to get thousands of bad mortgages off the books and to stop the fall in home values and credit availability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds said the plan represents &quot;no new expense to the taxpayer, but simply refocuses priorities to more directly assist the homeowners who are hurting instead of greed on Wall Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said the government should use some of the $700 billion in the newly enacted financial rescue plan to buy up troubled mortgages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we need to do it in a responsible way,&quot; he said. The government should not overpay for the mortgages, he said, or reward &quot;the very lenders whose recklessness helped cause this crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxpayers should be assured &quot;a share of the benefits when our housing market recovers,&quot; he said, and the government should crack down &quot;predatory lenders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying McCain has offered widely different economic proposals lately, Obama added, &quot;I don't think we can afford that kind of erratic and uncertain leadership in these uncertain times.&quot; Some Republicans say the word &quot;erratic&quot; is meant to raise doubts about McCain's age, 72.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign criticized McCain's mortgage plan Wednesday, but Thursday marked the first time Obama addressed it himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new Obama campaign TV ad says McCain &quot;would shift the burden from lenders to taxpayers, guaranteeing a loss of taxpayer money&quot; and rewarding lenders &quot;that caused the crisis in the first place.&quot; Speaking to about 8,000 people under sunny skies, Obama veered occasionally from his prepared text to make lighthearted asides. Stock values have dropped so sharply, he said, that many people's retirement accounts are now &quot;101(k)s&quot; instead of 401(k)s, the name derived from a section of the tax code.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How bad has Pennsylvania business slowed?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked Joseph M. Harenza, who ought to know, since he bosses 30 CPAs, financiers, ex-Wall Streeters, and veterans of the vanished Philadelphia banks at investment bank </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Griffin Financial Group L.L.C.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and doubles as chairman of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Stevens &amp; Lee P.C.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Reading corporate law </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">firm.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffin helps buy, sell and finance local banks, chain stores, factories, insurers. Places such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Boscov's, Harleysville National, the Harrisburg Senators, the Reading Eagle, East Penn Manufacturing Co.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the firm's June investment meeting, there were 12 deals listed as &quot;probable&quot; to &quot;close&quot; in the near future, says Griffin chairman emeritus </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">William A. Frack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By September, there were just &quot;three or four&quot; deals ranked probable, Frack said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Midmarket corporate financings &quot;aren't getting </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">done,&quot; said Harenza. The local midmarket banks, &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">PNC, M&amp;T, National Penn, Susquehanna, Wilmington Trust, WSFS,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> they're not stressed. They don't have the liquidity problems,&quot; said Harenza. &quot;But in the past few weeks, everyone has gotten scared and shut off the spigot.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It'll help when troubled </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Wachovia Corp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the region's biggest bank, gets settled in with its next owner. Frack has favored </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Wells Fargo &amp; Co. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">over rival suitor </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Citigroup Inc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We're already in Citi's market area; they're based in New York. We'd be just another small spot for them,&quot; Frack said. &quot;Wells Fargo would be better for the city. They'd have to make a new geographic commitment to be here.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they are no substitutes for the Philadelphia-focused lenders that used to line Broad Street, Harenza added. &quot;We don't really have a hometown bank anymore. I can't tell you how much that hurts the city.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What'll it take to get business growing again? &quot;Everyone's trying to predict the bottom of the market,&quot; Harenza said. Once that happens, &quot;there will be a great opportunity to take lending relationships from the big guys.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Especially since so many of the big guys - Wachovia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">- won't be around anymore. Meanwhile, &quot;it's a great time to buy distressed assets,&quot; if you can raise the cash. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business likes Obama Voting with their wallets, self-described business owners, chief executive officers, and other bosses in the Philadelphia area chose Democrat </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Barack Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over Republican </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">John McCain</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by a 60-40 ratio, according to a review of federal election finance records by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The Inquirer's Dylan Purcell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Searching on keywords </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">chief executive</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">owner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Purcell found 188 local bosses who had given at least $500 each to the Obama-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Biden</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ticket by August, compared with just 127 who have made similar-size donations to McCain-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Palin</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The group's dollar donations were $270,000 for Obama to $174,000 for McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some split their bets. Marketer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Norman Cohn</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, banker </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Harry Madonna </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">and online retailer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Michael G. Rubin</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gave money to both Obama and McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Comcast </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">executives also covered both sides, with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">David L. Cohen,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who's holding an Obama fund- raiser at his home this weekend, giving $2,300 to McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Words that hurt  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats in the U.S. Senate know how to kick a fragile industry when it's down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> Charles Schumer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (D., N.Y.) sparked an old-fashioned depositors' panic by denouncing troubled subprime-lender </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">IndyMac Bank</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, forcing regulators to mount a costly rescue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then last week, Senate Majority Leader </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Harry Reid </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">(D., Nev.) said in a news conference that there was &quot;a major insurance company - one with a name that everyone knows - that's on the verge of going bankrupt.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wouldn't say who. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">MetLife</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had to issue a statement: We don't know what Reid's talking about. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hartford Financial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">lost more than half its value, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">CreditSights Inc. analyst Robert Haines </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">wrote in a note to clients. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hartford dropped again Monday, after it cut its dividend, warned of investment losses, and accepted $2.5 billion in new capital from Germany's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Allianz</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Lincoln National Corp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, of Philadelphia, dropped 14 percent - following Hartford's lead, said analysts </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Jeffrey Schuman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ryan Krueger </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Hartford, Lincoln may have to raise more equity, the analysts wrote. Third-quarter earnings for dozens of financial companies are due out in the next few weeks. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OH, HOW they sang in Music City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama and John McCain, in Nashville for their second debate, last night crooned out empathy for economically fearful voters and offered plans and promises to fix what ails the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand your frustration,&quot; said Obama, &quot;You need somebody working for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said, &quot;It's our job to fix the problem,&quot; and &quot;I have been a consistent reformer.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama hit his themes of &quot;fundamental change&quot; and of tying McCain to the unproductive policies of President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain wrapped himself in his &quot;maverick&quot; mantle (without ever saying the word) and pledged to usher in a new Washington of less government and no new taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's not raise anybody's taxes, my friends,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These tunes played out as the nation faces record deficits, diving markets (the Dow dropped 1,400 points in just the last five trading days) and overall economic chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How were the lyrics received?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, since the debate was mostly mild and mostly substantive, I'm betting it has mostly no impact on the race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a town-hall-meeting format (projected to favor McCain; I don't think it did) hosted by NBC's Tom Brokaw with questions from 80 undecided voters seated around the candidates and e-mailed questions selected by Brokaw from voters across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It came as the race is at its (so far) ugliest: A new Obama&nbsp;ad accuses McCain of &quot;smears&quot;; a new McCain&nbsp;ad accuses Obama of lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respected Annenberg Political Fact Check says &quot;sadly&quot; both are right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there was little ugliness last night, largely, I suppose, because the format didn't allow for a dogfight and because, I suppose, McCain opted not to go postal in prime time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, I doubt the trend of the contest changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This debate comes as McCain claws to stay in a race that poll after poll says is slipping away from him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been ever since McCain last month asserted the &quot;fundamentals of our economy are strong&quot; - something that didn't play well coming from someone who has trouble recalling how many houses he owns - just nine days before he &quot;suspended&quot; his campaign to deal with &quot;an historic crisis&quot; in our economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently voters aren't all that drawn to political schizophrenia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gallup's daily tracking puts Obama up 9 percentage points, 51-42, the largest spread since Gallup started measuring Obama/McCain match-ups back in March and the first time either candidate has exceeded 50 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, McCain slapped at Obama last night - for wanting to raise taxes, for voting for taxes, for having &quot;the most liberal, big-spending record&quot; in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he threw no real punches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was steady, at ease and smooth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain accused Obama of seeking to hike taxes on small business, which Obama denied, suggesting, &quot;The Straight Talk Express lost a wheel on that one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And McCain did a few odd things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by Brokaw whom he'd consider for his Treasury secretary, he said, &quot;Not you, Tom.&quot; I suppose a joke. It fell flat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called, at different times, Ronald Reagan and Teddy Roosevelt &quot;my hero.&quot; He once forgot to use his hand-held microphone. And he, inexplicably, referred to Obama as &quot;that one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates paced the stage, speaking directly with citizen questioners and occasionally each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debate rules called for no reaction shots (though there were a few at a distance), I assume recalling George H.W. Bush looking at his watch, apparently bored, as H. Ross Perot twanged on about something or other in a '92 town-hall debate involving Bush, Perot and Bill Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain maybe should have looked at his watch. He'd have seen his time is running out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third and final debate is next Wednesday night at Hofstra University, in New York. If he wants to change the course of this campaign, McCain better start singing a different tune. *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- In a rare coordinated move, the Federal Reserve and other major central banks from around the world slashed interest rates Wednesday to prevent a mushrooming financial crisis from becoming a global economic meltdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overseas markets tumbled on worries that the move wouldn't immediately help ease the pain from the financial crisis. U.S. share prices seesawed, with some investors buying a few beaten down shares, but most still gloomy about the economy's prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed reduced its key rate from 2 percent to 1.5 percent. In Europe, which also has been hard hit by the financial crisis, the Bank of England cut its rate by half a point to 4.5 percent and the European Central Bank sliced its rate by half a point to 3.75 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central banks of China, Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland also cut rates. The Bank of Japan said it strongly supported the actions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The recent intensification of the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks to growth,&quot; the Fed said in explaining the coordinated action, the latest in a series of bold moves meant to pry open tight lending and revive the global economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dow Jones industrials, already down 875 points this week, rose 13 points in afternoon trading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed's action will reduce borrowing costs almost immediately for U.S. bank customers whose home equity and other floating-rate loans are tied to the prime interest rate. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other banks cut their prime rate by half a point to 4.5 percent after the Fed announcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesman Tony Fratto welcomed the cooperation among the Fed and other countries' central banks to battle the crisis. &quot;It's important and helpful that central banks are working in a coordinated way to deal with stress in the financial system,&quot; Fratto said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's presidential contenders also embraced the action. &quot;This is a global crisis that requires a global solution,&quot; said Democrat Barack Obama. Republican rival John McCain hoped it would contain the &quot;financial crisis spreading across the globe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts were skeptical that the coordinated rate reductions would do much to turn things around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At first blush, while this is a big step, it is unlikely to prove sufficient to stem the rot. Additional rate cuts are likely and further measures to inject liquidity and re-capitalize banks are needed,&quot; said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at the investment firm Brown Brothers Harriman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rate cuts came against a backdrop of increasing anxiety in global financial markets. Investors have been fleeing shares on worries that neither the Fed, nor other central banks, could move fast enough to stop the rising turmoil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European indexes fell. In Britain, the FTSE-100 fell 5.2 percent, Germany's DAX dropped 5.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 dropped 6.3 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 9.38 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng tumbled 8.17 percent hours before the rate cuts were announced; their declines showed the extent of the worldwide gloom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worldwide gloom follows a sell-off in U.S. markets late Tuesday, where major stock indexes slid 5 percent. The rout brought the Dow Jones industrials' losses to more than 875 points in two days, and its close was the lowest close in five years. The blue chip index is now around 33 percent below its record close of 14,164.53 a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed's action Wednesday was the latest in a long series of moves over the last several weeks that the central bank has taken in coordination with other federal agencies, Congress and the White House to shore up a financial industry stung by bad loans, mounting losses and - in many cases - collapse. President Bush signed a $700 billion financial bailout bill into law on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed's action reversed its current policy on interest rates, which had been to hold them steady out of concern that more cuts would fuel inflation. Since Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues put a stop to interest-rate cuts in June, economic and financial conditions have deteriorated significantly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pace of economic activity has slowed markedly in recent months,&quot; the Fed said. &quot;Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although inflation has been high, the Fed believes the recent drop in energy prices and the weaker prospects for economic activity have reduced this threat to the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The orchestrated rate reductions had a mixed impact on stressed credit markets. Rates dipped on some commercial paper, a crucial short-term financing mechanism that many businesses rely on to bankroll day-to-day operations. The important &quot;Libor&quot; rate, which affects a vast array of loans, remained high, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed also reduced its emergency lending rate to banks by half a percentage point to 1.75 percent. Given the intense credit crisis, banks have been ramping up their borrowing from the Fed's emergency &quot;discount&quot; window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that the Fed felt it couldn't wait until its regularly scheduled meeting on Oct. 28-29, underscored the urgency of the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the goals of the coordinated rate cuts is to spur nervous consumers and businesses to spend more freely again. They clamped down as housing, credit and financial problems intensified last month, throwing Wall Street into chaos. Many believe the United States is on the brink of, or already in, its first recession since 2001, one that could quickly spread to other countries around the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can take months before rate cuts work their way through the financial system, however, and the economy has pressing problems now. Major U.S. retailers turned in dismal reports of third quarter sales, a dire omen for the all-important holiday shopping season. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed's last rate cut was in late April, capping one of the most aggressive rate-cutting campaigns in decades as it scrambled to shore up the faltering economy. After that, the Fed moved to the sidelines, holding rates steady as zooming food and energy prices during that period threatened to ignite inflation. In the past few months, energy prices have retreated from record highs reached in mid-July, giving the Fed more leeway to drop rates again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its last meeting in September, the Fed struck a more dire tone about the economy, hinting that a rate reduction once again could be in the offing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even with the unprecedented $700 billion financial bailout plan, the failing economy and the jobs market probably will get worse. Many believe the economy will jolt into reverse later this year - if it hasn't already- and will stay sickly well into next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most crucial pillars of the economy - the jobs market - has cracked, and wage growth is slowing. This means that consumers will be even more hard-pressed to spend in the fashion that helps grow the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasingly skittish employers slashed payrolls by 159,000 in September, the most in more than five years. A staggering 760,000 jobs have disappeared so far this year. The unemployment rate is 6.1 percent, up sharply from 4.7 percent a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. unemployment rate could hit 7 or 7.5 percent by late 2009. If that happens, it would mark the highest rate of joblessness since the months immediately following the 1990-91 recession. Some economists say the jobless rate could rise even more before the situation starts to get better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mounting job losses, shrinking paychecks, shriveling nest eggs and rising foreclosures all have weighed heavily on American voters, who will be electing a new president in about four weeks. The economy is their No. 1 concern, polls have shown.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DETROIT - United Auto Workers President Ron Gettelfinger said the union would run $3 million worth of advertising criticizing Republican presidential candidate John McCain and his economic policies in four key states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gettelfinger said the television, radio and Internet ad campaign targeted four industrial states: Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania. They feature UAW members and the union's argument that working families can't afford McCain. Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana are competitive states; the McCain campaign said last week it was abandoning efforts to win in Michigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gettelfinger, who played the TV ads for reporters Tuesday afternoon at UAW headquarters in Detroit, said they feature &quot;workers talking to workers about issues&quot; that concern them, such as health care and policies that have cost millions of U.S. manufacturing jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We strategically placed these ads where we think they can and will make a difference,&quot; Gettelfinger said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UAW says more than half of its 1 million active and retired members live in those four states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign regional spokeswoman Sarah Lenti said in an e-mail Tuesday afternoon that working families need McCain's policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;UAW's attacks are about partisan politics, not a concern for working families,&quot; she wrote. &quot;John McCain's Jobs for America program will grow America's economy while keeping our taxes low.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UAW has endorsed McCain's Democratic opponent, Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad campaign is paid for by the UAW Voluntary Community Action Program, which is funded by voluntary donations by members and families. Union officials said they did not have breakout figures for the costs associated with the TV and radio ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gettelfinger last month criticized McCain for first saying he bought his daughter a Toyota Prius, then saying she bought it. Lenti had said McCain wants to lead on new ways to power transportation and the UAW should lay off his daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gettelfinger said it's important for the union to maintain advertising in Michigan, where the McCain campaign late last week pulled its staff and advertising. Some groups that favor McCain have said they plan to run their own ads to force Obama to spend resources in Michigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not letting our guard down in any way in Michigan,&quot; Gettelfinger said. &quot;We do not believe he's actually pulled out of Michigan. ... We're going to stay on guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gettelfinger was joined at the news conference by UAW members Joel Blatchford, 57, and Nicole Lowe, 36, who appeared in the ads. Both said they were interviewed by the people who produced the ads and the scripts included their input and represented their views. Each ended their ads with the phrase, &quot;We can't afford John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blatchford, who works at General Motors Corp.'s vehicle manufacturing facility in Lake Orion, said he's also talking to workers throughout his plant. He said he tells them that Obama has the will to change policies and modify trade agreements that have sent so many jobs overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't expect it to happen overnight, but we can get it turned around,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, U.S. Rep Joe Pitts criticized comments Sen. Barack Obama made last August about U.S. troops in Afghanistan as the McCain campaign started running an ad highlighting Obama's statements. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a press conference at Lancaster County GOP headquarters Monday afternoon, Pitts said Obama's August 2007 comments amounted to an accusation of war crimes that were demoralizing to U.S. troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is really difficult to imagine a commander-in-chief who would toss out a reckless accusation in order to secure support from the radical wing of the Democratic party,&quot; Pitts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the town hall meeting in New Hampshire, Obama said about Afghanistan: &quot;We've got to get the job done and that requires us to have enough troops so that we're not just air-raiding villages and killing civilians, which is causing enormous pressure over there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pitts said Monday that such comments call into question Obama's fitness to be president, adding that Illinois senator has not retracted what he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By continuing to stand by his reckless accusation, Barack Obama has confirmed every misgiving Americans have ever had toward him,&quot; Pitts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the McCain campaign released a new ad taking aim at Obama for what he said about Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using a snippet of the town hall meeting, the McCain&nbsp;ad shows Obama saying that U.S. troops in Afghanistan are &quot;just air-raiding villages and killing civilians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ryan Aument, Lancaster County Clerk of Courts and an Iraq war veteran, joined Pitts at the Monday afternoon press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aument said U.S. troops take great great risks to avoid civilian casualties, calling Obama's statement &quot;irresponsible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is clear to me that Sen. Obama has neither an understanding of this war in which we are engaged nor the judgment to serve as president of the United States,&quot; Aument said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Obama's comments last August, the Associated Press looked into the matter and concluded that &quot;Western forces (in Afghanistan) have been killing civilians at a faster rate than the insurgents have been killing civilians.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was foretold in ancient Gnostic scrolls found at Qumran. It was foreseen by history's most famous supermarket tabloid reporter, Nostradamus: The universe will either die, or, like, become so much funner on Nov. 23, the day child megastar </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Miley Cyrus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> turns 16. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fact, that day is so momentous that American prophet </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Mickey Mouse</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> couldn't stand to wait and decided to throw his own party. Thus the spectacle Sunday at Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., which hosted a party so ridiculously flamboyant, so frivolous, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Marie Antoinette</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would have been proud. Miley even sang a couple of tunes, as did her pa, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Billy Ray Cyrus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers say 5,000 Miley devotees paid $250 a head for the privilege of crashing the party.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's such a sad situation. She did hurt her Achilles tendon. I don't know if she tore it or ruptured it,&quot; Brooke said on the air. &quot;She's out of the competition. Just like that, it's over for her.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NASHVILLE, Tenn. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonight, Arizona Sen. John McCain finally gets his town hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a year ago, when his all-but-broke campaign was laying off staffers across the country, the Republican senator vowed to revive it with town hall appearances up and down the state of New Hampshire. To general surprise, his prediction proved accurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, with his general election campaign lagging in key state polls, Mr. McCain gets another chance to revive his campaign tonight in Nashville, as he confronts Illinois Sen. Barack Obama face to face in the format the Republican likes best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, in fact, once proposed that the two candidates face each other as many as 10 times in town hall debates. But as economic uncertainty preoccupies voters and helps push them toward his Democratic rival, the odds facing Mr. McCain's challenge are again daunting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rivals' Tennessee encounter comes after days in which both campaigns have taken on harsher, more personal tones, in person and on the airwaves. Recognizing that the economy is an issue that plays to Mr. Obama's strengths, the Republican campaign has tried to shift the campaign focus to spotlight the Democrat personally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a rally yesterday in Albuquerque, N.M., Mr. McCain raised pointed questions about his opponent's character and truthfulness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rather than answer his critics, Senator Obama will try to distract you from noticing that he never answers the serious and legitimate questions he has been asked,&quot; Mr. McCain said. &quot;But let me reply in the plainest terms I know: I don't need lessons about telling the truth to American people. And were I ever to need any improvement in that regard, I probably wouldn't seek advice from a Chicago politician. Senator Obama has accused me of opposing regulation to avert this crisis. I guess he believes if a lie is big enough, and repeated often enough, it will be believed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's criticism of the Democrat continued as he scored Mr. Obama for having called the move to promote sub-prime mortgages &quot;a good idea&quot; in a speech last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama camp responded that the Republican had taken that quote out of context, pointing out that, in the speech, the Democrat had said the riskier loans had started out as a good idea, but one that was then subverted by reckless business practices and an absence of regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP nominee's tough words were a sequel to similarly sharp attacks from his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Yesterday and over the weekend, she reminded voters of the Illinois Democrat's past associations with William Ayers, a Chicago educator who is a former member of the Weather Underground. And, responding to a question in an interview with William Kristol, a New York Times columnist, Ms. Palin agreed that Mr. Obama's links to his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, should also be open to campaign scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not to be left behind in this ad hominem arms race, the Obama campaign responded with an assault on Mr. McCain's past. The campaign directed its supporters to an Internet video that disinterred questions about the Arizona senator's role 17 years ago as one of the Keating Five, a congressional scandal during the nation's savings-and-loan industry financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain was among five senators investigated by a Senate ethics panel over charges that they had improperly pressured regulators to go easy on the S&amp;L operations of Charles Keating, then a close associate of Mr. McCain. In contrast to three of his colleagues, the panel exonerated Mr. McCain of wrongdoing, but said he had exercised poor judgment in his contacts with regulators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While his campaign joined in the acrimonious back-and-forth, Mr. Obama, campaigning in North Carolina, called his opponents' attacks an effort to distract voters from the state of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot imagine anything more important to talk about than the economic crisis,&quot; he said, &quot;and the notion that we'd want to brush that aside and engage in the usual political shenanigans and scare tactics that have come to characterize too many political campaigns, I think is not what the American people are looking for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the Republican campaign released a new commercial calling Mr. Obama &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;dishonorable&quot; because of a statement in which he had questioned U.S. tactics in Afghanistan. And, taking a page from the traditional GOP playbook, the Democrat's commercials assailed Mr. McCain as a tax raiser because of an element in his health plan that would remove the tax preference for employer-paid health benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the rhetoric was harsh on both sides on the eve of the second of the presidential candidates' three debates, it was unclear how much would impress voters on a day when the news was dominated by new hammer blows to world credit markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates' first debate occurred in the foreground of another chapter of the economic maelstrom -- the struggle to get Congress to ratify a rescue package for Wall Street. Surveys found that more voters thought the Democrat had won the debate. Mr. Obama's poll numbers have steadily climbed in the days since, whether because of a steady performance in that debate or because of the continuing preoccupation with an issue that is ripe for Democratic criticism in the eighth year of Republican administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pressure on Mr. McCain to refocus the race is clear. In a conference call with reporters last week -- on the same day the GOP camp acknowledged that it was effectively ceding one battleground state, Michigan, to the Democrats -- a McCain strategist argued that the campaign was competitive enough in other battlegrounds to put their man in the neighborhood of 260 electoral votes, just short of the 270 needed for election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are currently competing aggressively in Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Nevada, New Hampshire and New Mexico,&quot; McCain strategist Greg Strimple said. &quot;The combination of any of those states -- we have to get 10 more electoral votes in order to be successful, and have Mr. McCain as the next president of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that is a precarious strategy for the Republican. Mr. McCain has described himself as a gambler, and his hopes of prevailing next month amount to a multi-card draw to an inside straight. Or, to borrow a metaphor from a sport favored by Mr. Obama, Mr. McCain -- with no margin for error -- must run the electoral table described by his aide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls continue to suggest that will not be easy. In Minnesota -- the GOP convention's site and a state that had been consistently close -- one new survey, from the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, shows Mr. Obama leading by a landslide, 55 percent to 37 percent, although another, by SurveyUSA, depicted the state's race as a dead heat. In Ohio, a state whose loss would be fatal to Mr. McCain's chances, several new polls have also showed Mr. Obama moving into a lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New Hampshire, a state that had been considered a toss-up, where lots of independent voters have voted for Mr. McCain in his two primary victories, a New Hampshire Institute of Politics poll put Mr. Obama's lead at 49 percent to 37 percent. New polls in two traditionally Republican states, North Carolina and Virginia, also showed Mr. Obama moving into significant leads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in Pennsylvania, a tracking poll conducted for the Allentown Call by Muhlenberg College showed Mr. Obama ahead, 49 percent to 38 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All those circumstances combine to suggest that Mr. McCain will be under pressure to sustain his aggressive focus on his foe in hopes of shaking up the dynamics of their competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But neither candidate will be in complete control of today's encounter at Nashville's Belmont University, in which questions will come from supposedly undecided voters selected by the bipartisan debate organizers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After trying to persuade them, and the television audience beyond, Mr. McCain will switch his sights to Pennsylvania's voters tomorrow, when he and his running mate travel to a rally at Bethlehem's Lehigh University.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce McGeary spent 18 years believing he was unable to participate in the democracy for which he fought. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That changed Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Marine, who served as a forward observer in during the Vietnam War until 1969, re-activated his voter registration card on the last day to register for the Nov. 4 election. McGeary, 60, was convicted of making false statements on a medical form and spent a year in jail until his release in 1991.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he was incarcerated, he was told he couldn't vote any more. State law says otherwise. McGeary of McKees Rocks found out about the law Sunday night from a radio commercial he heard during the Steelers game.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGeary said he plans to cast his first vote since 1990 for Republican John McCain. He cited McCain's time as a prisoner of war as one reason for his vote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He did his time over there in a lot worse conditions than I did,&quot; McGeary said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections departments around the state yesterday dealt with one last flood of registration forms from the nearly year-long deluge of voter drives. Allegheny County officials expect 40,000 more voters to register for the general election than did for April's primary, said Mark Wolosik, manager of the elections division. Many are students, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That doesn't eclipse the record, though. About 100,000 voters registered between the primary and general election in 1994, Wolosik said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Barack Obama has inspired his share of people signing up. Brian Smoot, a junior at Duquesne University and running back for the school's football team, said he has been meaning to register for three years and finally got around to it yesterday, around lunchtime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I haven't been into politics until recently. I read (Obama's) book. I called up a couple of his speeches,&quot; said Smoot, 21. &quot;I think he's different. He seems genuine.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter registration has soared in Pennsylvania, even after the seven-week Democratic primary during which Obama and former rival Hillary Clinton worked feverishly to register people. More than 334,000 people have registered since the April election, according to the Pennsylvania Department of State. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both presidential campaigns and a mix of other groups scrambled during the weekend to sign up voters and ensure existing voters were ready to turn out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actors Rachael Leigh Cook and Mehcad Brooks rallied Obama supporters for a final registration drive at the campaign's office in Moon, one of more than a dozen similar events around the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thanks to three months of nonstop voter registration, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 1.1 million in Pennsylvania,&quot; Obama campaign spokesman Benjamin Freed said in a statement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential campaign of Republican John McCain hosted &quot;Super Saturday&quot; events to drum up voter registration efforts and had daughter Meghan McCain traveling to Pennsylvania to register voters. Republicans held a voter registration drive at Mellon Arena during the weekend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are encouraged by the growing number of independents, Democrats and Republicans who are drawn to John McCain's record of putting politics aside to get things done for the American people,&quot; campaign spokesman Peter Feldman said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LaToia Bryant, 22, a second-year medical student at the University of Pittsburgh, said the only thing she has decided about this race is that she wants to be part of it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though she has voted by absentee ballot in her native Maryland since she moved to Oakland, she didn't want to take a chance on mailing her vote in. Bryant registered Downtown yesterday morning.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just think it's more exciting to actually go into the booth to vote,&quot; Bryant said. She hasn't decided who she'll vote for, but said she has been a voter since she turned 18. &quot;Just because I know so many people have sacrificed for this.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OMAHA, Neb. -- With just four weeks until the election, John McCain is facing an increasingly steep path to the presidency, as the economic crisis and Barack Obama's financial edge tilt the political landscape to the Democrat's advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After two of the closest presidential races, the candidates are battling for a dwindling number of states as they scavenge for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. Both sides say the contest is competitive; the first of two remaining debates takes place Tuesday in Nashville, Tenn. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, however, clearly faces the tougher road. After pulling out of Michigan, a Democratic-leaning state he hoped to snatch away, the Republican nominee faces an exceedingly slim margin for error as he defends a number of must-win states. Chief among them are Ohio and Florida, the states that decided the past two presidential elections. Polls show they are once again very close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, by contrast, has expanded the competition to several states that Republicans usually count on, including Virginia, Colorado, Nevada, Indiana and North Carolina. Obama even hopes to pick off an electoral vote here in Nebraska, a Republican stronghold that allows its five electoral votes to be split, awarding three of them by congressional district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's always tough for Democrats,&quot; said Steve Achelpohl, the Nebraska party chairman. &quot;But given the general unhappiness with the state of the country, he's got a decent chance. So why not try?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is targeting Omaha and its surrounding area, an urban patchwork in this mostly rural state, which has a growing young population and a number of black and Hispanic residents. The Illinois senator already has a running start, having advertised for months as a way to reach voters just across the river in Iowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans scoff at the attempt. In 50 years of presidential elections Nebraska is second only to Utah in support for the GOP ticket. (The state has voted 61.1 percent Republican to Utah's 61.6 percent, according to the Almanac of American Politics.) All six statewide offices are held by Republicans, the GOP controls the unicameral legislature and all five members of Congress are Republican. The state has not sent a Democrat to the House in 16 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One thing the Obama campaign obviously has is a big pile of money,&quot; said Mark Quandahl, chairman of the Nebraska GOP. &quot;When a campaign is as lavishly funded as the Obama campaign, they're obviously going to have to find places to spend money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National polls give Obama a small but steady lead over McCain, built as the financial crisis has consumed the country. But the race for president is actually a series of contests fought state-by-state or, in the case of Nebraska and Maine, congressional district-by-congressional-district. (Most states are winner-take-all. After quitting Michigan, McCain strategists said they would redeploy forces to Maine, the other state that apportions its electoral votes, to fight for one its four electors.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attempt to split off a vote illustrates the lengths the candidates are going to win an Electoral College majority, mindful of the exceedingly close outcome in 2000 and 2004. &quot;If you win an electoral vote from the other side, that's a swing of two votes,&quot; said Robert Hardaway, a University of Denver expert on the Electoral College. &quot;In a close race, that could make the difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strategists for the two sides are sifting daily reams of data -- opinion polls, voter registration numbers, TV ad logs -- to decide how to spend their money and where to schedule the presidential hopefuls and their running mates. As they plot their maps, each candidate starts with the 2004 results. If nothing changed and McCain won every state President Bush carried, the Arizona senator would have 286 electoral votes and keep the White House in Republican hands for a third consecutive term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But replicating Bush's success is a tall order for McCain, given the unpopularity of the incumbent and the economic upheaval that, surveys indicate, is hurting Republicans more than Democrats. Polls show voters place more trust in Obama when it comes to handling the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also have McCain trailing or tied with Obama in a half dozen states Bush won in 2004: Ohio, Florida, Nevada, Virginia, North Carolina and Colorado. McCain is tied or only slightly ahead of Obama in two other Bush states, Missouri and Indiana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain could afford to lose a few Bush states -- Iowa and New Mexico seem most likely -- if he wins some that Democrats carried in 2004. Topping his list is Pennsylvania, which has 21 electoral votes and might be the closest thing to a must-win for Obama. Polls show the race there is close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strategists also talk up McCain's prospects in Minnesota, Wisconsin and New Hampshire; the latter two are highly competitive. But giving up on Michigan and its 17 electoral votes was a major concession; it was the second-largest of the 2004 states McCain hoped to convert and one the Obama camp was most worried about keeping. Even now, the Obama campaign is maintaining its Michigan operation and continuing TV ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strategists for McCain say Obama has fared well in places such as North Carolina and Indiana because the Democrat has been running largely unopposed. Once Republicans start investing money and resources those states &quot;will snap back aggressively in our favor,&quot; said Greg Strimple, a McCain adviser who also expressed confidence that Florida, a perennial target of both parties, will land in the GOP column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But any money spent on states McCain should take for granted is money he cannot spend on states he hopes to win from Obama. While McCain is receiving a financial boost from the richly funded Republican National Committee, his own campaign spending is capped at $84 million. Obama, who chose not to accept federal financing, can raise and spend unlimited sums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you look at the radio, who's playing offense and who's playing defense, McCain's playing offense in only four states,&quot; said David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager. &quot;We're playing offense in 11 or 12 states, including states McCain never thought he'd have to defend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With so many contests so close, several plausible outcomes could yield a 269-269 Electoral College tie, which would pitch the election into the House of Representatives. &quot;It's never happened,&quot; said the University of Denver's Hardaway, who figured the chances are extremely unlikely. &quot;But that's not to say it couldn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Tuesday night's presidential debate offers Republican John McCain one of his last best chances to stop Democrat Barack Obama's recent surge in the race and turn it in his favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate's town hall format is McCain's favorite style of campaigning. He asked Obama to appear with him in a series of town hall debates this past summer, but Obama wouldn't take him up on the challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That leaves Tuesday night's debate four weeks before Election Day as the only joint town hall that the two are scheduled to hold. The event at Belmont University in Nashville, Tenn., is being moderated by NBC's Tom Brokaw and will include questions on both foreign and domestic policy raised by the audience and voters participating through the Internet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the candidates are likely to go after each other on character issues, which McCain's team has forcefully re-injected into the campaign since the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin has raised Obama's ties to 1960s-era radical William Ayers and to the Democrat's former pastor, the incendiary Rev. Jeremiah Wright. In New Mexico on Monday, McCain himself asked, &quot;Who is the real Sen. Obama?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama retorted in North Carolina that McCain was engaging &quot;in the usual political shenanigans and smear tactics&quot; to distract from economic issues, even as his campaign rolled out a video recounting McCain's involvement in the 1980s Keating Five savings and loan scandal in which the Senate Ethics Committee criticized his &quot;poor judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newest TV ad from the Obama campaign plays up widespread reports that McCain's focus on the Democrat's past associations is an effort to turn the discussion away from the economy. &quot;As Americans lose their jobs, homes and savings, it's time for a president who'll change the economy, not change the subject,&quot; says the ad released Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The town hall is McCain's signature - one way he built his &quot;Straight Talk&quot; reputation by interacting with voters in the 2000 campaign and then pulled himself out of single digits to win this year's Republican primary. Since he won the nomination, however, the audiences for these events have needed to get tickets and have not been the come-one-come-all events of the primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has used the town hall format sporadically throughout his campaign, but not recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead the Democratic nominee has carefully protected his lead with a highly scripted campaign style ever since an off-the-cuff line blew up into a false controversy four weeks ago. Ever since, he's been exclusively sticking to rallies and speeches with a TelePrompTer almost always feeding him prepared text to read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's last town hall was on Sept. 12 - three days after he went on a riff about how McCain is talking about change when he's really just like President Bush and concluded, &quot;You can put lipstick on a pig.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama hadn't even mentioned McCain running mate Sarah Palin before using the line, but the McCain campaign argued it was a clear reference to her signature line during her nomination acceptance speech the week before, when she said the only difference between hockey moms like her and a pit bull is lipstick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter Obama's intent, the debate dominated a full day of campaign coverage and distracted from Obama's plans to focus the campaign on criticism of McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama went ahead with two more town halls scheduled for the following three days - one the next day in Virginia, where he lashed out at McCain and the media for blowing up his comment, and another two days later in New Hampshire, where a voter drew the spotlight when he rose and demanded to know when Obama would bring more of a fighting spirit against his critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama isn't the only one trying to minimize the chance for an unscripted moment at this critical stage of the campaign. McCain still holds his signature town hall meetings but has limited his interaction with the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign plane is still emblazoned &quot;Straight Talk Express,&quot; but the couch installed at the front doesn't carry reporters for freewheeling conversations like in the early days on his primary campaign bus trips. The town hall debate could be McCain's chance to again to come across to voters as feisty, warm, engaging and quick-witted. Those qualities are harder to show in scripted events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a town hall debate is not the same as a town hall campaign event - McCain will be sharing the stage with Obama, and his every word will be parsed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMoveOn.org Political Action ad plays the partisan blame game with the economic crisis, charging that John McCain's friend and former economic adviser Phil Gramm &quot;stripped safeguards that would have protected us.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim is bogus. Gramm's legislation had broad bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Clinton. Moreover, the bill had nothing to do with causing the crisis, and economists -- not to mention President Clinton -- praise it for having softened the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A McCain-Palin ad, in turn, blames Democrats for the mess. The ad says that the crisis &quot;didn't have to happen,&quot; because legislation McCain cosponsored would have tightened regulations on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, the ad says, Obama &quot;was notably silent&quot; while Democrats killed the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's oversimplified. Republicans, who controlled the Senate at the time, did not bring the bill forward for a vote. And it's unclear how much the legislation would have helped, as McCain signed on just two months before the housing bubble popped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, there's ample blame to go around. Experts have cited everyone from home buyers to Wall Street, mortgage brokers to Alan Greenspan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a partial list of those alleged to be at fault:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---The Federal Reserve, which slashed interest rates after the dot-com bubble burst, making credit cheap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---Home buyers, who took advantage of easy credit to bid up the prices of homes excessively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---Congress, which continues to support a mortgage tax deduction that gives consumers a tax incentive to buy more expensive houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---Real estate agents, most of whom work for the sellers rather than the buyers and who earned higher commissions from selling more expensive homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---The Clinton administration, which pushed for less stringent credit and downpayment requirements for working- and middle-class families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---Mortgage brokers, who offered less-credit-worthy home buyers subprime, adjustable rate loans with low initial payments, but exploding interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, who in 2004, near the peak of the housing bubble, encouraged Americans to take out adjustable rate mortgages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---Wall Street firms, who paid too little attention to the quality of the risky loans that they bundled into Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS), and issued bonds using those securities as collateral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---The Bush administration, which failed to provide needed government oversight of the increasingly dicey mortgage-backed securities market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---An obscure accounting rule called mark-to-market, which can have the paradoxical result of making assets be worth less on paper than they are in reality during times of panic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---Collective delusion, or a belief on the part of all parties that home prices would keep rising forever, no matter how high or how fast they had already gone up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. economy is enormously complicated. Screwing it up takes a great deal of cooperation. Claiming that a single piece of legislation was responsible for (or could have averted) the crisis is just political grandstanding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's allies are warning against the McCain campaign's attempts to smear the Democrat's character may turn out to be a bad idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Obama surrogates said, for example, that his supporters may start reminding voters of Sen. John McCain's ties to Charles Keating, a convicted savings-and-loan owner whose actions two decades ago triggered a Senate ethics investigation that involved McCain as one of the &quot;Keating Five.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warnings came as McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, took on the role of attacker and said that Obama sees America as so imperfect &quot;that he's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country.&quot; She was referring to an early Obama supporter, 1960s radical Bill Ayers, a founder of the Weather Underground whose members were blamed for several bombings when Obama was a child. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin first made the comments to a group of donors in Englewood, Colo. She echoed the line at three separate events Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a man who sees America like you and I see America,&quot; she said. &quot;We see America as a force of good in this world. We see an America of exceptionalism,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has denounced Ayers' radical views and activities. However, Ayers hosted a small gathering for Obama in 1995, early in his political career. Obama and Ayers live in the same Chicago neighborhood and served on a charity board together, but there is no evidence they have &quot;palled around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Obama's not above questioning McCain's character with loaded words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, Obama unveiled a TV ad on the economy that paints McCain as &quot;erratic in a crisis.&quot; Some see that as a reminder of McCain's age, 72.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats were well-synchronized yesterday, using the word &quot;erratic&quot; and Keating's name in nearly-matching sentences across the talk show circuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is going to be a month, I think, of character assassination,&quot; Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., an Obama supporter, said on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, McCain adviser Greg Strimple predicted &quot;a very aggressive last 30 days&quot; of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, too, alluded to harsher tactics in a speech yesterday to thousands of people in Asheville, N.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and his aides, Obama said, &quot;are gambling that he can distract you with smears rather than talk to you about substance. They'd rather try to tear our campaign down than lift this country up. It's what you do when you're out of touch, out of ideas, and running out of time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting the nation's serious economic problems, Obama said: &quot;Yet instead of addressing these crises, Senator McCain's campaign has announced that they plan to turn the page on the discussion about our economy and spend the final weeks of this campaign launching Swiftboat-style attacks on me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a Chicago Democrat and Obama supporter, warned against McCain's strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we are going to go down this road, you know, Barack Obama was eight years old, somehow responsible for Bill Ayers,&quot; he said. &quot;At 58, John McCain was associating with Charles Keating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we really want to talk who is associating with who, we will,&quot; Emanuel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just months into his Senate career, in the late 1980s, McCain made what he has called &quot;the worst mistake of my life.&quot; He participated in two meetings with banking regulators on behalf of Keating, a friend, campaign contributor and S&amp;L financier who was later convicted of securities fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate ethics committee investigated five senators' relationships with Keating. It cited McCain for a lesser role than the others, but faulted his &quot;poor judgment.&quot; * </SPAN></P>

Four Swedish tourists, who clearly had been on a shopping spree in Manhattan, fueled by the still cheap dollar, were trying to cram all their purchases into four suitcases. They had bought a hand-held scale -- one of those you just grip onto the suitcase and lift -- to make sure all their American goodies were not overweight for the flight home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another friend of mine in the ship-supply business in Baltimore, Alan Kotz, told me about a German customer who recently put in double his normal order. When Alan asked him if he was aware of how much he had ordered, the German brushed his question away and laughed: &quot;Alan, never mind, everything for us is half price.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a good thing it is. Even though the dollar has strengthened a bit lately, we are going to need foreigners and sovereign wealth funds from Asia, Europe and the Middle East more than ever to survive this crisis -- and they are going to need us to be healthy as well. In the process, we are going to become even more intertwined and dependent on the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin won't have to worry that she doesn't know what the Bush doctrine is. No one really knew what it meant. But it had something to do with the unilateral exercise of American power, and the next president's ability to act unilaterally on anything other than vital national security issues is going to be reduced. As the old saying goes: He who has the gold makes the rules. Well, we no longer have as much gold, and until we get some, we will have to pay more heed to the rules of those who lend us theirs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when the U.S. government gets half its borrowings from abroad, at a time when the U.S. household savings rate is hovering around zero and China alone is already holding around $1 trillion in U.S. Treasury notes and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds -- yes, that's how you got that cheap subprime mortgage -- it can't be any other way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somebody better tell John McCain: We are all Swedes now. Forget about &quot;Live Free or Die.&quot; Until we get our financial act together, our motto is going to be: &quot;Swedish spoken here -- or Arabic or Chinese or German ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would also bet that more and more of the foreign investors who come our way are going to want to buy hard, tangible assets -- skyscrapers, real estate and real companies -- not just mutual funds, T-bills, bank stocks or other equities. No problem. Americans own assets all over the world; foreigners have long owned substantial positions in U.S. companies. That's globalization -- and now you are going to see globalization and financial integration on steroids. It should help us, but also change us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The next round of capital that comes in from abroad is going to be much more demanding and move into real assets,&quot; argued Jeffrey Garten, professor of trade and finance at the Yale School of Management. &quot;Being a bigger debtor nation means losing even more of our sovereignty. It means conducting our economic policies with an eye toward whether others approve. It means bearing the advice and criticism that we have dispensed ad nauseam to other countries for over half a century. It means far more intensive consultations with other capitals on our fiscal policies and our monetary policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, added Mr. Garten, &quot;Corporate decisions will become more sensitive to international factors, in part because more non-Americans will be on the governing boards.&quot; This could make American industry even more globally competitive -- but for those who can't pass global muster or enlist global collaborators, the consequences could be harsh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, neither Barack Obama nor John McCain dare talk about this now. They want to pretend nothing has really changed. The minute one of them steps into the Oval Office, they will tell us otherwise. That will be the January surprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a lot of talk after Russia invaded Georgia that globalization was over and we were seeing the return of &quot;history&quot; and the primacy of politics over economics. I think not. Politics and economics are al-ways inextricably intertwined. History-making is rarely free. The Russian stock market has been hammered as a result of its invasion of Georgia, and the global slowdown has sunk Russian oil and gas earnings. No country is an island today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making history is not simply about the will to do so. It's also about the way -- the resources you have to achieve your ends. Whatever wills the next American president comes to office with, he is going to find that his ways have been diminished and restricted -- until we roll up our sleeves and work our way out of this mess.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nancy Pfotenhauer, an adviser to the McCain campaign, said it's &quot;absolutely essential&quot; that Americans hear not only about his plans for the future but also &quot;about the decision they have to make about these two individuals.&quot; She said she thought that commercials that raise new questions about Obama's associations &quot;have struck a nerve&quot; with the Democrat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's communications director, Robert Gibbs, countered that the new McCain offensive - including GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin's allegation that Obama &quot;pals around with terrorists&quot; -is happening because Republicans want to talk about something other than the struggling economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gibbs, who appeared with Pfotenhauer on ABC's &quot;Good Morning America&quot; Monday, charged that the McCain campaign is resorting to &quot;a despicable smear campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats on Sunday had denounced Palin's charge and warned that it would trigger reexaminations of McCain's past. Sure enough, Obama's campaign released a Web video and a letter about McCain's role in the Keating Five scandal from the early 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;does not want to play guilt-by-association, or this thing could blow up in his face,&quot; Democratic strategist Paul Begala said on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The names being bandied about - Bill Ayers and Charles Keating - are unfamiliar to millions of Americans, and their wrongdoings occurred decades ago. But political operatives dredged them up over the weekend, and they could play a prominent role in the campaign's final month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin, the Alaska governor, defended her earlier comments about Obama and Ayers, in which she said the Democratic nominee is &quot;palling around with terrorists who would target their own country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayers was a founder of the violent Weather Underground group during the Vietnam era. Its members were blamed for several bombings when Obama was a child. Obama has denounced Ayers' radical views and activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men live in the same Chicago neighborhood and once worked on the same charity board. Ayers hosted a small meet-the-candidate event for Obama in 1995, early in his political career. Obama strategist David Axelrod has said the two men are &quot;friendly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, Palin told reporters in California that her comments were about &quot;an association that has been known but hasn't been talked about. I think it's fair to talk about where Barack Obama kicked off his political career, in the guy's living room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Obama was questioned about Ayers during a prime-time Democratic debate against Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton before April's Pennsylvania primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The heels are on, the gloves are off,&quot; Palin said of her campaign strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, speaking Sunday to thousands at an outdoor event in Asheville, N.C., fired back. He said McCain and his aides &quot;are gambling that he can distract you with smears rather than talk to you about substance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described the criticisms as &quot;Swiftboat-style attacks on me,&quot; a reference to the unsubstantiated allegations about 2004 Democratic nominee John Kerry's military record in Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Democrats rushed to Obama's defense. Veteran party activist Hillary Rosen, on CNN's &quot;Late Edition,&quot; said, &quot;If they throw mud like that, then you go back to Charles Keating, you go back to Sarah Palin's investigation.&quot; She was referring to inquiries into the firing of Alaska's top police official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I just don't think that John McCain wants to take this nuclear strategy,&quot; Rosen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just months into his Senate career, in the late 1980s, McCain made what he has called &quot;the worst mistake of my life.&quot; He participated in two meetings with banking regulators on behalf of Keating, a friend, campaign contributor and savings and loan owner who was later convicted of securities fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate ethics committee investigated five senators relationships with Keating. The panel cited McCain for a lesser role than the others, but faulted his &quot;poor judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's new Web video, being e-mailed to millions of his supporters, summarizes a 13-minute Web &quot;documentary&quot; that the campaign plans to distribute Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said in a statement, &quot;McCain's Keating history is relevant and voters deserve to know the facts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, Obama also unveiled a TV ad on the economy that describes McCain was &quot;erratic in a crisis.&quot; Some see that as a reminder of McCain's age, 72.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush says the $700 billion bank-loan bailout and tax-break law he signed Friday will get the bond markets moving again, cut bank losses on bad loans, rescue investors, and ease the recession for small business, consumers, workers and homeowners. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's asking a lot, even for $700 billion. We asked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">See Yeng Quek</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, head of fixed-income investments at $135 billion-asset </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Delaware Investments</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Philadelphia, for a sober view of where we've been, where we're headed, and how this is supposed to get us there.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Question: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has been fighting the credit crisis for a year. Has it worked? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Answer:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first solutions looked like whack-a-mole. That is why the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Treasury</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposed such a broad and expansive strategy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are in uncharted waters here. We really do not have any history to help us predict the outcome. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could possibly lead to freeing up the balance sheet of some of these financial institutions. This would help these institutions to return to business as usual. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if the eventual price of the securities that the government sets is too low, this could damage some balance sheets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Q: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Won't some of the biggest financial institutions - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp., the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. - do well even without the loan program? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">A:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yes. Several large, well-capitalized, high-quality financial institutions are benefiting from a &quot;flight to quality&quot; by depositors and creditors alike. These institutions are operating from a position of strength and should be able to buy assets with or without a government loan-purchase guarantee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An excellent example of that is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Wells Fargo &amp; Co.'s</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plan to buy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Wachovia Corp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> without government help. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the government loan-purchase program will be incredibly important to the banking system, by allowing banks saddled with troubled real estate assets to free up capital and begin extending credit again, which is vital to our economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Q:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What differences do you see, if any, in the positions of presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama on what ought to be done? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">A:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They both supported the $700 billion program. The differences are mostly reflective of their traditional party positions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Q:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What have we learned about regulation, its limits, and the deregulation of the last 30 years? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">A:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are natural limits in everything. When you exceed those limits, you run the risk of a crisis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government-sponsored enterprises and banks were regulated entities, and yet they still failed, despite various limits set forth by regulation. Then again, we have evidence that deregulation doesn't really work, as well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One cause of this current housing crisis was the political agenda to increase homeownership in this country. To achieve that, we relaxed lending standards or were more &quot;creative&quot; on how we evaluated creditworthiness of the borrowers. This enabled some people to buy homes that they could not afford. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result of this is now obvious, but a lot of excesses were developed along the way. That is why the correction is so severe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Q:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How are the institutions in the financial sector going to look after this is resolved? Do you expect fewer, larger, more conservative banks, and higher financing costs for small and emerging businesses? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">A:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of the above. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the higher prices for risk, surviving institutions should be more profitable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the long term, we are confident that we will have a strong financial system supporting a fundamentally strong and diverse economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Q:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Do you expect foreign financial institutions to buy U.S. companies? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">A:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have seen several sovereign-wealth funds investing in (U.S.) financial institutions already. Those investments have not performed well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult to predict whether there will be more investments as this crisis becomes more global. The decline in commodities prices may also diminish further investments in the United States from sovereign-wealth funds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign investors will continue to get involved based on the analysis they perform, and the opportunities they see. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Q:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shouldn't the dollar be falling, instead of rising? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">A:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I would have expected the dollar to decline with such huge bailout plans being discussed. However, because of the turmoil in other markets, the dollar has strengthened against a number of major currencies. There is no clear alternative to the U.S. dollar. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Pennsylvania a key battleground state and the election just weeks away, Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain are dropping major dollars on campaign ads in the Philadelphia TV market. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, Pennsylvania ranks first in the country for campaign TV revenue, with $27 million being spent since mid-June, according to figures supplied by TNS Media Intelligence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio is a distant second at $23 million - $3 million ahead of Florida. McCain's $14 million outlay in the Keystone State tops his campaign; Obama's $13 million is second only to his spending in Florida, says TNS president Evan Tracey.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania, which went for Democrat John Kerry in 2004, &quot;is a vital state, no matter how you divide up the huge chunk [23] of electoral votes,&quot; Tracey says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's one of the few states that the McCain camp sees as a potential switch. Obama didn't win the primary there, and McCain may be able to pick up disaffected Hillary Clinton voters,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TV-wise, Philadelphia and its suburbs are vital to winning Pennsylvania. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fourth-largest TV market in the country, it includes Philadelphia, Montgomery, Chester and Delaware Counties as well as portions of South Jersey and Delaware. It represents 60 percent of the TV households in Pennsylvania, according to Nielsen Media Research. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, it is critical for campaigns looking to make inroads among suburban voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The campaigns always target the three big [suburban] counties,&quot; says Judith LaFountaine, sales manager at NBC10. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain outspent Obama in Pennsylvania frequently over the summer, but in the last two weeks Obama has racheted up his output, particularly in Philadelphia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Sept. 15 through 28, he spent $3.2 million statewide, almost $2 million of it here. During the same period, McCain put out $2 million, about half to Philadelphia, Tracey says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the last week, the candidates together have paid out nearly $1.6 million in Philadelphia alone, according to public records, with Obama outspending McCain three to one. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are heating up. The floodgates are opening,&quot; says political analyst Randall Miller of St. Joseph's University. &quot;Some of the stations have been carping recently. They had anticipated more money sooner.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's why: In the just-completed third quarter, the campaign ad spending was down 24 percent in Philadelphia compared with the George W. Bush-Kerry race four years ago, public records say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Cable, however, is a different story. The candidates spent a total of $1.6 million here in the third quarter, compared with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">zero</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2004, according to Jim Gallagher, general manager of Comcast Spotlight.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reason spending is down overall in Pennsylvania, says local political consultant Neil Oxman, is that the number of battleground states has increased to 14 or 15 from eight or nine. That means campaigns have to spread their TV dollars over more states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Neither side is conceding states to the other side,&quot; Oxman says. &quot;Democrats are advertising in places like North Carolina and Indiana. Republicans are fighting in places like Wisconsin, Minnesota and Oregon.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another difference from 2004 is that there have been far fewer ads purchased by the Democratic and Republican National Committees and advocacy groups. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are spending their money on other things,&quot; Oxman says. &quot;On the Democratic side, a lot of unions are putting money into field programs like voter registration.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, in 2004, the general election phase began in March. In 2008, Obama didn't nail the nomination until June. That means three fewer months of ad revenue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plummeting economy doesn't appear to have hurt the candidates, who are raising record amounts. In Oxman's view, campaigns are &quot;recession proof.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At this level, there's a fairly low ceiling on what individuals can give. When you have two million contributors like Obama and you're asking for 10, 20 bucks - that's the cost of a movie and dinner.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six local stations share in the political bounty. Last week, Obama has been most bountiful to CBS3, with $343,000, or 30 percent of his market total. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and McCain have made heavy buys during newscasts, whose viewers are older and tend to vote. Targeting women, McCain has spots in several daytime soaps and in syndicated shows like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Oprah</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Ellen</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Dr. Phil</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's hitting some of the same shows, along with football, to attract 25-to-54 year-old males. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Obama last week began airing 120-second spots, which sell for quadruple the rate of a typical 30-second ad. He ran more than $80,000 worth on CBS3 alone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miller says he's surprised by the timing of Obama's two-minute drills &quot;because they're usually used to introduce a candidate, in some ways, and to create a narrative structure.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strategically, however, Miller also sees them as a way for Obama &quot;to reclaim his own biography, which has been lost since the [Republican] convention. Ironically, he's become somewhat invisible.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A two-minute Obama&nbsp;ad ran Tuesday night on Fox's new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Fringe</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for $20,000, along with a 30-second spot for $5,000. McCain had one, also. An hour earlier, they each spent $15,500 on 30-second spots on Fox's hit </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">House</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next to Eagles broadcasts, that's chump change. The Birds are the most lucrative draw in town. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC10 commanded $30,000 for a 30-second spot on Sunday's Eagles-Bears game at 8:15 p.m. on NBC. Obama ran two ads and McCain one for a $90,000 payday for WCAU. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox29, which carries 10 Eagles games, notches $30,000 to $40,000 a 30-second pop. For today's 1 p.m. Fox home game against the Redskins, Obama ordered two and McCain one. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox29 expects an even bigger check when the Eagles play the Seahawks at 4:15 p.m. on Nov. 2 - two days before the election. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DOTT, Pa. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signs from both political parties graced the front window, and Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Gov. Sarah Palin grinned from fliers advertising a vice-presidential debate party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glenn Hiller bought and refurbished the Dott Store a year and a half ago, turning it into a country store with a steady lunch business -- and, Mr. Hiller hopes, a center for discourse in a rural area that is heavily Republican and mostly reserved about its politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting by the window, next to piles of campaign pamphlets, Jim DeShong, 82, and Floyd Palmer, 90, lifelong Fulton County residents and strong supporters of Sen. John McCain, say they are a bit jarred by the political paraphernalia -- and Mr. Hiller's open support for Sen. Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the wrong place to do it, in a place of business,&quot; Mr. Palmer said. &quot;I wouldn't tell anyone my politics.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it's very good for his business,&quot; Mr. DeShong added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It isn't the first time Mr. Hiller has been outnumbered politically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, Mr. Hiller heckled President Bush during an invitation-only campaign rally in West Virginia. His employer, advertising and design company Octavo Designs, fired him the next day saying Mr. Hiller embarrassed a client who had provided tickets to the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Hiller says his rebellious moment was born of a desire to show the importance of dissent, not radical partisanship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Controlling a campaign event, controlling the media and giving the appearance of 100 percent support and putting that on TV -- that's nothing but propaganda,&quot; Mr. Hiller said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was offended that things were moving in that direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Mr. Hiller is trying to restore civility to the political climate in a county that gave President Bush 76 percent of the vote in 2004, the highest percentage of any county in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set in the Allegheny Mountains on the Maryland border, Fulton County, population 14,261, is the crimson base to Pennsylvania's famous Republican 'T.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the county's Democrats have been more visible this election cycle and polls show Mr. Obama's lead increasing statewide, interviews with dozens of residents last week showed overwhelming support for Mr. McCain and deep reservations about Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's got two strikes on him before he even gets to the plate: 1. He's black. 2. He's a Muslim,&quot; said Charles Sipes, 68, of Harrisonville, repeating an oft-cited but untrue rumor about Mr. Obama's religion. &quot;This country was based on white people, not blacks. Blacks belong underneath, not on top.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'A little bit of foreign'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Fulton County interviewees didn't share Mr. Sipes' sentiments out loud, but many expressed fear and uneasiness about Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll probably go with McCain, and the only reason to go with him is I'm just afraid of what's going to happen with the other guy,&quot; said Don Peck, 68, owner of the Peck Wood Tavern in McConnellsburg. &quot;I don't like [Mr. Obama's] background, where he came from. He's got a little bit of foreign in him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some voters said they were perturbed by the controversial sermons of Mr. Obama's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, but others were adamant that Mr. Obama was Muslim, and were worried that he would ally with extremists or alienate Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That fear also spread to economic policies that some voters cited as a recipe to worsen the financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wouldn't vote for Obama because he'd raise capital gains taxes,&quot; said Mr. Palmer, of Dott. &quot;I'd have to go on assistance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experience was the deciding factor for many McCain supporters, several of whom said they would have voted for Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton if she had been the Democratic nominee. Many praised Mr. McCain's integrity and expressed reverence for his military service and time as a prisoner of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Obama is a phony and a snake-oil salesman. His background is questionable and his patriotism is questionable,&quot; said Bill Watson, 61, of Hustontown. &quot;There is no such question about McCain. You can take him at face value. He's already proven that he's a patriot. He wants to serve rather than rule, which sets him apart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lame duck</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. Watson, who works at a truck stop &quot;over the mountain&quot; in Breezewood, Bedford County, devotion to Mr. McCain does not extend to Mr. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's an embarrassment,&quot; Mr. Watson said. &quot;He's extremely inarticulate, and he's surrounded himself with some very bad advisers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many of the voters who supported the president so overwhelmingly in the last election -- he received 4,772 votes to Sen. John Kerry's 1,475 -- have maintained their confidence in him, with some saying they'd vote for Mr. Bush if he were able to seek a third term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in the rest of the country, there is general agreement in Fulton County that with two wars and an economic crisis, the nation is on the wrong track. Nationally, the blame is laid at the feet of the president, whose historically poor approval rating is hovering in the 20s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet in Fulton County, lukewarm support remains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There have been a lot of ups and downs with Bush,&quot; said Amanda Shives, 24, of McConnellsburg, a mother of three who works for a credit card company. &quot;He's had a lot of major things come through -- 9/11, Iraq. ... No matter who would have been in office, people wouldn't have been happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Auto mechanic Tim Mellott, 47, of Needmore, agreed that the events of the past eight years would have been difficult for anyone to handle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's dealt with more in this country than any president since World War II,&quot; Mr. Mellott said. &quot;After 9/11 he showed leadership and got the country back to work. Maybe he mishandled some things and has had a bad decline since then. ... I think there's enough blame to go around on both sides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locked and loaded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As wrangling over the proposed bailout plan continued on Capitol Hill last week, the first topic on voters' minds was the economy. But a close second -- in a county where camouflage is far more prevalent than businesswear -- is gun control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Second Amendment rights are just crucial,&quot; said county commissioner Daniel H. Swain Jr., 43, of Warfordsburg. &quot;It's the Second Amendment for a reason -- it's second only in importance to the first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately, fellow county commissioner Bonnie Mellott Keefer, 54, of McConnellsburg, jumped in, saying, &quot;I see the Second Amendment as the most important. It protects all the other rights. Otherwise, dictators have the ability to rise up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, who pushed for tougher gun regulation for Chicago while in the Illinois Senate, has been the target of a multimillion-dollar ad campaign by the National Rifle Association. The ads allege that he wants to severely restrict gun rights, though some of the claims have been challenged by independent fact-checking groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic volunteers lamented the fact that Mr. Obama has been portrayed as anti-gun, saying it's one of the biggest obstacles they face in trying to convert Republican voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You remind people that gun control for Obama is Uzis in South Chicago,&quot; said Joe Erwin, 67, of the Fulton County Democratic Committee. &quot;He's talking about controlling violence in the city, not taking your hunting rifle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal of the NRA is to keep some conservative Republicans from jumping ship, said G. Terry Madonna, a political science professor and pollster at Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're making an all-out effort, the NRA, to elect McCain and raise questions about Obama. That's going to help some, don't get me wrong, but it's a tough row to hoe,&quot; Mr. Madonna said. &quot;Guns are a big issue. ... They may not be able to hold them on some other issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The selection of Ms. Palin as Mr. McCain's vice presidential nominee has helped in Fulton County. Voters cited her hunting background as a reason to support the ticket, and social conservatives love her strong anti-abortion stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People we call don't mention the economy, except for occasional talk about gas prices and 'Drill, baby, drill,' &quot; said Mikael Fix, chairman of the Fulton County Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pro-life and pro-gun, those are the two biggest issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chipping away</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Fulton County Democrats, the aim is to pry the thoughts of undecided social conservatives away from guns and abortion and onto the economy. Polls have shown the public to be more confident in Mr. Obama's ability to handle the economy than in Mr. McCain's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fulton County Democrats have increased their visibility over the past few years, from holding a fund-raiser by selling chili to setting up a booth at the county fair. They have made outreach efforts on economic issues, including &quot;tutorials&quot; on Medicare and Social Security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They hope the message can hit home in a place where the economic slowdown has had palpable effects. Farming of dairy and beef cattle, once the area's lifeblood, has been on the wane for a long time. The county's largest employer, JLG, which manufactures aerial construction platforms, laid off 220 workers Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are very isolated here, and things that happen in the outside world don't always affect them -- they are now,&quot; said Joy Dasher, the organizer of the joint Democratic club for Fulton and Franklin counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are starting to think about change. It's starting to affect their world in Fulton County.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But support for Mr. McCain and doubts about Mr. Obama will be difficult to overcome. Republicans have more than a 1.5 -to-1 advantage in registration, and some wounds from the Democratic primary remain, pushing more voters to Mr. McCain's corner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several voters who disliked Mr. Obama mentioned his comments before the April primary at a fundraiser in San Francisco, in which he said of rural Pennsylvanians: &quot;They get bitter. They cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was strong backlash at the time -- Mr. Obama lost the primary by nearly 10 points. And Mr. McCain might reap rewards from those comments in November from the rural voters he'll need in huge numbers in order to carry the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish [Mr. Obama] would have gotten zero [votes] from Pennsylvania for saying that,&quot; Gerald Chalupka, 60, said with a chuckle as he did some shopping at the Dollar General in McConnellsburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess that makes me a Bible-thumping, gun-toting redneck.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. LOUIS, Mo. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delaware Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. won Thursday night's vice-presidential debate, according to two national polls, giving the Democrats fresh, important momentum yesterday as the campaign for the White House enters its final month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A CBS News/Knowledge Networks survey of 500 uncommitted voters taken after the debate Thursday night found that 46 percent thought Mr. Biden won, while 21 percent gave the victory to his Republican rival, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. While two-thirds found Ms. Palin knowledgeable about important issues, 98 percent said the same about Mr. Biden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A separate CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey found similar views, with 51 percent saying Mr. Biden did better, to 36 percent favoring Ms. Palin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps most significant, the CNN survey found that 87 percent thought the Delaware senator was qualified to be president, while 42 percent saw Ms. Palin that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He didn't ramble, and he wasn't patronizing. He stayed on message and linked McCain to President Bush in a very effective way,&quot; said political science professor Douglas Koopman of Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich. Particularly impressive, Dr. Koopman said, was how Mr. Biden dealt with Ms. Palin's repeated reference to her running mate, Arizona Sen. John McCain, as a &quot;maverick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love him,&quot; Mr. Biden said of Mr. McCain, his longtime Senate colleague. &quot;He's been a maverick on some issues, but he has been no maverick on the things that matter to people's lives,&quot; such as the economy, health care and education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, reviews for Ms. Palin, whose approval numbers had been tumbling in recent weeks, were generally favorable too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Had Palin blown it, it probably would have been the end of McCain's candidacy, but she dug in her heels and enhanced her credibility,&quot; said associate political science professor Wayne Lesperance at New England College in Henniker, N.H.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at this stage of the campaign, with Americans weary of war and anxious about the declining economy, the Republican ticket faces a hostile environment since it represents the incumbent party at a time when voters are seeking change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Palin had to do more than merely hold her own to shift the campaign's overall dynamic. But there's no evidence that she did that, even if she exceeded expectations for her performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Biden's running mate, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, led by an average of 5.8 points in national presidential-race surveys over the past week before the Biden-Palin debate, according to RealClearPolitics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every day that goes by with Barack Obama about 5 to 8 points ahead is not a good day for John McCain,&quot; said vice-presidential expert Timothy Walch, director of the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library in West Branch, Iowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every day of the next month is important,&quot; said Obama campaign manager David Plouffe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, Republicans claimed new momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Palin, who has been unavailable to most of the press corps ever since she joined the GOP ticket, will &quot;be available to the press, and she'll talk to every American voter. She'll be out 24/7,&quot; vowed McCain senior adviser Steve Schmidt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some experts agreed that Ms. Palin's folksy style could resonate, particularly with women in the Midwest and West -- a trend that may not show up right away. &quot;People listen to what the neighbors say, what their favorite pundit says, and sometimes there's a disconnect between that and what the media are saying now,&quot; said Wayne Fields, a professor of English and American culture studies at Washington University in St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, he said, people base their opinions on their intuition, and &quot;they really don't know specifically what they're basing their judgment on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Ms. Palin probably won't have much more opportunity to be widely heard. Public attention tends to focus most on presidential candidates, especially in the final weeks of a campaign, and there are no more vice-presidential debates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a crush of other big news stories -- including the House passage of the financial-rescue plan yesterday and the second McCain-Obama debate coming up Tuesday -- the Biden-Palin encounter is likely to fade quickly. &quot;The vice presidential story is essentially over now,&quot; Dr. Walch said. &quot;By Monday, we'll be on to another topic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Biden yesterday was in Dover, Del., saying goodbye to his son, Beau, who is Delaware's attorney general. Beau Biden's National Guard unit headed yesterday to Texas to train for deployment to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Palin yesterday was in Dallas for two private campaign events.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economy is crashing down on Jim Slovick. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country last month shed jobs at its fastest pace in five years, the U.S. Department of Labor said Friday, and Slovick knows the downward slide isn't done yet. His employer, Ryerson Steel, is closing its Carnegie plant. Slovick doesn't know when his last day of work will be, but he knows the remainder of his 39-year career is measured in weeks, not the years he'd once counted on. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 62, he's too young to collect his full Social Security benefits but too old to start anew.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want to retire. We want to work. I'm healthy,&quot; said Slovick of McDonald. He and co-worker Jay Clayton, 55, of Carnegie shared their plight with 12 other union members during an hourlong discussion with Richard Trumka, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, and Jack Shea, head of the Allegheny County Labor Council. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm 55 years old with 33 years of service,&quot; Clayton said. &quot;Where do I go?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employers cut 159,000 jobs in September. The department changed its unemployment figures for July and August, saying the economy lost 4,000 more jobs than previously thought. That brings the total job losses this year to about 768,000.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was a very weak job report. It confirms the U.S. is in a recession,&quot; said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for PNC Financial Services.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $700 billion-plus financial bailout passed by Congress yesterday will free up credit, getting some blood flowing in the economy again, but its effects for most people won't be immediate, Hoffman said. Job losses will continue for a while. That likely will dampen the holiday shopping season, which many businesses depend on to survive the year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's going to get worse. These things don't come and go overnight,&quot; Hoffman said. The federal government can do little if anything more but ride this out, he said. &quot;I think they've pulled as many rabbits out of their hats as they can.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trumka, who also spoke to the United Steelworkers to stump for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, said the employment situation could be even more grim than it looks. If the unemployment rate were calculated the way it was 20 years ago, it would be close to 15 percent, rather than 6.1 percent, Trumka said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This economy is not working for us,&quot; Trumka said. &quot;One out of 10 Americans who wants to work full time cannot find a full-time job.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past 12 months, the number of unemployed people rose by 2.2 million, mostly in construction, retail and manufacturing sectors. Long-term unemployment -- people without a job for more than half a year -- account for 2 million of the jobless. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slovick and his 18 co-workers expect to join their ranks soon. A woman who answered the phone at Ryerson's Carnegie plant said the plant would close in three weeks. Executives at the company's corporate headquarters could not be reached for comment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain said Obama's economic plan would make matters worse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unlike Sen. Obama, I do not believe we will create one single American job by increasing taxes, going on a massive spending binge, and closing off our markets,&quot; McCain said in a statement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, speaking in the Philadelphia suburb of Abington, blamed the crisis on an &quot;economic philosophy&quot; of deregulation and reliance on market forces that he said McCain and President Bush share. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've tried it their way. It hasn't worked. And it won't work now,&quot; Obama said. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not a Fox made-for-TV movie where the attractive, energetic hockey mom with five kids - including a newborn with Down syndrome - takes over the reins of the U.S. Government and, two hours and 30 commercials later, has mastered the most demanding and complicated position on the planet while still attending every one of her children's hockey games in Wasilla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain is giving up on his efforts to win the state of Michigan, his campaign said yesterday, in the latest sign that the faltering economy has reshaped the presidential race and cost Mr. McCain support in crucial states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ceding Michigan is a major blow to the McCain campaign, which had spent heavily on television commercials there and where Mr. McCain had campaigned repeatedly in the hopes that he could appeal to enough blue-collar voters, so-called Reagan Democrats and independent voters, to bring the state back into the Republican column in November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the rippling financial crisis shook up the presidential election, and Mr. McCain's somewhat unsteady response to it appeared to cost him support in a number of recent polls of battleground states, his campaign decided to pull out of Michigan and redirect its resources to other swing states where they felt Mr. McCain has a better chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign has spent nearly $8 million on ads in Michigan, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, a company that monitors political advertising, and now it has no more plans to advertise there, campaign officials said. And Mr. McCain canceled a visit he had planned to make to Michigan next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain had long made it clear that the state was central to his presidential hopes, returning there to campaign again and again and bluntly telling a crowd at a factory in Belleville this July that &quot;the state of Michigan, as it has in many elections in the past, will determine who the next president of the United States is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign announced its retreat on a day that the news of his ceding the state was almost sure to be drowned out by the buzz created by the much-anticipated vice-presidential debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign's withdrawal will free the Democratic nominee, Sen. Barack Obama, to redirect some of his resources from Michigan to several states that President Bush won in 2004 but where recent polls show him gaining ground, including Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign still projected optimism in a conference call with reporters, as senior campaign officials argued that they were confident that the electoral map presented them with numerous paths to victory in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike DuHaime, the McCain campaign's political director, said that the campaign would send some of its Michigan workers and resources to other states that voted for Democrats in 2004 but which they hoped to win in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He mentioned Pennsylvania, a state rich in electoral votes where Mr. Obama fared poorly in the Democratic primary; Wisconsin, which the Democrats have won narrowly in the last two presidential elections; and Maine, which divides its electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And although the McCain campaign's decision to accept public financing means that it faces spending limits that the Obama campaign does not face, there were indications that the campaign continues to be in strong shape on the money front. The campaign announced that the Republican National Committee, which could augment the $84 million in public money that the campaign had to spend on itself, raised nearly $66 million in September -- well above what Republicans had initially said they hoped to raise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greg Strimple, a senior McCain campaign adviser, held open the possibility that the RNC might continue to run some ads in Michigan to keep the state in play. &quot;If we see a swing back in our favor, we will re-engage,&quot; he said in the conference call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign made the announcement as Mr. Obama campaigned in Michigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign reacted cautiously to it. &quot;We'll believe it when we see it,&quot; said David Plouffe, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, who noted that the McCain campaign could still return to the state, or that independent expenditure groups might step in to try to fill the vacuum. &quot;We're not going to take their word for it. We're going to fight for every vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Plouffe said that if the McCain campaign really does withdraw from the state, it will make it more important for Mr. McCain to win all the states that President Bush carried in 2004, including some where they have seen an erosion of support in some recent polls. &quot;It just makes their path more narrow,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's struggles in Michigan were clear at the campaign stop at a factory in Belleville in July, where he found himself peppered with questions about his support for free trade by workers who believe it has cost the state jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign officials made it clear that they intended to open an aggressive new campaign highlighting what they described as Mr. Obama's liberal record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here in Denver, Mr. McCain was asked at a town-hall-style meeting when he intended to take the gloves off. &quot;How about Tuesday night?&quot; Mr. McCain responded, in a nod to his next scheduled debate with Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For contractor John Horanic, the financial crisis that has slammed Wall Street the past several weeks has hit his corner of Main Street. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just this week, his contract to expand a medical office building was postponed &quot;indefinitely&quot; because the owner could not obtain financing, said Horanic, who owns J. Michael's Independent Contracting Co. near Adamsburg, Westmoreland County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would have kept four guys working for three months. It's been a nightmare for us ... the worst it's been in 17 years,&quot; said Horanic, who has operated the business since 1985.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone's scared,&quot; he added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horanic, who has five employees, finds himself in a predicament shared by small businesses across the nation. Pessimism among business owners in the United States is at an all-time high in the five-year history of the PNC Economic Outlook Survey, with about 30 percent having doubts about their company's prospects over the next six months, the Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services Group said Thursday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The credit crunch, the rise in energy prices and the extent of a recession are among the biggest concerns for the nation's business owners, PNC said. About three-fourths of the business owners say the possibility of higher energy prices will have a negative effect on their company during the next six months, while 71 percent say the recession is their second-biggest concern. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PNC survey results supports the bank's view that &quot;the U.S. economy has entered into a recession and the economy is likely to remain weak through the middle of next year and beyond if the federal stabilization plan is not enacted,&quot; said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist for PNC. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a gloomy outlook for small businesses, which &quot;are at a point where they are saying they need help,&quot; said Marilyn Landis, a North Shore business owner and chairwoman of the 150,000-member National Small Business Association in Washington. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They need access to capital and they've always needed capital. They've relied on home equity loans, and that's not an option anymore,&quot; Landis said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What has been lost in all this bailout focus ... is that small businesses are still faced with the high cost of commodities, the high cost of fuel and the high cost of health care (insurance),&quot; said Landis, who owns Basic Business Concepts Inc., a nine-employee company that specializes in providing chief financial officer services for rapidly growing companies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixty-seven percent of the small businesses said in a recent survey that the credit crunch had an adverse impact on them, Landis said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horanic said he can't turn to his bank to fund a project upfront because his line of credit has been reduced at a time when the cost of raw materials, especially those containing petroleum products such as roof shingles, has skyrocketed. That's not even taking into account how the higher diesel fuel prices have eaten into his bottom line. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even healthy companies with solid balance sheets and order backlogs cannot obtain the routine financing they need to meet payroll and expand productive capacity,&quot; said John Engler, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade association. &quot;This is not about Wall Street, this is about Main Street,&quot; Engler added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the banks only have a limited amount of capital to loan, &quot;the small business is probably pretty far down the list,&quot; Landis said. The banks likely will be more restrictive in their lending practices. &quot;The fewer options we have, they'll dry up quickly,&quot; she added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tight credit pushes some small business owners into using credit cards for funding purchases, which makes the entrepreneurs vulnerable to credit card companies changing interest rates or payment dates on their purchases, Landis said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tight economy has 71 percent of the owners saying they are holding off on major purchases, and 54 percent say they are cutting their business, Landis said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those holding off on a major purchase until after the presidential election in November is Rudolph Jerzek, general manager and owner of Matt Machine and Manufacturing Inc. of Plum, a small business that machines products for the medical field and pipeline flow meters.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Due to the election itself, I'm holding off on a major enlargement of the facility,&quot; Jerzek said. If GOP candidate Sen. John McCain wins, Jerzek said he believes &quot;they'll be a reasonable chance of going ahead with it. But, if (Democrat Barack) Obama wins, I'm not so certain.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jerzek, whose family owned company has about 18 employees, said he was not certain the proposed bailout for Wall Street will work for small businesses, or any business for that matter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the bailout continues 'business as usual,' then I see a major problem in this country, where it will be another bailout down the road,&quot; Jerzek said. </SPAN></P>

LOUIS (AP) -- Under intense scrutiny, Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin stood her ground Thursday night against a vastly more experienced Joe Biden, debating the economy, energy and global warming, then challenging him on Iraq, &quot;especially with your son in the National Guard.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alaska governor also noted that Biden had once said Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama wasn't ready to be commander in chief, &quot;and I know again that you opposed the move that he made to try to cut off funding for the troops and I respect you for that.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden responded that John McCain, too, had voted against funding, and said the Republican presidential candidate had been &quot;dead wrong on the fundamental issues relating to the conduct of the war.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clash over Iraq was the most personal, and pointed, of the 90-minute debate in which Palin repeatedly cast herself as a non-Washington politician, part of a &quot;team of mavericks&quot; that she said was ready to bring change to a country demanding it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the opening moments of the debate, Biden sought to make McCain out as a straight-ahead successor to an unpopular President Bush. &quot;He voted four out of five times for George Bush's budget, which put us a half-trillion dollars in debt and over $4 trillion in debt since he got here,&quot; he said of McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin merely accused Biden of reciting the past rather than looking to the future. &quot;Americans are cravin' that straight talk&quot; that McCain offers, she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two running mates debated for 90 minutes on a stage at Washington University, their only encounter of a campaign with little more than one month to go. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent polls show Obama with a small but perceptible lead, and Republican officials said earlier in the day that McCain had decided to pull out of Michigan, conceding the state to the Democrats. At the same time, his own aides said the campaign may soon begin to advertise in Indiana -- a state that has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1968. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin faced enormous challenges of her own, though. After five weeks as McCain's ticket-mate, her poll ratings had begun dropping and even some conservatives have questioned her readiness for high public office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her solo campaign events are few, and she has drawn ridicule for some of her answers in the few interviews she has granted -- including her claim that Alaska's proximity to Russia gives her an insight into foreign policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After intense preparation -- including two days at McCain's home in Sedona, Ariz., there was only one obvious stumble, when she twice referred to the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan as &quot;Gen. McClellan.&quot; His name is David McKiernan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden's burden was not nearly as fundamental. Although he has long had a reputation for long-windedness, he is a veteran of more than 35 years in the Senate, with a strong knowledge of foreign policy as well as domestic issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For much of the evening, the debate unfolded in traditional vice presidential fashion -- the running mates praising their own presidential candidate and denigrating the other. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin said Obama had voted to raise taxes 94 times -- an allegation that Biden disputed and then countered. By the same reckoning, he said, McCain voted &quot;477 times to raise taxes.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They clashed over energy policy, as well, when Palin said Obama's vote for a Bush administration-backed bill granted breaks to the oil industry. By contrast, she said that as governor, she had stood up to the same industry, and noted that McCain had voted against the bill Obama supported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden said that in the past decade, McCain had voted &quot;20 times against funding alternative energy sources and thinks, I guess, the only answer is drill, drill, drill.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chant is, 'drill, baby drill,&quot; Palin countered quickly, unwilling to yield to Biden on that issue -- or any other. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the environment, Palin declined to attribute the cause of climate change to man-made activities alone. &quot;There is something to be said also for man's activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet,&quot; she said, adding that she didn't want to argue about the causes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden said the cause was clearly man-made, and added, &quot;If you don't understand what the cause is, it's virtually impossible to come up with a solution.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Barack Obama used word of the nation's worst monthly job loss in over five years Friday to argue the policies of his Republican opponents &quot;are killing jobs in America every single day.&quot; Republican John McCain retorted that Obama's tax and spending plans won't solve the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government reported employers cut 159,000 jobs last month, the ninth straight month of job losses. The crowd gathered to hear Obama at a Pennsylvania high school football field booed when he told them the numbers and again when he told them McCain recently said the economy is fundamentally strong and has made great progress under President Bush. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illinois senator encouraged voters to change the Republican leadership in the White House that he said hasn't worked. He disputed McCain running mate Sarah Palin's claim in a debate Thursday night that own spending plan would be a job killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Sen. McCain and his running mate talk about job killing, that's something they know a thing or two about,&quot; Obama said. &quot;Because the policies they've supported and are supporting are killing jobs in America every single day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours later at a town hall meeting in Pueblo, Colo., McCain himself said Obama's plans would hurt the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He wants higher taxes, more government, higher spending, and frankly that record is not something which has been good for America and we won't let it happen,&quot; McCain said. The McCain campaign launched a new national TV ad Friday repeating his criticisms of Obama's tax plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is proposing tax increases only for those earning more than $250,000 but would cut taxes for those making less details that McCain and Palin don't mention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their dispute came as Congress approved a $700 billion measure to bail out the financial industry. Both campaigns said their candidates called lawmakers on behalf of the bill. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus credited Obama with changing their minds, including Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Reps. Elijah Cummings and Donna Edwards, both Maryland Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said, &quot;He's made a number of calls today. We are not releasing specifics at this time.&quot; But Republican Rep. Sue Myrick of North Carolina, who switched her vote to favor the measure, said she hadn't heard from McCain. &quot;They told me he was going to call me. He didn't,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters upon landing in Flagstaff, Ariz., McCain took credit for helping push the bailout through Congress. Last week he briefly rearranged his campaign schedule to go to Washington as lawmakers began considering the package. He left to debate Obama but returned last weekend before the first House vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm glad I suspended my campaign and went back to Washington to bring to help bring House Republicans to the table,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Congress' passage of the bailout, there was no indication the Wall Street crisis would give way to other campaign issues and more economic woes could be ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in battleground Colorado, McCain defended the bailout, which he voted for in the Senate on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator said he is a &quot;proud opponent of waste and pork barrel spending,&quot; possibly a reference to pet projects and sweeteners tucked into the rescue measure to win more votes after the House defeated it Monday with 133 Republicans and 95 Democrats voting no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I also have to tell you that the government has to step in at this time and save Main Street from the challenges and the disaster that's looming,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, a member of the town hall audience asked why the government is bailing out Wall Street first instead of helping individual homeowners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that a lot of people view this as a 'bailout for Wall Street.' I'm not interested in helping Wall Street in any way,&quot; McCain said. He said rescuing the financial industry will give Americans confidence in the economy and help stabilize the housing market, which would eventually benefit homeowners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that grim economic backdrop, Obama is seeking to solidify his lead in national and battleground polls, while McCain looks for a game-changing development to close a gap that grew in part because McCain struggled to respond to the financial crisis and because economic woes tend to push voters toward Democratic candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show Obama has made progress in persuading voters that he's ready to be president and that McCain would continue Bush's economic policies. But the Illinois senator still has work to do to lock down his lead in case outside events or campaign blunders change the campaign conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama planned to continue to use the economy and McCain's 90 percent support for Bush in the Senate to hammer his opponent and to argue the GOP ticket has failed to articulate how it would be different from the Bush administration. Aides still view the race as very close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign is trying to regroup from two disastrous weeks. As Wall Street crumbled, McCain struggled to strike the right note. Palin's qualifications came under fire from GOP critics after she appeared ill-informed in TV interviews. The GOP nominee's poll numbers slipped everywhere, dropping so far in Michigan that the campaign pulled the plug. It diverted resources elsewhere, even moving to shore up Republican bastions like Indiana and North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator's advisers argued that Palin's debate performance quieted GOP critics and reassured other skeptics enough to stop McCain's slide, but it was too early to verify that. McCain advisers also hope Congress' approval of the bailout will help turn the page to other issues. They say McCain will go hard after Obama by emphasizing liberal positions Obama has taken in Senate votes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the night that political junkies - and there are millions and millions of you out there this year - have been waiting for. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 9 p.m., Sarah Palin and Joseph R. Biden Jr. meet in their one and only debate of the campaign season, at Washington University in St. Louis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the focus will be on the Republican far more than on the Democrat, both candidates have a lot to prove.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin, who remains extremely popular with the GOP base, will be out to show she has the depth of knowledge required of a would-be president - after doing television interviews that have generated ridicule from liberal commentators (as well as late-night comedians) and angst among some conservatives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poll released yesterday showed the degree to which the public's view of the Alaska governor has soured since her well-received speech at the Republican convention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately after the convention, the Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press found that Americans considered Palin &quot;qualified&quot; to be vice president, 52 percent to 39 percent. In the new survey, completed Monday, the verdict was &quot;not qualified,&quot; 51 percent to 37 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To argue that she's not qualified is something I categorically reject,&quot; Republican presidential candidate John McCain told newspaper editors in Iowa on Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden, who remains the all-but-forgotten man of the 2008 campaign, will be out to prove himself an asset to the Democratic ticket - by demonstrating command of the issues, avoiding any appearance of condescension toward Palin, and keeping his brain ahead of his sometimes too-quick mouth.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview last week, for instance, Biden bungled the history of the Great Depression, saying that President Franklin Roosevelt went on television after the stock-market crash to buck up people's spirits. In fact, Herbert Hoover was president at the time of the crash, and commercial television hadn't started. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think what Joe Biden is going to do is what he's done for us throughout his time as the vice presidential nominee,&quot; Barack Obama's communications director, Robert Gibbs, said in a television interview this week, &quot;and go out there and make the case for change.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The format for their meeting could help protect both candidates from themselves; it forces them to keep their answers short. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the rules, moderator Gwen Ifill of PBS will ask the questions, which can be about any topic. Each candidate will have 90 seconds to respond with a two-minute conversation to follow. In the presidential debate last Friday between McCain and Obama, answers lasted two minutes and the conversation five. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ifill's credentials for hosting the debate were questioned yesterday by several conservatives, Rush Limbaugh included. He alleged that Ifill has an economic interest in an Obama victory because it would help sales of her forthcoming book, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain told Fox News he was confident that Ifill would do a &quot;completely objective&quot; job. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates have spent most of recent days in the company of top campaign aides preparing for tonight. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's prep work started in New York last week, continued over a long weekend in Philadelphia, and wound up with three days at McCain's vacation house in Sedona, Ariz. In a photo from Arizona, McCain foreign-policy adviser Randy Scheunemann appeared to be taking on the role of Biden. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Biden did most of his rehearsing at his house near Wilmington, with Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm playing Palin. He traveled to Capitol Hill yesterday to vote on the economic rescue bill. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Biden has been virtually silent the last few days, Palin called in to conservative radio shows Tuesday and yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When host Hugh Hewitt asked her why she thought her candidacy had generated so much hostility on the left and from some in the media, she replied, &quot;Oh, I think they're just not used to someone coming in from the outside saying: You know what? It's time that normal Joe six-pack American is finally represented in the position of vice presidency.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, she told host Sean Hannity that she looked forward to the debate, &quot;getting to speak directly to Americans, without that filter of mainstream media trying to, I think, maybe censor some of my comments.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coming into tonight's encounter, the Republicans are in need of something to give them a spark. Ever since the financial crisis began nearly three weeks ago, all of the political indicators have been moving in Obama's direction. He now leads McCain by an average of 5 percentage points in national polls. And the numbers in battleground states have shown a strong Democratic trend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New state polls from the Quinnipiac Polling Institute yesterday have Obama ahead 15 points in Pennsylvania, 8 in Ohio, and 8 in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other surveys have shown Obama's lead in Pennsylvania in the 6-to-7-point range and the contest virtually even in Ohio and Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another new set of polls, from CNN/Time/Opinion Research, had Obama up 4 in Florida, 11 in Minnesota, 1 in Missouri, 4 in Nevada, and 9 in Virginia.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not clear how much impact, if any, tonight's debate will have; generally, people wind up voting for the top of the ticket with little regard for running mates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after what was arguably the most lopsided vice presidential debate - the one in 1988 in which Democrat Lloyd Bentsen told Republican Dan Quayle that he was &quot;no Jack Kennedy&quot; - the Republican ticket headed by George H.W. Bush won comfortably. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The TV audience tonight is likely to exceed the estimated 52.4 million who watched the Obama-McCain debate, a number kept down by the uncertainty over whether the event would happen and by its being scheduled on a Friday night. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE'VE HEARD it said ad nauseam since Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was named the GOP vice-presidential nominee:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She can field-dress a moose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Palin was a little girl, her father, Charlie, reportedly often took her moose hunting before school. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's supporters cite her skill as a boast that she's no effete weakling but a tough mama who can triumph over huge, hairy obstacles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As she prepares to face a huge, though less hairy, adversary in the vice-presidential debate tonight, I thought it would be instructive to explore the issue further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those of us brought up in the city, for instance, where predators have handguns instead of hooves, what does it mean to field-dress a moose, anyway? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with Palin teetering on the edge of self-destruction, given her inept performance in news interviews, will it help her survive tonight's showdown? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A moose can weigh from 600 to 1,400 pounds, which means that you can't just sling the carcass over your shoulder and tie it to your hood, unless you're Paul Bunyan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only way you can get it home, not to mention save the meat from spoiling, is by butchering it right where it drops in the woods - dressing it, so to speak, in the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Web sites that provide instructions start with a crucial warning:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make sure the moose is dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Be cautious when approaching any downed game, and make your approach from the rear or sides,&quot; said one Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are several stories of excited hunters being too close when an animal thought to be dead struggles to get up, injuring the hunter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(It seems that Palin and McCain may have made this mistaken assumption with Barack Obama, considering his resurrection in the latest presidential polls.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since moose die with their eyes open, it's hard to tell whether they're still alive. So, the instructions say, if you want to make really sure the moose is dead, you can poke it in the eye with a stick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopefully, Palin will be kept a safe distance from Joe Biden tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once you're sure the moose is dead, proceed to: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Bleed the animal by slitting its throat with a sharp knife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Cut the moose from &quot;throat to anus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Use an axe or a saw to break its breastbone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Sever the wind pipe and gullet from the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Cut through the abdomen to the anus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Split the pelvic bone with an ax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. If you've killed a cow moose, locate its uterus - if it's pregnant, remove fetus and transplant it to a surrogate moose womb because you don't believe in killing the unborn. You can shoot it later when it grows up. (This is only for anti-choice hunters like Palin.) (Yes, it's a joke.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Cut the diaphragm from the cavity wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Most importantly, to avoid tainting the meat, free the anus from the carcass without cutting it open and spilling poop all over the place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Grasp the windpipe and pull the moose's heart and lungs out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Clean the body cavity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point, if you want to quarter the animal, you can start by cutting off its head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOW you know why Palin's supporters boast of her skill at field-dressing a moose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone capable of such brutality can surely run our country and keep us safe from our enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia's Putin, for instance, better think twice before he &quot;rears his head and comes into the airspace of America&quot; across the &quot;very narrow maritime border&quot; with Alaska - as Palin famously described it to Katie Couric - given that he'll be poked in the eye and eviscerated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And don't even think of underestimating Palin's ability to survive tonight's debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If she can handle a dead moose, Joe Biden may very well be a cooked goose. *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three months ago, you needed $1.60 in good American money to buy one euro in Rome or Berlin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You needed just $1.44 Monday. It cost $1.40 yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means, while Fannie Mae, Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc. and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Wachovia Corp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were collapsing, the dollar was getting stronger. As the House of Representatives voted down a bailout, the dollar jumped. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How's that? For all the talk about foreign markets' breaking away from the United States, we're still connected. We don't just share financial trouble; we've exported it.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Problems from the U.S. are causing problems abroad,&quot; said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Mauro Guillen</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, head of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Lauder Institute of</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Management and International Studies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Penn's Wharton School</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reckless&quot; U.S. subprime loans were &quot;sliced and repackaged&quot; into &quot;toxic securities&quot; by U.S. investment banks, who resold these bonds to banks and pension funds around the world - cash up front, to be repaid as borrowers made their payments, or defaulted if they didn't. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. investors knew last year that some banks had problems; that's when the dollar sank. Europeans woke up to the losses only when British, German and Dutch regulators had to bail out banks last weekend, Guillen said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. bailout, when it passes, will help some, he said. &quot;China, Brazil and Mexico all managed to get out of big banking crises in the 1990s. I can't come up with an example of a country that let the financial system go down the drain,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People don't like giving money to bankers. Especially investment bankers. But what is the alternative? The alternative is chaos. Companies can't operate if the financial system crashes.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important, the bailout will make it easier for the more-efficient and well-run banks to buy inefficient and failing lenders. Natural selection, with government help, as it were. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guillen says Wall Street's survivors - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - have &quot;insider information.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Jr.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> used to be a Goldman executive; predecessor </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Robert Rubin </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">works at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Citigroup</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; their colleagues advise </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Barack </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">John </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">McCain</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. No wonder, Guillen says, that they're in position to buy up troubled bank assets at bargain prices, bailout or no. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it will be best for U.S. business and consumers if European and Asian banks also join the buyouts, Guillen added. &quot;Commercial banks in the U.S. are not very good by international standards. They are not efficient,&quot; Guillen said. &quot;The good retail banks are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">HSBC, ING Group,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Japanese, Canadian and Spanish banks. It would be great for the U.S. retail sector if those banks would come in.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panic aside, if U.S. budget and trade deficits continue, the dollar is expected over time to lose ground as the world's investment and reserve currency. That means &quot;interest rates in the U.S. will be slightly higher,&quot; said Guillen. &quot;And U.S. influence in global financial affairs and even political affairs is going to wane. Standards of living in the U.S. are going to suffer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I would not underestimate the ability of the U.S. financial system to adjust. It's brutal, but the beauty is it's flexible. ... Two or three years down the road, we will be talking about a different situation. But there will be a lot of pain, a lot of people losing their jobs and trying to find other ones, until then.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Student model? Student lender </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">SLM Corp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sallie Mae</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) may be pointing the way to the end of the bond-market crisis, without a government bailout. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time since the bond markets started jamming in early 2007, SLM is &quot;testing the waters&quot; of the asset-backed securities market, laying plans to sell bonds backed by student-loan payments, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">analysts </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Matt Snowling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bill Jackson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">wrote in a report yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means SLM will have more cash to make new student loans. But it also means more expensive student loans, since bondholders are demanding higher payback in today's volatile markets. It also means SLM will demand better credit from borrowers, the analysts note. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's how the bond market prices will end: Rates will increase; sellers will demand better credit from borrowers, and will give investors better information. More confidence, and better trading, until the next cycle. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. She got on a plane eight months pregnant and then after her water broke, got on another plane and flew eight more hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A case of bad judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. She belongs to a church that believes the end of the earth is near. Is the type of person who should be in the vicinity of the nuclear football?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. She lied about the Bridge to Nowhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. As mayor of a small town, she inherited a balanced budget and left the town millions in debt and her hockey rink is still tied up in litigation destined to cost millions more. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. She doesn't believe in global warming, which puts 90 percent of the species on earth at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can we afford to take the chance science is wrong?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Her environmental record is pitiful. The lake she lives on is dead. Would you expect from someone who hunts wolves from a copter with an AK-47?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Last spring, Barack Obama holed up in a Center City hotel room and crafted the most important speech of his life. How that address came to be-and how people reacted to it-says as much about us as it does about him<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the beginning, back in the summer of 2004, Barack Obama spoke himself into existence. With a single speech before the Democratic convention, he took form in the American consciousness: &quot;Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it&quot;-here he placed his hand over his heart-&quot;my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that phrase he tilted straight at his unexpected name and skin color, and set himself apart from all other stars in the political firmament-a zig set against a predominant union of zags.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He ascended. The rise happened almost without pause until this past March, midway through the primary season, when video surfaced of Obama's longtime pastor and friend, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, exercising his right to free speech with a particular vigor. Among other things, he referred to the tragedy of September 11th, saying &quot;America's chickens are coming home to roost,&quot; and admonished his congregation to sing &quot;God DAMN America.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political poison. Unavoidable catastrophe. How, people wondered, could Obama possibly distance himself from his lethal cleric? How could any speech cast Jeremiah Wright from the earth, hide him behind the moon, push him into the silence and darkness of the void?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's candidacy, whatever may come of it, pivoted on the moment. And so the speech he gave in response bears examination, from the series of crises and decisions that created it, to the role Philadelphia played in its final form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I learned recently that at the National Constitution Center-the site Obama would eventually choose to deliver his talk-a staff worker had kept the speech. Not a video, or an audio clip, but the physical speech itself, swiped afterward from the candidate's lectern. I wanted to see it, because in a field of almost universal abstraction, here we find the promise of a measurable artifact. Something with weight and displacement and, perhaps, some revelation about its creator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Constitution Center, Steve Frank, the head of exhibits, led me into the sheetrock caverns beneath the deceptively enormous building. We walked through a maze of hallways, stairwells, and doors requiring electronic codes, and finally arrived in a room of beiges and grays: the center's storage room, which seemed designed to lull to sleep any potential cat burglar. A row of file cabinets stood along one wall, and Frank opened the putty-_colored doors of Cabinet 1A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cabinet 1A, it turned out, serves as a sort of odds-and-ends bin for history. It holds, for instance, Franklin Roosevelt's fedora, the familiar hat from countless textbook photos, which the archivist warned me against trying on. (Roosevelt, for what it's worth, had a remarkably small head.) And Cabinet 1A holds other treasures on its shelves: an early printing of Irving Berlin's sheet music for &quot;God Bless America,&quot; for example, and the first public, printed copy of the Constitution, published by the _Pennfylvania Packet just days after the Founding Fathers drafted it, a block away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And somewhere, in Cabinet 1A, there waited Barack Obama's speech on race in America, delivered at 10:53 in the morning on March 18th, 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To understand where, exactly, Obama's speech belongs on the shelves of Cabinet 1A-where it fits into history-we've got to tumble back to a time when men really did climb onto stumps to shout out their thoughts. The question of presidential eloquence and substance-or, some would say, eloquence vs. substance-is as old as the job itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his farewell address, George Washington set the tone for his successors with sweeping turns of phrase. &quot;Citizens by birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to concentrate your affections,&quot; he hollered beautifully. &quot;The name of American, which belongs to you, in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of Patriotism, more than any appellation derived from local discriminations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, Abraham Lincoln delivered an address at Gettysburg that stands today as perhaps the finest presidential speech ever. He did it in 10 sentences so lapidary-so carved-they almost defy excerption. But here is one elegiac passage: &quot;Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later still, a thunderous Theodore Roosevelt called the presidential podium his &quot;bully pulpit,&quot; from which he did not engage in the now-popular &quot;conversation&quot; with the people, but unabashedly talked at them. Consider this, from a lecture on conservation of natural resources: &quot;So any nation which in its youth lives only for the day, reaps without sowing, and consumes without husbanding, must expect the penalty of the prodigal whose labor could with difficulty find him the bare means of life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's worth noting that Roosevelt delivered that piece of hardy rhetoric to a group of schoolchildren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And lastly, in tidy parallel, Franklin D. Roosevelt doffed his fedora and gave one of his most famous speeches before the Democratic convention in 1936-in Philadelphia. &quot;Governments can err, presidents do make mistakes,&quot; he said, &quot;but the immortal Dante tells us that divine justice weighs the sins of the cold-blooded and the sins of the warmhearted in different scales.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So where did this sort of presidential expression go? And would we, as Americans, put up with it today?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elvin Lim, a professor at Wesleyan University, has devised a way to measure the speech of presidents throughout history, and his findings are bleak. Roosevelt and his contemporaries spoke at the collegiate level; modern presidents offer speeches at eighth-grade level (George W. Bush is, perhaps to his own surprise, not the worst); and when that much time has passed again, Lim says, our presidents will use the language of elementary  - school children. Children who are, that is, barely literate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lim writes in his recently published book The Anti-Intellectual Presidency that every president wants to be regarded as a man of the people, and that &quot;the more presidents simplify, the further their successors must go.&quot; That's why Bush swore, after his failed bid for Congress in 1978, to &quot;never get out-countried again.&quot; And he wasn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I ask Lim whether simpler might be better than ornate, and he cites Albert Einstein: &quot;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another century or so, Lim believes, American presidents will try to squeeze political ideals-notions of vast importance, complex matters of life and death-into the &quot;language of comic books.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, I tell him, there's evidence it may not take that long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider, for instance, the following comic books, due to arrive in bookstores this month: On one cover, square-jawed John McCain stands facing the right, outlined with a faint hint of red, before a super-sized American flag. And Obama, on another cover, stands facing the left, outlined in blue, also before a massive flag. McCain wears pinstripes and a smile; Obama, a solid two-piece with an equally determined chin. Both stand with fists on hips, suit buttons straining in the Clark Kent style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I sort of threw it out there as a joke one day during an editorial staff meeting, and everybody laughed. Then I thought, hey, maybe that's not such a bad idea,&quot; says Scott Dunbier, special projects editor of IDW Publishing, one of the country's largest comic-book makers, after Marvel and DC. The joke became a run of comics about the two candidates, their backgrounds and their positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we've done our job right, then we're helping to inform people,&quot; Dunbier says. The comics are 32 pages each, he says, and &quot;We put a Rock the Vote ad on the back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunbier seems devoted to doing a fair, accurate job. But can he imagine, say, Teddy Roosevelt, as he sought to persuade the American public of the need to dig the Panama Canal-a task so grand and complicated that it lasted into Woodrow Wilson's presidency-holding aloft a comic book?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, no, but 20 years ago, if you had asked me to imagine the Internet, I couldn't have done that,&quot; Dunbier says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I ask Lim, the presidential scholar, to respond. After a moment of silence, he says, &quot;There are ideas that won't fit into the little boxes of comic books.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the Republican and Democratic national conventions, I got a press release from a website called Campaign.com. The release was titled &quot;Voting Is a Superpower,&quot; and it noted the efforts of two people named Campaign Boy and Campaign Girl to get out the vote while wearing superhero costumes with top hats and capes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People don't want a lot of policy and statistics,&quot; Campaign Boy, also known as Michael Jonas, told me during the Republican convention. &quot;People get bored. This simplifies the political process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boy and Girl seem to be serious people. Boy, 23, is a student at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, and spoke with familiarity of the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858. And Girl, a 28-year-old Pennsylvania native named Elizabeth Ireland, writes for San Diego's NBC news affiliate. So why the superhero ruse?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A necessary evil,&quot; Boy said. &quot;Otherwise, people won't listen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On their website, Campaign Boy and Girl have posted an interview with a man who said he planned to vote in November. &quot;This Obama guy, he's cool,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign Boy asked: Does Obama have superpowers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not know that much about the man,&quot; the voter said. &quot;He has the ability to lift people up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Campaign Boy, the voter wore his own superhero outfit, complete with cape. This simplifies matters for today's presidential candidates; they need not practice any public-speaking mental tricks to feel at ease before a crowd. Much of their audience has shown up already, wearing its underwear on the outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For better or worse, the world received the prophecies of Jeremiah Wright-_himself a Philadelphia native_-through one of the &quot;little boxes&quot; of our day: online video clips. There, his miniature likeness called out &quot;the U.S. of KKKA,&quot; and all the rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About the time the scandal first took shape, a team of people called the National Constitution Center and said they'd like to rent the auditorium. The team represented someone who preferred to remain _anonymous-all very cloak-and-dagger-but said they'd like to tour the facilities. Only later did they acknowledge they represented someone who worked in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And finally, after a thorough tour, they named Obama as their sender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a slow undressing,&quot; says Joe Torsella, the center's CEO. The Obama team said the Senator planned to deliver a speech on foreign policy on March 18th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama faced mounting obstacles, though: Hillary Clinton led him in polls at the time, and he faced a yawning stretch between primary votes in Mississippi and Pennsylvania with nothing to occupy people's minds but his self-immolating pastor. Perhaps foreign policy could wait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A couple of days before the planned speech, State Representative Josh Shapiro of Montgomery County received a call from Obama advisers. &quot;They said he was planning this speech to outline race relations, and they were looking for any input,&quot; says Shapiro. &quot;Where things stood, there were just a few [Wright] snippets on YouTube and Fox News, so the politically convenient thing to do would have been to throw his pastor and his church under the bus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, March 15th, Barack Obama dictated a general outline of his speech to Jon Favreau, his head speechwriter. (Through a campaign spokesman, Favreau, who is unrelated to the actor of the same name, declined to speak about his role in the speech.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, Favreau presented Obama with a fuller version. Sunday night, the Senator worked to rewrite it from about 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. the next day, Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That day-the final day before the speech itself-Obama slept for a few hours, then made various campaign stops around Pennsylvania. About 9:30 that night, he returned to the speech, working in his room at the Sheraton Hotel at 17th and Race streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went to sleep,&quot; says David Axelrod, Obama's chief strategist. &quot;I woke up at 2 a.m. Tuesday, and the finished speech was on my BlackBerry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama made the most of his setting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a Constitutional lawyer, he knew well the significance of Philadelphia's history, and-forced to react to Reverend Wright-chose not just to use the city as a backdrop for his speech, but to weave it into the fabric of the speech itself.  The setting offered him a pretext to reach deep into the country's history, to evoke the otherwise less reachable Founding Fathers, giving the speech the grandness it needed. He wouldn't merely address his pastor's racial comments; he would address race itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was dealing with a fundamental and long-standing issue that has gnawed at our country, one we've been wrestling with for the entire history of our country,&quot; Axelrod says. &quot;What better place to deal with it than right there at the Constitution Center?&quot; Nothing could have suited Barack Obama better. Most politicians would run from any scandal involving race, but thanks to Philadelphia's historical foundations, Obama could charge directly at the subject. As he had done in 2004, he would zig against the expected zag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He certainly provided a contrast to his surroundings at the Constitution Center. In its main hall, campaign staffers struggled to accommodate the multitude of journalists who, sensing the importance of the moment, overwhelmed Obama's staff with requests for credentials. In the audience, Congressman Patrick Murphy and Chaka Fattah and other politicians were seated. Backstage, where Obama waited to enter the auditorium, tense and excited politicos surrounded him_-Harris and Dan Wofford, Michelle Obama-but Obama, by all accounts, remained placid. &quot;He has this tremendous sense of calm about himself,&quot; Shapiro says. Meanwhile, at Obama's side, one local politician-overcome by tension, or the excitement-hyperventilated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The auditorium stage bore eight American flags, and when Obama began his speech, he went straight to the historical gravity of the setting:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'We the people, in order to form a more perfect union,'&quot; he began. &quot;Two hundred and 21 years ago, in a hall that still stands across the street, a group of men gathered and, with these simple words, launched America's improbable experiment in democracy. Farmers and scholars, statesmen and patriots who had traveled across the ocean to escape tyranny and persecution finally made real their declaration of independence at a Philadelphia convention that lasted through the spring of 1787. The document they produced was eventually signed but ultimately unfinished. It was stained by this nation's original sin of slavery. ... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with that, Obama had laid a Philadelphian foundation from which he could address Reverend Wright not from a defensive crouch, but from the great height and distance of history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers across the political spectrum say that whether he's right or wrong, Obama delivers speeches with more panache than any other modern politician. He's the best. So it's worth dwelling, for a moment, on the tools he employs when he speaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The literary devices have esoteric names-conduplicatio, anaphora, epistrophe, mesodiplosis-but readers and listeners don't need to know them; the devices make their appeal at the visceral level, through repetition and rhythm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many political speakers have a gesture they return to again and again, sometimes to the point of caricature. Think of Bill Clinton's thumb peeping from his fist, or either Bush president with arms held out and palms facing his chest, as though embracing an invisible person. Obama seems to have a broader arsenal, tailored to the tone of a passage: the hand over heart for a moment of emotion; the tips of thumb and middle finger touched together during a professorial point; reaching out to place invisible words in the air before him, to _isolate a key phrase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a mixture of the purposeful and the natural,&quot; says Shel Leanne, who recently published a book on speaking called Say It Like Obama. &quot;He does use those devices, but he has a powerful delivery that's difficult to teach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama had spent two decades in his Chicago church, where he picked up and refined the techniques of black pastors past and present-the rising and falling, the swelling and receding, the subtle inflections and emphases that, together, set his style apart. That's why the spirit of Reverend Wright infused not only the subject of Obama's speech in Philadelphia, but the delivery of every passage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama disavowed Wright's comments during his speech, but famously continued: &quot;I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community. I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother. ... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead he embarked on a bold tour of all racial discord in America. Anger in the black community, he said, is justified by decades of &quot;humiliation and doubt and fear.&quot; And likewise, he said, resentment by white Americans is &quot;grounded in legitimate concerns.&quot; He gave examples of each, and causes. Then he offered a solution, in the form of his candidacy: &quot;But I have asserted a firm conviction, a conviction rooted in my faith in God and my faith in the American people, that, working together, we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds and that, in fact, we have no choice-we have no choice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To even attempt such a feat required a shocking audacity: to both call upon and admonish the Founding Fathers, to criticize both whites and blacks for their prejudices, then to simultaneously empathize with both groups' indignations, and to finally offer by implication his own presidency as a step toward reconciliation. It's impossible to say yet whether he pulled it off entirely. But the speech certainly achieved the lesser and more immediate goal: It saved the Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, however, his opponents say, the small matter of being right. In the first of his two most important speeches, his beautiful 2004 address before the Democratic National Convention, Obama concluded, &quot;The people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be sworn in as president, and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president.&quot; But, of course, they weren't. And then, during the second of his two greatest speeches, he built an argument that Reverend Wright's vitriol was understandable when viewed through the prism of America's past. But, of course, it wasn't. And so Obama did indeed disown the pastor a month after the speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those seem like details, somehow, that exist only in the shadows of the two speeches. And perhaps that's the nexus where style meets substance. Where eloquence becomes element. In a job where war and peace turn on persuasion-of friends, enemies, countrymen-Barack Obama may be uniquely qualified. That's because, according to presidential scholar Elvin Lim, he manages to sound both professorial and platitudinous. To a population used to eighth-grade rhetoric, the gorgeous loops and rhythms of Obama's oratory are intellectually dazzling. And yet his popular, ever-simple phrases-&quot;Yes we can&quot;-reduce the message to something a toddler could grasp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is Janus-like in his language,&quot; Lim says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next to Roosevelt's fedora in Cabinet 1A, standing forever in a storage room beneath the Constitution Center, lies the speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had secretly hoped to blow off the dust and discover pages covered with hand-scrawled notes that might reveal something of Obama the orator. Something of his process, his style, his method. Instead, the caretaker removed this: a black plastic binder from a Staples office-supply store-the one at 15th and Chestnut, in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It held a sheath of plastic-sleeved pages filled with impersonal laser-printed words. About two hours before the speech, an aide had run to the supply store and printed it out in oversize letters, for easy readability in case Obama's teleprompter failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in some way, the binder, set as it was amidst the hat, the music and the early printed Constitution, did reveal something of Obama the orator. It placed him and his style-smooth, modern, oversized for easy access-into the context of American history. He is not yet, in the sense of Lincoln and Roosevelt, a great speaker. He is merely the best we have.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As lawmakers dashed home to explain themselves to voters as perplexed as they were angry at the credit-market meltdown and the House's decision to reject a bailout package, John Gorenc got on the phone to members of Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I called Altmire and Murphy and even Murtha,&quot; said Mr. Gorenc, a Vietnam veteran who lives in Clinton, and who had spent part of the day arguing with a friend about what -- if anything -- to do about the bad mortgages and Swiss cheese investment packages now threatening to sink the market. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gorenc asked if, just this once, the simplest solution might not be the right one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What would be the simplest way?&quot; he said. &quot;Let them drown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He paused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's one thing to let them drown, but who do they drag down with them?&quot; That was the question that hung over the Capitol yesterday for the men and women assigned to sort through a mess as hard to define as it is to solve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The worst thing we can do right now is nothing, and if someone has a better idea, they better put it on the table quickly,&quot; said Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., a Senate Banking Committee member who said he thinks the Senate &quot;would have passed this tomorrow&quot; if the House had put the bill through Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it was, Congress didn't even get close to passing the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The bill failed 228-205.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those voting against it were two of the congressmen whom Mr. Gorenc phoned: Reps. Jason Altmire, D-McCandless, and Tim Murphy, R-Upper St. Clair. Rep. John Murtha, the Democratic leadership veteran from Johnstown, voted in favor of the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential candidates Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Barack Obama of Illinois both weighed in on the crisis yesterday, with suggestions ranging from limits on golden parachutes to substantially increasing the amount of savings guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., from $100,000 to $250,000 -- a move aimed at helping small businesses. Both men also stopped using the term &quot;bailout,&quot; talking instead about a &quot;rescue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chairman asked Congress for temporary authority to raise the limit by an unspecified amount. That could help ease a crisis of confidence in the banking system, said Chairman Sheila Bair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush spoke with both nominees during the day and made another statement at the White House. &quot;Congress must act,&quot; he demanded in front of the cameras. &quot;I recognize this is a difficult vote for members of Congress,&quot; he said. &quot;But the reality is we are in an urgent situation, and the consequences will grow worse each day if we do not act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a perfect economic storm brewed on an election eve, congressional leaders scrambled yesterday to put forward another vote, with debate swirling among nervous House members -- all facing a Nov. 4 election -- on whether the bill needs to be substantially changed or simply better explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House signaled a willingness to accept some changes to the bill. Spokesman Tony Fratto said there are plenty of good ideas to help the financial markets, and &quot;we're going to look at all of those.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Rep. Phil English, an Erie Republican and perennial Democratic election target, Monday's &quot;no&quot; vote was based in part on a conviction that the commercial markets should do more for themselves, and a worry that Congress ceded too much of its oversight powers to the executive branch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm willing to look at almost anything that they're going to lay before us at this point. But I want to see internal controls,&quot; Mr. English said yesterday. &quot;I want to see some limits on how a future Treasury employs devices like this. This is a bailout that is the equivalent of 6 percent of GDP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. English has been a longstanding proponent of so-called &quot;profit repatriation,&quot; essentially a reduction of taxes or amnesty for profits that American firms hold in offshore accounts to avoid U.S. taxes. He believes that it could bring an estimated $350 billion into the U.S. market -- money he thinks could ease the deepening freeze on credit that threatens business growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like a greater confidence that we're not only going to be able to fix this thing using tax dollars, but also providing some pro-growth policies that lift the market and limit the damage,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans -- rank-and-file members who balked at the administration's bailout proposal -- have also called for changes in federal law that currently require banks to mark down the value of assets that have fluctuated over the course of a year, the so-called &quot;mark-to-market&quot; rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, banks holding commercial paper --say, real estate -- that dramatically drops in market valuation must rush to the credit markets for cash reserves they are required by law to keep on hand. Those reserves are a set percentage of monies the banks have lent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mr. English and Rep. Bill Shuster, R-Blair, said they want changes in the law to allow banks to average out those valuation estimates, effectively giving them wiggle room to meet reserve requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some other members who opposed the bill want even more ambitious changes, far from the tweaks hinted at yesterday by House leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Part of what I see that has contributed to this spindown in the marketplace has been the cost of energy and manufacturing in this country,&quot; said Mr. Murphy, the South Hills Republican who joined Mr. Shuster and Mr. English in voting no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Murphy said the House should consider somehow tying the rescue bill to energy investments that he said would spur job growth, be they a boost in offshore drilling or coal-generating technologies. &quot;Then you'd have some real value connected with this,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As dissenters debated what to do with the failed bill, one of its principal supporters, Pennsylvania's Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Luzerne, chairman of the House's subcommittee on capital markets, said he was working with leaders on a revised bill, but hinted that there was a limit to what could be done. &quot;We can also consider additional provisions to improve the legislation,&quot; he said. &quot;But I caution my colleagues that during this economic crisis is not the time to let the perfect become the enemy of the good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such ambitious proposals also worry Mr. Casey, who said too many additions to the bill could potentially frighten off some of the previous supporters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- As lawmakers dashed home to explain themselves to voters as perplexed as they were angry at the credit-market meltdown and the House's decision to reject a bailout package, John Gorenc got on the phone to members of Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I called Altmire and Murphy and even Murtha,&quot; said Mr. Gorenc, a Vietnam veteran who lives in Clinton, and who had spent part of the day arguing with a friend about what -- if anything -- to do about the bad mortgages and Swiss cheese investment packages now threatening to sink the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gorenc asked if, just this once, the simplest solution might not be the right one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What would be the simplest way?&quot; he said. &quot;Let them drown.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He paused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's one thing to let them drown, but who do they drag down with them?&quot; That was the question that hung over the Capitol yesterday for the men and women assigned to sort through a mess as hard to define as it is to solve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The worst thing we can do right now is nothing, and if someone has a better idea, they better put it on the table quickly,&quot; said Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., a Senate Banking Committee member who said he thinks the Senate &quot;would have passed this tomorrow&quot; if the House had put the bill through Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it was, Congress didn't even get close to passing the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The bill failed 228-205.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those voting against it were two of the congressmen whom Mr. Gorenc phoned: Reps. Jason Altmire, D-McCandless, and Tim Murphy, R-Upper St. Clair. Rep. John Murtha, the Democratic leadership veteran from Johnstown, voted in favor of the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential candidates Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Barack Obama of Illinois both weighed in on the crisis yesterday, with suggestions ranging from limits on golden parachutes to substantially increasing the amount of savings guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., from $100,000 to $250,000 -- a move aimed at helping small businesses. Both men also stopped using the term &quot;bailout,&quot; talking instead about a &quot;rescue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chairman asked Congress for temporary authority to raise the limit by an unspecified amount. That could help ease a crisis of confidence in the banking system, said Chairman Sheila Bair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush spoke with both nominees during the day and made another statement at the White House. &quot;Congress must act,&quot; he demanded in front of the cameras. &quot;I recognize this is a difficult vote for members of Congress,&quot; he said. &quot;But the reality is we are in an urgent situation, and the consequences will grow worse each day if we do not act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a perfect economic storm brewed on an election eve, congressional leaders scrambled yesterday to put forward another vote, with debate swirling among nervous House members -- all facing a Nov. 4 election -- on whether the bill needs to be substantially changed or simply better explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House signaled a willingness to accept some changes to the bill. Spokesman Tony Fratto said there are plenty of good ideas to help the financial markets, and &quot;we're going to look at all of those.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, Senate leaders scheduled a vote for tonight on a version of the bill that adds substantial tax cuts meant to appeal to Republicans when it reaches the House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal is to net at least 12 more House votes than the rescue proposal received Monday, when lawmakers rocked the political and financial worlds by rejecting it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Rep. Phil English, an Erie Republican and perennial Democratic election target, Monday's &quot;no&quot; vote was based in part on a conviction that the commercial markets should do more for themselves, and a worry that Congress ceded too much of its oversight powers to the executive branch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm willing to look at almost anything that they're going to lay before us at this point. But I want to see internal controls,&quot; Mr. English said yesterday. &quot;I want to see some limits on how a future Treasury employs devices like this. This is a bailout that is the equivalent of 6 percent of GDP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. English has been a proponent of &quot;profit repatriation,&quot; essentially a reduction of taxes or amnesty for profits that American firms hold in offshore accounts to avoid U.S. taxes. He believes that it could bring an estimated $350 billion into the U.S. market -- money he thinks could ease the deepening freeze on credit that threatens business growth. &quot;I'd like a greater confidence that we're not only going to be able to fix this thing using tax dollars, but also providing some pro-growth policies that lift the market and limit the damage,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans -- rank-and-file members who balked at the administration's bailout proposal -- have also called for changes in federal law that currently require banks to mark down the value of assets that have fluctuated over the course of a year, the so-called &quot;mark-to-market&quot; rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, banks holding commercial paper --say, real estate -- that dramatically drops in market valuation must rush to the credit markets for cash reserves they are required by law to keep on hand. Those reserves are a set percentage of monies the banks have lent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mr. English and Rep. Bill Shuster, R-Blair, said they want changes in the law to allow banks to average out those valuation estimates, effectively giving them wiggle room to meet reserve requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some members who opposed the bill want more ambitious changes, far from the tweaks hinted at yesterday by House leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Part of what I see that has contributed to this spindown in the marketplace has been the cost of energy and manufacturing in this country,&quot; said Mr. Murphy, the South Hills Republican who joined Mr. Shuster and Mr. English in voting no. Mr. Murphy said the House should consider somehow tying the rescue bill to energy investments that he said would spur job growth, be they a boost in offshore drilling or coal-generating technologies. &quot;Then you'd have some real value connected with this,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time for another peek inside the e-mail bag. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You really should do a little research before you put garbage like what you wrote about Aaric Murray and La Salle in print.&nbsp;Your implication that Aaric is stupid (the doorknob comment was particularly offensive) and that La Salle lowered their standards to accept him  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was really uncalled for, and for that, they deserve an apology.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sorry we can't all be as &quot;intelligent&quot; as you. Maybe you should go back into politics.&nbsp;You seem perfectly suited for it. Hard to believe that an alum would write something like this about his alma mater and another future alum. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c10">Kevin, I wasn't calling Aaric Murray stupid at all. I was satirizing his comments about La Salle. The interview he did with Comcast SportsNet made me laugh because he was quite clearly implying that he could do far better than La Salle. He was indicting the school. Not me. (Though, in truth, I have been known to do that in the past.)  As for the doorknob line, that wasn't directed at Murray. That was directed at the fictional students who might see the CHI Institute/La Salle </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">commercial</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> and think, &quot;Hey, that's me!&quot; Again, all meant to point out that Murray's words made La Salle sound like a second-rate option. Re: going back into politics. Doubtful. I was &quot;in politics&quot; for about an hour and a half, and when it was over, my wallet was gone.  Gonzo </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liked your column about the Phils winning the division. The part about your&nbsp;friend in the press box saying that Lidge might blow it made me laugh. (I'm assuming he's your friend - the punch-him-in-the-face stuff&nbsp;was tongue in cheek, right?)&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;I'm curious, do you get flak from people about being a fan? Because you are, right? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alex </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c10">Alex, Yes, the guy in the press box - John Finger - is a friend. I wouldn't actually punch him (probably). And, yes, I'm a fan. Not so much of the players - who come and go, and some of&nbsp;whom can be deeply unpleasant - but of the laundry. I'm from here, and I grew up rooting for these teams. I want to experience a championship as much as anyone. I think the city has earned it. To my mind, there are two kinds of reporters. The ones who legitimately aren't fans, for whatever reason, and the guys who pretend not to care, but secretly do, because they think it lends credibility. I never understood that. If you're a fan here, you're as likely to criticize the teams as you are to praise them. Fans here are honest brokers about what they're thinking. So why pretend? It's disingenuous.  God, I just reread that. So earnest. Ugh. Forget Finger. Now I want to punch myself.  &nbsp;Gonzo </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, Gonzalez,&nbsp; after accidentally reading your column today, I realized again why I canceled my subscription to The Inquirer, along with hundreds of other people I know.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is nothing more pathetic than someone who tries to be funny but just exposes himself as a clueless moron, as you did. To refer to a genuine war hero (not a phony one like [John] Kerry, who wrote his own medals) as a &quot;curmudgeon&quot; is nothing less than a cruel, classless comment worthy of a fifth grader. With one notable exception, you fit in very well with the rest of those left-wing loons at The Inquirer. I wonder if you would have referred to Sen. [Frank] Lautenberg as a curmudgeon. I guess not; he is a liberal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then you guys at The Inquirer wonder why your paper, along with several others, is going out of business and down the tubes. Under excruciating torture, [John] McCain was asked for the names of his commanding officers. He replied by giving the North Vietnamese the names of the offensive line of the Green Bay Packers. That is my kind of guy. His honorable service deserves better than what a jackass like you wrote about him.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c10">George, Lemme guess: You're voting for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Obama?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Gonzo </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's our turn&quot;? You and Wax think it's our turn? For what??? To get swept by the Brewers? I've been a Phils fan too long to swallow such optimism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dare to dream.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chad </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c10">Chad, Being negative is hard work, and I'm tired. Not to mention it hasn't worked. I'm going the other way this time. If that doesn't work, either, no harm done - we're right back to where we started. Besides: Wax said it's the city's turn. All I did was say it made me smile. Be angry at him. He lives at 6- -, V - - - - Rd. in Consohocken. To fill in the blanks, send money. Gonzo </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wanted to drop you a quick line with regard to your article in which you &quot;revel in the Mets' misery.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a die-hard, transplanted Mets fan living in Center City, I was furious when I saw your headline.&nbsp; However, I owe you an apology.&nbsp;You hit the nail right on the head, exposing the misery that comes with being a Mets fan these past few years, especially a Mets fan living in the epicenter of the Phillies love fest. (Incidentally, I ran into Pat Burrell on the street last week and struck up a conversation.&nbsp; Much to my surprise - and chagrin? - he was actually a really nice guy.) In any event, the Phils played with heart and deserve to be where they are. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama proposed Tuesday that the government insure consumers' bank deposits up to $250,000 by raising the $100,000 federal limit as each sought to navigate the unpredictable politics of the financial crisis. Both sides also rolled out fresh advertisements tying the other to the Wall Street crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Avoiding the term &quot;bailout,&quot; the candidates said in separate statements that Congress must make another attempt to pass an economic &quot;rescue&quot; plan after the House defeated the Bush administration's $700 billion proposal amid widespread public disapproval of it. The 228-205 vote, with Republicans and Democrats alike dissenting, prompted the largest sell-off on Wall Street since the day after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We haven't convinced people that this is a rescue effort, not just for Wall Street but for Main Street America, for working families, for small businesses, the heartland of America -- all over America,&quot; McCain said on &quot;American Morning&quot; on CNN. &quot;We didn't do a good enough job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator said he recommended to President Bush on Tuesday morning that the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund of $250 billion be used to shore up institutions, that the limit on federally insured deposits be raised to $250,000 and that the Treasury exercise its ability to buy up $1 trillion in mortgages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also spoke to Bush Tuesday morning. In a statement earlier in the day, Obama said Congress should not start over as lawmakers consider their next move in the wake of the House's rejection of what he called &quot;the economic rescue plan.&quot; Said the Illinois senator: &quot;Given the progress we have made, I believe we are unlikely to succeed if we start from scratch or reopen negotiations about the core elements of the agreement. But in order to pass this plan, we must do more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OK for most: He said the current federal guarantee of up to $100,000 in bank deposit insurance, a limit set nearly 30 years ago, is adequate for most families but insufficient for many small businesses. Raising the limit to $250,000 &quot;would boost small businesses, make our banking system more secure and help restore public confidence in our financial system,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential campaign has become entirely about the financial crisis and who can best handle an economy in peril. Iraq, foreign policy, education and health care have largely fallen to the wayside as each campaign tries to chart a course to the presidency over the next five weeks in extraordinarily choppy economic waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's coming: Normally, campaign strategists can forecast what the political environment will look like and what the impact of a candidate's action or response will be -- and position their candidate accordingly to reap political benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not so when financial markets are involved. Their ups and downs are incredibly difficult to predict, making the fallout of each candidate's reaction to the crisis also difficult to know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both McCain and Obama are taking positions and making statements with every development in hopes of appearing wise come Nov. 4 -- and gaining political ground now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertising: In that vein, Obama and the Republican National Committee rolled out fresh TV ads on the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A two-minute Obama&nbsp;commercial promotes his economic plan and accuses McCain of following Bush's policies. &quot;I know that that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis,&quot; Obama says in the spot. &quot;But not by driving down the very same path.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can it get any worse?&quot; asks a new RNC commercial airing in six states. It says Obama's economic plan &quot;will make the problem worse&quot; with new taxes, new spending and new debt. The RNC launched its commercial using the word &quot;bailout&quot; in battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia, as well as Indiana, a Republican-leaning state where Obama has been on the air for months alone and has gained ground in polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Options for addressing the crisis are limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, it was of little surprise that both candidates voiced similar prescriptions on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., an independent federal agency created in 1933, insures deposits in banks and thrift institutions for at least $100,000. Premiums paid by member institutions and investment earnings in Treasury securities fund the agency, which has an insurance fund of more than $49 billion, according to its Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FDIC says it insures more than $3 trillion in deposits and already provides up to $250,000 in insurance for retirement accounts such as individual retirement accounts and Keoghs. A five-person bipartisan board of directors appointed by the president manages the agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September began as John McCain's month and ended as Barack Obama's. McCain's high-risk wagers aimed at shaking up the campaign turned into very bad investments. And Friday's debate eliminated McCain's best chance to deliver a knockout blow to an opponent whose most important asset may be his capacity for self-correction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is supposed to own the foreign policy issue -- and he should have owned Friday's debate. During their respective primary battles, McCain was a better debater than Obama, who could be hesitant, wordy and thrown off his stride. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Obama who showed up at Ole Miss was sharper and more concise than the man who frequently lost debates against his Democratic foes. He was also resolutely calm in standing his ground against McCain, whose condescension became a major talking point following the debate. If Al Gore suffered from his sighs during the 2000 debates, McCain will be remembered for his supercilious repetition of seven variations on &quot;Senator Obama doesn't understand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This gave special power to Obama's peroration about McCain's &quot;wrong&quot; judgments on going to war in Iraq. McCain's dismissal of Obama brought back memories of how advocates for the war arrogantly dismissed those who insisted (rightly, as it turned out) that the conflict would be far more difficult and costly than its architects suggested. McCain's derisive approach may help explain why the instant polls gave Obama an edge in a debate that many pundits rated a tie -- and why women seemed especially inclined toward Obama. CNN's survey found that 59 percent of women rated Obama as having done better, with just 31 percent saying that of McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Obama adviser who was watching a &quot;dial group&quot; -- in which viewers turn a device to express their feelings about a debate's every moment -- said that whenever McCain lectured or attacked Obama, the Republican's ratings would drop, and the fall was especially steep among women. But if the debate was indeed a tie -- and McCain certainly looked informed and engaged once the discussion moved from economics to foreign affairs -- this would count as a net gain for Obama. A foreign policy discussion afforded McCain his best opportunity to aggravate doubts about his foe. That opportunity is now gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the first 40 minutes devoted to the economic crisis, Obama was more forceful in addressing public anxieties. He used the occasion to tout his middle-class tax cut that a large share of the electorate doesn't even know he's proposing. Obama's campaign quickly went on the air with an ad noting that McCain did not once mention the words &quot;middle class&quot; during the discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus ends a month that began with such promise for McCain. His choice of Sarah Palin as a running mate at the end of August created a fortnight of excitement among Republican loyalists who were less than enthusiastic about McCain. Some said Palin would also enhance his appeal to women voters and help him recast his candidacy as a maverick's crusade. But it was a reckless choice. Palin has proved herself to be spectacularly unprepared for a national campaign and embarrassingly inarticulate and unreflective. She is held in protective custody by a campaign that trusts her less and less. A few conservatives suggested she should be dropped from the ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came McCain's abrupt foray into Washington's negotiations over a Wall Street bailout bill. His showy call for postponing Friday's debate was serenely rebuffed by Obama and McCain was forced to retreat. The candidate with 26 years of congressional experience lost a test of wills to an opponent with just four years on the national stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when McCain intervened in the rescue package discussions, his position on the matter was muddy. This champion of bipartisanship briefly stood up for a House Republican minority that was battling against a bipartisan accord largely accepted by his Senate Republican colleagues, and then pulled back. The McCain who had once allied with such liberals as Ted Kennedy and Russ Feingold was suddenly flirting with an approach to the economic rescue recommended by Newt Gingrich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The post-Labor Day period has thus brought the campaign to an unexpected point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, once the candidate of tested experience, must now battle the perception that he has become the riskier choice, a man too given to rash moves under pressure. Obama, whose very newness promised change but also raised doubts, has emerged as the cool and unruffled candidate who moves calmly but steadily forward. However one judges the first debate, it did nothing to block Obama's progress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He who frames the debate wins the debate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the heart of modern American politics. This is why the Republican Party wins more elections than its governing record would seem to justify. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does it mean to frame the debate? It involves something deeper than the shadings known as spin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spin dances across the terrain; framing defines it.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Win the framing war, and it's easier to spin even the most uncomfortable facts. Lose this war, and you forever slip, slide, and fumble uphill towards entrenched positions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You are, to put it another way, a Democrat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is framing, and why does it matter so? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, it's an essential human activity. The world is too vast, volatile and various for us to take it all in. We need to sort and cull data. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, it's an essential political skill. How does it work? Well, consider three common meanings of the verb </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">to frame.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Each has a political corollary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Framing a house: A house's wooden skeleton defines its basic shape and size, while allowing for design variety inside.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political framing means shaping a master narrative into which you fit your smaller, ad hoc issues. At this, Ronald Reagan was a great American master. We still live inside the core narrative he framed about American renewal through strength, moral clarity and reluctant government. This is what Barack Obama meant when he praised Reagan's political achievement - an achievement he would like to match and replace.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Framing the photo:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When you use a camera, you shape how others see the scene you shoot. You select the angle, put certain elements in sharp focus, relegate others to a fuzzy background, and shunt still others outside the frame altogether. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it is with political issues. Whoever builds the frame through which the public sees an issue gains an advantage. And in politics, frames are built out of language. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lakoff is a linguist who had a brief vogue among Democratic operatives after the 2004 election. In books such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Don't Think of an Elephant,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he explored how conservatives frame issues to their advantage. As a political guru, Lakoff proved inept, but his basic premise was sound: Words matter, and they work on subterranean as well as conscious levels. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take the phrase </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">tax relief,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a favored Lakoff example. What does one need relief from? A burden. The phrase dictates that taxes be seen as an onus to be lifted, not an essential act of a mature government. In any debate framed as &quot;Do you support tax relief?&quot; only one answer wins. Yes, I do.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Framing a person:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this legal usage, a frame discards, invents or arranges facts to indict a culprit.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In politics, it involves the quest to pin blame: Who lost Vietnam? Who lost control of our streets? Who caused the deficit? Who let 9/11 happen? Who failed New Orleans? Who enabled the mortgage meltdown? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such framing battles go to the swift and shameless. Tab a villain and you force the other guy to play defense. Harp on small facts that support your case, while pooh-poohing big ones that don't.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each side does this feverishly. Republicans do it better. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think this is all just semantics? Our use of words, Lakoff argues, actually rewires our brains, making them more receptive to messages that travel established neural pathways, and hostile to messages that must forge new paths. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is why facts bounce off frames. We hate it when a fact challenges an entrenched mental frame. We resist, we refuse.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, conservatives have deftly pounded home frames that imply a sharp character advantage for them over liberals.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin is such a hit with social conservatives because, compared to wooden John McCain, she's a whiz at invoking their favorite culture-war framings: conservatives' steadfast moral clarity vs. liberals' weak-kneed addiction to nuance; real people vs. arrogant experts; small-town goodness vs. big-city perfidy; doers vs. talkers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's Twin Cities triumph was an object lesson in how conservatives try to exploit the power of framing to enable cultural resentments to trump economic ones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats lose elections for lots of reasons. Too much corruption. Too many backward-looking solutions. But a top reason is their relative ineptitude when they try their hand at framing. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a rough two weeks, Republican John McCain entered Friday night's first debate looking for something that would change the dynamic of his race against Democrat Barack Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, he's still looking. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate did not qualify as a game-changing moment for McCain, who has struggled to find his footing ever since news of the financial crisis broke, transforming the contest in an instant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How and where he might create such a moment is hard to see right now. One possibility might be to oppose the final bailout package, the whole idea of which is extremely unpopular among large blocs of voters. But he appeared to rule that out in his comments Friday night.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though McCain was on the offensive for much of the debate - and received high marks from some analysts for his command of national security - overnight polls scored Obama the winner, 51 percent to 38 percent in a CNN poll, 39-24 in a CBS poll of undecided voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the value of such surveys, they make it highly unlikely that Sept. 26 was the night that the Republican nominee, who trails by an average of 4 points in the national polls, started to turn the election in his favor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the numbers suggest that Obama made progress in getting some key undecided voters - who are inclined to vote Democratic but feel uncomfortable with him personally - to envision him as their president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think last night we not only passed the commander-in-chief test, we flew by it,&quot; David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager, said yesterday in a conference call with reporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a top McCain adviser, expressed a different view in a television interview: &quot;There was only one person on the stage who was a president. He was John McCain.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, both campaigns moved swiftly to anticipate the next debate - between vice presidential candidates Sarah Palin, the Republican, and Democrat Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday - and to seize on what they perceived as the debate-related openings created by the other side. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama camp put out a new commercial titled &quot;Zero,&quot; which is the number of times McCain used the term </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">middle class</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in taking about the economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama made the same point in a speech to a rally in Greensboro, N.C. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The truth is, through 90 minutes of debating, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but he had nothing to say about you,&quot; the Democratic nominee told the crowd. &quot;He didn't even say the words </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">middle class</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Didn't say the words </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">working people</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see, I think Sen. McCain just doesn't get it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other settings, McCain has talked often about the economic squeeze being felt by the middle class. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, in a speech delivered by satellite to a sportsmen's group, McCain pointed to a word Obama hadn't used. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even as American troops are fighting on two fronts, Barack Obama couldn't bring himself to use the word </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">victory</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> even once,&quot; McCain said. &quot;. . . When Americans look at a candidate, they can tell the difference between mere self-confidence and an abiding confidence in our country.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also coming from the McCain side yesterday - the candidate himself was in Washington, working the phones on the financial rescue package - was a new television commercial focusing on a vote that Obama cast against funding the troops in Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad shows clips from 2007 in which Biden, then and now a Democratic senator from Delaware, criticized those who voted against the funding. As Obama's picture appears on the screen, an announcer says: &quot;Playing politics. Risking lives. Not ready to lead.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said during the debate that he cast that vote because the bill in question included no timetable for withdrawing troops from Iraq. He voted in favor of funding the troops on numerous other occasions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain opposed a 2007 emergency spending bill that would have funded the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; he opposed it because it contained a timetable for withdrawal of troops from Iraq. At McCain's urging, President Bush vetoed the bill. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from the substance of the debate, Obama's aides say their man won on style, in a way that feeds into recent events. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the overnight polls and in various focus groups, most debate viewers said they viewed Obama as cool and steady, which is how his aides characterize his behavior during the financial crisis. Early in the crisis, Obama laid out a set of principles that he said should guide any federal action, and he has stuck to them.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrast that to McCain, who had an edgier quality in the debate, rarely looking at his opponent or otherwise acknowledging his presence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That and McCain's various reactions to the financial crisis over the last two weeks - saying the economic fundamentals were strong, calling for a study commission, advocating the firing of the chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission, proposing a new government agency, suspending his campaign, going to Washington, and resuming his campaign without a rescue agreement - emboldened two Obama aides to use the word </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">erratic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> yesterday in describing him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a not-so-subtle attempt by the Obama campaign to suggest that McCain, who can be fiery at times, might not be temperamentally suited to be president of the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's aides say that's absurd. Said spokesman Tucker Bounds: &quot;John McCain spent his week fighting for American taxpayers, he's spent his career fighting to change Washington, and he spent last night proving that a record of change and reform is more powerful than just talking about it.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he has the next 37 days to do something about the political trends that are working against him. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a lot of talk, most of it silly, about the dynamics at play as we head toward October in the presidential campaign. Maybe there's virtue in cutting away a lot of the chaff by describing the state of play in a sentence: Voters are coming home, because events are nudging them there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's about time. This is an important election, this is a symbolic election, this is a high-intensity election, this is a high-interest election. Until now it was also an odd election: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican base, which since 1980 has included religious conservatives, was alienated; the nominee wasn't one of their own, and had little affinity for them. The Democratic base, which since 1932 has included blue-collar and unionized voters, was equally unsettled; the nominee, though raised by a single striving mother, was struggling to reach these voters, who had been moved more deeply by Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton than by him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, for most of 2008, the presidential campaign has been conducted under the political equivalent of a climatic inversion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John S. McCain was talking about the evils of big business and its lobbyists, which first sent waves of shock and then waves of panic across the Republican pond. At the same time, Ms. Clinton, for most of her time in the national spotlight a poster child for Ivy elitism and upper-middle-class feminism, had transformed herself into a fighter-for-the-people in the Hubert H. Humphrey mold while Sen. Barack Obama, who was reared in far more gritty circumstances, found himself imprisoned in an image that cast him as a modern-day Adlai Stevenson, not quite sardonic but not quite a man of the people either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That phase is over, and there are two reasons: Sarah Palin. Economic upheaval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The selection of Gov. Palin brought an end to Mr. McCain's problems with religious conservatives. Like President Bush, Ms. Palin isn't merely appealing to religious conservatives; she is one. The press's inquiries into Ms. Palin's views and the airborne invasion of reporters into Alaska (target: Wasilla) may have sowed doubt among undecided voters but they removed any doubt among believers. Mr. McCain is now free to move about the country, unencumbered by worries about religious conservatives sitting on their hands. Those hands have been busy lately, applauding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the weeks following the selection of Ms. Palin, Democratic hands have been wringing in worry. There is no recent example of a presidential campaign being so flummoxed in the face of its rivals' maneuvers; it was as if the Obama campaign had adopted radio silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's over, too. Just as the Palin nomination swept away all the pumped-up enthusiasm of the Democrats' Denver stadium rally, the terrifying extremes of the markets and the rout in the financial sector of the economy -- toppling some of the icons of Wall Street, diminishing others, transforming those that survived from investment bankers into commercial bankers -- have placed the contretemps about Ms. Palin's former brother-in-law on the news bridge-to-nowhere. Suddenly, it's the economy, again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That plays to Mr. Obama's strength in November, even though the economy surely is not Mr. Obama's strength personally (nor Mr. McCain's, which doesn't help the Republicans trying to flee the record of President Bush). Though Mr. Obama's remarks on the economic tumult are only peripherally different from those of Mr. McCain -- more emphasis on the homeowners who hold mortgages than on the financial institutions that own the mortgages, plus he's talking about middle-class tax breaks as part of an economic-stimulus package -- he is the principal beneficiary of the economic stress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has business bigwigs on his team and on his donor lists, to be sure, but his camp is emphasizing that the Democrats aren't responsible for the mess, that the Republicans can't clean up the mess and that the mess isn't going to go away unless Washington recognizes what Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and others are saying with their actions: The magic of the markets has its limits and government has an important role to play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is good for Mr. Obama because suddenly he no longer has to worry about the traditional Democrats who voted for Mrs. Clinton and shunned him in the primaries; few are likely to flock into Republican arms, even those held out at arms' length (or more) from President Bush. Much like Mr. McCain's choice of Ms. Palin firmed up his support among religious conservatives, events have conspired to solidify Mr. Obama's base and give him more elbow room as the campaign proceeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men now seem liberated -- but in fact they are liberated mostly to return to the position that party nominees customarily occupy in American politics, with the Republican seen as stronger on national security and with the Democrat seen as more effective on economic issues. (Ronald Reagan pulled the trick of being seen as both, which was one reason there were so many Reagan Democrats.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watch politics return to a natural equilibrium: The latest Zogby Interactive poll shows twice as many likely voters believing Mr. McCain is a better potential commander-in-chief, while Mr. Obama is viewed more as the competent manager, problem solver and in sync with the average person. That may explain Mr. McCain's midweek call for a suspension of the campaign; equilibrium is the enemy of insurgencies such as his.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This campaign has had several jolts -- the latest ones put Mr. Obama ahead of Mr. McCain by 9 points, according to a recent Washington Post-ABC News Poll -- but the nature of this campaign suggests that more jolts may follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing to remember as we go forward: Neither candidate was the favorite to win his party's nomination. The nominees, watching the voters come back to their traditional musings, are practiced in the art of coming back themselves. More to come.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to put out a fire by pouring gasoline on it, so many are amazed the Obama campaign is employing this technique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fire that Sen. Barack Obama wants to douse was small until his aides arrived with gas cans. For months, conservatives have been trying to direct attention to the relationship between Mr. Obama and William Ayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ayers was a leader of the Weather Underground, which planted bombs in the U.S. Capitol and the Pentagon during the Vietnam War. He went on the lam after a nail bomb his group was building to kill soldiers and their wives at a dance at Fort Dix went off prematurely, killing three of the conspirators. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ayers was never prosecuted because of FBI misconduct. He became a professor of education at the University of Illinois-Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't regret setting bombs,&quot; Mr. Ayers told the New York Times in an interview published on 9/11. &quot;I feel we didn't do enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked about Mr. Ayers during a Democratic debate in Philadelphia, Mr. Obama responded: &quot;This is a guy who lives in my neighborhood, who's a professor of English (sic) in Chicago, who I know and who I have not received some official endorsement from. He's not somebody I exchange ideas from on a regular basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was disingenuous. When Barack Obama ran for the Illinois Senate, the first fund-raiser for him was held in Mr. Ayers' living room. They served together on the board of the Woods Charitable Trust and on the Chicago Annenberg Challenge. Mr. Ayers was a founder of the challenge, co-chaired its principal operational arm and may have helped pick Mr. Obama as the organization's board chairman in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chicago Annenberg Challenge spent $110 million between 1995 and 2001 to promote &quot;radical&quot; school reform. A report issued by University of Chicago researchers in 2003 indicated that it had no impact on improving the education of school children. It was more successful in providing lucrative employment to otherwise unemployable radicals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As board chairman, Mr. Obama's principal job was to monitor how CAC funds were spent. Since this was the only significant managerial responsibility Mr. Obama has ever had, one would think journalists would be more curious about how he performed it. But journalists have been remarkably incurious about anything that may reflect poorly on The One.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Mr. Obama and his aides are aware of this incuriosity, their nuclear response to the efforts of an independent group to call attention to the Obama-Ayers relationship is puzzling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ad on the relationship produced by the American Issues Project likely would have been ignored by the news media if the Obama campaign hadn't rushed out an ad in response and asked the Justice Department to investigate whether the project had violated campaign finance laws. (The Justice Department refused.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad falsely linked the American Issues Project ad to the McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With all our problems, why is John McCain talking about the 1960s, trying to link Barack Obama to radical Bill Ayers?&quot; the Obama&nbsp;ad says. &quot;McCain knows Obama denounced Ayers' crimes, committed when Obama was just eight years old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would you excuse a friendship with a Nazi war criminal on the grounds his crimes were committed before you were born? Many Americans feel the same about maintaining a friendship with an unrepentant domestic terrorist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the Obama campaign's aggressive response, it's now difficult for the news media to ignore the relationship. Why would the Obama campaign do something that seems so stupid?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stanley Kurtz of the Ethics and Public Policy Center discovered that 132 boxes of CAC records had been donated to the library at the University of Illinois-Chicago. He was going to review them until a library official told him he couldn't. After the library was forcefully reminded it's against the law to deny access to the files, they were made available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign described Mr. Kurtz, a mild-mannered academic, as &quot;a slimy character assassin,&quot; but was unable to point to anything Mr. Kurtz has said that is untrue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mr. Kurtz appeared on a Chicago radio station, the Obama campaign declined an opportunity to have a spokesman appear with him. Instead, the campaign urged Obama supporters to barrage the program with complaints. The Los Angeles Times described this as &quot;a surprising attempt to stifle broadcast criticism of its candidate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know what's in those files, but the Obama campaign doesn't want us to find out.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. O'Neill also said that neither Mr. Bush nor John McCain nor Barack Obama has handled the crisis well. He thinks bailout negotiations got bogged down in side issues -- such as executive pay -- and ought to have focused on providing government insurance for bad mortgages instead of having the government purchase them. As for the cause of the mess: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We suspended disbelief and said we can take people with no known source of income or wealth generation and we can give them a $500,000 mortgage. ... When you violate fundamental principles of economics you can get away with it for a while, but eventually it's going to get you.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to announce at this time that I am suspending this blog so that I can concentrate on the ongoing financial crisis that has gripped this nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you and God bless America.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pouncing on Palin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloggers are all over Sarah Palin's interview with Katie Couric. John McIntire spoofs Ms. Palin's explanation as to why living near Russia gives her foreign-policy credibility. First, Ms. Palin:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have trade missions back and forth, we do. It's very important when you consider even national-security issues with Russia. As Putin rears his head and comes into the air space of the United States of America, where do they go? It's Alaska. It's just right over the border. It is from Alaska that we send those out to make sure that an eye is being kept on this very powerful nation, Russia, because they are right next to, they are right next to our state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McIntire's version:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where do they go? Those Rooskies? They go over my land and stuff. Sometimes we send those out to spy on those foreign folk. Sometimes those have to be sent. You know. The White House depends on me to keep an eye on that big land mass over there and everything. And stuff. 'Cause you know ... it's next to our state. Like, right next door and everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(macyapper.blogspot.com)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alaska as welfare queen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's this from David Morris at Alternet: &quot;[Sarah] Palin might be campaigning on an anti-government, do-it-yourself platform, but her state is the most dependent on the federal government of all 50 states. Washington sends Alaska more money per capita than any other state. Alaskans receive back from the federal government almost $2 for every $1 they send to Washington. It's a sweet deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syonara Seagate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">414 Grant Street laments the pending departure from the Strip of the computer hard drive giant: &quot;Seagate Technologies abandoning Pittsburgh and the brand new building they just built is bad news for Pittsburgh. Just a few years ago Pittsburgh was on a hot streak of attracting new, cool tech companies ... FreeMarkets, Seagate, etc ... It's been at least 2 years ... Maybe this is what happens when you politicize your economic development agency?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(414grantstreet.blogspot.com)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Checking facts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a plug for the Truth-O-Meter and Flip-O-Meter at PolitiFact.Com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Truth-O-Meter measures the veracity of claims made by the presidential candidates, their surrogates and independent groups, rating them from true, to barely true, to false, to pants on fire (as in liar, liar). For instance, barely true: John McCain opposed an Obama bill aimed at limited executive pay. Pants on fire: The NRA's ad claiming that Barack Obama wants to prevent homeowners from buying guns to protect themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Flip-O-Meter measures flip-flops, ranging from no flip, to half flip, to full flop. It gives a full flop to Sarah Palin for supporting the Bridge to Nowhere as a candidate and opposing it as governor. Mr. Obama got a full flop on tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(politifact.com)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the candidates make a last dash toward the White House, there's one question that is not ringing out across America: &quot;Are you going to the Rock for McCain concert?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the polls reveal a tight race with the voting public, Sen. Barack Obama has the liberal pop music world in the tank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's hardly a break from tradition. Right on course, the sound of the Republican campaign is country stars such as John Rich and LeAnn Rimes spiriting a message of down-home values. Meanwhile, Obama is not only inspiring a reunion of the Grateful Dead, he's actually the first presidential candidate with a CD soundtrack, &quot;Yes We Can: Voices of a Grassroots Movement,&quot; featuring the likes of Kanye West, John Mayer and John Legend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The campaign's use of music is another example of the 'enthusiasm gap' between the Obama and McCain campaigns,&quot; said Obama spokesperson Allison Price. &quot;Sen. Obama's events, from small community gatherings to larger town halls and rallies, are pulsing with enthusiasm, and that is reflected in the campaign's choice of music.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately for Republicans, if pop stars could make or break a campaign, George W. Bush never would have survived the Vote for Change concerts, the Dixie Chicks and the Rock Against Bush tours in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, with Obama sporting a rock-star appeal John Kerry never mustered, Democrats and their supporters clearly think musicians can rock the base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locally, Rock for Obama concerts have been popping up. On Saturday, the Democrats will target the Carnegie Mellon campus with a voter registration drive headlined by Vampire Weekend, one of the year's hottest new bands. &quot;We support Barack Obama because on every issue we care about he is more logical, sensitive and unbiased than John McCain,&quot; the band told the Post-Gazette in a statement. Thousands of first-time voters will likely be lured by the Afro-pop and then leave with the impression that Obama is cooler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nine days later, on Oct. 13, the living members of the Dead will reunite for Deadheads for Obama at State College. Meanwhile, Carole King, not one of the hottest acts of the year, is on an Obama conversation tour in the swing state of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Price says Obama uses music as a tool to &quot;attract more people to this campaign that might not have tuned in to the issues yet.&quot; In May, the Illinois senator drew an estimated 75,000 to a rally in Portland, Ore., prompting conservative Web sites such as The National Review to wonder why it wasn't mentioned in the liberal media that the rally was preceded by a popular hometown band -- The Decemberists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama rallies are rocking with Bruce Springsteen's &quot;The Rising,&quot; Stevie Wonder's &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered,&quot; Jackie Wilson's &quot;Higher and Higher&quot; and Earth, Wind and Fire's &quot;Shining Star,&quot; among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Musical support has been tougher for the Republicans, so McCain can be awfully grateful to Rich, who wrote him a tribute song called &quot;Raising McCain.&quot; Rich jammed at the Republican Convention, along with Rimes, the Charlie Daniels Band, Joe Nichols, Clay Walker and the Bellamy Brothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When McCain running mate Gov. Sarah Palin had a whirlwind of meetings with world leaders at the United Nations, much was made of U2's Bono being on her dance card. Bono, a noted activist for global causes, doesn't play partisan politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for recorded music, McCain's daughter Meghan has a blog where she posts playlists filled with everything from cool-trendy bands like Wolf Parade and, yes, Vampire Weekend, to classic artists Dylan and Joni Mitchell. Not that her father's campaign would or could use much of that, not with all the left-leaning artists who have just said no:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In February, John Mellencamp asked the McCain people to stop using &quot;Our Country&quot; and &quot;Little Pink Houses,&quot; songs with obvious heartland appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Last month, Jackson Browne filed a lawsuit against Republicans in Ohio for use of his 1997 hit &quot;Running on Empty&quot; in an ad attacking Obama's energy policy. Browne's lawyer said its use was &quot;entirely reprehensible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Heart sent a cease-and-desist order to Republicans after their song &quot;Barracuda&quot; was played at the convention in honor of Sarah &quot;Barracuda&quot; Palin. When Republicans continued to use it, co-writer Roger Fisher said, OK, he would donate royalties to the Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Paul Lindsay declined to offer a playlist from the campaign but said, &quot;Music plays an important role in motivating the audience, but the record crowds are an indication of the growing excitement and enthusiasm for John McCain and Sarah Palin. We appreciate supporters who take time out of their day to come to these events, so we make every effort to provide an entertaining and family-friendly environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are rockers who lean right, but they tend to be problematic. There's not much you can do on the campaign trail with Ted Nugent and Alice Cooper, unless they can figure out how to use &quot;Cat Scratch Fever&quot; or &quot;I'm Eighteen.&quot; While &quot;I'm 18 and I don't know what I want&quot; might actually speak to the zeitgeist, it doesn't exactly uplift a crowd. As for conservatives Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears -- not exactly the philosopher-poets of pop music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much does the musical imbalance weigh on the election? Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist, says: not much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a fan of Springsteen's music. I also have Pearl Jam on my iPod. Both are big supporters of Democrats and liberal causes, and yet I keep listening to them because, like most people, I separate my music and my politics. When the data breakdowns arrive after every campaign is over, the empirical evidence proves that voters are motivated by how the candidates talked about the issues affecting them, rather than the endorsements they received.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the &quot;rock&quot; in the name, one group that doesn't take sides is Rock the Vote. It asks its performers on its tour to limit their comments to the importance of voting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heather Smith, executive director of Rock the Vote, thinks musicians do have an influence on young voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The artists pique their interests,&quot; she says. &quot;Sure, they look at what groups support what candidates, but in the end I think they make up their own mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As this campaign has heated up, there's been one firecracker not going off: the war of words between the Dixie Chicks and Toby Keith. Not this time. Keith, who wrote the post-9/11 revenge anthem &quot;Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue,&quot; is actually a lifelong Democrat, but after supporting Bush, he's said nice things about Obama. For now, he's keeping his choice to himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say,&quot; Keith told the PG. &quot;If someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote, then you're not taking advantage of your American right here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kid Rock, who leans Republican, agrees: &quot;I truly believe that people like myself, who are in a position of entertainers in the limelight, should keep their mouth shut on politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One funny thing is happening on the way to the White House: Obama and McCain are trying to win votes with the same song -- Brooks &amp; Dunn's &quot;Only in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes after Friday night's presidential debate ended, the McCain campaign had posted a video on YouTube.com enumerating the times Sen. Barack Obama noted that Sen. John McCain was &quot;right&quot; about something -- seven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 8 a.m. the next morning, the Obama campaign unveiled its own new ad: &quot;Zero&quot; -- the number of times Mr. McCain mentioned &quot;the middle class&quot; during the 90-minute matchup at the University of Mississippi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns scrambled this weekend to score political points after a debate that was full of substance and evasion, fumbling and occasional zingers -- but one, most pundits agreed, that lacked the crucial breakout moment needed to shake up a neck-and-neck race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were no defining moments, no gotcha moments, no moments at all that could have moved things off script -- which means we still have a very close, competitive race that could be won by either candidate,&quot; said Terry Madonna, a political science professor and pollster at Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on his own polling and other surveys, Mr. Madonna said, &quot;About 15 percent of the voters remain genuinely in play and I don't think last night moved very many of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, in what has become a predictable post-debate ritual, both campaigns deluged reporters yesterday with cherry-picked &quot;reviews&quot; from television analysts and newspaper editorial boards declaring their candidate the winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those efforts to massage public perception and jolt the campaign out of its stasis has taken on particular urgency this year, given the closeness of the race and the fact that the actual pool of undecided voters is much smaller than many polls reveal, said Jeff Berry, a professor of political science at Tufts University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When pollsters push too hard, sometimes people say they're undecided when they really aren't,&quot; he said. Given this race's uncertainty, there may be a lot of that going on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, while there may not be many wavering voters left, &quot;the public clearly regards Sen. Obama as the winner,&quot; he said, noting that a series of instant polls -- by CNN, CBS, plus focus groups on Fox News and by Republican pollster Frank Luntz -- consistently gave the edge to Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the particulars of the debate itself may soon fade from public consciousness, &quot;Mr. Obama achieved the one thing he had to do, which was convince viewers that he would be at least an adequate commander-in-chief,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And with Obama leading narrowly in national polls up until Friday, McCain now has to figure out how to take that lead away from him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, that's just one political scientist's perception. While Mr. Obama may have come out ahead simply by holding his own, said Ken Heineman, a political science professor at Ohio University, Mr. McCain won the expectations game -- an important plus, given that he had been in danger of losing it during last week's chaotic events on Wall Street and in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He wasn't tired or grumpy, but conversational, smiling, and kept emphasizing his experience in bipartisanship, which was an effective play for independents,&quot; said Mr. Heineman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates made strong points on foreign policy, and Mr. McCain skillfully focused on taxes and spending cuts rather than on the Wall Street financial crisis, he said, while Mr. Obama &quot;should have scored a knockout on the economy, which is such a 'gimme' issue, and he didn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd say McCain won on the margins, but he didn't stage a knockout punch,&quot; Mr. Heineman added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain planned to remain in Washington over the weekend to work on the financial bailout bill, his campaign said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, on the other hand, hit the campaign trail, hammering away at his opponent's debate performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The truth is, through 90 minutes of debating, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but he had nothing to say about you. He didn't even say the words 'middle class.' Not once,&quot; Mr. Obama told a crowd in Greensboro, N.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, David Plouffe, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, was busy lowering expectations for the next few debates. Republican vice presidential nominee Gov. Sarah Palin -- who faces Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. Thursday -- is &quot;a gifted debater,&quot; he told reporters in a conference call, while Mr. Obama will also be &quot;the decided underdog&quot; in a town hall meeting Oct. 7 in Nashville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[John McCain] is the undisputed town hall champion, and he's done more of them than any president in history,&quot; Mr. Plouffe said, adding that he would be &quot;thrilled,&quot; if Mr. Obama can &quot;escape unscathed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also conceded, though, that these debates may not produce much movement in the polls in the near future. While voters are now becoming very focused, many &quot;may wait until even after the third debate to make their decision,&quot; Mr. Plouffe said. &quot;But for those who do, we're confident we put more in our column than in John McCain's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for the McCain campaign, said Mr. Obama failed a key test: showing voters he was capable of being commander-in-chief -- because he &quot;failed to utter the word 'victory' a single time&quot; during the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite that fact, his campaign launched a mad-dash of damage-control this morning attempting to claim a debate 'victory' for Barack Obama when he was clearly struggling to defend his record of lavish new government spending, higher taxes and failed foreign policy judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, this fixation on how many words were uttered -- or not uttered -- by either candidate, not to mention the emphasis on who &quot;won&quot; or who &quot;lost,&quot; may be for naught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some debates produce ineffable moments that resonate with the public and, ultimately, define the candidate -- from Vice President Al Gore's condescending sighs in 2000 to then Gov. Ronald Reagan's head-shaking, mock-regretful &quot;There you go again&quot; in 1980. But it's important to remember that Sen. John F. Kerry &quot;won&quot; at least two out of three debates in 2004 with President Bush -- and then lost the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerry came across as a technician, while Bush came across as a regular guy, and people identified with him,&quot; said Mr. Madonna. &quot;On that score, I'd say that McCain did a much better job connecting with the voters, while on debate points, Obama won.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, he added, &quot;by next week we may have completely forgotten all about this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To a limited extent I don't know if debates ever change anyone's minds,&quot; added Gerald Shuster, a professor of political communication at the University of Pittsburgh's Department of Communications. &quot;They tend to reinforce perceptions of one's own candidate. If you already like one, chances are you'll think he did a great job.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on such calculus, one would expect Joe Biden, the veteran Democratic senator from Delaware, to handily defeat Sarah Palin, the two-year Republican governor from Alaska. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the stock market crashed, Franklin D. Roosevelt got on the television and didn't just talk about the, you know, the princes of greed. He said, 'Look, here's what happened,'&quot; Biden told news anchor Katie Couric.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gaffes just keep on coming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a rope line in Ohio this week, a woman asked him why he and Obama support &quot;clean coal&quot; technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not supporting clean coal,&quot; Biden replied, putting his hands on the questioner's shoulders. &quot;Guess what? China's building two every week, two dirty coal plants, and it's polluting the United States. It's causing people to die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the exchange, he said: &quot;No coal plants here in America. Build them, if they're going to build them, over there (in China). Make them clean, because they're killing you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That might be good Democratic politics, looking pro-environment and all that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But check his running mate's energy policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under &quot;New Energy for America,&quot; barackobama.com says: &quot;Obama's Department of Energy will enter into public-private partnerships to develop five 'first-of-a-kind' commercial scale coal-fired plants with clean carbon capture and sequestration technology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden was back on message Thursday in Wilkes-Barre, saying, &quot;I am for clean coal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then comes the best part. A Biden spokesman denies the obvious contradiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ohio, you see, Biden was trying to convey that &quot;even if we stopped investing in clean coal tomorrow, the reality is China is building dirty coal-fired power plants, which contributes to global warming,&quot; spokesman David Wade explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Got that? No, neither did we.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden also jumped ahead of Obama on Sept. 16, telling NBC News that &quot;I don't think (AIG) should be bailed out by the federal government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week later, speaking on the same network, Obama was asked why he had criticized GOP nominee John McCain for opposing the government's bailout of the insurance giant when Biden had, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think ... that in that situation, I think Joe should have waited, as well,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Biden commits a gaffe in his debate with Palin on Thursday, Obama will no doubt agree with a recent comment the Delaware senator made to a Hillary Clinton critic during a town-hall meeting in Nashua, N.H.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've been covering John McCain for a decade. A few years ago, I worked on a book, which I foolishly never completed, on the U.S. Senate with Mr. McCain as the central character. So when I step back and think of Mr. McCain, even in the heat of this campaign, I still think of him first in the real world of governing, not in the show-business world of the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think first of the personal qualities. He was unfailingly candid. When other politicians described a meeting, they always ended up the heroes of the story. But Mr. McCain would always describe the meeting straight, emphasizing his own failings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is, for a politician, a humble man. The most important legacy of his prisoner-of-war days is that he witnessed others behaving more heroically than he did. This experience has given him a basic honesty when appraising himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mood darkened as the Iraq war deteriorated, but his accomplishments mounted. I don't think any senator had as impressive a few years as Mr. McCain did during this span of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lobbied relentlessly for a change of strategy in Iraq, holding off the tide that would have had us accept defeat and leave Iraq to its genocide. He negotiated a complicated immigration bill with Ted Kennedy. He helped organize the Gang of 14 to save the Senate from polarized Armageddon over judicial nominations. He voted against opportunist bills like the pork-laden energy package and the prescription drug plan. He led a crusade against Jack Abramoff and the sleaze-meisters in his own party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I could fill this column with his accomplishments during this period, and not even mention the insights. At a defense conference in Munich, I saw him diagnose and confront Russian hegemony. Week after week, I saw him dissent from GOP colleagues as their party lost its way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people who cover the campaign seem to have no knowledge of anything but the campaign, but I can't get these events -- which were real and required the constant application of judgment, honor and courage -- out of my head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do I wish he was running a different campaign? Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not that he has changed his political personality that bothers me. I've come to accept that in this media-circus environment, you simply cannot run for president as a candid, normal person. Nor is it, primarily, the dishonest ads he is running. My friends in the Obama cheering section get huffy about them, while filtering from their consciousness all the dishonest ads Sen. Barack Obama has run -- the demagogic DHL ad, the insulting computer ad, the cynical Rush Limbaugh ad. If one candidate has sunk lower than the other at this point, I've lost track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, what disappoints me about the McCain campaign is it has no central argument. I had hoped that he would create a grand narrative explaining how the United States is fundamentally unprepared for the 21st century and how Mr. McCain's worldview is different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain has not made that argument, so his proposals don't add up to more than the sum of their parts. Without a groundbreaking argument about why he is different, he's had to rely on tactical gimmicks to stay afloat. He has no frame to organize his response when financial and other crises pop up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain has no overarching argument in part because of his Senate training and the tendency to take issues on one at a time and in part because he has never really resolved the contradiction between the Barry Goldwater and Teddy Roosevelt sides of his worldview. One day he's a small-government Western conservative; the next he's a Bull Moose progressive. The two don't add up -- as we've seen in his uneven reaction to the financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, when people try to tell me that the McCain on the campaign trail is the real McCain and the one who came before was fake, I just say, baloney. I saw him. A half-century of evidence is there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mr. McCain is elected, he will retain his instinct for the hard challenge. With that Greatest Generation style of his, he will run the least partisan administration in recent times. He is not a sophisticated conceptual thinker, but he is a good judge of character. He is not an organized administrator, but he has become a practiced legislative craftsman. He is, above all -- and this is completely impossible to convey in the midst of a campaign -- a serious man prone to serious things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the stupidity of this season, it seemed worth stepping back to recall the fundamentals -- about Mr. McCain today and Mr. Obama on some other day in the near future.</SPAN></P>

John McCain and Barack Obama are about to face off in the presidential debates, with media pundits focused more on possible gaffes than on good policy. I am tired of all the polarized political commercials and want answers to real issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want to hear just one question about what each candidate would do to address extreme poverty around the world. More specifically, as a mother I want to know what the U.S. will do to lift up people who are hungry, who are drinking filthy water and suffering treatable, preventable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and even diarrhea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As members of the ONE Campaign, many of us in Pennsylvania and across America are coming together to petition the moderator of the debate on foreign policy to ask this very important question. The debate is tonight. We hope the candidates address the issue of extreme poverty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fate of this evening's presidential debate in Mississippi remained uncertain last night, with Republican John McCain saying he would not participate until a deal on a Wall Street plan was hashed out in Washington. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a meeting at the White House, which he and Democrat Barack Obama attended, McCain said he was &quot;very hopeful&quot; an agreement could be worked out in time for the debate to proceed. But he made no commitment to attend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who like McCain remained in Washington overnight, said that he planned to go to the Mississippi site regardless and that it was &quot;important to have a debate.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event - the first of three scheduled encounters between the major-party presidential candidates, and scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. - was supposed to be limited to issues of foreign policy and national security. But Obama said he expected that the financial crisis would be discussed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the debate site, on the University of Mississippi campus in Oxford, final preparations were proceeding yesterday despite the uncertainty. Officials of the university and the state of Mississippi have a lot at stake. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the debates are sponsored by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, the events themselves are financed largely by the universities and communities that win the right to host them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The University of Mississippi, which has never hosted one before, had raised and spent about $5 million - much of it in private donations - to make the necessary preparations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If and when the debate happens, it will set the stage for the final acts of the 2008 presidential race. And it could do a whole lot more. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">History indicates that the first debate of a general election is the one most likely to affect public opinion, because the audience is usually the largest, and first impressions tend to be lasting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any shift in voter sentiment could prove significant in this close and historic race. At this point, Obama has opened up a modest lead in most national polls, in part because of the financial crisis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts, though, expect undecided voters to wait until the final debate, scheduled for Oct. 15, before making up their minds.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No event in a campaign focuses the minds of voters more than these debates,&quot; said Michael X. Delli Carpini, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. &quot;When it comes to the lesser-known candidate, Sen. Obama, it's as much about the person as the issues.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the polls, voters see McCain as the more credible commander in chief, based in part on his years of experience in the military and the Senate. That, of course, figures into the expectations game for the foreign-policy debate and into the goals for both candidates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama will be out to increase voters' comfort level with him and to make the case that his relative lack of experience in the national security arena will not hamper him in office.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The expectations level for McCain has to be enormous, because national security is his campaign's reason for being,&quot; said Gov. Rendell, who is working for Democrat Obama. &quot;If Sen. Obama shows he understands the issues, he wins the debate, regardless of what McCain does.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain wants to be seen as a hard-nosed realist whose command of world affairs makes him the better choice to protect the nation. If he can underline his differences with the Bush administration as well, so much the better for him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the two candidates stand side by side, there'll be a decisive difference,&quot; Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa.) said earlier this week. &quot;Sen. Obama is an able fellow, but he doesn't have John's experience and knowledge.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big question last night was whether the two will be side by side before today is over. And if they don't meet tonight, how would that affect the rest of the schedule, which has the lone vice presidential debate up next on Oct. 2? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Obama campaign last night accused McCain of not really &quot;suspending&quot; his campaign in deference to the financial crisis, as he announced Wednesday he was going to do.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a memo to reporters, Obama spokesman Bill Burton said that McCain aides were still attacking Obama on television and that some McCain&nbsp;commercials were still on the air. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign officials said last night that all their commercials had been taken down. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philadelphia is a place of history, especially Center City. A few blocks below the Gallery are the federal court house, the Constitution Center, Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell and many more landmarks. Our founding fathers certainly would not approve of a gambling Mecca so close to the sight of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, there's talk of revitalizing the Gallery. Not many people frequent it due to the youths that continuously hang out there. An 84- year-old gentleman was assaulted and robbed there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You want to revitalize the Gallery, how about having some security there and confronting the youth as to why they aren't in school, or why they are traveling in groups and not buying but antagonizing the shoppers who do frequent the Gallery.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pat Walder, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Philadelphia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locating a casino in Chinatown is very bad, worse than the South Philadelphia site. Also, it's not true what the mayor and governor say about the taxes not neing used to repay Foxwoods for money they spent already. That is the joke of all jokes on the citizens of Philadelphia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Domenick Lazarro Jr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c10">Philadelphia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're lying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost every time John McCain and Sarah Palin open their mouths these days, they're lying. They say Barack Obama has never authored significant legislation - but check out his work on nuclear proliferation and government transparency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. They say Palin opposed the Bridge to Nowhere - but she campaigned in favor of it and even praised the strength of Alaska's corrupt congressional delegation. They say the economy is fundamentally sound - even as one financial institution after another collapses alongside home values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dave Thomer, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Philadelphia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sham war</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pardon my ignorance, but when did Iraq declare war on the United States? Why is it so important that we win a war where we don't know who the enemy is? Who are we fighting?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems to me the fight is between Shiite and Sunni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I understand the fears of President Bush and Sen. McCain that if we don't pound somebody into the ground so that we can declare victory, we will lose face with the rest of the world and be considered weak. So we have to stay and rebuild their country and make them whole again, so we can save face at the cost of billions, which the president doesn't have to pay out of his own pocket. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since he is president, let the American people pay the bill. Since the battle is not mine, it's the Lord's. I'll let Him handle it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James W. Williams, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Philadelphia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 'racial litmus test'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re Fatimah Ali's op-ed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot; 'Race War' in America&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The author's main qualification as a self-anointed expert on race relations is her color-blind upbringing in Mt. Airy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And I quote:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, we're not anywhere near 'post-racial' times. If we were, the possibility that a black man may well become our next president wouldn't matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All evidence suggests that it doesn't matter. He won a major party's nomination for the office of president of the United States. But that apparently does not suffice as proof of our country approaching a place &quot;anywhere near post-racial times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the author recognize the ridiculousness of that statement? Liberals, black and white, in no uncertain terms, have decided that each vote in this election is a de facto &quot;racist litmus test.&quot; Anyone who hasn't yet come to the obvious (in their minds) conclusion that Obama is our country's messiah, delivered to us in our hour of greatest need, is either racist or a fool, not sufficiently enlightened to even be entrusted with a vote in this election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The author manages to lump all McCain supporters, as well as the undecideds who have not yet been willing to anoint Obama, in with the racists and radicals that responded to her column with invective. Many voters remain undecided. I was one of them until moments ago. At least Ms. Ali's column and its ill-considered opinion on race and this election was good for something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Nocito, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Philadelphia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Boondocks' Sarah</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I cannot sit back any longer and hold inside my thoughts about John McCain's pick for a running mate, Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How in the world did he find her? He must have gone to the &quot;boondocks.&quot; How can people get excited about a person who talks too loudly, too much, and, says absolutely nothing? Except when she is trying to attack a man like Senator Barack Obama. Notice I said 'trying' to attack him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin, just like McCain, has no clue what this election is truly about. It is about how the people, especially, the poor of this country have been suffering under George Bush for the last eight years. George Bush whom Senator McCain, out of his own mouth, voted with over ninety percent of the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I saw an old, white woman on the news the other day. On national television she had the audacity to say she wouldn't vote for Obama, &quot;because I don't like his name&quot;. Talk about scary!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlotte J. Mears, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Philadelphia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Electoral twilight zone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will be the longest 40- something days of my mature life. After going through the worst seven something years under George W. Bush in my 60-something years, I shudder to think that there are folks out there who are actually enthusiastic about the Republican ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who promises more of the same and is a known Bushie promises to shake up the Washington establishment after spending years in congress mostly going with the flow. He's known as a maverick yet voted with the administration 90 percent of the time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His running mate was plucked from obscurity and her claim to fame is being a hockey mom, hunter and church lady. She's in the midst of trooper-gate and is being sheltered by McCain's handlers from serious discourse about global and domestic issues. One suspects that she doesn't have a clue. And this is a woman who is one heartbeat from a seventy something man who sometimes, in my opinion, displays symptoms of vertigo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Am I crazy or, unknowingly, am I in the twilight zone?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony J. Frascino, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Cherry Hill, N.J</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trusting the police</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To those ignorant people who don't, or don't want to, trust the police:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People said they didn't trust cops who on the afternoon that Officer Patrick McDonald was slain first said they've kill him. They didn't consider that the criminal (and he had a list of convictions) had killed an officer who was there protecting them and was serving his city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then the father arrives and said &quot;you might as well kill me too&quot; (duh!). What kind of rationalization is this. And then someone said &quot;he's a Muslim&quot; which I assume made it OK to kill someone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't condone killing of anyone, but the bum who fatally shot one officer and wound another got what he deservered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a former resident of Philadelphia and a police officer in that city for well over 20 years, one day the thugs will get it in their heads that a standoff with police offficers just won't get it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carl Branch, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Cherry Hill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ad-monition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, John McCain feels like Barack Obama's campaign is &quot;wasted pork&quot; and will cause Americans to have to pay huge taxes on electricity and home heating oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Um, aren't we already paying exorbitant amounts of money for this stuff in the first place?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I love these political ads. It's like first-grade all over again. Funny, I was always taught not to rat anyone out or make fun of others. To see our possible leaders go back and forth and do this is kind of ironic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlie Gagliardi, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Philadelphia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Left out of the bailout</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isn't it incredible that the federal government (read: we the taxpayers) see fit to bail many high profile banks, brokerages and insurance companies out of their tough situations!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many layoffs have occurred, but I'm willing to bet more lower income employees are let go, while the top dogs still get their bonuses, and multi-million dollar salaries!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what about the poor folks that have had to declare bankruptcy, losing their homes and their savings due to the down sliding economy? Will our government come to their aid? Two chances of that ever happening! Slim and none! We're stuck with everything! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ain't it just great?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Palmer, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Philadelphia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right on, Christine!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am the contact person for the Respect Life ministry of the parish of Christ the King in Hillside, N.J.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read Christine Flowers' op-ed &quot;Feminists Biggest Nightmare: Stepford Sarah&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All I can say is: AMEN! Sarah Palin is indeed an embodiment of feminism correctly understood. Now when you think about it, the National Organization for Women members, for instance, should be trembling with excitement over her candidacy not only because, for the first time, a &quot;sister&quot; of theirs has a real chance of making it to the second-highest office in the land but also because she has it in her the true feminist ideals (a working woman who is able juggle successfully both career and family, and a woman public official who climbed her way up the political ladder through her very own merits, and not because she took the place of a husband or a father who predeceased her).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These past 25 years, when one speaks of &quot;women's vote&quot;, it almost automatically means liberal, usually Democratic, women who are pro-abortion rights, pro-same sex unions, pro-condom distribution, and the like. Well, hello, there is another kind of &quot;women's vote&quot; out there who has always been here but is long ignor ed (purposely, I suspect) and just as significant and, dare I say, just as powerful: conservative, mostly religious, women who are pro-life, pro-traditional marriage, pro-premarital abstinence, and so on. ; Sara h Palin has ignited that other &quot;powerhouse&quot; so I can understand the trepidation of, say, NOW. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I need to get a few things off my chest before it eats away at me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's start with the Jim Taylor controversy. Mr. Taylor, like any other American, has a constitutional right to vote for who he wants. He didn't resign from his post of chairman of the Franklin County Republican Party when running for office because he wasn't sure that he was going to get elected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He hasn't publicly endorsed Rich Alloway because maybe he is not going to vote for Rich Alloway. I don't know the circumstances, but I know that on Nov. 4 I'm voting for Jim Taylor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, lets move on. I need to say that state Attorney General Tom Corbett is the first person in Pennsylvania to take a stand for our children. Because of Mr. Corbett's sincerity to protect our children, more predators and perverts are off our streets and in prison where they belong. Mr. Corbett, because of that, I will be voting for you in November and I hope to see you in the White House someday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Barack Obama has made another lie and doesn't even know that he did it. In a recent television ad by a company that endorsed Obama, they show him making a statement that his tax cuts would benefit the middle class three times as much as McCain's. The only problem with that ad is that Obama doesn't want to lower our taxes. He said that he will lower taxes on 95 percent of working Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he also said that he will raise taxes on businesses and corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My problem with that is that 99 percent of working Americans work for businesses or corporations, and those same companies will have to do something to pay their taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think that they will cut payroll! I don't know, I'm just taking a wild guess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know about you, but I don't want to take a 5 percent chance on tax cuts!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will be voting for John McCain in November and I hope and pray that others will join me.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cathryn needs to sit down and take a deep breath as I explain something to her and all the other Obama fanatics who are living in &quot;Denial, USA.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Palin is the governor of Alaska. She reformed Alaska's government and passed legislation that cut wasteful spending - in other words she has legislative experience. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has no accomplishments, no bills, no legislation to attach to his name, unless you want to count his unwavering support of late-term abortions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a newsflash for Miss Michon - and Fatimah Ali, for that matter. Skin color counts for nothing in determining the worth of a human being, now or ever! My race is the human race, people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stuart Caesar, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Philadelphia</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xxxxxx</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After watching the Obama&nbsp;ad showing McCain in the 1980s with a disco ball, I was wondering if there was a 1980s photo of Obama snorting cocaine and smoking pot, both of which he admits doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith Callan, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Philadelphia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his interview on &quot;Candidates Forum on Service,&quot; Barack Obama spoke of the &quot;sacred obligation&quot; government has to those who help the country in times of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This reminded me of how President Bush initiated tax cuts for the rich even as he sent the country to war on a pack of lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If President Bush's spin on the horrors of Sept. 11 aren't grounds for high treason against our country, then perhaps they are merely the most perverted expression of anti-&quot;leadership&quot; imaginable, in the context of an individual being entrusted as commander in chief of our nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of staying the course, in the wake of these actions, is both incomprehensible and anti-constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitch Deighan, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Philadelphia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xxxxxx</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember George Bush?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those of us who didn't vote for him tried to warn those who were planning to that they should look at the real issues and not believe the nonsense, and not get caught up in the nastiness, that was the core of his campaign. Both times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any unbiased person, anyone having no agenda except electing the most qualified man, anyone doing their homework on the most pressing issues facing our nation, could not possibly have thought that Bush would be a better president than Al Gore or John Kerry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, alas, people have agendas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wealthy want tax breaks. Evangelicals want to keep gay people from having the right to marry. People who misunderstand the meaning of patriotism want to &quot;kill them all and let God sort them out.&quot; So they vote for the likes of Bush. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why worry about the economy, or jobs, or affordable health care. Bush told us that he had a plan for each, and too many of us, disregarding the track record of Republican administrations over the last 60 years, believed him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before running for president, George Bush had failed in every position he ever held. As president, he's added to that dubious resume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, along comes John McCain, and that fraud he picked as a running mate. The tone of their campaign, the attack ads, the clever phrases substituting for real knowledge virtually guarantee Bush III should they be elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time people realized Bush was incompetent, arrogant and ignorant, it was way too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember the saying: &quot;Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Leonardo, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Palmyra, N.J.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Stu columnist Bykofsky,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven years ago, 19 whack-jobs killed over 3,000 of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For decades, the Soviets, a much greater threat, had thousands of nuclear warheads pointed at us, but we didn't have the level of surveillance that we are subject to now (which Bush did first illegally, then Congress codified this summer).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republicans, because of 19 perps, declared a multi-billion-dollar &quot;war on terror&quot; to scare us and keep themselves in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of 19 jerks (and Exxon Mobil), they invade a completely innocent country and now they don't even need warrants to spy on us. You newspaper guys, when you get information from sources overseas, you'll be simultaneously (and warrantlessly) sharing that with eavesdropping spooks. If you're running for office against a Republican, they'll be listening in to your campaign strategy. And with all these memorials and the moment of silence that you want, these emotional soap operas makes us look weak, a more appetizing target to terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phil Gramm, though he didn't mean it in this context, is right - we are a nation of whiners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopefully, the ACLU, et al, will overturn FISA on 4th amendment grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if more Americans die (which is doubtful) as result of less government intrusion, then so be it - that's the cost of freedom. We payed that price in 1776.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans yesterday criticized Democratic vice-presidential candidate Joseph R. Biden Jr. over an overheard comment at odds with Illinois Sen. Barack Obama's campaign pledge to support the development of clean coal plants in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the remarks, circulated on YouTube, the Delaware senator seems to reject the idea of building new coal-fired plants domestically, while suggesting that clean-coal technology, a goal that both campaigns have promised billions of dollars to develop, should be used to protect the environment from coal plants abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the video, recorded at the beginning of Mr. Biden's bus trip across Ohio last week, the Democrat is speaking to a woman as he works the crowd after a rally. Responding to her question pressing him on why the campaign is supporting clean coal, he says: &quot;We're not supporting clean coal. Guess what? China is building two every week, two dirty coal plants. And it's polluting the United States, it's causing people to die.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As their exchange continues, Mr. Biden says: &quot;China's gonna burn 300 years of bad coal unless we figure out how to clean their coal up, because it's gonna ruin your lungs, and there's nothing we can do about it. No coal plants here in America. Build 'em, if they're gonna build 'em, over there and make 'em clean because they're killing you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arizona Sen. John McCain's campaign jumped on the remarks. The Republican nominee criticized them yesterday during an Ohio campaign stop, while his aides staged at least two conference calls allowing coal-state Republicans to register their opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My opponent is against the expansion of nuclear power,&quot; Mr. McCain said, repeating a charge contradicted by Mr. Obama's repeated remarks on the issue. &quot;His running mate here in Ohio recently said that they weren't supporting clean coal either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain has more enthusiastically supported developing new nuclear plants, but Mr. Obama, in his platform and in numerous remarks on the issue, has voiced at least cautious support for nuclear power. The candidates differ on the location of a radioactive waste storage facility under development in Nevada. Mr. McCain supports it; Mr. Obama opposes the site, while not offering an alternative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both presidential candidates have pledged to support research that would allow the burning of coal while capturing its greenhouse-gas emissions -- a pledge seemingly contradicted by Mr. Biden's remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a call yesterday with Pennsylvania reporters, Rep. Phil English, R-Erie, characterized those comments as &quot;Senator Biden's bizarre anti-coal rant.&quot; And Rep. Mike Turzai, R-Bradford Woods, said they were &quot;a slap to those [coal mining] employees and a slap to consumers who want electric consumption at realistic prices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without specifically addressing Mr. Biden's &quot;no coal plants here in America&quot; passage, an Obama campaign spokesman insisted in a statement, &quot;This is yet another false attack from a dishonorable campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator McCain knows that Senator Obama and Senator Biden support clean-coal technology. Senator Biden's point is that China is building coal plants with outdated technology every day, and the United States needs to lead by developing clean-coal technologies,&quot; spokesman David Wade said in the statement. &quot;The Obama-Biden comprehensive energy plan will invest $150 billion over 10 years in clean energy technologies, including incentives to accelerate private-sector investment in commercial-scale zero-carbon coal facilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National polls suggest that Ralph Nader won't win the White House again this year, but the activist lawyer has scored a victory of sorts in one battleground state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nader will be on the ballot in Pennsylvania come Nov. 4, unlike four years ago when Democrats successfully challenged Nader's campaign paperwork to have him booted off. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Democrats here and in 44 other states might not even have to worry about him being a spoiler this year, said Nader, citing several recent polls that show him siphoning more votes from Republican John McCain than Democrat Barack Obama.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Nader tilt the race in Pennsylvania or some other swing state enough to influence the outcome of the presidential race, as many believe he did in 2000 when George W. Bush narrowly defeated Al Gore in Florida and clinched the election? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nowhere near as much as Obama or McCain will tilt it one way or the other,&quot; Nader said in a telephone interview Tuesday with the Tribune-Review on the eve of a scheduled appearance at the University of Pittsburgh.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nader will speak during a 7:30 p.m. public rally in room 120 of David Lawrence Hall on Pitt's Oakland campus.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to talking about his presidential agenda, Nader said he will discuss Pennsylvania's &quot;Bonusgate&quot; scandal, which included the successful effort to have him tossed from the ballot in 2004, according to a state grand jury. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel overwhelmingly vindicated,&quot; Nader said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nader's presence on the ballot might not significantly impact the race in Pennsylvania, since votes for the liberal consumer activist might be offset by those for Libertarian candidate Bob Barr, said pollster G. Terry Madonna of Franklin &amp; Marshall College. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My hunch is he will not be decisive,&quot; Madonna said. &quot;His time has come and gone, and I doubt if he will play the role of spoiler this time.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, third-party candidates could affect the results in several battleground states, according to CNN/Time Magazine/Opinion Research Corp. poll results released a week ago.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When included in the results, Nader, Barr and Green Party candidate Cynthia McKinney took a total of 7 percent of the vote in Indiana, 6 percent in Florida and Ohio, and 5 percent in North Carolina, which could be enough to influence the outcome. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nader, 74, gained fame as a consumer advocate in the 1960s. His 1965 book, &quot;Unsafe at any Speed,&quot; detailed his contention that American car companies resisted making safer vehicles. One of his main targets was the compact Chevrolet Corvair, which Nader said was prone to rollovers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nader loyalists likely will flock to the polls on Nov. 4, but their numbers are hardly expected to tilt the outcome, said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's showing up in polls in the low single digits,&quot; Sabato said. &quot;We're looking at a tiny percentage of the vote. Nader got 2.7 percent in 2000 and he got about 0.37 in 2004. I think you are looking at a total much closer to 2004 than 2000.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is Nader's fifth run for president. His first race was in 1992. In 1996 and 2000, he played a significant role in developing the pro-environment, anti-corporate Green Party. He ran in 2004 as an independent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since the problems have remained the same, only they are worse, our agenda hasn't changed that much,&quot; Nader said. It includes &quot;how to get out of Iraq, how to prevent Wall Street bailouts on the back of the taxpayers, how to promote more jobs in public works all over the country.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third-party candidates such as Nader and Barr typically lose ground in the polls as Election Day approaches -- &quot;for a logical reason,&quot; Sabato said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Americans understand the Electoral College system and when they give their vote to a third-party candidate they end up missing the opportunity to help choose between the two frontrunners,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a late-afternoon rally outside the Delaware County Courthouse, Republican presidential candidate John McCain expressed his reservations about the proposed Wall Street bailout plan and criticized Democrat Barack Obama for not coming up with a financial-rescue proposal of his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking about the bailout plan being crafted by the Bush administration, McCain said it was not acceptable for the vast sums of money being discussed to be administered and spent solely by the secretary of the Treasury - without any further review. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We won't solve a problem caused by poor oversight with a plan that calls for no oversight,&quot; he told the several thousand enthusiastic supporters who gathered on the streets of Media, many dressed in Republican red.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama, speaking in Green Bay, Wis., kept his focus on the economy as well, pledging as president to save the federal government $40 billion by reducing spending on outside contractors by 10 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain, who was accompanied in his visit to the region by running mate Sarah Palin, proposed creation of a high-level, bipartisan board to keep watch over the federal bailouts being discussed, which could involve as much as $1 trillion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As members of such a board, he suggested individuals such as former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican; New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent; and investor Warren Buffett, who is backing Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Arizona senator also said that the legislation creating the bailout fund must include language that prevents the top brass of companies receiving federal assistance from getting rich at taxpayers' expense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Senior executives of any firm bailed out by Treasury should not make more than the highest-paid government official,&quot; he said. The president makes $400,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Friday, McCain put forward a plan in response to the financial crisis, proposing creation of a Mortgage and Financial Institutions Trust that is not dissimilar to the Bush administration's plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama did not follow suit, saying on Friday that he did not want to disrupt the efforts ongoing in Washington by making his own specific proposal. He stuck to that position yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, the Democratic nominee made his proposal for reducing federal spending, laid out the principles that would guide his outlook vis-&amp;agrave;-vis the financial community, and embraced the same mantra of accountability that McCain talked about with his oversight board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said Obama in Wisconsin: &quot;We cannot give a blank check to Washington with no oversight and accountability, when no oversight and accountability is what got us into this mess in the first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Media, McCain said that Obama's words were not sufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;One week after the crisis began, Sen. Obama has still not offered a plan of any kind,&quot; McCain said. &quot;In time of crisis, when leadership is needed, Sen. Obama has been MIA, my friends. That means missing in action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier in the day, several of Pennsylvania's ranking Democrats reacted to the presence of the Republican ticket by assembling on Independence Mall to announce the formation of a Democratic &quot;truth squad&quot; designed to combat, they said, misrepresentations being made by the McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The squad leader, Gov. Rendell, said that McCain had lied about Obama's tax policy by saying that Obama wanted to raise taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama's proposal calls for higher income taxes on individuals making more than $200,000 per year and on families making more than $250,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most other taxpayers would get an income tax cut, $500 for individuals and $1,000 for families, according to the Obama plan - although the McCain campaign argues that Obama will not be able to pay for his campaign promises and deliver on the tax cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What Rendell called &quot;big lie number two&quot; has to do with McCain's portraying himself as a friend of renewable energy. The governor pointed to a series of votes in the Senate over the years in which McCain has opposed measures that would have encouraged the development of renewable energy sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mayor Nutter, who also attended the news conference, added, &quot;The terror many of us feel is that a McCain presidency turns into a Palin presidency, and then we're really in trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No such terror was in evidence at the Republican rally in Media yesterday afternoon when Palin spoke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Americans are tired of politics as usual,&quot; she told the crowd. &quot;. . . That's why we need to take the maverick of the Senate and put him in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The day also featured another exchange of commercials between the two campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain's latest entry highlights the Democratic candidate's connections to several figures from Illinois politics including fund-raiser Tony Rezko, a convicted felon. The ad concludes: &quot;With friends like that, Obama is not ready to lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama's blast focuses on an article written by McCain that talks up the benefits of deregulating the banking industry, touts a similar strategy for health care, and ends with these words: &quot;John McCain: A risk we can't afford to take.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain began his day in Scranton, where he attended a town-hall meeting organized by the local Irish American community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There, he spent much of his time discussing the financial crisis. But he also took time to give a preview of the first presidential debate, which is to take place Friday night in Oxford, Miss., on the subject of foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He talked about how the surge strategy, of which he was a leading advocate, had improved the security situation in Iraq, and how Obama, who opposed it, has refused to acknowledge its success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He was wrong about Iraq,&quot; McCain said. &quot;He was wrong about Georgia. He was wrong about Russia. He was wrong about Iran. And he's not right for America's future national security.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a recent online poll conducted by The Associated Press and Yahoo News, a third of white Democrats admit that the color of the presidential candidate will determine who gets their vote on Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is better news than it looks initially. We had to wait 100 years after the Civil War ended for Congress and a Democratic president to agree on landmark voting rights legislation that upheld the sanctity of the 14th Amendment by enshrining every citizen's right to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barely one generation removed from Jim Crow, it's a miracle that the percentage of white Democrats who can't bring themselves to vote for a black candidate isn't higher. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a time when the majority of Dems who didn't defect to Nixon's &quot;Silent Majority&quot; in 1968 would have dismissed the candidacy of Barack Obama on the grounds that the country &quot;wasn't ready&quot; to live up to its most radical democratic ideals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To paraphrase that old Virginia Slims ad, &quot;We've come a long way, brother.&quot; Indeed. The Democratic Party used to be the party of white supremacy, as many of my e-mail correspondents are fond of pointing out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last December, conservative historian Bruce Bartlett published an excerpt from his book &quot;Wrong on Race: The Democratic Party's Buried Past&quot; in The Wall Street Journal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a mini-compendium on the racial sins of the Democratic Party. It conveniently left out the sins of Democrats-turned-Republicans like Strom Thurmond and Jesse Helms, but, never mind. It was an eye-popping list of quotes and party platform statements over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish I had a dollar for every copy of Bartlett's essay that landed on my desk in the months that followed. I would make a fortune from a lot of Republicans who don't know to what extent they're living in glass houses, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, their points are well taken. There's a history of intolerance in the Democratic Party that is rarely acknowledged in polite company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given how odious a party that once housed the likes of President Andrew Johnson, Sen. John C. Calhoun and defenders of the Fugitive Slave Act was, a mere 33 percent of white Democrats refusing to vote for Obama in 2008 because of his color means we're practically in the Age of Aquarius.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's face it. A lot of folks have to die off before some of the attitudes of the last century have gone the way of poll taxes and brown paper bag tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In five weeks when Mr. Obama is elected the nation's first African-American president in what will undoubtedly be a squeaker, we'll still have to wait a generation until pigment becomes as much a non-issue as a candidate's astrological sign or shoe size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My Republican friends who aren't totally brainwashed by conservative talk radio are mystified by the overwhelmingly high percentage of blacks who vote Democratic every four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They're quick to remind me that African Americans were among the most loyal constituents of the Republican Party until the New Deal came along.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I point out that supporting the agenda of Franklin D. Roosevelt was rational at a time when the Democrats were creating a social safety net during the Depression, there is a lot of tut-tutting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to my conservative friends, blacks abandoned the &quot;free market egalitarianism&quot; of the Republicans for the &quot;second-class socialism&quot; of the Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They point out examples of bureaucratic condescension, especially during the flurry of badly designed programs and legislation that came out of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society that hurt blacks tremendously in the long run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What often gets lost in the back-and-forth about which party would be best for African Americans is the fact that wherever they settle, there's going to be unresolved racial animus still kicking around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having said that, I will concede this much to my Republican friends. If Gen. Colin Powell were the Republican nominee for president in their party in 2008, I believe a higher percentage of white Republicans would support him than there are Democrats supporting Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans are simply more disciplined than Democrats when it comes to supporting their standard bearer. They're loyal, if nothing else. They can't stand John McCain, but he's still tied with Barack Obama in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, I remain a Democrat because my values are more aligned with that party's progressive agenda. This is a rational decision for me, not a family habit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm also heartened by the fact that the majority of white Democrats are willing to vote for a black presidential candidate. For those who can't imagine doing such a thing, I ask that they try this thought experiment:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't think of the biracial candidate as a black man; think of him as three-fifths a white guy. That will get you through Election Day with a clear conscience.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. 'Off with his head!' she said without even looking around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- &quot;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the pressure of the financial crisis, one presidential candidate is behaving like a flustered rookie playing in a league too high. It is not Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Channeling his inner Queen of Hearts, John McCain furiously, and apparently without even looking around at facts, said Chris Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, should be decapitated. This childish reflex provoked The Wall Street Journal to editorialize that &quot;McCain untethered&quot; -- disconnected from knowledge and principle -- had made a &quot;false and deeply unfair&quot; attack on Mr. Cox that was &quot;unpresidential&quot; and demonstrated that Mr. McCain &quot;doesn't understand what's happening on Wall Street any better than Barack Obama does.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider Mr. McCain's characteristic accusation that Mr. Cox &quot;has betrayed the public's trust.&quot; Perhaps an old antagonism is involved in Mr. McCain's fact-free slander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His most conspicuous economic adviser is Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who previously headed the Congressional Budget Office. There he was an impediment to conservatives, including then-Congressman Cox, who as chairman of the Republican Policy Committee persistently tried and generally failed to enlist CBO support for &quot;dynamic scoring&quot; that would estimate the economic growth effects of proposed tax cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, Mr. McCain's smear -- that Mr. Cox &quot;betrayed the public's trust&quot; -- is a harbinger of a McCain presidency. For Mr. McCain, politics is always operatic, pitting people who agree with him against those who are &quot;corrupt&quot; or &quot;betray the public's trust,&quot; two categories that seem to be exhaustive -- there are no other people. Mr. McCain's Manichaean worldview drove him to his signature legislative achievement, the McCain-Feingold law's restrictions on campaigning. Today, his campaign is creatively finding interstices in laws intended to restrict campaign giving and spending. By a Gresham's Law of political discourse, Mr. McCain's Queen of Hearts intervention in the opaque financial crisis overshadowed a solid conservative complaint from the Republican Study Committee, chaired by Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas. In a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, the RSC decried the improvised torrent of bailouts as a &quot;dangerous and unmistakable precedent for the federal government both to be looked to and indeed relied upon to save private sector companies from the consequences of their poor economic decisions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This letter, listing just $650 billion of the perhaps more than $1 trillion in new federal exposures to risk, was sent while Mr. McCain's campaign, characteristically substituting vehemence for coherence, was airing an ad warning that Mr. Obama favors &quot;massive government, billions in spending increases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political left always aims to expand the permeation of economic life by politics. Today, the efficient means to that end is government control of capital. So, is not Mr. McCain's party now conducting the most leftist administration in American history? The New Deal never acted so precipitously on such a scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Treasury Secretary Paulson, asked about conservative complaints that his rescue program amounts to socialism, said, essentially: This is not socialism, this is necessary. That non sequitur might be politically necessary, but remember that government control of capital is government control of capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does Mr. McCain have qualms about this, or only quarrels? On &quot;60 Minutes&quot; Sunday evening, Mr. McCain, saying &quot;this may sound a little unusual,&quot; said that he would like to replace Mr. Cox with Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic attorney general of New York who is the son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo. Mr. McCain explained that Mr. Cuomo has &quot;respect&quot; and &quot;prestige&quot; and could &quot;lend some bipartisanship.&quot; Conservatives have been warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatives who insist that electing Mr. McCain is crucial usually start, and increasingly end, by saying he would make excellent judicial selections. But the more one sees of his impulsive, intensely personal reactions to people and events, the less confidence one has that he would select judges by calm reflection and clear principles, having neither patience nor aptitude for either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is arguable that, because of his inexperience, Mr. Obama is not ready for the presidency. It is arguable that Mr. McCain, because of his boiling moralism and bottomless reservoir of certitudes, is not suited to the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unreadiness can be corrected, although perhaps at great cost, by experience. Can a dismaying temperament be fixed?</SPAN></P>

This childish reflex provoked The Wall Street Journal to editorialize that &quot;McCain untethered&quot; -- disconnected from knowledge and principle -- had made a &quot;false and deeply unfair&quot; attack on Cox that was &quot;unpresidential&quot; and demonstrated that McCain &quot;doesn't understand what's happening on Wall Street any better than Barack Obama does.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To read the Journal's details about the depths of McCain's shallowness on the subject of Cox's chairmanship, see &quot;McCain's Scapegoat&quot; (Sept. 19, Page A22). Then consider McCain's characteristic accusation that Cox &quot;has betrayed the public's trust.&quot; Perhaps an old antagonism is involved in McCain's fact-free slander. His most conspicuous economic adviser is Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who previously headed the Congressional Budget Office. There he was an impediment to conservatives, including then-Congressman Cox, who as chairman of the Republican Policy Committee persistently tried and generally failed to enlist CBO support for &quot;dynamic scoring&quot; that would estimate the economic growth effects of proposed tax cuts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, McCain's smear -- that Cox &quot;betrayed the public's trust&quot; -- is a harbinger of a McCain presidency. For McCain, politics is always operatic, pitting people who agree with him against those who are &quot;corrupt&quot; or &quot;betray the public's trust,&quot; two categories that seem to be exhaustive -- there are no other people. McCain's Manichean worldview drove him to his signature legislative achievement, the McCain-Feingold law's restrictions on campaigning. Today, his campaign is creatively finding interstices in laws intended to restrict campaign giving and spending. (For details, see The Washington Post of Sept. 17, Page A4; and The New York Times of Sept. 20, Page 1.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By a Gresham's Law of political discourse, McCain's Queen of Hearts intervention in the opaque financial crisis overshadowed a solid conservative complaint from the Republican Study Committee, chaired by Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas. In a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, the RSC decried the improvised torrent of bailouts as a &quot;dangerous and unmistakable precedent for the federal government both to be looked to and indeed relied upon to save private sector companies from the consequences of their poor economic decisions.&quot; This letter, listing just $650 billion of the perhaps more than $1 trillion in new federal exposures to risk, was sent while McCain's campaign, characteristically substituting vehemence for coherence, was airing an ad warning that Obama favors &quot;massive government, billions in spending increases.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political left always aims to expand the permeation of economic life by politics. Today, the efficient means to that end is government control of capital. So, is not McCain's party now conducting the most leftist administration in American history? The New Deal never acted so precipitously on such a scale. Treasury Secretary Paulson, asked about conservative complaints that his rescue program amounts to socialism, said, essentially: This is not socialism, this is necessary. That non sequitur might be politically necessary, but remember that government control of capital is government control of capitalism. Does McCain have qualms about this, or only quarrels? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On &quot;60 Minutes&quot; Sunday evening, McCain, saying &quot;this may sound a little unusual,&quot; said that he would like to replace Cox with Andrew Cuomo, the Democrat attorney general of New York who is the son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo. McCain explained that Cuomo has &quot;respect&quot; and &quot;prestige&quot; and could &quot;lend some bipartisanship.&quot; Conservatives have been warned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatives who insist that electing McCain is crucial usually start, and increasingly end, by saying he would make excellent judicial selections. But the more one sees of his impulsive, intensely personal reactions to people and events, the less confidence one has that he would select judges by calm reflection and clear principles, having neither patience nor aptitude for either. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is arguable that, because of his inexperience, Obama is not ready for the presidency. It is arguable that McCain, because of his boiling moralism and bottomless reservoir of certitudes, is not suited to the presidency. Unreadiness can be corrected, although perhaps at great cost, by experience. Can a dismaying temperament be fixed? </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential race in Pennsylvania may well come down to a fight for the hearts and minds of people like Cindy Moran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's afraid that Republican John McCain will continue economic policies that led to the current financial crisis. But Democrat Barack Obama's remark last April that rural Pennsylvanians cling to their guns and religion still makes her uneasy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's just, I don't know what he's thinking,&quot; Moran said of Obama as she pondered the candidates after coffee at a rural farmers market near the Maryland border. &quot;I don't know what he wants, really. It'll be a last-minute decision, I think.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are plenty of reasons things should be going Obama's way in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state was a Democratic highlight in 2006 as the party took control of Congress, picking up a Senate seat and four House seats here more than in any other state. Since 2004, when President Bush barely lost the state to John Kerry, the Democratic advantage in party registration over the GOP has swelled to more than 1 million including 100,000 voters who have joined the party since the state's April primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even history is on Obama's side: A GOP presidential candidate hasn't won the state since 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this was Hillary Rodham Clinton country during the primary elections she defeated Obama decisively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the lead Obama had over McCain in polling here before the party conventions has dwindled. That's partly because of a burst of enthusiasm for McCain's selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, but Obama also has been struggling in Pennsylvania to attract the white working-class voters who flocked to Clinton in the primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both GOP candidates were campaigning in the state Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stakes are enormous: With 8.5 million registered voters and 21 electoral votes, Pennsylvania could decide who takes the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In McCain, Republicans say they've found a good fit for independent-minded voters in the state, who tend to be socially conservative. More than 10 percent of Pennsylvanians are military veterans, and the state ranks third in the percentage of people 65 and older, offering common ground with a 72-year-old former Vietnam prisoner of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are Democratic strongholds in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, and conservative bastions in Pennsylvania's rural central and northern regions. But the state's middle-class Philadelphia suburbs and old industrial towns are home to many voters willing to vote across party lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some haven't forgotten Obama's comment during a San Francisco fundraiser in April that bitter voters in rural Pennsylvania cling to guns and religion because of their economic frustrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state has fared better economically than its Rust Belt counterparts, Ohio and Michigan. But the number of residents who were unemployed reached a five-year high in August, and there's plenty of worry about the economy and government spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larry Fales Sr., 65, of York, a retired railroad worker, is one of the Democrats who hasn't warmed up to Obama. Taking a break from the Hungry Parrot Pizza Co. where he helps out his son, Fales said he would have voted for Clinton in the election, but now he'll vote for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is &quot;great at giving speeches and everything like that, but I just don't trust his past, and he promises too much,&quot; Fales said. &quot;I don't care who it is, no one can give what he promises he's going to give.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's the issue of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Democrat, Robert L. Hamilton Jr., 77, a Korean War veteran and retired postal worker, said he's leaning toward Obama but isn't sure about some others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bad part about Obama is you're going to have too many people vote against him because of his race,&quot; Hamilton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaching out to voters like Fales and Hamilton, Obama selected as his running mate Delaware Sen. Joe Biden, a Scranton native with lunchbucket roots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That helped seal the deal for voter Jay Weissman, 55, a therapist from the suburban Philadelphia town of Wynnewood, who spoke about the campaign while eating ice cream in his parked car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was concerned about his lack of experience, but that has been allayed with the appointment of Joe Biden,&quot; said Weissman, a Democrat who said he was a registered Republican until about five years ago. &quot;I feel much better about that now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, in turn, picked a running mate seemingly tailored to blue-collar Pennsylvania: Palin, an anti-abortion rights candidate who supports gun rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That won over Terri Morton, 47, of Lancaster County, who's registered as a Republican but voted for Al Gore in 2000 and Kerry four years ago. She said she was open to voting for Obama, but swung to McCain after watching Palin speak at the Republican convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's a regular person with real problems, family issues and all that, and that did it for me,&quot; Morton said from the clubhouse of the Four Seasons Golf Course, where she works as food and beverage manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As on every other issue, Pennsylvanians are hardly unanimous on the veep choice:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I trust my wife with anything and everything, and I trust Sarah the same way. She'll make the right decisions,&quot; said Phil Reilly, 48, a construction business owner and father of four from Chester Springs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I understand they needed to do that to bring some change in and go after my demographic of women white voters, but it's not enough to sway me,&quot; said Gabrielle Raia, 35, a biotech sales representative and real estate agent from Conshohocken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recognizing the need to attract blue-collar workers, the Obama team starting running an ad focused on the 2003 closure of a Corning Inc. plant in State College. The ad blames Washington and McCain help for selling workers out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mike DuHaime, McCain's political director, said, &quot;His record as one of an independent, as a maverick, brings a special appeal that you need in Pennsylvania.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One place Obama seems to be holding his own is in the Philadelphia suburbs, said Clay Richards, a pollster at Quinnipiac University. The region has historically voted Republican but has been moving more Democratic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Republican there, Matthew Curry, 25, an elementary school teacher who was selling lottery tickets at the Brewer's Outlet in Chadds Ford to pick up some extra money, said he thinks McCain is a good guy but too close to Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I plan on voting for Barack Obama,&quot; Curry said. &quot;I like pretty much everything. I like Joe Biden. I agree that he's going for change.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's eerily quiet. Maybe we need an all point's bulletin. If you've seen people with &quot;Vote for (INSERT NAME)&quot; buttons and handing out leaflets in your neighborhood, please contact your local political writer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Lloyd Smucker, who's running for the 13th state Senate seat - the news releases on his Web site are from the spring primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Democratic opponent Jose Urdaneta? Aside from Sunday's volunteer training session, the latest attention-grabbing headline on Urdaneta's Web site is from April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are others (Bill Neff, a Republican businessman who lost in the spring primary, is running a write-in campaign for state Senate), and I have no doubt all are knocking on doors, shaking hands, talking to people one on one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, there's been an absence of issue-oriented news releases from the campaigns, even as the state Legislature wrangles over critical measures like government reform and health insurance. No press conferences. No memos. Nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Bruce Slater and Republican Joe Pitts? Hardly a peep from either. Anybody know what they're running for? Anybody know who the third-party candidates are for that race?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This isn't so much a criticism of our various candidates as it is an observation. You can expect the rhetoric and exposure of everyone to get ramped up next month, but compared to previous general elections in Lancaster, there's hardly a murmur of conversation about the local races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without doubt, the various campaigns are operating in the shadow of the Barack Obama/John McCain race for president, so it's not easy to gain the attention of the press. In the last week, nearly every news article I've written for the Intelligencer Journal has been about the presidential race.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all Sen. Barack Obama's remarkable fundraising and sizable surplus, the Democratic presidential nominee entered the final two months of the presidential contest on virtually equal financial footing as his Republican rival, Sen. John McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to finance reports filed in the past two days with the Federal Election Commission, Mr. Obama and the Democratic National Committee ended August with $95 million in the bank. Mr. McCain and the Republican National Committee ended with about $94 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties are crucial players in the general election, coordinating some activities with the candidates while also spending independently to help them. Both sides also distributed money to state party committees to assist in the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is bypassing the public financing system for presidential contests. That burdens him with the continuing need to raise money. Mr. McCain has decided to accept $84 million in public financing -- and the spending limitations that go with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both men have chosen distinct money paths that seem suited to their circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic National Committee has $17.7 million in the bank and Mr. Obama has $77.4 million. The Republicans present a mirror image. The Republican National Committee has $76 million in the bank and Mr. McCain has given it $18 million of his surplus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mr. McCain now has $84 million for the next two months, without exerting any effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has been the money leader of the presidential campaign. Overall, he has raised more than $450 million to Mr. McCain's $210 million. Despite the advantage, Mr. Obama didn't shake Hillary Rodham Clinton until the final primary in June, and his race with Mr. McCain remains practically a dead heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insofar as money matters in this race, Mr. Obama can't afford to stay even with Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain is using every advantage provided to him by law to maximize his money. He is relying on running mate Sarah Palin, a popular draw in Republican circles, to help raise money for the party. He is running hybrid ads with the RNC, stretching his spending limits by having the party pay for half the cost of the television spots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August, Mr. Obama had the upper hand, according to FEC documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama raised $65 million during the month and Mr. McCain raised $47 million -- personal bests for both. Mr. McCain received a special boost of more than $9 million in the three days after he announced his selection of Alaska Gov. Palin as his running mate on Aug. 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama outspent Mr. McCain by $53.5 million to $41 million -- a joint spending rate of $3 million a day. More than half was spent on advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain spent about $23 million on commercials. Mr. Obama vastly outspent him -- about $33 million -- as he practically matched Mr. McCain's advertising in key states.</SPAN></P>

However, an ad approved by John McCain goes beyond nasty to despicable. In that ad, McCain accuses Barack Obama of passing a bill that provides sex education for young children. This is a complete lie and McCain knows it. Barack Obama once voted for a law in Illinois that was intended to protect children from sexual predators. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One part of that bill approved age-appropriate education of children to make them aware of such predators. It had nothing to do with &quot;sex education&quot; as McCain is implying. McCain and Palin continue with these &quot;swiftboating&quot; tactics because they don't have a plan to fix our economy, end the war in Iraq, provide health care and improve our educational system. I challenge all decent Americans, regardless of party to stand with me and say Enough! Enough! We can do better than this.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lending money to people who probably won't pay it back isn't good business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you wrap crummy loans in a clever package, they're still crummy loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your typical Wal-Mart shopper understands this. But the Masters of the Universe on Wall Street and in Washington evidently didn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a lot of people to blame for the subprime mortgage crisis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Reserve Board under Chairman Alan Greenspan (1987-2006) pursued what seems in hindsight clearly to have been way too loose a monetary policy. Banks were awash with money to lend and got careless in how they lent it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ostensibly to aid the poor and working class, the Clinton administration and Congress encouraged lenders to give mortgages to bad credit risks. The combination of easy money and the expansion of the number of borrowers unable to repay their loans sent housing prices through the roof, creating the bubble whose bursting has led to this crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress in 1999 repealed the law that established a bright line between commercial and investment banks. This meant bad investments by banks could jeopardize depositors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wall Street created &quot;derivatives&quot; which multiplied profits in good times, but which also multiplied risk if there were defaults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most important was corruption and mismanagement at the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac), which together controlled 90 percent of the secondary mortgage market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once your bank has lent you money to buy a house, it can't lend the money again until you pay it back. But if your bank sells your mortgage, it can make another loan right away. Without the secondary market, most of the funds for home mortgages would dry up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fannie and Freddie went broke because they bought billions of dollars worth of subprime mortgages, on which borrowers defaulted when the housing bubble popped. Fannie bought most of its bad mortgages from Countrywide Financial, whose CEO, Angelo Mozilo, gave sweetheart loans to senior executives of Fannie Mae.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fannie and Freddie cooked their books so senior executives would be paid millions of dollars in bonuses to which they were not entitled. Inadequate regulation kept the book-cooking from being discovered until the crisis had become a catastrophe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush proposed regulatory reforms in 2003, but Congress took no action. In 2005, John McCain and three other GOP senators proposed a strong reform bill. It died when Democrats threatened a filibuster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats opposed reform in part because they feared it would mean fewer loans to poor people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not facing any kind of financial crisis,&quot; Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass, told The New York Times when the Bush bill was introduced. &quot;The more pressure there is on these companies, the less we will see in terms of affordable housing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats and some Republicans opposed reform in part because Fannie and Freddie were very good at greasing palms. Fannie has spent $170 million on lobbying since 1998 and $19.3 million on political contributions since 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The principal recipient of Fannie Mae's largesse was Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. No. 2 was Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Dodd was also the second largest recipient in the Senate of contributions from Countrywide's political action committee and its employees, and the recipient of a home loan from Countrywide at well below market rates. The No. 1 senator on Countrywide's list? Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fannie Mae CEO Franklin Raines was forced to resign in December 2004 because of &quot;accounting irregularities.&quot; The Washington Post reported July 16 that the Obama campaign has called Mr. Raines &quot;seeking his advice on mortgage and housing policy matters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama appointed Mr. Raines' predecessor, James Johnson, as head of his vice presidential search committee until he also was implicated in &quot;accounting irregularities,&quot; and it was revealed he'd received cut-rate loans from Countrywide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chicago billionaire Penny Pritzker, head of Mr. Obama's finance committee, chaired the now-defunct Superior bank when it began to cook the books to conceal losses from subprime mortgages. The holding company her family owned collected $200 million in dividends on phony profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trouble with crony capitalism isn't capitalism. It's the cronies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is an invisible man in the 2008 election: the president of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican candidates have all but shunned him, save those who need him to help raise money. And to the extent any president can keep a low profile, George W. Bush is doing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saddled with one of the lowest approval ratings in polling history, the president is still in demand to shake the party money tree, though almost all of that is done out of the public eye. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sadly, a highly visible presence by the president will hurt the party and hurt John McCain,&quot; Mr. Bush's former spokesman Ari Fleischer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican candidates in close races compete for prominent politicians. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee stumped with North Carolina Sen. Elizabeth Dole, and former Speaker Newt Gingrich campaigned with Ohio Rep. Steve Chabot. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is booked for events every week through Election Day, while Mr. Bush's public political calendar has mostly been empty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The country is looking for change, and he's not the most popular president in recent times,&quot; said David Carney, political director for Bush's father, President George H. W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2000, Vice President Al Gore generally kept his distance from President Bill Clinton while seeking to succeed him. The two-term incumbent was still in demand with other Democrats, holding 202 fundraisers during his last year in office and campaigning for House candidates in states such as New York, Missouri, and Arkansas, Mrs. Clinton's former spokesman Jake Siewert said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton spent an enormous amount of time on the campaign trail,&quot; Mr. Siewert said. &quot;There was a fair amount of demand for him to do public events.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain didn't utter Bush's name during his Sept. 4 speech accepting the Republican nomination. Pairing the words &quot;George&quot; and &quot;Bush&quot; is seemingly so politically dangerous that the Arizona senator even referred to the elder Bush only as &quot;the 41st president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, 72, isn't the only Republican politician keeping his distance. Of 11 governor's races this year, the president has campaigned just with the North Carolina Republican nominee, Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory, and he has appeared with only a handful of hopefuls for 435 U.S. House seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For candidates this year, being photographed with Mr. Bush gives ammunition to opponents seeking to shackle Republicans to the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They simply don't want to be seen with him,&quot; said Tad Devine, a strategist in presidential campaigns for Mr. Gore and Sen. John F. Kerry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama released a television commercial earlier this month that, in 30 seconds, managed to show five different pictures of Mr. McCain with Mr. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House political director Barry Jackson wouldn't provide details on Bush's political schedule leading up to the Nov. 4 election. Specifics about Mr. Bush's appearances aren't released until several days before an event, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are lots of places he's not likely to go, like the Hampton Roads region in southeast Virginia. &quot;We haven't even discussed it,&quot; said Corry Bliss, campaign manager for Virginia U.S. Rep. Thelma Drake, when asked about a Bush visit. &quot;This campaign is about next year and the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, there's nothing in the works with Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi. &quot;Sen. Wicker is running his own race,&quot; campaign spokesman Ryan Annison said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain accepted Mr. Bush's endorsement in the White House Rose Garden on March 5, the day after sewing up the nomination. &quot;If he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies, I'd be glad to show up,&quot; Mr. Bush said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than six months later, Mr. McCain hasn't taken up the offer. Their only other joint appearance was on May 27, for less than a minute, when they shook hands as Mr. Bush boarded Air Force One after a Phoenix fundraiser.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Weekly Standard blog, Jonathan Last blasts the Obama campaign for using its database of supporters to inundate media outlets with calls and e-mails whenever it see or hears something it doesn't like. Citing a Chicago radio producer who said it was difficult to run his talk show in the face of &quot;constant, constant phone calls&quot; and e-mails, Mr. Last likened the tactic to a denial-of-service attack intended to render useless an Internet service or Web site. He notes that such cyber assaults, while legal in the United States, are outlawed in Britain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARDWIRED CONSERVATIVES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonathan Haidt at Edge says science now suggests that &quot;conservatism is a partially heritable personality trait that predisposes some people to be cognitively inflexible, fond of hierarchy and inordinately afraid of uncertainty, change and death. People vote Republican because Republicans offer 'moral clarity' -- a simple vision of good and evil that activates deep-seated fears in much of the electorate. Democrats, in contrast, appeal to reason with their long-winded explorations of policy options for a complex world.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PALIN VS. MCCAIN?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ella Hushagen of Stand Up for Health Care quotes and then comments on part of Sarah Palin's speech at the GOP convention:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the families of special-needs children all across this country, I have a message: For years, you sought to make America a more welcoming place for your sons and daughters. I pledge to you that if we are elected, you will have a friend and advocate in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a momentous oath -- and one that means Gov. Palin cannot in good faith support the health-care plan of her running mate ... Why not? Unfortunately Sen. McCain's plan would allow most insurance companies in the individual market to continue their current practices of denying coverage, charging far higher premiums and excluding crucial medical services based on peoples' pre-existing conditions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(standupforhealthcare.org)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POOR PITTSBURGH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harold Miller at Pittsburgh's Future helps explains why a recently released Census Bureau report found Pittsburgh to be one of the poorest large cities in the country, with a median household income in 2007 of $32,263, the fourth lowest among central cities in the top 40 regions. Pittsburgh, he points out, has a far higher proportion of college students and households headed by seniors than most other cities, and both juniors and seniors tend to make less money. Still, he points out, Pittsburgh wages and salaries do lag, even taking into account the relatively low cost of living here.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hotair notes Rush Limbaugh's Wall Street Journal op-ed blasting Barack Obama for a Spanish-language ad that suggests John McCain shares Mr. Limbaugh's hardline views on immigration (he doesn't):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What kind of potential president would let his campaign knowingly extract two incomplete, out-of-context lines from two radio parodies and build a framework of hate around them in order to exploit racial tensions? The segregationists of the 1950s and 1960s were famous for such vile fear-mongering.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Angry Drunk Bureaucrat provides a long list of ways to get to work if Port Authority workers go on strike. Aside from biking, walking and driving, they include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Helicopter/airplane -- Should this be an option for you, you probably have more money than sense. I would be perfectly happy to relieve you of this burden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Carpooling -- All the charms of a taxi combined with all the joys of being stuck at work with people you don't like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cannon -- I haven't tried this one out yet, but I'm pretty sure with the right wind conditions and with the appropriate caliber gun, anyone can hit the Steel Building.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">RALEIGH, N.C. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of a sudden, North Carolina matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It hasn't for decades in presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Democrat Barack Obama made an aggressive play for this traditionally GOP state and polls showed the race tightening. That forced Republican John McCain to defend his turf or risk ceding the Southern state -- and its 15 electoral votes -- to Democrats for the first time in 32 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, just seven weeks before the election, North Carolina has become a general-election battleground, one of 13 states where both candidates are competing with television commercials and campaign staff on the ground. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They clearly see the threat,&quot; Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said after Mr. McCain's campaign intensified its efforts here. &quot;They can profess that they're not concerned. But their spending and their actions belie&quot; that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Schmidt, Mr. McCain's chief strategist, insists the campaign is unconcerned: &quot;It's just one more state where the Obama campaign has allowed its hubris to dictate spending decisions. John McCain will win North Carolina and soon you will see the Obama camp withdraw from North Carolina like you have seen them withdraw from other states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public polling shows a competitive race, though private surveys for both Republicans and Democrats give Mr. McCain an edge of anywhere from 3 to 8 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Time/CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Wednesday showed the race virtually tied at 48 percent for Mr. McCain, 47 percent for Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenge for Mr. Obama may have increased after Mr. McCain selected Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, a choice that has energized conservatives. At a recent Republican gathering in Cary for veterans, the mere mention of Ms. Palin's name drew thunderous applause while Mr. McCain's name elicited a tepid response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not that thrilled about McCain,&quot; said James Arscott, 66, a National Guard veteran and a Republican. &quot;That is, I wasn't thrilled about McCain until Sarah Palin came about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Democratic loyalists acknowledge that it is difficult to imagine North Carolina voting for Mr. Obama, who would be the country's first black president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would be stunned,&quot; said Tim Rohde, 51, a Democrat from Raleigh. &quot;But it would be amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It takes 270 electoral votes to claim the White House. Typically, candidates compete for them in upward of two dozen states early in a general election only to see those that historically aren't swing states drop out of contention by the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposite has occurred with North Carolina. Look no further than the state's population spurt -- and its origins in the more liberal Northeast -- to understand why Mr. Obama thinks he has a shot this year, and why Mr. McCain isn't taking it for granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White-collar workers have poured into Charlotte's financial hub in the south, while recent college graduates and their young families have been drawn to plentiful jobs and quality education in the academic Research Triangle encompassing Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill. Retirees concerned about health care and the environment have settled on both sides of the state, from the eastern coastline to the western mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter registration rolls illustrate the shifting tide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Board of Elections records show that Democratic registrations have risen 7 percent since the start of 2008, while Republican registrations grew about 1 percent. There are now about 40 percent more Democrats than Republicans in North Carolina, although members of both state parties tend to be more conservative than their national counterparts. Registrations among blacks, a pivotal part of the Democratic base, are up almost 10 percent while white registrations are up 4 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of registrations for voters who don't claim a political party jumped 11 percent this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference yesterday morning in Pittsburgh with Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, Mr. Rendell said that television ads and statements by the campaign have inaccurately suggested that Mr. McCain's Democratic opponent, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, would raise taxes on most Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vast majority, in fact, would receive bigger tax breaks under Mr. Obama's tax plan, he said, outlining various groups of lower- and middle-income people, ranging from a single parent with young children to couples and elderly widows, that he said would do better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokespeople for the McCain campaign did not return calls and e-mails yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rendell and others have accused the McCain campaign before of making false statements about Mr. Obama's tax plan. Last week, for example, FactCheck.org said the McCain campaign &quot;has released yet another ad that makes false claims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we keep saying,&quot; the Web site noted, &quot;Obama says he'll raise income taxes and capital gains taxes only for couples earning more than $250,000 per year or singles making over $200,000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less clear is how Mr. Obama, if elected, would accomplish those goals, particularly facing budget deficits and a struggling economy, said G. Terry Madonna, a political science professor and pollster from Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news conference was held at Grandview Park, Mount Washington, where the Obama campaign kicked off &quot;Steps for Change,&quot; a local effort to register new voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show the race between Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama has narrowed in Pennsylvania, considered a battleground state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to a small group of Obama canvassers at the news conference, Mr. Ravenstahl and Mr. Vilsack, a Pittsburgh native, urged them to press on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to continue to do whatever we can&quot; before the Nov. 4 election, the mayor said. &quot;You all will make the difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Lindsay, a McCain campaign spokesman, said that at a time of increased economic hardship, Pennsylvania families deserve to know about Mr. Obama's record, including that he has voted for higher taxes &quot;nearly 100 times&quot; in the Senate and &quot;plans to tax coal and natural gas that are an engine for job growth in the state.&quot; In February, Mr. Obama did tell a San Antonio newspaper, &quot;What we ought to tax is dirty energy, like coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas.&quot; But the remark was made after he was asked whether taxes should be levied on renewable energy sources and &quot;was not a general call for increasing taxes on coal or natural gas,&quot; according to FactCheck.org. Mr. Obama &quot;certainly does not have any such proposal as part of his public platform,&quot; the Web site noted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news conference was held at Grandview Park, Mount Washington, where the Obama campaign kicked off &quot;Steps for Change,&quot; a local effort to register new voters. While those efforts have been ongoing, &quot;Steps for Change&quot; acknowledged Pittsburgh's status as the U.S. city with the most public stairways -- 712, with a total of 44,645 steps.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the rationale for the AIG bailout was understandable, the upshot was a further turn toward what economist Nouriel Roubini has called the &quot;United Socialist State Republic of America.&quot; This was, wrote Roubini, the &quot;first pure case of a fully private company, actually the largest insurance company in the world, being nationalized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so after several weeks of election-year trivialities, both presidential candidates were forced to step up. Barack Obama's initial response was tepid; the reality is that his party bears some of the blame for the meltdown on Wall Street. Democrats have been almost as bullish about deregulation as the GOP. And Obama has actually taken more in campaign contributions from the financial sector than John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Obama has long spoken of a &quot;21st century regulatory framework.&quot; And Wednesday he released a new ad, a full two minutes long, detailing his plans to deal with the economy. Much of it was boilerplate, though I was struck by his assertion that we need to &quot;bring a responsible end to this war in Iraq so we stop spending billions each month rebuilding their country when we should be rebuilding ours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's response was angrier, but ultimately less credible. He initially came out against the AIG bailout - a conservative position - but then backed off. More startling was his fiery condemnation of Wall Street. He called the crisis &quot;the result of unchecked corporate greed,&quot; and insisted that &quot;government must protect the public from investment schemes too complex for people to understand or regulate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greed is bad? Government needs to protect the people from capitalist excesses? Since when do Republicans believe any of this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has been a champion of deregulation, though to a lesser extent than other Republicans. His economic adviser, Phil Gramm, was an architect of the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which removed &quot;the Depression-era walls between banking, investment and insurance companies,&quot; according to an article in last week's Washington Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That bill allowed AIG to participate in the gold rush of a rapidly expanding global banking and investment market,'' reported the Post. &quot;But the legislation also helped pave the way for companies such as AIG and Lehman Brothers to become behemoths laden with bad loans and investments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deregulation, in other words, led to excess. Who could have guessed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So now McCain, even his party, are forced to acknowledge that, as one online commenter noted last week, markets without regulation work about as well as a football game without referees. But can they be trusted to tighten the strings they have been so committed to loosening? Is McCain selling out a core principle for the sake of political expediency? Does he actually understand the need for a streamlined, 21st-century regulatory framework?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do the Democrats?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And perhaps most importantly - do you?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL OPINION; P-com Opinion; Pg. 15</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">686 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HE'S AT it again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, Barack Obama insulted rural Pennsylvanians, among others, by calling them bitter, clinging to their guns and religion. He said it at a private fund-raiser in San Francisco wine and cheese country, where the sky is as blue as the voters, and apparently thought the rubes would remain blissfully ignorant of his disdain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the guy is big on bilingualism. And now he's trying the same thing again - this time in Spanish. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has just come out with new TV and radio ads trying to link John McCain with racism. And he's given this smear a &quot;muy caliente&quot; multicultural twist. The TV ad features derogatory comments about Latinos presumably made by Rush Limbaugh on his radio show. Limbaugh, of course, is unhappy. He says that his comments were taken out of context. (In an election year, imagine that!)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I don't care about Limbaugh. For one thing, he and I are borders apart on immigration reform. For another, he's perfectly capable of defending himself against the junior senator of Illinois and his crew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What I do care about is the false impression Obama is trying to create by encouraging Latinos to believe that John McCain and George Bush are not only racist but anti-immigrant as well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flashing pictures of the GOP candidate and the president in the same frame, a disembodied voice implies that &quot;they&quot; derailed immigration reform. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It goes on: &quot;John McCain and his Republican friends have two faces. One that lies just to get our vote and another, even worse, that continues the failed policies of George Bush that put special interests ahead of working families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these are the facts, folks:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the 12 years that I've been practicing immigration law, there have been only two Republicans who actually worked in a major public way toward getting a reasonable solution to the immigration problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both of them are pictured in that dishonest commercial. At great political risk, both men - McCain in particular - tried to work with their ideological opponents to create pragmatic and effective legislation that would reduce the size of the undocumented population in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush had his doomed guest- worker program. McCain entered into a shotgun marriage with Ted Kennedy and proposed workable comprehensive immigration legislation that was distorted by a label that made compromise impossible: &quot;Amnesty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither Bush nor McCain were successful in their efforts because of congressional gridlock brought on by fierce public opposition. Ironically, this was one of the few times that rank-and-file Democrats and Republicans agreed on something: Secure that border first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That battle will continue well beyond this election cycle. And I continue to hope that the misleading labels are erased, and we can finally talk some sense about immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the time is obviously not now, and the person to do it is definitely not Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the Democratic nominee is trying to do is appeal to a demographic he desperately needs in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator from Illinois is trying to convince Latino voters that he's on their side and that the other guy is aiming to deport their families. This is what his Spanish-speaking surrogate says on the radio: &quot;Don't forget that John McCain abandoned us rather than confront the leaders of the Republican Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nice way to twist the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCCAIN HASN'T &quot;abandoned&quot; immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What he has done is take a step backward and indicate a desire to find some common ground where immigration reform will not be stymied by the same gridlock that doomed his original proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama seems to think if he just keeps beating that drum long enough, voters will fall in line. They won't need to know if the lyrics are true - they'll just fall for the seductive rhythms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In pandering to Latinos who voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton during the primaries, Obama has shown that, contrary to his campaign's accusations, he's the one playing the race card in this election. Only this time it's brown, not black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Que verguenza. And I'm sure Obama knows what that means: &quot;That's shameful!&quot; *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Don Draper, the fictional advertising executive played by Jon Hamm on &quot;Mad Men,&quot; couldn't salvage Microsoft's ad campaign featuring Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Gates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not a pretty sight. The former sitcom star and the world's richest software developer ambled through the mystifying TV spots like Vladimir and Estragon on the lam from &quot;Waiting for Godot.&quot; The ads, the first wave of a campaign to rehabilitate Windows, were derided by computer geeks and normal people alike. Microsoft pulled the plug this week (though claiming that was their plan all along).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first spot, the two men -- who could easily buy entire ZIP codes with the cash they had in their pockets that day -- fake familiarity with downscale shopping at a discount shoe store. In another, the celebrities, bunking with an ordinary family in a suburban split-level, find themselves commenting on the incongruity of it all: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gates: &quot;Why are we doing this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seinfeld: &quot;Why, Bill? Because as we discussed, you and I are a little out of it. You're in some kind of moon house hovering over Seattle like the mothership. I've got so many cars, I get stuck in my own traffic. We need to connect with real people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The resident grandmother wanders by their bedroom door wailing: &quot;Who took my teeth out of the freezer?&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seinfeld [pointing to her]: &quot;That's real!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gates [nodding]: &quot;Hmmm. I felt that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the spots are supposed to be an answer to Apple's &quot;I'm a Mac, I'm a PC&quot; campaign, it was a miserable failure. Bill Gates is no John Hodgman, though Jerry Seinfeld has a lot in common with the smug, black-attired Mac guy in the ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his trouble, Mr. Seinfeld pocketed a cool $10 million for writing the most baffling commercials in a generation. I know a lot of pretentious people, and no one has been able to explain to me what's going on in these spots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, the absurdity of two gazillionaires shopping at a discount shoe outlet is reminiscent of the McCain campaign's faux populism of recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin are very much like Bill Gates and Jerry Seinfeld -- except the latter are keenly aware how phony their pose as mall rats looks to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Republican presidential ticket doesn't care how inauthentic they sound as long as their stump speech helps them &quot;connect with real people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So John McCain hits the campaign trail every day, sounding increasingly like actor Wallace Shawn doing a really bad Huey Long imitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's clear that being a man of the people doesn't come naturally to Mr. McCain. Even as storied financial institutions began crashing and burning like the Hindenburg all over Wall Street, John McCain stuck to his assessment that the &quot;fundamentals of the economy&quot; were sound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the post-convention bounce that tied the two campaigns suddenly evaporated, Mr. McCain abandoned his relentlessly optimistic line about the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now we're supposed to believe that the &quot;fundamentals&quot; he's been referring to all along is really a metaphor for the humble American worker -- not the market. He assures us he would never say that the &quot;fundamentals&quot; of American capitalism are sound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if to prove John McCain's bona fides as the kind of man an unemployed steel worker in Ohio could have a beer with, the campaign rolled out a prominent Hillary supporter who defected to the Republicans -- Lynn Forester de Rothschild.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lady Rothschild, a member in good standing of the &quot;Let 'em eat cake&quot; wing of the Democratic Party, told an incredulous Campbell Brown on CNN that she couldn't support Barack Obama because he is &quot;elitist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, you have to understand how ridiculous this seems to a lot of people,&quot; Ms. Brown said. &quot;You're a Rothschild. You're married to a billionaire. You were a millionaire before you married him. You're a jetsetter. You live between New York and London. And yet, you're calling Barack Obama an elitist. Are you not a member of the elite?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lady Rothschild, after noting her middle-class upbringing in New Jersey, insisted that Barack Obama was a divisive figure who promulgated class warfare and thinks he's &quot;grander than the rest of us.&quot; She supports Mr. McCain because he's a champion of the middle class and that he and Sarah Palin &quot;are the great Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a second, I thought I was watching another one of Jerry Seinfeld's maddeningly opaque Microsoft commercials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">853 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anew Obama-Biden ad includes misleading claims about McCain and education spending, according to FactCheck.org:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---It says McCain &quot;voted to cut education funding&quot; and lists five votes. But one was a vote for increased education funding, although for fewer dollars than what Democrats may have wanted. And three others were votes against additional funding, not votes for funding cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---The ad says that &quot;McCain's economic plan gives $200 billion more to special interests while taking money away from public schools.&quot; Not exactly. McCain has proposed a one-year freeze on discretionary spending in general. A freeze would mean that funds would not keep pace with inflation and population growth, but no dollars would be &quot;taken away.&quot; The $200 billion for &quot;special interests&quot; refers to the cost of McCain's proposal to reduce the tax rate for all business corporations, not just a few &quot;special&quot; ones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: On Sept. 9, Obama gave a speech on education in Ohio, and his campaign released a new attack ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad says that McCain &quot;voted to cut education funding&quot; and lists five Senate votes. But only one of the five meets that description, and even then, the vote requires further explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995, McCain voted for a Republican budget resolution for fiscal year 1996 that would have reduced education spending from the previous year. But education was not the only budget item targeted. The resolution was actually one in a series of appropriations bills for departments ranging from Health and Human Services to the Department of Energy, and in each measure, the Newt Gingrich-led Republicans tried to reduce funding from the previous year's level. President Bill Clinton refused to sign any of the measures, and the government was shut down for a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides that vote to actually cut funding, the ad lists three votes against increased funding for the Department of Education. In the past, we've criticized Republicans for falsely attacking Obama on voting for tax increases when he actually voted against tax cuts. Obama's&nbsp;ad applies the same faulty logic. Voting against an increase is notably different from voting for a funding cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those three votes were:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---A vote McCain cast against an amendment to the 2006 budget resolution to increase discretionary education funding by $500 million. It passed anyway, and McCain voted for the final bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---A vote against an amendment to the 2001 budget resolution that would have repealed tax cuts worth $250 billion in order to increase education funding. It passed anyway, and, again McCain voted for the final bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---A vote against an amendment in 2001 to add $250 million to Title I funding for struggling schools. The measure failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---Finally, the Obama campaign points to McCain's vote in 2000 for the next year's education appropriations bill, saying in their ad backup that it &quot;underfunded&quot; the department. But that legislation, which was signed into law by President Clinton, was a spending increase from the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special interests: The ad also says, &quot;John McCain's economic plan gives $200 billion more to special interests while taking money away from public schools.&quot; But that's misleading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To start, McCain's plan doesn't include any specific cuts to education programs and funding. Rather, he has proposed an across-the-board &quot;freeze [of] non-defense, non-veterans discretionary spending for a year.&quot; So education grants, as well as all sorts of other government programs like farm subsidies and NASA projects, would not receive their annual funding increase for one year. Some would argue that a freeze is actually a cut when you factor in the effect of inflation. And others would go further and say it's a cut if the money had been projected by an earlier budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the Obama campaign provided us with an analysis done by the Tennessee affiliate of the National Education Association that demonstrated the difference in funding between a freeze and the anticipated increase from the previous year's budget. To the NEA Tennessee branch, a freeze is a cut. But even if one agrees with that, McCain's proposal to freeze the entire discretionary budget is different from a proposal to specifically &quot;take money away from public schools,&quot; as the ad says. No dollars are being &quot;taken away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;$200 billion to special interests&quot; line is actually a new version of an old attack. It refers to the total cost, over five years, of McCain's proposal to lower the corporate tax rate. The Tax Policy Center's analysis of McCain's plan estimates a $200 billion loss of revenue over the next five years. We've criticized the Obama campaign previously for unfairly implying that McCain's plan would give tax breaks targeted to &quot;oil companies.&quot; In this case, the campaign calls a change in taxes on all businesses a giveaway to &quot;special interests.&quot; But the corporate tax rate is paid by any incorporated entity, a group that includes restaurant owners, garage mechanics and other small businesses that we suspect few would call a &quot;special interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FactCheck.org is a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Penn sylvania.<BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama released a national television ad Tuesday highlighting a Pennsylvania factory that closed four years ago and blaming tax policies embraced by his opponent, Republican Sen. John McCain, for the job losses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The factory - Corning Inc.'s former State College plant, which manufactured glass television tubes - shut its doors in 2004, leaving 1,000 people without jobs. The workers were then hired to disassemble the plant and ship the equipment to China, according to the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Washington sold them out with the help of people like John McCain,&quot; the narrator says, referencing McCain's support for legislation that Democrats say leads to companies shipping jobs overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign fired back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain sees job losses as a crisis that demands leadership, but it's clear that Barack Obama sees them as an opportunity to launch political distortions,&quot; said Paul Lindsay, an Ohio-Pennsylvania spokesman for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee also released a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In lieu of accomplishments or any real record of reform, Barack Obama is choosing gutter politics to attack John McCain,&quot; GOP spokesman Blair Latoff said. &quot;Pennsylvanians have already seen Barack Obama's thin record and false attacks, and just as they did this spring, they're eager to tell him 'Thanks but no thanks.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama camp appears to be stepping up its attacks on McCain's record with the economy as the nation reacts to the recent troubles of several financial giants, including Merrill Lynch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls have consistently shown the economy is the top concern among registered voters in Pennsylvania and that a majority of those who worry about the economy are more likely to vote for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, McCain and Obama are in a statistical tie in recent Pennsylvania surveys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a conference call with reporters Wednesday, Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell launched several sharply worded criticisms of McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rendell cited votes McCain cast in the Senate - three since 1995 - supporting tax breaks for companies that &quot;ship jobs overseas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain continues to support tax breaks that are at the heart of what's wrong with the American economy,&quot; Rendell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign also released a television ad Tuesday after the collapse of investment firm Lehman Brothers, the emergency buyout of investment firm Merrill Lynch and the federal bailout of insurance giant AIG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You, the American workers, are the best in the world,&quot; McCain says into the camera. &quot;But your economic security has been put at risk by the greed of Wall Street. That's unacceptable. My opponent's only solutions are talk and taxes. I'll reform Wall Street and fix Washington. I've taken on tougher guys than this before.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama released a national television ad Tuesday highlighting a Pennsylvania factory that closed four years ago and blaming tax policies embraced by his opponent, Republican Sen. John McCain, for the job losses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The factory - Corning Inc.'s former State College plant, which manufactured glass television tubes - shut its doors in 2004, leaving 1,000 people without jobs. The workers were then hired to disassemble the plant and ship the equipment to China, according to the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Washington sold them out with the help of people like John McCain,&quot; the narrator says, referencing McCain's support for legislation that Democrats say leads to companies shipping jobs overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign fired back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain sees job losses as a crisis that demands leadership, but it's clear that Barack Obama sees them as an opportunity to launch political distortions,&quot; said Paul Lindsay, an Ohio-Pennsylvania spokesman for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee also released a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In lieu of accomplishments or any real record of reform, Barack Obama is choosing gutter politics to attack John McCain,&quot; GOP spokesman Blair Latoff said. &quot;Pennsylvanians have already seen Barack Obama's thin record and false attacks, and just as they did this spring, they're eager to tell him 'Thanks but no thanks.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama camp appears to be stepping up its attacks on McCain's record with the economy as the nation reacts to the recent troubles of several financial giants, including Merrill Lynch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls have consistently shown the economy is the top concern among registered voters in Pennsylvania and that a majority of those who worry about the economy are more likely to vote for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, McCain and Obama are in a statistical tie in recent Pennsylvania surveys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a conference call with reporters Wednesday, Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell launched several sharply worded criticisms of McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rendell cited votes McCain cast in the Senate - three since 1995 - supporting tax breaks for companies that &quot;ship jobs overseas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain continues to support tax breaks that are at the heart of what's wrong with the American economy,&quot; Rendell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign also released a television ad Tuesday after the collapse of investment firm Lehman Brothers, the emergency buyout of investment firm Merrill Lynch and the federal bailout of insurance giant AIG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You, the American workers, are the best in the world,&quot; McCain says into the camera. &quot;But your economic security has been put at risk by the greed of Wall Street. That's unacceptable. My opponent's only solutions are talk and taxes. I'll reform Wall Street and fix Washington. I've taken on tougher guys than this before.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day after he dismissed a federal bailout for American International Group Inc., Republican presidential nominee John McCain yesterday announced that circumstances had forced him to shift his position, and that he supported the proposed $85 billion rescue of the insurance giant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator, who in recent days has slammed what he called Wall Street greed and corruption for causing the latest stock market downward spiral, said he had to change his position on AIG to protect millions of Americans who could be hurt if the company were forced to seek bankruptcy protection. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government was forced to commit $85 billion,&quot; Mr. McCain said in a statement. &quot;These actions stem from failed regulation, reckless management and a casino culture on Wall Street that has crippled one of the most important companies in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The focus of any such action should be to protect the millions of Americans who hold insurance policies, retirement plans and other accounts with AIG,&quot; he said. &quot;We must not bail out the management and speculators who created this mess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a campaign stop in Elko, Nev., Mr. McCain's Democratic rival, Barack Obama, also insisted that any federal action must not bail out AIG shareholders and management. He also said the week's economic news was troubling, but insisted that most people already knew the economy was in difficulty. Then the Illinois senator attacked Mr. McCain, emphasizing themes that Democrats have consistently put forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been an interesting week for John McCain. It's been really interesting to watch him respond to this economic news,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;His first reaction to this crisis on Monday was to stand up and repeat the line he's said over and over and over again throughout this campaign -- quote -- 'the fundamentals of our economy are strong.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, his campaign must've realized that probably wasn't a smart thing to say on the day of a financial meltdown, so they sent him back out a few hours later to clean up his remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it sounds like he got a little carried away because yesterday John McCain actually said that if he's president, he'll take on the -- quote -- 'old boys network' in Washington. I am not making this up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is someone who's been in Congress for 26 years, who put seven of the most powerful Washington lobbyists in charge of his campaign, and now he tells us that he's the one who will take on the old boy network,&quot; the Democrat said. &quot;The old boy network? In the McCain campaign, that's called a staff meeting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All week, the economy has reasserted itself as the top campaign issue. The growing federal role in trying to save the financial sector during a fiercely fought presidential election has both candidates calling for regulatory reform to prevent more capital markets mayhem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both have upped their populist rhetoric, insisting to voters that their rival lacks the leadership to make substantial changes. But the financial tailspin represents a special problem for Mr. McCain and Republicans, who generally favor open, unregulated markets and generally oppose federal loan guarantees and bailouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a spate of morning television interviews Tuesday, the Arizona senator opposed the idea of an AIG bailout. &quot;We cannot have the taxpayers bail out AIG or anybody else,&quot; he said on NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the McCain campaign was forced to reconsider, said senior advisor Matt McDonald, who yesterday toured a General Motors auto plant in Michigan with the senator. &quot;He doesn't like what happened, but his priority is working Americans who could be impacted,&quot; the advisor said of Mr. McCain. &quot;They're the ones who have to be protected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain visited the GM plant in Lake Orion, where 4,200 people and 600 robots produce Chevrolet Malibus and the Pontiac G6. &quot;We're not going to leave the workers here in Michigan hung out to dry while we give billions in taxpayers' dollars to Wall Street,&quot; Mr. McCain insisted. &quot;We're going to take care of the workers, the workers. They are the ones who deserve our help. It's time to get our auto industry back on its feet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning in Cleveland, Mr. McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, expressed disappointment that the federal government needed to inject tax money into yet another financial institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Obama campaign released a two-minute ad on the economy. In the ad, Mr. Obama talks about his ideas for reforming the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He calls for a $1,000 tax break to the middle class, &quot;instead of showering more on oil companies and corporations that outsource our jobs.&quot; He pledges &quot;real regulation that protects your investments and pensions,&quot; energy independence, an end to the war in Iraq and a crackdown on lobbyists &quot;once and for all, so their backroom deal-making no longer drowns out the voices of the middle class and undermines our common interests as Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donna Cole is a small businesswoman, owner of a diner in Shaler and a passionate Hillary Rodham Clinton supporter who, she likes to say, &quot;broke through the glass ceiling all by myself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But bring up the issue of pay equity, and suddenly the 51-year-old owner of the Cole Cafe -- who is still undecided about who she will vote for in November -- looks like a stumped contestant on &quot;Jeopardy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not familiar with that term,&quot; she said politely during an interview, before wheeling around and asking eight women -- waitresses and customers: &quot;Have you girls ever heard of something called pay equity?&quot; In unison, the women shook their heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, framed differently -- equal pay for women and men doing equal work -- pay equity suddenly becomes an issue most women understand, and Sen. Barack Obama's Democratic presidential campaign is hoping it may also sway votes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, pay equity is being showcased as a centerpiece issue in the campaign's much-ballyhooed &quot;Women for the Change We Need Week of Action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the campaign aired an ad about the issue in key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, along with a radio spot and an Internet ad on sites frequented by women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, Delaware Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, and Mrs. Clinton, the New York senator, talked about pay equity in an online video chat. Meanwhile, Michelle Obama and Jill Biden stumped on the campaign trail with Lilly Ledbetter, the plaintiff in a lawsuit that ended when the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling last year making it more difficult for women to sue for pay discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of all, Mr. Obama and his surrogates have been lambasting Sen. John McCain for his opposition to a Senate bill that would have reversed the high court's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But does the issue of pay equity have traction with the one group of voters who matter most -- undecided women?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, among unmarried female voters, the answer is yes, according to Anna Greenberg of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, a Washington, D.C., polling and research firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pay equity has tested very well with unmarried women,&quot; who live from paycheck to paycheck, said Ms. Greenberg. &quot;Of course you have to explain it simply, as equal pay for equal work, and it has to be framed as part of a larger attack on John McCain's economic policies and how they negatively impact women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain has said the Senate bill, which extends the statute of limitations on when suits can be filed, would lead to more unnecessary lawsuits clogging the legal system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign also struck back with a news release this week claiming that Mr. Obama's female Senate staffers held fewer senior positions than men did and, as a result, were paid on average $9,000 a year less than men on the staff. In Mr. McCain's office, more women held senior positions and, on average, were paid $2,000 more than men, the campaign said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do these candidates actually behave when it comes to equal pay for equal work?&quot; asked Carly Fiorina, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, in an interview Tuesday -- shortly before she was temporarily benched by the McCain campaign for saying that none of the candidates were ready to run a major corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allison Price, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign, called the McCain salvo &quot;dishonest&quot; and noted that it &quot;doesn't change the fact that even in 2008, John McCain still opposes requiring that women be paid the same as men who do the same jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Fiorina noted that Mr. McCain has a strong record supporting women's equality. He supported the U.S. Glass Ceiling Commission, a 1990s-era federal panel that studied the barriers to female advancement within corporate hierarchies, and fought to eliminate a 43-year ban against women flying combat missions, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also cited economists who have noted that factors such as schooling, work experience and a preference for part-time work when caring for young children contribute to the pay gap -- not discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If most women work in secretarial jobs and men in managerial [positions], women are going to be paid less than men,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It isn't quite that simple, contended Chris Briem, an economist at the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Social and Urban Research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is there still occupational segregation in the workplace? It's better than it's been in the past, but if you look at income strata at the very low end, it's very much women-dominated, and you have to question what's causing that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly, women moving in and out of the labor force will see an impact on their future earnings, but is that the only explanation for this disparity? I don't think so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the existing law's six-month statute of limitations is ample time for a female employee to seek legal redress for paycheck discrimination, Ms. Fiorina said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's ridiculous, countered Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano, noting that Ms. Ledbetter didn't discover that she'd been underpaid in comparison to her male colleagues until six months before she retired -- and 19 years after the discrimination began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most women don't find out about this right away,&quot; she told a group of Obama volunteers gathered Sunday at Chatham University. &quot;Most employers don't post salaries, or send out e-mails, so how is it reasonable to expect they will find out within six months? We want to make sure that the statute of limitations in this law isn't used to close the courthouse door.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was this line that got the biggest round of applause from Obama supporters during Ms. Napolitano's appearance -- but it's not clear if that will translate into votes on that issue alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, wow,&quot; said Barbara Pecoraro, a 40-year-old sales representative from Dormont. &quot;The problem with that whole equal pay thing is that there are a lot variables. You can mask a lot of things a lot of different kind of ways. It really is a subjective thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Pecoraro says she will vote for Mr. Obama, but Ms. Cole still wasn't sure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if equal pay would be the determining factor,&quot; Ms. Cole said. &quot;I was loyal to Hillary, but now I'm still not sure who I'm going to vote for. A candidate's position on something like this would give me reason to pause and think, but it still wouldn't push me over the edge.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- John McCain blamed Wall Street's &quot;casino culture,&quot; and Barack Obama blamed Republicans -- including McCain -- on Wednesday for the financial turmoil that led to the government's takeover of the nation's largest insurer.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government was forced to commit $85 billion,&quot; McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, said in a statement about the Federal Reserve's loan Tuesday night to American International Group. &quot;These actions stem from failed regulation, reckless management and a casino culture on Wall Street that has crippled one of the most important companies in America.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, pounced, calling McCain's views &quot;an eleventh-hour conversion to the language of reform&quot; after decades of support for Republican policies deferring to markets and cutting government regulation of them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed's takeover of AIG &quot;is the final verdict on the failed economic philosophy of the last eight years,&quot; Obama charged in a statement. &quot;This crisis serves as a stark reminder of the failures of crony capitalism and an economic philosophy that sees any regulation at all as unwise and unnecessary. ... Despite his eleventh-hour conversion to the language of reform, Senator McCain has subscribed to this philosophy for 26 years in Washington.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain supported 1999 legislation that tore down Depression-era legal walls separating commercial banks, investment banks and insurers from one another. However, President Clinton, a Democrat, signed it into law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout his congressional career, the Arizona senator usually has backed cutting federal regulation of industries in the name of promoting free markets and ending government interference, which is Republican ideology. However, he's sided with Democrats in voting for HMO regulation, background checks for sales at gun shows and tougher fuel-economy standards for autos. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the closest modern parallel to recent government intervention in Wall Street's crisis, McCain voted in support of the 1989 bill to clean up the debt-ridden savings and loan industry, which passed the Senate 91-8. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain was one of the &quot;Keating Five&quot; senators, whom the Senate Ethics Committee investigated for their relationships with Charles Keating, the chairman of the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. Keating gave McCain's campaigns about $112,000 in contributions, and they were friends; McCain and his family took lavish trips with Keating. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keating served five years in jail after being convicted of corruption charges in connection with his management of Lincoln. The committee cleared McCain -- who met with federal regulators to discuss Keating -- of acting improperly but said he'd exercised poor judgment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Obama stressed that the Fed should aim most to protect taxpayers, not financiers. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seldom has there been a larger contrast between the style of a candidate and the strategy of his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is cool, firm and permanently unruffled. It is precisely this quality of steadiness that has made him seem a credible prospective president with the thinnest of resumes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama's campaign is rootless, reactive and panicky. At every stage since securing the nomination, it has seemed fearful of missteps and unsure of its own organizing principle. So it has invariably adopted the Democratic conventional wisdom of the moment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's first major decision was his running mate. He could have reinforced a message of change and moderation with a Democratic governor who wins in a Republican state, or reached for history by selecting Hillary Clinton. But his choice came soon after Russia invaded Georgia, and the conventional wisdom demanded an old hand who knew his way around Tbilisi. When the Georgia crisis faded, Obama was left with a partisan, undisciplined, congressional liberal at his side. This has served to undermine Obama's message of change -- and has allowed Sarah Palin to pilfer a portion of that appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's second decision concerned the tone and content of his convention. Here the Democratic conventional wisdom was nearly unanimous. Obama should shelve his highfalutin' rhetoric and talk like a real Democrat. Go after McCain. Talk about &quot;bread and butter&quot; issues -- really code words for class warfare attacks on consumers of blinis and caviar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama took this advice to the letter -- at the cost of his political identity. In his Denver speech, it seemed that every American home was on the auction block, every car stalled for lack of gasoline, every credit card bill past due, every worker treated like a Russian serf. And McCain? He was out of touch, with flawed &quot;judgment.&quot; His life devoted to serving oil companies and big corporations. And, by the way, he didn't have the courage to follow Osama bin Laden &quot;to the cave where he lives.&quot; In obedience to the best Democratic advice, Obama managed to be conventional, bitter and graceless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Obama has made his third major campaign decision -- to finally get really tough on McCain. In response to attacks and dropping polls, the Democratic wisdom is once again nearly uniform: Democrats lose because they are not vicious enough. And once again, the Obama campaign has taken this advice without hesitation. &quot;We will respond with speed and ferocity to John McCain's attacks and we will take the fight to him,&quot; says Obama's campaign manager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama feels provoked -- and he has been. There is no evidence that Obama supported explicit sex education in kindergarten, as a McCain&nbsp;ad implied. Having already accused McCain of being a cowardly corporate tool who is disconnected from reality, escalation is not an easy task for Obama. But he has managed. In one recent commercial, McCain is clearly mocked for his age -- compared to a disco ball and a 10-pound cell phone. Another ad uses the word &quot;dishonorable&quot; next to a photo of McCain -- an attack from a candidate who has little practical familiarity with the cost of honor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who is hurt most by this race to the bottom? McCain, by the evidence of his own convention, wants to be viewed as a fighter -- which a fight does little to undermine. Obama was introduced to America as a different and better kind of politician -- an image now in tatters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even worse for Obama, all these shifts to catch the prevailing winds confirm the most serious concerns about his political character. As a senator, he has almost never opposed the ideological consensus of his party. (The ethics reform he often cites as his profile in courage eventually passed the Senate 96-2.) And now as a presidential candidate, Obama has run his campaign with all the constancy of a skittish sailboat on an erratic ocean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is a different strategy. Obama could attempt to &quot;beat back the politics of fear, and doubt, and cynicism.&quot; He could try to build a coalition that &quot;stretches through red states and blue states.&quot; He could reject &quot;the politics where we tear each other down instead of lifting this country up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidate who said those words the night he won the Iowa caucuses did pretty well. But whatever the outcome of this presidential election, that candidate is no longer in the race.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of Wall Street's Big Five investment banks have chosen to shack up with commercial banks so far this year, or die trying. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's next? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Wachovia Corp. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investment banks such as Goldman buy and sell companies and bits of companies. It's a tough business, especially when stock, bond and loan prices fall, like now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commercial banks such as Wachovia borrow from savers and lend to consumers and companies. Not so exciting, but it's steadier when things get slow.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took over the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bear Stearns Cos. Inc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with help from the Federal Reserve. Sunday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bank of America Corp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> picked up </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, while jilted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> filed for bankruptcy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That leaves only the biggest and richest of the independent investment banks: Goldman, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Morgan Stanley</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commercial banks are suffering, too, partly because they tried so hard to be like investment banks. Wachovia shares have fallen more than most, dropping to what they were at the end of the last banking crisis in 1991 - worse, if you consider inflation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stock tumbled Monday after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Deutsche Bank AG analyst Michael Mayo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.'s Meredith Whitney</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Wachovia needed to raise billions more to cover the falling value of its West Coast subprime loans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The traditional commercial banks that have stuck to their business are solid. Like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">PNC</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; said veteran Philadelphia investment banker </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bill Frack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a former executive at Wachovia's predecessor, CoreStates Bank, and a founder of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Griffin Holding Group.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm afraid the Wachovias have gotten in over their heads.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wachovia is the biggest bank in the Philadelphia market. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Robert Steel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the new Wachovia chief executive officer, spent 30 years at Goldman Sachs, then followed his old boss, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Henry M. Paulson Jr.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to the U.S. Treasury, where Secretary Paulson now runs the industry's biggest matchmaking service. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it's a natural combination, says </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Commerce Bancorp Inc. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">founder </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Vernon Hill</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, now a bank investor. &quot;If Goldman needs a bank,&quot; Hill said, &quot;you've got a Goldman guy running Wachovia. Goldman helped hire him. That's where this all leads.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two companies aren't acting as if they were engaged. On </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Jim Cramer's CNBC</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> show, Steel dismissed Whitney's numbers. &quot;We're making progress as we work through this,&quot; Steel said. &quot;It's messy and it's hard, but there's progress. We have a great future as a public company, [with] very exciting prospects.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Goldman reported disappointing profit yesterday,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> Citigroup Inc. analyst Prashant Bhatia </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">asked Goldman chief financial officer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">David Viniar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> if Goldman needed bank deposits to stabilize its businesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, Viniar said. &quot;Most of the businesses we're in could not be funded by banks,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's still Fortress Goldman, against the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stadium world </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Comcast-Spectacor L.P.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is going global. The Ed Snider-Comcast Corp. combination, which owns the Flyers, Sixers, the Wachovia stadium complex, and other properties, along with facilities manager </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Global Spectrum L.P.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, has set up a European arm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are now aggressively seeking management contracts throughout the continent of Europe,&quot; said spokesman </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ike Richman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. It's a joint venture with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">NEC Group Birmingham</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the U.K. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global Spectrum already manages 70 buildings from Philadelphia to Phoenix. Global Spectrum said last winter it would manage 55,000-seat </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Premiere Park</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Singapore, its first Asia facility. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who is what? Another sign both presidential candidates are moving to the center: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">John McCain</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Republican, is beating up on financiers and traders. &quot;People on Wall Street have been recklessly wagering instead of making the sound investments we expected of them,&quot; McCain said in a Tampa, Fla., rally yesterday, according to Bloomberg News. He called for a 9/11 Commission-style federal investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Barack Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Democrat, urged governmental restraint: He called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rep. Barney Frank's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (D., Mass.) plan for a new federal home loan finance agency &quot;premature,&quot; and Obama warned against putting taxpayers &quot;on the hook&quot; by giving stricken financial companies too much help.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the national economy shows signs of weakening further, the chances of Democrat Barack Obama winning the presidency could strengthen, analysts said Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans upset by a sour economy typically throw the party in power out of the White House. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, Republican John McCain's strategy of billing himself and running mate Sarah Palin as &quot;maverick&quot; reformers appears to be helping the GOP ticket ride out a storm of bad news on Wall Street, at least for now, some say.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mounting international financial and credit crisis should, by any account, harm the 'ins,' &quot; said Bert Rockman, chairman of the political science department at Purdue University.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One would think this ... would be catastrophic for the Republicans' chances. However, the McCain-Palin 'change' drumbeat seems to have swing voters confused as to the who and what of change,&quot; Rockman said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National polls released Tuesday showed McCain and Obama statistically tied. McCain appeared to continue to ride a bounce he received from naming Palin as his pick for vice president. It was too soon to know whether Obama, as a challenger of the status quo, would receive a boost from Monday's stock market plunge and fresh troubles for investment banks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's bound to help Obama. He is the candidate of the out-of-power party, and traditionally bad economic times assist that candidate,&quot; said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain can narrow the advantage Obama might get by responding forcefully about the issue, as McCain did Monday with a new TV ad, Sabato said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. sold itself to Bank of America, McCain's campaign started airing a television spot called &quot;Crisis.&quot; The ad began: &quot;Our economy in crisis. Only proven reformers John McCain and Sarah Palin can fix it. Tougher rules on Wall Street to protect your life savings.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later Monday, however, McCain opened himself to criticism by saying in a speech that the &quot;fundamentals of the economy are strong,&quot; Sabato said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was a mistake by McCain,&quot; Sabato said. &quot;He may well be right, but you do not say that. It's the old Clinton principle: You feel people's pain. You don't say, 'Stop the whining, everything's fine.' &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign pounced on the remark. It released a TV ad with visuals, noting: &quot;Lehman Brothers Collapses,&quot; &quot;Markets in Turmoil,&quot; &quot;Job Losses at 605,000 for the year,&quot; followed by a snip of video of McCain saying: &quot;Our economy, I think still, the fundamentals of our economy are strong.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad's punchline: &quot;How can John McCain fix our economy if he doesn't understand it's broken?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign so far &quot;has been brilliant in changing the conversation to its advantage&quot; and blunting &quot;to some degree, the impact of all this bad news,&quot; Rockman said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, Rockman believes, &quot;it's still Obama's election to lose. The recent surge of events has made it even more so.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Princeton University political science professor Larry Bartels agreed the spate of gloomy economic news &quot;is probably bad for Sen. McCain, since he is the candidate of the incumbent party and the candidate who has been insisting that 'the fundamentals of our economy are strong.' &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anything that brings up issues of a struggling economy tends to help Obama, said Bob Maranto, a political scientist at the University of Arkansas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama really doesn't have any economic expertise, but he does have a more plausible claim of being an outsider, since McCain is from the incumbent's party,&quot; Maranto said. &quot;McCain is the only Republican, I think, who could run this year who could plausibly distance himself from President Bush's economic policies, and that's certainly what he's trying to do.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new television ad released Wednesday by Sen. Barack Obama's campaign highlights the closure of Corning Inc.'s plant in State College, Pa., and accuses Washington with Sen. John McCain's help of selling out the workers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad features photos of blue-collar workers. It highlights the fact that, in 2004, the company hired many of the workers back to dismantle the equipment so it could be shipped to China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also accuses McCain of supporting tax breaks to companies that moved jobs overseas and of voting against a crackdown on unfair trade practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Washington sold them out with the help of people like John McCain,&quot; the ad says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Lindsay, a McCain campaign spokesman, accused Obama in a statement of using job losses as &quot;an opportunity to launch political distortions,&quot; with the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad will run across Pennsylvania and in 13 other states, said Sean Smith, a campaign spokesman. The Obama campaign has been spending about $850,000 a week on advertising in Pennsylvania, where polls show the race is tight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has been seeking to connect with blue-collar workers, many of whom voted for Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in Democratic primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2003, Corning announced about 1,000 jobs would be lost at the plant where Corning Asahi Video Products made glass tubes for television sets and computer monitors. Dan Collins, a Corning spokesman, said Wednesday that production of the glass tubes was stopped because it was not profitable to make them, but that no jobs were moved overseas with the plant's closure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins said the company hired back the workers to tear down the equipment to sell to another company because, &quot;otherwise we would've hired out-of-state workers. Somebody was going to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said as far as he knows, the company that bought the equipment was not successful. Today, Corning has 3,000 more U.S.-based jobs than it did in late 2003, he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financial upheaval that shocked Wall Street on Monday refocused the presidential race and caused at least some top lawmakers to wonder whether the federal government is doing its job.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One financial titan, Lehman Brothers, filed for Chapter 11 protection and another, Merrill Lynch, was bought for $50 billion by rival Bank of America. Unlike the collapse of Bear Stearns in March, and the near-failure of mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae last week, the federal government offered no bailout. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Bob Casey, a member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, said he hopes to question Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson by the end of the week about why Bear Stearns got a bailout and Lehman Brothers didn't.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casey said he's withholding judgment on Paulson's decision, and noted that &quot;it's not always that the government has to come riding to the rescue with a checkbook.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama agreed with the decision not to spend billions in taxpayer dollars to save the companies. The two presidential candidates pledged stricter regulation of financial institutions rocked by the housing market collapse.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There the common ground ended. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, looking to retake the lead in polls after a bruising week, claimed McCain doesn't understand the economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why else would he say, today of all days, just a few hours ago -- think about this, we just woke up to news of financial disaster -- and this morning he said that the fundamentals of the economy are still strong,&quot; Obama said in Colorado. &quot;Senator McCain, what economy are you talking about?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign accused Obama of distorting his statement, made during a campaign stop in Florida. McCain explained later that the &quot;fundamentals&quot; he was talking about are American workers, innovation, entrepreneurship and small businesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those are the fundamentals of America and I think they are strong. But they are being threatened today,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain released an advertisement yesterday called &quot;Crisis,&quot; which features images of Lehman Brothers and includes a pledge to more closely regulate Wall Street. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has laid out six principles, which he explained in March during a speech in New York, to overhaul regulation of financial markets. His plan calls for giving the Federal Reserve oversight of institutions to which it gives loans, streamlining the regulatory process and adapting regulations to cover changing types of securities. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Showing a tough love stance for now, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues decided to keep a key interest rate steady Tuesday. They acknowledged stresses in financial markets have grown, though, and hinted they stood ready to lower rates if needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wreckage on Wall Street in recent days did not force the Fed - as some thought possible - to reverse course and cut rates. The Fed left its key rate at 2 percent for the third straight meeting. It marked the first meeting this year the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rate policy, agreed unanimously with a decision. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime lending rate for millions of consumers and businesses stayed at 5 percent. The prime rate applies to certain credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans. The Fed's key rate and the prime rate are at four-year lows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed's view of economic and financial conditions, however, was more dour than its last assessment in early August. Economic growth appears to be slowing as consumers hunker down and export growth cools off a bit, Fed policymakers said. And, &quot;strains in financial markets have increased significantly,&quot; the Fed said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more bearish tone indicates the Fed is again open to rate cuts down the road, some analysts believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Fed has opened the door to a rate cut that many thought was closed,&quot; said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group. &quot;I think there was more emphasis about the economy being weak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed said it would &quot;act as needed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days, the American financial system has suffered its worst shakeout since the Great Depression as bad bets on dodgy mortgage-backed securities claimed more Wall Street giants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lehman Brothers, the country's fourth-largest investment bank, filed for bankruptcy protection. A weakened Merrill Lynch, deciding it couldn't go it alone anymore, found help in the arms of Bank of America. Now, the insurance giant American International Group is dangerously wobbling. Against this backdrop, Wall Street on Monday plunged 500 points, the most since the September 2001 terror attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrials gained 141 points after the Fed's action soothed market anxiety over the financial system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far this year, 11 federally insured banks and thrifts have failed, compared with three last year. The country's largest thrift, Washington Mutual Inc., is faltering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urgently trying to keep cash flowing amid a Wall Street meltdown, the Fed pumped another $70 billion into the nation's financial system to help ease credit stresses. In emergency sessions over the weekend, the Fed expanded its loan programs to Wall Street firms, part of an ongoing effort to get credit flowing more freely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By standing pat now, the Fed is leaving room in its rate-cutting arsenal to act later, if needed. &quot;The Fed has kept its powder dry,&quot; said Terry Connelly, dean of Golden Gate University's Ageno School of Business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last few months, Bernanke and his Fed colleagues have signaled that the central bank's next move on interest rates would probably be an increase to fend off inflation. Given all the economic and financial problems, though, economists are now saying the likelihood of a rate increase over the next six to nine months has all but disappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inflation - which has been high - should moderate later this year and next year, the Fed said. It dropped language contained in its August assessment that some barometers of consumer and business expectations of inflation have been &quot;elevated.&quot; That suggested slightly less concern about inflation even as the Fed made clear it would remain vigilant on this front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed in June halted its most aggressive rate-cutting campaign to shore up the economy out of fears that those low rates were aggravating inflation. It didn't budge the rate at the last meeting in August for the same reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most closely watched inflation yardsticks - consumer prices- registered the first monthly drop in nearly two years, giving some relief to stressed consumers, the government reported Tuesday. The improvement came from moderating energy prices, which hit record highs in mid July. That gives the Fed more leeway to lower rates if needed or at least to hold them steady.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fed officials have suggested that harder-to-get credit and financial troubles have blunted the energizing impact of the central bank's already-ordered rate cuts on consumers and businesses. Economic growth is slowing and the unemployment rate is at a five-year high of 6.1 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that, some argued that an additional rate cut probably wouldn't do much to turn around worried consumers and bolster the economy. Others feared another rate cut could send a wrong message to financial companies that made bad bets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Fed left the rate unchanged because that was the right thing to do. The Fed can lower interest rates, but is (that) going to revive this ailing financial system? I don't think so. I think we're beyond the point were the Fed can do much about this,&quot; said Timothy A. Canova, professor of international economic law at the Chapman University School of Law in Orange, Calif.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fallout from the crisis is prompting Democrats to call for a second round of government stimulus, something Republicans and President Bush so far has resisted. And, on the campaign trail, both presidential GOP nominee Sen. John McCain and his Democratic rival, Sen. Barack Obama, said the cascading crisis underscores the need to overhaul the nation's regulatory structure, which dates back to the Civil War.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">818 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A McCain-Palin ad has FactCheck.org calling Barack Obama's attacks on Sarah Palin &quot;completely false&quot; and &quot;misleading.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what FactCheck.org said, but it wasn't about Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article criticized anonymous e-mail falsehoods and bogus claims about Palin posted around the Internet. FactCheck.org says it has no evidence that any of the claims it found to be false came from the Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain-Palin ad also twists a quote from a Wall Street Journal columnist, who said the Obama camp had sent a team to Alaska to &quot;dig into her record and background.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad quotes the WSJ as saying the team was sent to &quot;dig dirt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the Obama campaign insists that no researchers have been sent to Alaska and that the Journal owes them a correction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: FactCheck.org does not object to people reprinting its articles. In fact, its copyright policy encourages it. But the Web site also asks that &quot;the editorial integrity of the article be preserved&quot; and told those who use the items that &quot;you should not edit the original in such a way as to alter the message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain-Palin 2008 Ad:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fact Check&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcer: The attacks on Governor Palin have been called &quot;completely false&quot;...&quot;misleading.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On screen: Photo of Obama, FactCheck.org banner, &quot;'completely false' . . . 'misleading' 9/10/08&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, they've just begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The [Wall Street] Journal reports Obama &quot;air-dropped a mini-army of 30 lawyers, investigators and opposition researchers&quot; into Alaska to dig dirt on Governor Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Obama drops in the polls, he'll try to destroy her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's &quot;politics of hope&quot;? Empty words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: I'm John McCain and I approved this message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With its latest ad, released Sept. 10, the McCain-Palin campaign has altered FactCheck.org's message in a fashion it considers less than honest. The ad strives to convey the message that FactCheck.org said &quot;completely false&quot; attacks on Gov. Sarah Palin had come from Sen. Barack Obama. FactCheck.org said it has said no such thing and has yet to dispute any claim from the Obama campaign about Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They call the ad &quot;Fact Check.&quot; It says &quot;the attacks on Gov. Palin have been called 'completely false' ... 'misleading.'&quot; On screen is a still photo of a grim-faced Obama. The words are accurately quoted, but they had nothing to do with Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article, posted two days earlier, debunked a number of false or misleading claims that have circulated in chain e-mails and Internet postings regarding Palin. There is no evidence that the Obama campaign is behind any of the wild accusations that were critiqued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no more basis for attributing these viral attacks to the Obama campaign than there is for blaming the McCain campaign for chain e-mail attacks falsely claiming that Obama is a Muslim, or a &quot;racist,&quot; or that he is proposing to tax water. The anti-Palin messages, like the anti-Obama messages, have every appearance of being home-grown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Digging for &quot;Dirt&quot;: The ad also quotes the Wall Street Journal as saying that the Obama campaign &quot;air-dropped a mini-army of 30 lawyers, investigators and opposition researchers to dig dirt on Governor Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's also a distortion. The Wall Street Journal opinion article did not say that the Obama team was there to &quot;dig dirt.&quot; It said they were there to &quot;dig into her record and background.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full quote, from an item by conservative columnist John Fund, dated Sept. 9:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WSJ's John Fund, Sept. 9: Democrats have airdropped a mini-army of 30 lawyers, investigators and opposition researchers into Anchorage, the state capital Juneau and Mrs. Palin's hometown of Wasilla to dig into her record and background. My sources report the first wave arrived in Anchorage less than 24 hours after John McCain selected her on Aug. 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fund said the opposition researchers were mainly interested in a controversy surrounding Palin's firing of her public safety commissioner, Walt Monegan. Monegan has claimed he was dismissed because he wouldn't fire a state trooper who was in a divorce battle with Palin's sister; the Alaska Legislature is investigating whether Palin acted properly. Fund also stated that the Palin family has accused the trooper of &quot;using a Taser on his 10-year-old stepson, drinking in his patrol car and illegally shooting a moose.&quot; Now, that's &quot;dirt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Update, Sept. 10: After this article was posted, the Obama campaign contacted us to say that John Fund's article is wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor, Sept. 10: John Fund's claim that we &quot;air-dropped&quot; 30 lawyers into Alaska is false. No one from the Obama campaign or the DNC has been sent to Alaska. FactCheck.org has askled Fund for a correction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Footnote: At least one Obama spokesman has repeated an allegation that FactCheck.org debunked in its story, that Palin was a supporter of Pat Buchanan. However, the Obama campaign was not the originator of the claim.<BR>FactCheck.org is a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.<BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A failed plan to rescue Lehman Brothers was followed yesterday by more seismic shocks from Wall Street, including an apparent government-brokered takeover of Merrill Lynch by the Bank of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A forced restructuring of the world's largest insurance company, American International Group Inc., also weighed heavily on global markets as the effects of the 14-month-old credit crisis intensified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A global consortium of banks, working with government officials in New York, announced late yesterday a $70 billion pool of funds to lend to troubled financial companies. The aim, according to participants who spoke to The Associated Press, was to prevent a worldwide panic on stock and other financial exchanges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten banks -- Bank of America, Barclays, Citibank, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS -- each agreed to provide $7 billion &quot;to help enhance liquidity and mitigate the unprecedented volatility and other challenges affecting global equity and debt markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Reserve also chipped in with more largesse in its emergency lending program for commercial and investment banks. The central bank announced late yesterday that it was broadening the types of collateral that financial institutions can use to obtain loans from the Fed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the discussions had been aimed at identifying &quot;potential market vulnerabilities in the wake of an unwinding of a major financial institution and to consider appropriate official sector and private sector responses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Futures pegged to the Dow Jones industrial average fell almost 300 points in electronic trading last night, pointing to a sharply lower open for the blue chip index this morning. Asian stock markets were also falling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lehman Brothers may be forced to seek an orderly unwinding of its businesses. All potential buyers walked away after the U.S. Treasury refused to budge on its refusal to provide any takeover aid, as it had done six months ago when Bear Stearns faltered and earlier this month when it seized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expectations that the 158-year-old Lehman would survive dimmed after Barclays PLC withdrew its bid to buy the investment bank. Barclays and Bank of America were considered front-runners to buy Lehman, which is foundering under the weight of $60 billion in soured real estate holdings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurer AIG, hit hard by deterioration in the credit markets, said yesterday it is reviewing its operations and discussing possible options with outside parties to improve its business after a week when its stock dropped 45 percent amid concerns about the company's financial underpinnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merrill Lynch, another investment bank laid low by the crisis that was triggered by rising mortgage defaults and plunging home values in the U.S., agreed to be acquired by Bank of America for $29 a share, according to the Wall Street Journal. That's a premium to its closing price on Friday of $17.05 but only a fraction of its price of almost $100 a share early in 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America has the most deposits of any U.S. bank, while Merrill Lynch is the world's largest brokerage. A combination of the two would create a global financial giant to rival Citigroup Inc., the biggest U.S. bank in terms of assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal would not come without risks, however. Merrill Lynch, like many of its Wall Street peers, has been struggling with tight credit markets and billions of dollars in assets tied to mortgages that have plunged in value. Merrill has reported four straight quarterly losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Bank of America's own finances are far from robust. As consumer credit deteriorates, the bank has seen its profits decline, and the company is still in the midst of absorbing the embattled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial, which it acquired in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stunning weekend developments took place as voters, who rank the economy as their top concern, prepare to elect a new president in seven weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weekend's developments will likely spur a much greater focus by presidential candidates -- Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama -- and members of Congress on the need for stricter financial regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Paulson was huddled through the weekend at the New York Federal Reserve's fortress-like building in downtown Manhattan with executives from major banks and investment houses to hash out the fate of Lehman Brothers and to staunch the bleeding on Wall Street that threatened to shatter investor confidence around the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's clear we're one step away from a financial meltdown,&quot; said Nouriel Roubini, chairman of the consulting firm RGE Monitor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine for a minute that attending the Republican convention in St. Paul, sitting in a skybox overlooking the convention floor, were observers from Russia, Iran and Venezuela. And imagine for a minute what these observers would have been doing when Rudy Giuliani led the delegates in a chant of &quot;drill, baby, drill!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll tell you what they would have been doing: the Russian, Iranian and Venezuelan observers would have been up out of their seats, exchanging high-fives and joining in the chant louder than anyone in the hall -- &quot;Yes! Yes! Drill, America, drill!&quot; -- because an America that is focused first and foremost on drilling for oil is an America more focused on feeding its oil habit than kicking it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why would Republicans, the party of business, want to focus our country on breathing life into a 19th-century technology -- fossil fuels -- rather than giving birth to a 21st-century technology -- renewable energy? As I have argued before, it reminds me of someone who, on the eve of the IT revolution -- on the eve of PCs and the Internet -- is pounding the table for America to make more IBM typewriters and carbon paper. &quot;Typewriters, baby, typewriters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, we're going to need oil for many years, but instead of exalting that -- with &quot;drill, baby, drill&quot; -- why not throw all our energy into innovating a whole new industry of clean power with the mantra &quot;invent, baby, invent&quot;? That is what a party committed to &quot;change&quot; would really be doing. As they say in Texas: &quot;If all you ever do is all you've ever done, then all you'll ever get is all you ever got.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I dwell on this issue because it is symbolic of the campaign that John McCain has decided to run. It's a campaign now built on turning everything possible into a cultural wedge issue -- including even energy policy, no matter how stupid it makes the voters and no matter how much it might weaken America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I respected Mr. McCain's willingness to support the troop surge in Iraq, even if it was going to cost him the Republican nomination. Now the same guy, who would not sell his soul to win his party's nomination, is ready to sell every piece of his soul to win the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to disguise the fact that the core of his campaign is to continue the same Bush policies that have led 80 percent of the country to conclude we're on the wrong track, Mr. McCain has decided to play the culture-war card. Barack Obama may be a bit professorial, but at least he is trying to unite the country to face the real issues rather than divide us over cultural differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Washington Post editorial on Thursday put it well: &quot;On a day when the Congressional Budget Office warned of looming deficits and a grim economic outlook, when the stock market faltered even in the wake of the government's rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, when President Bush discussed the road ahead in Iraq and Afghanistan, on what did the campaign of Sen. John McCain spend its energy? A conference call to denounce Sen. Barack Obama for using the phrase 'lipstick on a pig' and a new television ad accusing the Democrat of wanting to teach kindergartners about sex before they learn to read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some McCain supporters criticize Mr. Obama for not having the steel in his belly to use force in the dangerous world we live in today. Well, I know this: In order to use force, you have to have force. In order to exercise leverage, you have to have leverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know how much steel is in Mr. Obama's belly, but I do know that the issues he is focusing on in this campaign -- improving education and health care, dealing with the deficit and forging a real energy policy based on building a whole new energy infrastructure -- are the only way we can put steel back into America's spine. Mr. McCain, alas, has abandoned those issues for the culture-war strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who cares how much steel John McCain has in his gut when the steel that today holds up our bridges, railroads, nuclear reactors and other infrastructure is rusting? Mr. McCain talks about how he would build dozens of nuclear power plants. Oh, really? They go for $10 billion a pop. Where is the money going to come from? From lowering taxes? From banning abortions? From borrowing more from China? From having Sarah Palin &quot;reform&quot; Washington -- as if she has any more clue how to do that than the first 100 names in the D.C. phone book?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sorry, but there is no sustainable political/military power without economic power, and talking about one without the other is nonsense. Unless we make America the country most able to innovate, compete and win in the age of globalization, our leverage in the world will continue to slowly erode. Those are the issues this election needs to be about, because that is what the next four years need to be about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no strong leader without a strong country. And posing as one, to use the current vernacular, is nothing more than putting lipstick on a pig.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain has said that he does not understand economic issues. That is nowhere more apparent than in a recent TV ad aired by the McCain campaign. That ad attempts to scare voters about what will happen if Barack Obama is elected, saying he will &quot;destroy your family budget,&quot; cause &quot;higher prices at the pump&quot; and create an &quot;economic disaster.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is an interesting approach for the McCain campaign: Recite the Bush administration's record on the economy and blame it on Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously, Sen. McCain has not been paying attention to the economy during the last seven years. Many middle-class families have had their family budgets destroyed by loss of employment and a rising cost of living, fueled by higher prices at the pump. The economy is already a disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama will turn things around by bringing the war in Iraq to a responsible end and devoting resources to restoring our economy. He will focus on alternative energy, rebuild the country's infrastructure, provide universal health insurance and provide tax relief for those who have been ignored by the Bush administration. This is an approach that will create new jobs and broaden the base of the economy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Larry Eichel; Inquirer Senior Writer</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATIONAL; Inq World &amp; Nation; Pg. A18</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1091 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has been the presidential election of a lifetime, different in so many ways from all that has come before. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last week, though, it has reverted to something like business as usual, with a shrinking list of familiar battleground states and a nasty, often trivial back-and-forth between the candidates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the campaign of Republican John McCain setting the negative tone and that of Democrat Barack Obama struggling to respond, the debate has degenerated into half-truths, ridicule, and outraged accusations of foul play.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has said several times that the tenor &quot;of this whole campaign would have been very different&quot; had Obama accepted his invitation to spend the summer doing joint town-hall meetings. But that didn't happen, and the McCain campaign has fired away, putting Obama on the defensive in ways many Democrats believe are beyond the pale. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the Obama camp, on its heels ever since Sarah Palin was named to the Republican ticket, has adopted a much more aggressive tone - and promises far more rapid responses to McCain's ads and allegations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider what happened Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From McCain came a commercial that accused Obama of lashing out disrespectfully at Palin. All the words cited in the ad, which came from various Obama campaign officials and supporters, were attributed to a vague &quot;they&quot; and juxtaposed with photographs of Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Obama came an ad that belittled McCain as hopelessly &quot;out of touch&quot; with modern technology and the angst of the beleaguered middle class. It included images of such objects as a 1980s-era disco ball and a bulky, early-vintage cellular telephone - and noted that the Republican nominee did not know how to use a computer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mocking nature of the ad was part of the Obama campaign's multifaceted attempt to reset its message. The goal is to take back the change label, counter the McCain attacks, and ease the minds of supporters worried by the progress the GOP has made through its aggressiveness and Palin's appeal. McCain now has a slight lead in most national polls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In recent weeks, John McCain has shown that he is willing to go into the gutter to win this election,&quot; Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, said Friday in a memo to supporters. Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton yesterday accused McCain of &quot;running the sleaziest and least honorable campaign in modern presidential campaign history,&quot; one characterized by &quot;discredited ads&quot; full of &quot;disgusting lies.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain responded to that line of attack during an appearance Friday on ABC's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The View</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Actually, they're not lies, and have you seen some of the ads running against me?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its reset, the Obama campaign also was trying to respond to critics who say the Illinois senator has yet to put much policy meat on his &quot;change&quot; bones or devise a pithy, understandable way to tell voters what his candidacy is all about. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Obama came up with was a pitch framing the choice in economic terms, stressing the tax cut he proposes for 95 percent of taxpayers. He also is ridiculing the change credentials of McCain, who, by naming Palin, seems to have convinced some voters that his presidency would represent a real break with the unpopular Republican incumbent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's basic suggestion to you is this,&quot; Obama said in New Hampshire yesterday. &quot;Watch out, George Bush. With the exception of economic policy, tax policy, health-care policy, education policy, foreign policy, and Karl Rove-style politics, we're really going to shake things up in Washington.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of this happened at the close of a week marked by such brouhahas as the one over Obama's &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; remark. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama used the derogatory phrase - one that McCain and other politicians have employed - as part of his argument that his rival's policies do not amount to &quot;change.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain responded with an ad claiming that the reference was a sexist assault on Palin, who had made a much-quoted lipstick comment at the Republican convention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign also ran an ad accusing Obama of favoring &quot;comprehensive sex education&quot; for kindergartners; the Illinois legislation in question actually allowed schools to provide &quot;age-appropriate&quot; instruction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To those who have accused them of violating the norms of political conduct, the Republicans replied by pointing to a number of outrageous or arguably outrageous statements made by Democrats in various parts of the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One came from vice presidential candidate Joseph R. Biden Jr., who said Palin's election would be &quot;a backward step&quot; for women, citing her policy views. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Stephen I. Cohen of Tennessee made a convoluted observation comparing Obama, as a community organizer, to Jesus, and Palin, as a governor, to Pontius Pilate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol Fowler, chair of the South Carolina party, said Palin's prime qualification &quot;seems to be that she hasn't had an abortion.&quot; Fowler later apologized. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such comments, said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), a McCain confidant, reflect a Democratic Party in &quot;meltdown mode.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether this tone will continue until November remains to be seen. The historical record is mixed, and Republicans, including George H.W. Bush in 1988 and George W. Bush in 2004, have won with the help of tough-minded ads focused on trying to disqualify the opponent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those hoping for a more elevated dialogue can place their hopes on the debates, the first of which is set for Sept. 26 in Oxford, Miss. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General-election debates, although often remembered for gaffes and one-liners, tend to focus on issues of substance; the first McCain-Obama encounter, for instance, is supposed to be limited to questions of foreign policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the content of the campaign has reverted to form, so, too, has the geography of the race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though Obama's strategists are reluctant to acknowledge it, they will likely scale back on earlier plans to compete in states that Republicans won handily in recent elections - such as Georgia, Montana, North Dakota and, of course, Alaska. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point, the Democratic strategy is moving inexorably toward holding onto the 252 electoral votes John Kerry won in 2004 and getting to the magic number of 270 by adding some combination of Iowa, Ohio, Nevada, New Mexico, and perhaps Virginia or Colorado. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain plan is to retain nearly all of Bush's red states and destroy Obama's hopes by pulling Pennsylvania, Michigan and/or New Hampshire into the Republican column. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With seven weeks to go, that part of it, like the rhetoric, is starting to sound pretty familiar. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lipstick politics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a Washington Post editorial:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard to think of a presidential campaign with a wider chasm between the seriousness of the issues confronting the country and the triviality, so far anyway, of the political discourse. On a day when the Congressional Budget Office warned of looming deficits and a grim economic outlook, when the stock market faltered even in the wake of the government's rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, when President Bush discussed the road ahead in Iraq and Afghanistan, on what did the campaign of Sen. John McCain spend its energy? A conference call to denounce Sen. Barack Obama for using the phrase 'lipstick on a pig' and a new TV ad accusing the Democrat of wanting to teach kindergartners about sex before they learn to read.&quot; -- washingtonpost.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who's the pig?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powerline offers this on that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Debate rages over whether or not Barack Obama called Gov. Sarah Palin a 'pig.' Whatever your view, it is undeniable that when it comes to earmarks the Democrats are the pigs.:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In its new report, the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste gave the Republican presidential nominee a 100 percent rating for his votes in the Senate last year, and a lifetime score of 88 percent. ... By comparison, the nonpartisan group gave the Democratic presidential nominee a 10 percent score last year and a lifetime score of 18 percent. [Sen.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hotair.com offers these examples of what it considers sexist language on the part of Barack Obama, all directed at Hillary Clinton during the primaries:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand that Sen. Clinton, periodically when she's feeling down, launches attacks as a way of trying to boost her appeal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deceptive Republicans?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Cesca, at Huffington Post:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's happening again.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The referenda was not proposing cutting the drink tax in half. That would have meant going from 10 percent to 5 percent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama, speaking in Norfolk, Va., Wednesday, got out his shovel and dug the hole he's in a little deeper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign moved to &quot;seize an innocent remark and take it out of context because they knew it's catnip for the news media,&quot; he said, thus guaranteeing the &quot;innocent remark&quot; and its fallout would dominate the news for a second day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Lebanon, Va., the day before, Mr. Obama said Sen. John McCain may claim he'll change Washington, but he's really just like President Bush. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can put lipstick on a pig,&quot; he said. &quot;It's still a pig. You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change. It's still going to stink after eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AP's Nedra Pickler said the remark drew &quot;shouts and raucous applause&quot; from his audience, whose members were &quot;clearly drawing a connection&quot; to the joke Sarah Palin told in her acceptance speech, that the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull is lipstick. The McCain campaign demanded he apologize for the remark and rushed out a television ad criticizing him for making it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said Wednesday he meant no such thing. His profession of innocence would have been more persuasive if he'd attempted to disabuse his audience Tuesday of the notion he was referring to Ms. Palin, and if an Obama surrogate hadn't used remarkably similar language that day in referring to her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain chose as his running mate &quot;someone with zero experience in national government, zero experience in foreign affairs,&quot; Rep. Russ Carnahan said in his introduction of Sen. Joe Biden at an event in Missouri. &quot;There is no way you can dress up that record, even with a lot of lipstick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm inclined to take Mr. Obama at his word, mostly because it would be really stupid to say such a thing deliberately. But the remark comes on the heels of unprecedented personal invective directed at Ms. Palin and her family from Obama supporters, and it does sound like a campaign meme. The video of Mr. Obama's remarks is on YouTube. Watch it and judge for yourself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some conservatives think it unseemly for a Republican to complain about sexism. But they miss the genius of what the McCain campaign is doing. Whether their outrage was real or faux, the McCain campaign has Mr. Obama, looking rattled, talking about the Republican candidate for vice president instead of talking about issues that might win him votes. The GOP television ad about the lipstick remark was designed for an audience of one, and it worked. Mr. McCain is so far inside Mr. Obama's OODA loop that I almost feel sorry for the senator from Illinois.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OODA loop is a concept coined by fighter ace John Boyd. It stands for Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action. You see something. You figure out what it means. You decide what you're going to do about it, and then you do it. The winner in a dogfight is the pilot who goes through the OODA loop faster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has been on the defensive ever since Sarah Palin's speech at the Republican National Convention. Candidates who are on the defensive rarely win elections. It's amazing to me that Mr. Obama spends so much time attacking her. He's running for president. She's running for vice president. When you punch below your weight card, you do not add to your stature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to ignore Sarah Palin or the crowds she attracts. But Mr. Obama had better try. She's a first-rate candidate whose presence on the GOP ticket makes it harder for Mr. Obama to win. But personal attacks on Ms. Palin and her family just make his problem worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign is betting Mr. Obama's ego is so great and his skin so thin that he can't resist responding to the barbs Ms. Palin delivers with such a sweet smile. So far, they're winning the bet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bitter words Mr. Obama had for the news media in Norfolk on Wednesday suggest a campaign overcome by panic and confusion. And ingratitude, considering the way his friends in the press have stacked the deck on his behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama has a legitimate beef with the news media. Were it not for their vicious, baseless characterizations of Ms. Palin and her family, the audience for her speech would not have been comparable to his in the Barackopolis. Nor could she have delivered to Mr. McCain on the following night an even bigger audience than Mr. Obama attracted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano -- in town today campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama -- received an earful today from Obama supporters worried the campaign isn't pushing back hard enough against attacks by Sen. John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been through Dukakis, Gore and Kerry, and we've been disappointed to see that sometimes the candidate didn't have the same fight in him that we did,&quot; Georgia Blotzer, an Obama volunteer, told Ms. Napolitano at an event at Chatham University where the Arizona governor spoke. &quot;It's frustrating to see so many lies perpetrated by the McCain campaign and not see a more forceful response,&quot; she added, citing in particular a recent Obama&nbsp;ad criticizing Mr. McCain for not knowing how to use a computer or email. &quot;What about an ad on equal pay for equal work?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona governor was speaking at a forum on pay equity sponsored by Women for Obama. Ms. Napolitano said she understood Ms. Blotzer's concerns, but noted that &quot;There is a balance to be struck between that ad and some advertisement that turns off an undecided voter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plus, she added, &quot;We need to let Obama be Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Napolitano then went on to characterize her relationship with Mr. McCain, her state's senior senator, as &quot;professional,&quot; before tearing into him as &quot;a big phony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not the 'straight talk express,'&quot; said Ms. Napolitano, who has served two terms as governor. &quot;This is the campaign that they [the Republicans] ran against him eight years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another member of the audience complained that the Obama campaign too frequently frames issues in dry terms -- talking about the need for universal health care rather than for providing every family with their own family doctor, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hear you, and I think Chicago is hearing the same thing,&quot; said Ms. Napolitano, referring to Obama's campaign headquarters in Chicago. &quot;We all need to try to show more emotion. There's no harm in showing passion about your candidate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona governor was the second prominent female Obama surrogate to visit Pittsburgh in two days. On Friday, California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer stopped briefly in the city to rally Obama supporters,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning, Ms. Napolitano visited a Mt. Lebanon Obama office filled with about 80 supporters and accompanied some of them on a voter registration drive in a nearby neighborhood, followed by brunch with women supporters at Tom's Diner on the South Side, where she greeted diners and urged them to support the Illinois senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One customer, Regis Dusch, 40, of Greenfield, told her firmly he was a McCain supporter, noting he'd served in the military and felt the Arizona senator would do more to keep America safe. But when he noted that Mr. Obama had voted &quot;present&quot; in the Senate more than 100 times, Ms. Napolitano countered by saying Mr. McCain was only present for 58 percent of roll call votes. &quot;Look it up,&quot; she said, before moving on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She didn't change Mr. Dusch's mind. &quot;John McCain has proven himself. What's the other guy done?&quot; he asked afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day's first stop for Ms. Napolitano, actually, was in Baldwin -- where she lived for two years, from age 4 to 6, while her father, Dr. Leonard Napolitano, worked at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Medicine. &quot;I learned how to read in Pittsburgh,&quot; she said with a laugh, adding that many of the same neighbors were still there and remembered her family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't see that much in Arizona,&quot; she said, shaking her head. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's how area members of Congress voted on major roll calls last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobacco trafficking: Voting 379 for and 12 against, the House passed a bill (HR 4081) to crack down on those who sell tobacco products across state lines without paying state sales taxes. The bill virtually bans the mailing of those products, and requires vendors to notify tax officials in receiving states when they use commercial delivery services. The bill raises cigarette trafficking from a misdemeanor to a felony and empowers the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to inspect companies that distribute large volumes of tobacco products. Not voting, Joseph Pitts (R-16th District). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mexican truck ban: The House voted, 395 for and 18 against, to block an administration plan to extend a pilot program in which a limited number of Mexican trucks can travel throughout the United States. The bill (HR 6630) would confine Mexican trucking to border zones. Even though the 1993 North America Free Trade Agreement authorizes long-haul Mexican trucking in the U.S., Congress has never given its approval. Not voting, Pitts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National missile defense: Voting 39 for and 57 against, the Senate refused to increase National Missile Defense spending by $271 million over the $9.3 billion already included in the $601 billion 2009 military budget (S 3001). The bill remained in debate. Backers sought to pay for the amendment by reducing other defense programs by $271 million, but left it up to the Pentagon to specify the cuts. Yes, Arlen Specter (R). No, Robert Casey Jr. (D).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential candidates, Sens. Barack Obama (D-Ill.), and John McCain, (R-Ariz.), and vice presidential candidate, Joe Biden, (D-Del.), did not vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military benefits: The Senate voted, 94 for and two against, to end a policy that reduces military spouses' survivor benefits by the amount received in Dependency and Indemnity Compensation. The former is an insurance annuity to spouses and children of deceased soldiers. The latter is a Department of Veterans Affairs benefit for spouses of active-duty personnel who die from a service-related cause. Yes, Specter and Casey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, McCain and Biden did not vote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama people say they'll stick with the &quot;big issues&quot; in their sprint right up to Election Day, but it's doubtful they will. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They've given no indication of a break from their strategy of personal attacks and triviality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest Obama TV ad, the campaign mocks McCain because he's not computer savvy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign says this as if e-mailing is a litmus test for being president. But many of the best and brightest people in the world aren't computer savvy, and they function just fine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad follows a recent one that had to do with the number of homes in the McCain family. What's the point, other than a personal attack? Obama has one home, but it's a million-dollar home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, himself, was thrown off message earlier this week by his lipstick-on-a-pig gaffe. The remark was intended as a criticism of McCain policy, but some people took it as a dig at Palin, who made a similar comment (substitute &quot;pig&quot; with &quot;Pit Bull&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's focus on the trivial does little to elevate the debate on the issues that really matter - war on terror, U.S. economy, energy independence, the environment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain says the 2008 campaign may have been strikingly different, had Obama agreed to the dual appearances when the Arizona senator proposed them earlier this year. And he's probably right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a format would be in the tradition of the celebrated Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858, when Abraham Lincoln challenged - unsuccessfully, it turns out - Stephen A. Douglas, who was the incumbent senator from Illinois (Obama's home state).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some 50 days remaining before the election, still plenty of time for Obama to take up McCain on his offer. He should do so.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One week after Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin electrified the Republican base with a vice-presidential acceptance speech that pilloried the Democratic presidential nominee, the Obama camp made clear that from now on they will be running against Arizona Sen. John McCain, not his running mate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In keeping with the new focus, Mr. Obama held a town hall meeting in Dover yesterday focused on tax relief for the middle class, to outline what the campaign called &quot;the sharp differences between his plan to cut taxes for 95 percent of hard-working Americans and John McCain's plan to give tax breaks to corporations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faulting the Bush administration for &quot;irresponsible fiscal policies&quot; that have resulted in unemployment at its highest rate in five years and gas prices that are &quot;killing family budgets,&quot; Mr. Obama said, &quot;We can't afford four more years of what George Bush and John McCain consider progress.&quot; Criticizing Republicans for their &quot;trickle-down&quot; approach to the economy, Mr. Obama asked, &quot;How much has trickled down so far?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One supporter upbraided Mr. Obama for not hitting back hard enough at Mr. McCain's allegations. He responded: &quot;Our ads have been pretty tough, but I just have a different philosophy. I'm going to respond with the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charging that Republicans &quot;make up lies&quot; about the Democratic presidential candidate every four years, Mr. Obama said: &quot;We're going to be hitting back on issues that matter to families. We're not going to start making up lies about John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, &quot;If they lie about us, then we will correct the record,&quot; and that he would not &quot;just sit back and watch.&quot; But he argued that &quot;this election is too serious to be playing silly games.&quot; To applause from the crowd, Mr. Obama promised not to be &quot;distracted or dissuaded from making my case to the American people that we've got to fundamentally change this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign Manager David Plouffe issued a statement calling this &quot;the first day&quot; of a retooled campaign and pledging that &quot;we will respond with speed and ferocity to John McCain's attacks, and we will take the fight to him, but we will do it on the big issues that matter to the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also blasted Mr. McCain for attacks on Mr. Obama's character. &quot;In recent weeks, John McCain has shown that he is willing to go into the gutter to win this election,&quot; his memo said. &quot;His campaign has become nothing but a series of smears, lies and cynical attempts to distract from the issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one Obama&nbsp;ad released yesterday morning, a narrator faults Mr. McCain for not being able to use a computer or send an e-mail, and for not understanding the economy. Questioning how much a man without these skills can be an agent of change, Mr. Obama speaks directly into the camera in another ad and says, &quot;This year, change has to be more than a slogan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain also appeared on ABC's &quot;The View,&quot; where he defended Ms. Palin's record as a reformer and his own reputation as a maverick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't see the old John McCain who used to buck the system,&quot; said &quot;The View&quot; co-host Joy Behar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Replied Mr. McCain: &quot;I have taken on my own party, my own president, the special interests.&quot; Reprising his campaign talking points, he said Ms. Palin would help him change Washington, in part by putting a stop to lawmaker's pet projects known as earmarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When co-host Barbara Walters pointed out that Ms. Palin requested earmarks of her own, Mr. McCain inaccurately interjected: &quot;Not as governor, she didn't.&quot; But Ms. Palin submitted nearly $200 million in requests this year for earmarked projects, including $2 million to research crab productivity in the Bering Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After defending Mr. McCain's comments, the campaign later clarified his position. &quot;Senator McCain was in the throes of a discussion about her record of reforming government, which includes drastic cuts in wasteful spending in the Alaska state budget. If he gave viewers a mistaken impression, it certainly wasn't intentional or without some basis in fact,&quot; said spokesman Tucker Bounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by Ms. Walters about his attacks on Mr. Obama for saying Mr. McCain's claims of change are like &quot;putting lipstick on a pig,&quot; the Republican insisted his Democratic rival was talking about Ms. Palin, not about change. &quot;Senator Obama chooses his words very carefully,&quot; said Mr. McCain. &quot;He shouldn't have said it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On abortion, Mr. McCain said he thought Roe v. Wade was &quot;a very bad decision,&quot; and that he would appoint justices who strictly uphold the Constitution. If the decision were overturned, he said, it would be left to the states to make their own laws on the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past week, Sen. John McCain's campaign spent twice as much across Pennsylvania on television advertising as Sen. Barack Obama's camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican has also outspent his Democratic opponent overall on ads since the general election opened up in June and aired 30 percent more commercial spots statewide, according to data from the Campaign Media Analysis Group in Arlington, Va. The estimated $24 million in Pennsylvania television spending for both candidates is the most in any state in the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course Mr. McCain has reason to spend more and Mr. Obama less: The state has tilted toward Democratic candidates in the last races for president, governor and U.S. Senate, and Democrats here hold a 1.1 million registration edge over the GOP. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans arguably need to go full throttle to make the race closer, while Democrats can hang back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is what campaigns do -- try to out-perform in places they do not do as well and hope to maintain in places they should do well,&quot; said Evan Tracey, the head of CMAG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underscoring that strategy, the McCain camp is targeting the Philadelphia area with many of its ads, where Mr. Obama is thought to be strongest, while doing less in Pittsburgh (where it is also cheaper to buy air time). Over the past week, McCain's campaign spent $1.1 million to Obama's $550,000 in Philadelphia, and $400,000 to Obama's $200,000 in Pittsburgh, by CMAG estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statewide, the ad spending was $2 million and $1 million respectively the past week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy may be paying off, with polls showing the Pennsylvania race getting tighter: A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday said Mr. Obama's lead was down to three percentage points among likely voters, down from a seven-point lead weeks earlier. Mr. McCain's choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as running mate was helping attract white women voters in the state, the poll found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little evidence that increases in advertising lead directly to increases in votes, Temple University political science professor Michael G. Hagen noted yesterday. He too said the Republican convention, featuring Ms. Palin, was probably the biggest factor in the polls tightening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, after a one-day truce on Sept. 11, both sides released new negative ads: one from Mr. Obama makes fun of Mr. McCain's lack of computer savvy, saying he's out of touch on economic issues, and one from Mr. McCain, called &quot;Disrespectful,&quot; criticizes Democratic attacks on Ms. Palin. In another new ad, Mr. Obama speaks directly into the camera on calls for change in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with the McCain camp's bump in advertising -- especially those targeted at the expensive Philadelphia market -- comes a bump in bills, and his campaign will be forced to weigh how long it will target the state, or if the resources would be better spent elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With that kind of money, it shows that right now McCain is putting a lot of horsepower into the state. If they get to the 1st of October and it looks like a state they can win, they'll probably keep it up. If it looks like they haven't closed the gap, they'll probably redirect resources to a state like Michigan or Ohio,&quot; Mr. Tracey said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also the theory that ads produce better bang for the buck closer to November, and both candidates would be better served to save their advertising spending until the last two weeks of the race. That is what the George W. Bush campaign did with success in 2000, especially in Florida, said Mr. Hagen, who has co-authored an upcoming book on that race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People's memory for advertising seems fairly short,&quot; he said, &quot;and having images, ideas and policies fresh in minds is terribly valuable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since June, the McCain camp has aired roughly 18,000 television spots on television stations statewide and the Obama camp 14,000, according to CMAG estimates. The McCain campaign spent an estimated $6 million in the Philadelphia market to the Obama camp's $4.8 million, and $2.4 million to Obama's $2 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arlington, Va., company tracks advertising on broadcast, cable and local television stations using software that identifies unique sound patterns in campaign commercials, and produces spending estimates based on when, where and how often they are aired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would someone mind explaining how the School District of Lancaster comes up with a two-mile rule when it comes to getting bus service for students?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have two daughters, one is in Edward Hand and the other one is in McCaskey East. The daughter that is in Edward Hand gets bus service to school, and might I add, Hand is closer to my home than McCaskey East. But yet my other daughter receives no bus at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the school district determine mileage by drawing straight lines on a map?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My Dad picked my 9th grader up at school on Friday, and he reset his mileage at McCaskey East. It was 2.2 miles from that school to my home. And yet the school district says it's not. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, I did call the school district about bus service and explained that both my daughters attend different schools and only one of them gets bus service. I was told it was because of the neighborhoods that are between Hand and my home. Well, that's the poorest excuse I have ever heard for something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school district used to provide RRTA passes for students at one time. I really think they should do this again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I was also told during this phone call that parents have to buy one for their kids. What if parents can't afford a bus pass, not to mention that gas prices are still high and driving kids back and forth also adds up a good bit?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">School district officials really should try to drive around this city and do the mileage for themselves. I'm sure that I am not the only parent who feels this way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karl E. Moyer had a letter to the editor on Sept. 2. In it he explained that voters need facts, not fear. Here are the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama will negotiate with terrorists, frightful dictators and world leaders such as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who hate our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama says he will pull the troops out of Iraq by the conclusion of his first term, meaning that no soldiers will be preventing terrorists from attacking our country, like on that fateful day in 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain says implement a new strategy and support the surge, which is working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is extremely inexperienced. Before he was senator, he was a community organizer. Oh, that's real experience. Then he became a state senator, then a U.S. senator. He had no experience to be a U.S. senator in the first place. A mere two months later, he decided he would run for president. My aunt is a community organizer, and there is no way she can be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain has years of experience as a leader, a soldier and a strong senator. Community organizer versus a strong senator with years of experience. Hmmm...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only reason that Barack Obama is the Democratic nominee is because he is a political rock star.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats in Congress and here in Lancaster are so blinded by their misplaced sense of self-righteousness and disgusting political correctness that they think they will become a better person by voting for Barack Obama. That is not a racist comment, that is the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I understand that most Lancastrians are Republicans, but I am addressing those few, weak-minded Democrats. This November, voters will choose who to vote for, an inexperienced rock star or a strong, experienced maverick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know who to vote for. I know how to assess the current predicament that our country is in. I know what each candidate stands for. I know how experienced each candidate is. I know that John McCain is more qualified than Barack Obama. I know that he is a proven leader and a hero. I know that he is the smart choice for America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And I'm 13 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. McCain's running mate, Gov Palin, has stated she never really gives the war in Iraq much thought. Haven't any Alaska National Guard troops joined in George Bush's war? That is an insult to the 4,000-plus dead and tens of thousands wounded veterans of that war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her stance on abortion is equally insulting to those who have fought for women's rights. Her views are so extreme. She is against any contraceptive used with married couples, also. She is a gamble by McCain to win over Hillary Clinton's supporters, millions of those who are pro-choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has successfully run ads showing Obama as a celebrity. He now has to include his running mate in that category as she has donned several magazine covers for politics and beauty pageants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Come on, McCain, this election is not about who can fill stadiums, it's about who's going to help fill the gas tanks, as well as the food and medicine cabinets!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have just watched the Democratic and Republican conventions. But I have a problem here. I do not find my candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My candidate will work to repeal NAFTA and all other free-trade agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My candidate will fight to bring jobs back to the United States</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My candidate will seek to raise the minimum wage to a living wage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My candidate will not hand out false stimulus when his people just need a program that will provide jobs that pay wages that allow the worker to feed and clothe his family and put a roof over their heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My candidate won't try to appease the corporations but will find a way to see that the rest of us can continue to have a life. We do not want to be peons. We want to be able to survive and get a little joy out of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My candidate won't tell the young woman, with a child, who is on welfare, to go get a job. He will see that the job is there for her to get. A job that will provide her with the necessities of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe there is someone out there who could be my candidate. If so, I would vote for him/her. I would write in that name on my ballot and encourage my friends to do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Caustic&quot;? Holy Cow!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do you think the oratory floating around the mile-high stadium was? Moonlight and roses?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing I've noticed, ideologue theorists, political and otherwise, can dish out the colorful language, but when a strong answer comes back, they curl up in their self-righteous defensive shells like the armadillo in the what's-its-name commercial and holler &quot;foul.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those of my generation - and I have over a decade on John McCain - remember the lines from &quot;Pistol Packin' Mama&quot; - &quot;The draw was slow, so now they know. They can't do that to Mame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How about a re-release of one of my all-time TV favorites, &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cicely'd love Sarah - and vice versa!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I understand that most Lancastrians are Republicans, but I am addressing those few, weak-minded Democrats. This November, voters will choose who to vote for, an inexperienced rock star or a strong, experienced maverick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know who to vote for. I know how to assess the current predicament that our country is in. I know what each candidate stands for. I know how experienced each candidate is. I know that John McCain is more qualified than Barack Obama. I know that he is a proven leader and a hero. I know that he is the smart choice for America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And I'm 13 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. McCain's running mate, Gov Palin, has stated she never really gives the war in Iraq much thought. Haven't any Alaska National Guard troops joined in George Bush's war? That is an insult to the 4,000-plus dead and tens of thousands wounded veterans of that war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her stance on abortion is equally insulting to those who have fought for women's rights. Her views are so extreme. She is against any contraceptive used with married couples, also. She is a gamble by McCain to win over Hillary Clinton's supporters, millions of those who are pro-choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has successfully run ads showing Obama as a celebrity. He now has to include his running mate in that category as she has donned several magazine covers for politics and beauty pageants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Come on, McCain, this election is not about who can fill stadiums, it's about who's going to help fill the gas tanks, as well as the food and medicine cabinets!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have just watched the Democratic and Republican conventions. But I have a problem here. I do not find my candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My candidate will work to repeal NAFTA and all other free-trade agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My candidate will fight to bring jobs back to the United States</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My candidate will seek to raise the minimum wage to a living wage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My candidate will not hand out false stimulus when his people just need a program that will provide jobs that pay wages that allow the worker to feed and clothe his family and put a roof over their heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My candidate won't try to appease the corporations but will find a way to see that the rest of us can continue to have a life. We do not want to be peons. We want to be able to survive and get a little joy out of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My candidate won't tell the young woman, with a child, who is on welfare, to go get a job. He will see that the job is there for her to get. A job that will provide her with the necessities of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe there is someone out there who could be my candidate. If so, I would vote for him/her. I would write in that name on my ballot and encourage my friends to do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Caustic&quot;? Holy Cow!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do you think the oratory floating around the mile-high stadium was? Moonlight and roses?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing I've noticed, ideologue theorists, political and otherwise, can dish out the colorful language, but when a strong answer comes back, they curl up in their self-righteous defensive shells like the armadillo in the what's-its-name commercial and holler &quot;foul.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those of my generation - and I have over a decade on John McCain - remember the lines from &quot;Pistol Packin' Mama&quot; - &quot;The draw was slow, so now they know. They can't do that to Mame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How about a re-release of one of my all-time TV favorites, &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cicely'd love Sarah - and vice versa!</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this September of our dissonance, the nation feasts on all things Sarah. News sources, Web sites, and the cacophony of cable chatter, on both sides of the chasm, are peddling Palin.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E-mail missives, many nasty, unfounded and unpublishable, most sent by women, engorge the Internet. More than a hundred landed in my mailbox during the weekend. Some women write daily. Tuesday brought &quot;Women against Sarah Palin/Please sign petition.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">will alter the outcome.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is anyone talking about John McCain or Barack Obama? Aren't we supposed to direct our attention toward the candidates' serious differences on education, health care, fiscal recovery and foreign policy?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently not.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many women, and the men vying for women's attention, are too busy assailing or defending the Republican vice presidential nominee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the alpha girls of junior high, women are dwelling on Palin's looks, her children, her voice. Her story has become the hit drama of the new fall season.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back to the lockers We've regressed to the locker room of life, where women engage in combat daily, catfights in kitten heels, as in Clare Boothe Luce's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Women</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. In the pallid remake opening Friday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">the</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> women - the right ones, educated and established - fight back at a &quot;spritzer girl,&quot; the upstart perfume saleswoman.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in the movie, the political pig-in-lipstick imbroglio also concerns class, reviving one of the greatest hits of the culture war. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After their speed date, John McCain selected Sarah Palin not due to experience or compatibility, but because she's the woman who completes him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas he is 72, irreligious, average-looking, rich and physically limited, the Alaska governor is young, religious, photogenic, middle-class and active, with a moose of a narrative.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hoped we had moved beyond the dumb emphasis on narrative to the issues and solutions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How girl of me.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin also bestows on McCain the embittered evangelical far right, the electoral gluttons who almost sat out this cycle but whose needs apparently must be served in every general election before those of everyone else. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain cynically chose her in the belief that women vote with their ovaries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How small to think we would bond with a candidate we barely know when our only shared traits are motherhood, glasses, and the ability to produce estrogen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The battle this engenders among women underscores, despite hollow bromides to the contrary, how few have reached the upper echelon of politics. To attack Palin, McCain's camp argues, is to attack all women, rather than, say, these Republicans.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Know what I think? This is a monumental distraction. Women are attacking women. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does this make us look good? No, it does not. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's girl-on-girl crime, though plenty of men are in the fight, too.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The object of disaffection Should women be so mad at Sarah Palin, an ambitious politician offered the chance of a lifetime? Wouldn't they be better served directing their enmity toward the man who chose her?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican's latest salvo is playing the victim card, trumpeting Palin's girliness. &quot;As Obama drops in the polls,&quot; the announcer says in McCain's latest ad, after showing wolves on the hunt, &quot;he'll try to destroy her.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, John, please save Sarah! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's selection of Palin initially seemed foolish, given how she upstages him. Increasingly, it seems like a masterstroke of diversionary tactics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's ahead in the polls. Obama's fading in the debate. And Palin is America's cover girl, tabloid fodder, the lightning rod. She's the flavor of the month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, with only so little time to go, it's a distraction we can ill afford.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN THE SEVEN years since the 9/11 mass murders, we've gone from &quot;you didn't connect the dots&quot; in some quarters to &quot;I don't want Big Brother snooping on me&quot; in others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven years ago this morning, amid towers turned to lava by airliners made into missiles, America was pulled into war. Still out there today are the deluded who insist that Osama bin Laden is blameless; it was an &quot;inside job&quot; orchestrated by &quot;neo-cons&quot; under the spell of &quot;Zionist traitors.&quot; I'm not certain that Barbie and Ken are free from all suspicion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of a 9/11 column I wrote last year, across the Internet I am identified as a neo-con. Also a traitor. And a Zionist. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That column wondered if another 9/11 attack might unify a splintered, partisan America as the first 9/11 had. My most fervent critics dishonestly portrayed me as calling for an attack and even suggesting targets. What I actually did was demonstrate that our open society is ripe with opportunities for terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our best protection comes from coordinating efforts with allies - and by massive intelligence-gathering, on foreigners and Americans alike: Wiretaps, surveillance, mining data from e-mails, security cameras. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the idea of surveilling Americans infuriates many, I don't suggest it lightly or without judicial oversight. I do it because, sadly, it's naive to believe that all Americans can be trusted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to 9/11, the most deadly terror attack on American soil - the 1995 bombing of the Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City - was done by Timothy McVeigh, an American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven years after 9/11, we have safeguards against skyjacking, which is the last war, but our ports remain open to chemical and biological penetration, despite strides that have been made. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anthrax sent through the mail in the weeks following 9/11, resulting in a half-dozen deaths? No convictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protection from sarin gas released in a subway, as happened in Tokyo in 1995? Don't think about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chemical plants in the U.S.? Vulnerable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of shoulder-launched Stinger-type missiles in unfriendly hands? Equipping civilian aircraft with defensive counter-measures is &quot;too expensive.&quot; (Think of the cost if a U.S. passenger plane is shot down, plus the resulting panic and air- traffic paralysis.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To some this sounds hysterical. Is your idea of protection pinning a smile button on your lapel?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the presidential campaign the threat of terrorism, strangely, has rarely come up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who will protect us better - Barack Obama or John McCain?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To my surprise, Obama - who often comes off like Gentle Ben - expressed a willingness to go into Pakistan if we had &quot;actionable intelligence&quot; that bin Laden was there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To my surprise, McCain chided Obama for that. McCain's willing to chase bin Laden &quot;to the gates of hell,&quot; but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">not</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into Pakistan?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm looking for the leader smart enough - and patient enough - to fight a decades-long war against terror that will outlive bin Laden. I want a leader who understands that sometimes you have to put aside cherished personal principles to accomplish an unsavory task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More security </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">will</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reduce personal liberty, but less than the current hassle at airports. We must be able to connect the dots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are at war, even though we don't like to be reminded of it. We don't even have a national moment of silence to honor those who died on 9/11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This horrible anniversary demands that we do a better job of fighting terror, or we will live to regret it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even worse, many of us will die to regret it. *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lipstick. Pigs. Sex education of kindergartners. Abortions -- or the lack thereof -- as a qualification for public office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's getting nasty out there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever happened to the &quot;honorable campaign,&quot; the &quot;end to divisive politics&quot; promised by both Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama at the start of their 2008 race for the presidency?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the past three days, anyway, there's been no sign of any such thing. Instead, yesterday, South Carolina Democratic chair Carol Fowler was quoted in Politico.com as saying Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's &quot;primary qualification [as the Republican vice-presidential nominee] seems to be that she hasn't had an abortion.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Mr. Obama characterized Mr. McCain's promise to change Washington as &quot;lipstick on a pig,&quot; a remark that GOP officials immediately claimed was a swipe at Ms. Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a new McCain&nbsp;ad running in Pennsylvania that claims Mr. Obama supported sex education for kindergartners -- &quot;learning about sex before learning to read?&quot; an announcer's voice says over a photo of Mr. Obama smiling -- prompting Obama officials to denounce the ad as &quot;shameful&quot; and &quot;downright perverse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Republicans are claiming that 30 Democratic National Committee operatives flew to Alaska to dig up dirt on Ms. Palin the day after Mr. McCain selected her as his running mate. The claim is completely untrue, former Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles, a Democrat, said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have formed a &quot;Palin Truth Squad&quot; to counter allegations about the Alaska governor -- both personal and political -- while the Democrats unveiled their own &quot;Alaska Myth Busters&quot; yesterday to hammer away at Ms. Palin's support for pork-barrel projects like the $223 million &quot;Bridge To Nowhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign is even using the previously taboo &quot;L&quot; word -- lie -- to characterize the McCain campaign's continuing insistence that Ms. Palin opposed the bridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Closer to home, Pennsylvania's Gov. Ed Rendell and Sen. Bob Casey, in a conference call with reporters yesterday, decried the McCain campaign's tactics, with Mr. Casey claiming that Republican consultants have &quot;a Ph.D&quot; in sleazy campaigning. In another conference call, Pennsylvania Republican women said they were appalled by Mr. Obama's &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was insulting to women and insulting to Sarah Palin,&quot; said Joyce Haas, vice chair of the state Republican party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this shock and outrage at the other side's claims and counterclaims merely marks the official start to the real presidential campaign, said Pittsburgh-based Republican political consultant John Brabender -- in part because it's what the media likes to cover and what voters like to know about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What gets covered is the interesting, not the important,&quot; said Mr. Brabender. &quot;This is the ultimate reality of campaigns today. Let's face it: Voters would rather read about this stuff than a side-by-side comparison of the candidates' energy plans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential campaigns &quot;are run on a minute-by-minute basis, and you can be sure that every time John McCain says something, Barack Obama will be monitoring everything and move into action -- and vice versa,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, shortly after Ms. Fowler's abortion comments were reported, Republicans scheduled a conference call with Sen. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, who called on Mr. Obama to condemn her remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If a Republican had said this about a Democrat, it would be outrage of the century,&quot; Mr. Graham told reporters. &quot;Our Democratic colleagues and opponents are in a meltdown mode over Governor Palin. They are seeing a threat they did not see before, and they're striking back, basically, in a panic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Fowler apologized later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Ms. Palin -- whose selection has thrilled and energized conservative women as well as some Hillary Rodham Clinton supporters -- seems to be driving much of the heated rhetoric, said Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, but presidential campaign trash talk is hardly a new development in American politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was some pretty horrible stuff thrown back and forth between Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams,&quot; he noted. &quot;Mrs. Jackson was called a slut, among other things, became ill and died, and President Jackson forever blamed Mr. Adams for killing his wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difference today, Mr. Whalen added, is that &quot;there's this thing called the Internet, so it gets out there pretty quickly. Fifty years ago people sat around in bars and talked about it. Now it's out in minutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has rejected calls for apologies for the &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; remark. &quot;They seize on an innocent remark, try to take it out of context, throw up an outrageous ad because they know that it's catnip for the news media,&quot; Mr. Obama said in Virginia yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign then issued a press release listing three instances in which Mr. McCain used the same expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans were similarly unrepentant about the McCain campaign's sex education ad -- which actually refers to a bill Mr. Obama supported that protects young children against sexual predators</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, at least, there will be a respite from all the rancor: Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain will be appearing together in New York City at two memorials to the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, one at ground zero and another at Columbia University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Whalen, for one, believes this current &quot;bad patch&quot; of nastiness will end on a precise date: Sept. 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's when the first presidential debate takes place, and that should put us back into a debate about issues,&quot; he said. &quot;One candidate or the other will be particularly effective on one subject or the other and spark a whole new discussion, and this particular negative phase will be forgotten. Unless of course someone screws up and makes a gaffe, and then I guess it all starts again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sep. 11--Lynette Runyan-Baker remembers how the country pulled together in the days following Sept. 11, 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was evident at the York Fair that week, she said, where all it took was a glance into other people's eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You could feel a connection,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She believes things have changed in the seven years since the attacks that toppled the World Trade Center towers and struck the Pentagon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact of the date, she said, seems to have dulled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only about 30 people gathered Thursday morning outside the York County Administrative Center in downtown York to watch a memorial ceremony marking the anniversary of the morning attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's a human tendency to move on and forget,&quot; Runyan-Baker said. &quot;It's just disappointing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that people are so busy with their lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others may be able to forget the fallout from the attacks, but she can't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, her son, Army Cpl. Luke S. Runyan of Spring Grove, was killed in Iraq. He was 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His name was added Thursday to a plaque outside the county building on East Market Street in York memorializing troops fallen in battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ceremony, organized by the county's Joint Veterans Council, has been held almost every year since the attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The York County Veterans Honor Guard fired its rifles to salute the dead, and York Mayor John Brenner urged the public to remember the troops and civilians killed in war and in terrorist attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 8:46 a.m. -- the time the center was first hit by a commercial flight</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- the crowd listened to the somber cry of Taps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roslyn Ream of East Berlin, 70, has attended the ceremony almost every year it's been held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2001, she and her husband, John, were on vacation in Delaware when she heard the New York City skyscrapers had been hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Ream, who was with the American Red Cross, rushed back to York and then Shanksville, where United Airlines Flight 93 crashed after the passengers and crew reportedly fought their hijackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emotions stirred from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">event haven't faded for Roslyn Ream. But she said she understands if they have for others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's just a natural thing,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Lowe of York, 28, called himself one of those who have become &quot;desensitized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm always hearing about terrorists and the attacks,&quot; he said. &quot;I guess it's just become part of my daily routine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most years, the event draws about 25 to 30 people, coordinator Jeff Hines said. However, he added, the crowds have begun to grow as the 10th anniversary approaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems to be picking up steam a little bit,&quot; he said. &quot;I think people are having a renewed interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lowe said he decided to attend the ceremony because of publicity over new memorials in Shanksville and the Pentagon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's weird that it's been almost 10 years now,&quot; he said. &quot;It doesn't seem too far back when it all happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks on Sept. 11 were tragic, he said. But with an &quot;erosion&quot; of civil rights in the aftermath, he said, the date might have more significance for him now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">York County Controller Robb Green tries to come to the ceremony every year. Each time he attends, he said, he thinks of a friend killed in Vietnam and his past dream of being a New York City firefighter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He doesn't think a modest crowd at the ceremony is a sign that people are forgetting what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that in their hearts, they're here,&quot; he said. &quot;If they remember, that in itself is meaningful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HONORING LUKE RUNYAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Army Cpl. Luke S. Runyan, 21, of Spring Grove, died Feb. 17 in Diyala province when enemy forces attacked his dismounted patrol using small-arms fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 2004 Spring Grove Area High School graduate, he was posthumously awarded a Bronze Star with valor at a July ceremony welcoming his unit, the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, back to Fort Lewis in Washington. He also was awarded the Bronze Star for achievement at his burial service in March at Arlington National Cemetery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To some people, Sarah Palin is a &quot;rock star.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or at least, that's what some attendees of the &quot;Road to Victory&quot; rally at Franklin &amp; Marshall College's Alumni Sports &amp; Fitness Center on Harrisburg Pike said Tuesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was supporting John McCain before, but I wasn't as excited about the campaign,&quot; Lancaster resident Brian Anthony said. &quot;I think (Palin) has livened things up and made the race fun for Republicans again.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some carried signs that read, &quot;You Go Girl!&quot; and &quot;Sarah Rocks!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're Sarah's groupies,&quot; said Natalie Yost, who came from Berks County to attend the rally. &quot;There's a bunch of us here who think she's the star of the show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin, Alaska's governor and the newly minted Republican nominee for vice president, appeared onstage wearing a red, cropped blazer with matching red heels. The fitness center was packed, and whenever Palin finished a sentence, the cheers were deafening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to Washington to shake things up,&quot; Palin said, looking at Sen. McCain. &quot;And (McCain) is the only candidate who has served America - in good times and bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin, 44, is a mother of five. Until recently, the former beauty-pageant contestant and mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, was best known for her nearly two years as governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She already had given a boost to McCain's fundraising efforts. Of the $47 million he raised in August, $10 million came in the three days after he announced Palin as his vice presidential running mate, the campaign said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some who attended the rally attributed Palin's popularity to her &quot;anti-abortion stance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She put a face to the cause - a very high-profile face,&quot; Lancaster resident Abby Kest said. &quot;I think for some people, that's very important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin, known to be outspoken in her anti-abortion views, is one of many government officials in favor of abstinence-only sex education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days after she was announced as McCain's running mate, the campaign disclosed that her 17-year-old daughter, Bristol Palin, was pregnant by her boyfriend, Levi Johnston, 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think that's hurt her,&quot; Kest said. &quot;It's the kind of thing that can happen to any family. And it hasn't changed her beliefs in the least, which says a lot about her character.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Tuesday's rally, McCain and Palin referred to themselves as a team of &quot;mavericks&quot; and told the audience that victory wasn't far off for American troops in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin also said she and McCain would guarantee &quot;change,&quot; unlike their opponent, Sen. Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some politicians use 'change' to promote their careers,&quot; she said. &quot;Other candidates use their their career to promote change. (McCain) doesn't run with the Washington herd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, the Obama campaign has criticized the McCain-Palin campaign's new ad called &quot;Original Mavericks,&quot; which includes a claim that Palin stopped the so-called &quot;Bridge to Nowhere,&quot; a nearly $400 million proposal to use federal money to build a bridge to an island in Alaska occupied by 50 residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to published reports, Palin voiced support for the project during her campaign to become Alaska's governor, although she was critical of the project's size and later abandoned plans for the project. Palin used the money Alaska received from the federal government for other projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Palin didn't respond to the criticism during the rally. Instead, Palin mentioned &quot;expanding energy alternatives&quot; that should be provided by &quot;American ingenuity and American workers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a time for politics, a time to campaign and a time to put country first,&quot; Palin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the rally, she took the time to sign autographs before getting back on the campaign bus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who attended the rally said they were impressed with the way Palin handled herself and expressed confidence in her ability to handle her critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far, she hasn't buckled under the pressure,&quot; Daniel Anderson of Lebanon said. &quot;That business with her ex-brother-in-law hasn't made her sweat much either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alaska's Legislature is looking into allegations that Palin fired Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan when he refused to fire her ex-brother-in-law, a state trooper involved in a custody battle with the governor's sister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin has denied wrongdoing, and her supporters have told news organizations that the investigation has become a &quot;political circus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think picking Palin was a good thing,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;Most the people I've met here today were supporting McCain before he announced Palin - but now things have gotten more interesting. We feel inspired.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The signs: &quot;Read My Lipstick - Palin Rocks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pink buttons: &quot;Hot Chicks Vote Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wild cheers at the end of her every exhortation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It didn't even matter that she fumbled her lone attempt at pronouncing Lancaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, Sarah Palin was the star and provided the buzz when the Republican presidential ticket whipped up a raucous crowd of near-adulators Tuesday at Franklin &amp; Marshall College's Alumni Sports &amp; Fitness Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was a disappointed Republican, but now I'm back,&quot; declared James Saunders, 51, a Manheim Township resident. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin is the greatest thing since sliced bread.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marci Bressler, 46, a mother of eight from Kirkwood, may have been with McCain from the beginning, but predicts Palin was an addition of historic proportions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton may have started the battle of getting women in the White House but Sarah Palin is going to end it,&quot; she predicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That gives all of us that want to work and have kids a chance to do everything a guy can do, and not be stuck in the kitchen,&quot; Bressler said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judging from crowd reaction, Palin's 22-minute speech took on more of a keynote address than a warm-up for her boss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm ready to vote!&quot; an energized Marcia Stabley of York said moments after John McCain had finished his pep talk amid thunderous applause from a wildly supportive, sign-waving crowd in the auditorium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several loyal Republicans admitted sheepishly that they wouldn't have come if Palin hadn't also been on the podium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Temptations song that blared before the speeches with the words, &quot;Look out baby, 'cause here I come,&quot; fits both candidates, but Palin was garnering the elephant's share of attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm in love with Sarah Palin!&quot; said Sheila Myers, 66, of York. &quot;I like her openness. She's very genuine. She's likable. I like everything about her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She brings a breath of fresh air, for sure. His campaign has taken off like a rocket. I think he realizes he struck gold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many said they liked Palin's &quot;outsider&quot; status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's not typical Washington,&quot; said Karen Aydt, 49, of Gladwyne. &quot;That's what I'm sort of sick of. She actually may get in Washington and we actually may have a chance of cleaning things up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Octogenarian Arlene Holbein of Millersville says she groaned &quot;Oh no!&quot; out loud when she first heard that McCain had tapped the unknown governor from Alaska as a VP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She now sings a different tune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's terrific. I just like the way she carries herself. (McCain) needed a boost. She's just a positive person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd lit up when Palin spoke, punctuating her speech with chants of &quot;Sarah! Sarah! Sarah!&quot; and &quot;USA! USA! USA!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People held aloft a sea of campaign signs such as &quot;Country First&quot; that were handed out at the rally. Plenty brought their own, hoisting slogans including &quot;Preschoolers for Palin,&quot; &quot;Energy Independence&quot; and &quot;If We Were 18, We'd Vote McCain-Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People said McCain's campaign got a burst of energy with Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neal Lesher, 23, of Palmyra, one of many in the crowd from beyond Lancaster County, said, &quot;I'm super-excited about John McCain. I think he has the vision and leadership necessary to lead this country for the next four years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin, he said, &quot;is exactly what this country needed to get excited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack Boyd, of Devon, said he thought it took &quot;tremendous courage&quot; for McCain to pick a relatively unknown woman from Alaska as his running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a brilliant move,&quot; he said. &quot;She's a sleeper. ... She will be responsible for a lot of infusion of fringe voters and cross-party voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others praised McCain's character, and said Palin meshes well with that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's a real person,&quot; said E.J. Richter, 42, of Wayne. &quot;You can tell when you see a person and when they are trying to sell you something. ... I think she doubly emphasizes that point. I relate to Sarah. She's got integrity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were many veterans in the crowd and they received a long, loud ovation when McCain asked them to raise their hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of them, John Frederick, 67, of Manheim, who lost a best friend in Korea, said the main reason he came was to hear Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He predicted that if the McCain-Palin ticket wins in November, Sarah Palin will be elected president in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 33, Rebecca Weiler will be voting in her first presidential election, a voting record she is not proud of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just feel I need to set a better example for my son and be an American citizen,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her choice: McCain. &quot;He served our country and to me that says a lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several McCain-Palin supporters said the two candidates' anti-abortion stands was the crux of their support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A handful of protesters showed up outside the rally, quietly holding signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Lane, a 74-year-old Lancaster Township resident, leaned stoically on an umbrella, holding a sign that said, &quot;McCain Is Bush Warmed Over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He braved without reply occasional taunts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see a pure white crowd here,&quot; he observed. &quot;It's a little sad in a way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josh Redd, of Students for a Democratic Society in Millersville, had water thrown at him by someone who yelled, &quot;Get a job!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous people brought their children to the rally, holding them on their shoulders and handing them signs to wave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some came not to cheer but to listen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angela Richards, 57, of Lancaster, has not made up her mind about the presidential race. A registered Independent, she also attended Barack Obama's rally Thursday in Lancaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She had hoped to hear more specifics about where McCain and Palin stand on issues such as the economy and health care, she said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm still on the fence,&quot; she said, &quot;I want to hear less rah-rah and more issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 10 Lancaster County Amish men and women were at the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of them, who estimated about 15 percent of the local Amish adults will vote this November, said Amish tend to vote Republican because of the party's pro-life platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of McCain, one Amish man said, &quot;Our people look at someone with gray hair and think it's someone who is wise.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, Sarah Palin was the star and provided the buzz when the Republican presidential ticket whipped up a raucous crowd of near-adulators Tuesday at Franklin &amp; Marshall College's Alumni Sports &amp; Fitness Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was a disappointed Republican, but now I'm back,&quot; declared James Saunders, 51, a Manheim Township resident. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin is the greatest thing since sliced bread.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TO THE EDITOR:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am writing as a lifelong Republican and Vietnam veteran. I have followed both campaigns and their policies and have been utterly appalled at the outright lies of the McCain ads. Even the Washington Post (Aug. 31) on its editorial page titled one piece: &quot;Mr. McCain's ads on taxes are just plain false.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates have widely differing views on taxes as one would expect. But here are the facts. They quote the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in pointing out the following: Obama, tax breaks for the bottom fifth, $567 per year; McCain, $21. For the middle fifth, Obama $1,118; McCain, $325.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While McCain firmly stands behind the present tax breaks for oil companies, Obama does not in light of their mind-boggling profits and proposes distributing the savings to taxpayers. McCain firmly stands for present tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest Americans; Obama proposes to eliminate them for the companies who ship jobs overseas and increasing taxes only on the wealthiest of Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find it pathetic that John McCain, a man formerly known for integrity and honesty, would support such outright lies. He must assume Americans are uninformed idiots for whom the Big Lie is sufficient. Is this the man we want for president?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Ed Rendell Monday summed up John McCain's campaign and the Republican National Convention last week with three words: &quot;The Big Lie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making his first remarks here since the GOP convention, Rendell convened a news conference Monday afternoon on the grass-and-concrete patio in front of Franklin &amp; Marshall College's Alumni Sports &amp; Fitness Center, 24 hours before McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, were scheduled to appear for a rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rendell, laughing during a lighthearted moment, called on the McCain campaign to suspend by Wednesday all ads he says are mischaracterizing Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama by indicating he plans to raise taxes on all Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is going on is a deliberate campaign: I call it 'The Big Lie,' &quot; Rendell said. &quot;Speaker after speaker after speaker created the impression in the American people's minds that Barack Obama was going to raise their taxes. Television ad after television ad, you can't hear a television ad without hearing Barack Obama's going to raise taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans immediately shot back Monday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't hear many things he doesn't want to raise taxes on,&quot; said state Republican Party spokesman Michael Barley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rendell - surrounded by Lancaster city officials, including Mayor Rick Gray, local Obama supporters and former U.S. Sen. Harris Wofford - focused his attack on what he said are &quot;lies&quot; perpetuated by Republicans, including McCain and Palin, about Obama's tax plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He even penned a letter that Abe Amoros, political and communications director for the state Democratic Party, will try to hand-deliver to McCain during the F&amp;M event. The letter outlines Obama's and McCain's tax plans, then says: &quot;I hope that you will stop misleading the American public about Barack Obama's tax plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington, D.C., people earning $66,354 or less (about 60 percent of income earners) will see tax reductions if either of the candidates' plans are adopted, but the reductions are between three and 19 times deeper in Obama's proposals than McCain's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those making between $37,596 and $66,354 would receive a $1,042 tax cut under Obama's plan or a $319 cut in McCain's plan. The margins grow wider the lower the annual income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rendell also pointed to Obama's plans to eliminate federal income taxes for working seniors earning $50,000 or less and proposed tax cuts on mortgage rates and college tuition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, though, would raise taxes on capital gains, income and dividends if a person or business is making more than $250,000 from those sources of income, but the rates would be the same as those during the 1990s, according to Rendell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's raising taxes on the very wealthy, and he's cutting taxes for the middle class,&quot; Rendell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's tax plan calls for tax cuts in all income brackets. The deepest cuts would go to the top earners - those making $160,973 and more - who would see at least a 3 percent reduction in income taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Rendell accused McCain of pandering to wealthy earners and rich corporations, Barley said that's a tired argument frequently used by Democrats.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TO THE EDITOR:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am writing as a lifelong Republican and Vietnam veteran. I have followed both campaigns and their policies and have been utterly appalled at the outright lies of the McCain ads. Even the Washington Post (Aug. 31) on its editorial page titled one piece: &quot;Mr. McCain's ads on taxes are just plain false.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates have widely differing views on taxes as one would expect. But here are the facts. They quote the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in pointing out the following: Obama, tax breaks for the bottom fifth, $567 per year; McCain, $21. For the middle fifth, Obama $1,118; McCain, $325.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While McCain firmly stands behind the present tax breaks for oil companies, Obama does not in light of their mind-boggling profits and proposes distributing the savings to taxpayers. McCain firmly stands for present tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest Americans; Obama proposes to eliminate them for the companies who ship jobs overseas and increasing taxes only on the wealthiest of Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find it pathetic that John McCain, a man formerly known for integrity and honesty, would support such outright lies. He must assume Americans are uninformed idiots for whom the Big Lie is sufficient. Is this the man we want for president?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Ed Rendell Monday summed up John McCain's campaign and the Republican National Convention last week with three words: &quot;The Big Lie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making his first remarks here since the GOP convention, Rendell convened a news conference Monday afternoon on the grass-and-concrete patio in front of Franklin &amp; Marshall College's Alumni Sports &amp; Fitness Center, 24 hours before McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, were scheduled to appear for a rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rendell, laughing during a lighthearted moment, called on the McCain campaign to suspend by Wednesday all ads he says are mischaracterizing Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama by indicating he plans to raise taxes on all Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is going on is a deliberate campaign: I call it 'The Big Lie,' &quot; Rendell said. &quot;Speaker after speaker after speaker created the impression in the American people's minds that Barack Obama was going to raise their taxes. Television ad after television ad, you can't hear a television ad without hearing Barack Obama's going to raise taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans immediately shot back Monday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't hear many things he doesn't want to raise taxes on,&quot; said state Republican Party spokesman Michael Barley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rendell - surrounded by Lancaster city officials, including Mayor Rick Gray, local Obama supporters and former U.S. Sen. Harris Wofford - focused his attack on what he said are &quot;lies&quot; perpetuated by Republicans, including McCain and Palin, about Obama's tax plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He even penned a letter that Abe Amoros, political and communications director for the state Democratic Party, will try to hand-deliver to McCain during the F&amp;M event. The letter outlines Obama's and McCain's tax plans, then says: &quot;I hope that you will stop misleading the American public about Barack Obama's tax plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington, D.C., people earning $66,354 or less (about 60 percent of income earners) will see tax reductions if either of the candidates' plans are adopted, but the reductions are between three and 19 times deeper in Obama's proposals than McCain's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those making between $37,596 and $66,354 would receive a $1,042 tax cut under Obama's plan or a $319 cut in McCain's plan. The margins grow wider the lower the annual income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rendell also pointed to Obama's plans to eliminate federal income taxes for working seniors earning $50,000 or less and proposed tax cuts on mortgage rates and college tuition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, though, would raise taxes on capital gains, income and dividends if a person or business is making more than $250,000 from those sources of income, but the rates would be the same as those during the 1990s, according to Rendell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's raising taxes on the very wealthy, and he's cutting taxes for the middle class,&quot; Rendell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's tax plan calls for tax cuts in all income brackets. The deepest cuts would go to the top earners - those making $160,973 and more - who would see at least a 3 percent reduction in income taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Rendell accused McCain of pandering to wealthy earners and rich corporations, Barley said that's a tired argument frequently used by Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rich people pay a larger amount of taxes,&quot; Barley said. &quot;The wealthier people are also the people who help to provide jobs. They help the economy. They are typically the ones who do a lot of purchasing. I understand that's a favorite argument of Democrats, but you have to look and say that John McCain, at the end of the day, is going to leave more in your paycheck than Barack Obama. There's no doubt about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans John McCain and Sarah Palin, on their way to Lancaster for an afternoon rally today, will portray themselves here as reformers who will &quot;drain the Washington swamp&quot; and fight special interests, aides and recent appearances suggest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP presidential nominee will renew his emphasis on his reputation as a maverick and call for more offshore drilling and support for nuclear power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arriving here just five days after winning his party's nomination, McCain is expected to criticize Democratic opponent Barack Obama's position on the surge strategy in Iraq - another staple of his stump speech. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Running mate Palin, meantime, has launched a new line of attack on Obama and his use of congressional earmarks, money for projects that lawmakers try to get for their home districts and constituents - a theme she is likely to repeat here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just the other day our opponent brought up earmarks - and frankly I was surprised that he would even raise the subject at all,&quot; Palin said at a rally Monday in Missouri. &quot;I thought he wouldn't want to go there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Republicans expect a capacity crowd - 6,500 to 7,000 supporters - to greet McCain and Palin in their first post-convention visit to Pennsylvania and Lancaster County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. senator from Arizona and his surprise pick for vice president, the governor of Alaska, were to speak at a 3:30 p.m. rally at Franklin &amp; Marshall College's Alumni Sports &amp; Fitness Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The excitement surrounding this visit is proof of the enthusiasm for the McCain-Palin ticket among voters in Central Pennsylvania,&quot; said McCain spokesman Paul Lindsay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are two mavericks who have a record of reform that they will bring to Washington in order to get our economy moving again and put government on the side of the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Palin were expected to fly into Lancaster Airport at 1:30 p.m. aboard the presidential nominee's campaign plane, &quot;Straight Talk Air.&quot; They were speaking before some 5,000 supporters at a rally in Lebanon, Ohio, late this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we're going to do, what we have to do is take our message of reform - because Washington desperately needs reform - all across this nation to everyone in every party or no party at all,&quot; Palin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are committed to that reform. That's what John McCain, that's what I am all about. It's going to be small-town America getting us to where we need to get that reform,&quot; Palin said. &quot;It's with your help and with your vote we're going to Washington, and we're going to shake things up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain doesn't walk with the Washington herd,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin also talked at length about spending cuts she made as Alaska's governor, and how she took on the state's &quot;good-old-boys network.&quot; She also repeated her criticism of Obama for trying to win congressional earmarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So as we reformed the abuses of earmarks in our state, our opponent was requesting nearly $1 billion in earmarks,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama hasn't asked for any earmarks this year. Last year, he asked for $311 million worth, about $25 for every Illinois resident. Alaska asked this year for earmarks totaling $198 million, about $295 for every Alaska citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin has cut back on pork project requests. But, under her administration, Alaska is still by far the largest per-capita consumer of federal pet-project spending, according to news reports. The governor did reject plans to build the notorious &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot; after Congress had cut off its financing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin said in Ohio that &quot;I told Congress thanks but no thanks for that Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, speaking after Palin this morning, said, &quot;I can't wait to introduce her to Washington, D.C., and the big spenders ... she'll take 'em on like she did in Alaska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Change is coming, and real change is coming to Washington, D.C.,&quot; McCain said. &quot;You've got a team of mavericks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As McCain and Palin make their way to the college, a group of community organizers from across the state was expected to gather outside the field house and criticize the GOP's attempts to minimize their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, led by former Green Party gubernatorial candidate Michael Morrill, will try to deliver a petition to the Republicans calling on them to &quot;stop their attacks on their chosen career,&quot; according to a statement, and asking for an apology for &quot;the demeaning attacks on the important work that we do to strengthen our communities and our great nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Republicans, speaking at the party's convention last week, ridiculed Barack Obama's work as a community organizer in Chicago two decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic state Rep. Mike Sturla, of Lancaster, and other local Democrats held their own news conference late this morning to criticize the GOP ticket, just as Gov. Ed Rendell, city Mayor Rick Gray and U.S. Sen. Harris Wofford did here on Monday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rendell focused his attack on what he said are &quot;lies&quot; perpetuated by Republicans, including McCain and Palin, about Obama's tax plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaker after speaker after speaker (at the Republican National Convention) created the impression in the American people's minds that Barack Obama was going to raise their taxes.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, led by former Green Party gubernatorial candidate Michael Morrill, will try to deliver a petition to the Republicans calling on them to &quot;stop their attacks on their chosen career,&quot; according to a statement, and asking for an apology for &quot;the demeaning attacks on the important work that we do to strengthen our communities and our great nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Republicans, speaking at the party's convention last week, ridiculed Barack Obama's work as a community organizer in Chicago two decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic state Rep. Mike Sturla, of Lancaster, and other local Democrats held their own news conference late this morning to criticize the GOP ticket, just as Gov. Ed Rendell, city Mayor Rick Gray and U.S. Sen. Harris Wofford did here on Monday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rendell focused his attack on what he said are &quot;lies&quot; perpetuated by Republicans, including McCain and Palin, about Obama's tax plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaker after speaker after speaker (at the Republican National Convention) created the impression in the American people's minds that Barack Obama was going to raise their taxes. Television ad after television ad, you can't hear a television ad without hearing Barack Obama's going to raise taxes,&quot; Rendell said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUPPORTERS of Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin should be glad that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Oprah Winfrey </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">wants to wait until after the election to have the Alaska governor appear on her show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can you imagine Winfrey fixing that wide-eyed gaze of hers on Palin, a supporter of abstinence-only sex education, as she quizzes the veep candidate about her pregnant 17-year-old? Given Winfrey's own troubled sexual history as a teen, the talk-show diva isn't likely to give her much slack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what would happen once the book-loving Winfrey starts probing Palin about allegations that the former mayor of Wasilla tried to ban certain books from a public library? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or if she really wanted to pander to her viewership, she could bring on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sen. Hillary Clinton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and let her offer up a counterpoint to Palin's view on the war in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, for Palin, who has been lying low in terms of giving interviews, the smarter thing is to back away slowly . . . no, run . . . from being in the Oprah hot seat. After all, the much-heralded &quot;Oprah Effect&quot; isn't bestowed just by being in proximity to the Queen of All Media. It's all about whether Winfrey actually gives you the thumbs-up. Someone needs to tell that to those trying to stir up trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid conservative complaints that the media in general is biased against Palin, a Republican women's group in Florida yesterday announced plans to boycott the top-rated talk show and are encouraging women to cancel their subscriptions to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">O: The Oprah Magazine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oprah's show reaches an audience of roughly 8 million viewers per day, the vast majority of whom are women. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women in Florida helped build Oprah into the icon she is today,&quot; said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Linda Ivell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, president of Florida Federation of Republican Women, in a statement. &quot;We are deeply disappointed in Ms. Winfrey's decision to sit out the greatest political moment in the history of women since suffrage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That announcement came after Winfrey's move on Friday to rebut an unsubstantiated report on the Drudge Report about infighting among her employees over whether to invite Palin to appear on the show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has been absolutely no discussion about having Sarah Palin on my show,&quot; Winfrey said. &quot;At the beginning of this presidential campaign, when I decided that I was going to take my first public stance in support of a candidate, I made the decision not to use my show as a platform for any of the candidates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's story of having made her way from the local Parent Teachers Association to the Alaska governor's office is just the kind of inspirational tale Winfrey is famous for spotlighting. Winfrey, who's seen as an American everywoman, has made a career of cheerleading for people, women in particular, to reach for their dreams and to live their best lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for months now, Winfrey has been all about her support for Democratic presidential candidate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sen. Barack Obama&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">- even in the face of negative pushback from viewers upset about her backing a man instead of Clinton. Now, it's Palin that has some of her viewers buzzing. The message board has been flooded with e-mails from those who accuse her of abandoning her fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oprah was made in part by white women, we are her largest viewing base,&quot; one poster wrote. &quot;Oprah do what is right, even if you do not like Sarah, for the sake of your base. . . . all of us women out here, put this woman on your show. I am asking that you do the right thing and give back to us who made you who you are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last I checked, Winfrey wasn't hosting &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; And it's not as if she's had Obama on since he announced his run for president. Nor has Sen. John McCain been on since the campaign got underway. Yet there are these ugly rumblings, as if Winfrey has somehow wronged Palin by not having her on the show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's become this war between the liberals and Republican, right-wing, no-abortion women, and Oprah is a convenient target,&quot; said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Barbara Lippert</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Ad</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"> Week</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> editor who has written about Palin. &quot;These were women who were just waiting for their moment. They felt they were not represented.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin, she said, &quot;has ignited every war between between women. It's like she's invented new wars . . . people have a lot of anger that's been waiting to come out.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">LEE'S SUMMIT, Mo. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arizona Sen. John McCain and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin criticized Illinois Sen. Barack Obama over the amount of money he has requested for his home state, even though Alaska under Ms. Palin's leadership has asked Washington for 10 times more money per citizen for pet projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a rally in swing state Missouri, the Republican presidential nominee and his running mate accused Mr. Obama, Mr. McCain's Democratic rival, of requesting nearly $1 billion in earmarks for his state during his time as a senator. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new line of attack came after Mr. Obama over the weekend made his first direct criticism of Mr. McCain's vice-presidential choice, citing the topic of Ms. Palin's earmarks, which are special projects that lawmakers try to get for their districts and constituents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just the other day our opponent brought up earmarks -- and, frankly, I was surprised that he would even raise the subject at all,&quot; Ms. Palin said. &quot;I thought he wouldn't want to go there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama hasn't asked for any earmarks this year. Last year, he asked for $311 million worth, or about $25 for every Illinois resident. Alaska asked this year for earmarks totaling $198 million, or about $295 for every Alaska citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Palin has cut back on pork project requests, but under her administration, Alaska is still the largest per-capita consumer of federal pet-project spending by far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor did reject plans to build the notorious &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot; after Congress had cut off its financing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin were presented as a maverick team in an ad their campaign released yesterday that played up their reputation for taking on entrenched interests. The ad credits Ms. Palin with stopping the bridge, without mentioning that she once appeared to support it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush, who came to Washington as a former Texas governor without national legislative experience, called the Alaska governor &quot;an inspired pick&quot; by Mr. McCain. &quot;She's had executive experience, and that's what it takes to be a capable person here in Washington, D.C., in the executive branch,&quot; he said in a Fox News interview to be shown today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Rome, Vice President Dick Cheney also sought to deflect Democratic criticism that Ms. Palin, a former small-town mayor with less than two years in the governor's office, lacks the gravity to be vice president. &quot;Each administration is different,&quot; he said. &quot;And there's no reason why Sarah Palin can't be a successful vice president in a McCain administration.&quot; He said her convention speech was superb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In attacking Mr. Obama yesterday, Mr. McCain said the Illinois senator's earmark total over the years amounts to &quot;almost a million dollars for every single day he was in the United States Senate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Mr. McCain doesn't seek pork projects and vows to do away with them as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While speaking to voters in Indiana over the weekend, Mr. Obama ridiculed the idea of Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin presenting themselves as reformers, and suggested that Ms. Palin was distorting her own record on earmarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know the governor of Alaska has been saying she's change, and that's great,&quot; Mr. Obama said Saturday. &quot;She's a skillful politician. But, you know, when you've been taking all these earmarks when it's convenient, and then suddenly you're the champion anti-earmark person, that's not change. Come on! I mean, words mean something; you can't just make stuff up.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSNBC said Sunday it is replacing Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews as co-anchors of political night coverage with David Gregory, and will use the two newsmen as commentators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change reflects tensions between the freewheeling, opinionated MSNBC and the impartial newsgatherers at NBC News. Throughout the primaries and summer, MSNBC argued that Olbermann and Matthews could serve as dispassionate anchors on political news nights and that viewers would accept them in that role, but things fell apart during the conventions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gregory, the veteran Washington hand, will anchor MSNBC's coverage of the presidential and vice presidential debates and election night, said Jeremy Gaines, network spokesman. The change was first reported by The New York Times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tipping point appears to have come during the Republican convention when Olbermann, after the network aired a Sept. 11-themed video prepared by the Republicans, said that MSNBC should not have shown it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSNBC executives, who had publicly defended their anchors' roles while privately monitoring it throughout the political season, made the change over the weekend after discussions with Olbermann. Despite the controversy around him, Olbermann has been a hero with left-leaning viewers and keyed MSNBC's growth among coveted young viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During her acceptance speech last week, Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin talked about the &quot;Washington elite&quot; not accepting her qualifications for the job. Some delegates on the convention floor began chanting, &quot;N-B-C, N-B-C.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olbermann began to have difficulty keeping his opinions in check, or simply stopped trying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He sarcastically dismissed GOP pundit Pat Buchanan on the air after Buchanan said the GOP had been enlivened by the entrance of a conservative Republican. Perhaps most embarrassing, Joe Scarborough was discussing positive developments in John McCain's campaign at one point when Olbermann was heard on an offstage microphone saying: &quot;Jesus, Joe, why don't you get a shovel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scarborough, a former Republican congressman and host of MSNBC's &quot;Morning Joe,&quot; got in another nasty on-air exchange with MSNBC reporter David Shuster, and Matthews snapped at Olbermann on-air when it appeared Olbermann was criticizing him for talking too much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the drama made MSNBC a punch line when top NBC anchor Brian Williams appeared on Comedy Central's &quot;The Daily Show&quot; last week. &quot;Is there no control?&quot; Stewart asked him. &quot;Is it 'Lord of the Flies?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sheepish Williams said that every family has a dynamic of its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But does MSNBC have to be the Lohans?&quot; Stewart said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RATINGS UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a television draw, John McCain was every bit the equal of Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP presidential candidate attracted roughly the same number of viewers to his convention acceptance speech Thursday as Obama did before the Democrats last week, according to Nielsen Media Research. Last week's ratings, with an average of 34.5 million viewers watching the GOP convention over three days, proved people are becoming more interested in what the Republicans have to say. The Democrats had an average audience of 30.2 million over four days, Nielsen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nielsen said that 38.9 million people watched McCain accept the GOP nomination Thursday on either ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel or MSNBC. PBS, which has a more imprecise estimate based on samples in a few big cities, said 3.5 million watched on its network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Obama's speech in Denver was seen by 38.4 million on 10 different commercial networks, and an additional 4 million on PBS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Add it up, and that's McCain, 42.4 million, to Obama, 42.4 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one can really tell who truly had the biggest audience, because C-SPAN also showed the speeches, and Nielsen doesn't measure the cable channel's viewers. But if the presidential vote is this close on Nov. 4, it will be a long night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain may have caught a break Thursday when the opening NFL game between the New York Giants and Washington Redskins finished a couple of minutes before the Republican took the stage, Wallace said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More men (17.9 million) watched McCain speak than watched Obama (16.2 million), Nielsen said. The numbers put to rest the thought that politics has been a turnoff and death for ratings, which has long been gospel at the TV networks, Rosenstiel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That has particularly applied to convention coverage, which broadcast networks have backed away from over the years because executives saw them as stage-managed events. ABC, CBS and NBC each added an hour this year to convention coverage, but it didn't halt one trend: Viewers are just as likely to watch the conventions on cable news networks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the time, you hear remarks about our law enforcement that are nasty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on the evening of Aug. 28, when Regional Police searched a very questionable house in Marietta, the officers were very thorough in their investigation, plus they allowed three small children and one handicapped child to leave with their grandmother before they cuffed the mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This shows compassion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marietta has an excellent police force. We thank you for protecting our small but quiet town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joan Parsons,Marietta</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This letter is in response to your editorial of Friday, Aug. 29, on the subject of the proposed &quot;entrepreneurship ombudsman.&quot; I'd like to thank you for bringing this important action to the public's attention, because I'm all for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a budding technology-based community growing in our midst. There are at least nine such companies at the Burle Industrial Park and perhaps an equal number in downtown Lancaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The companies at Burle tend to be &quot;hardware&quot; companies; those downtown tend to be &quot;software&quot; companies. All told, these companies have around 100 employees. Several are growing and actively hiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to build a structure to encourage the formation of new companies of this type, since they represent new opportunities that will help to continue the county's growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, Lancaster has a variety of government and private services available to entrepreneurs. The ombudsman's job is to connect them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is this needed? Very few entrepreneurs start a company with all the necessary skills and experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the technology field, nearly 100 percent of start-up companies bring strong technology knowledge to the party. That's something that can usually be counted upon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, most of the entrepreneurs come from large companies, where the other functions, including sales and marketing and legal affairs, are not within their experience base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They don't know where or how to find the help they need. They need help finding reliable advice and mentoring. That's where the &quot;entrepreneurship ombudsman&quot; comes in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As you point out, Lancaster County is well endowed with people and organizations that can help. (I'd like to point out that the Lancaster Library, the Lancaster Angel Network and our area venture capital people should be included in your list.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem, which is well recognized within the entrepreneurial community, and at the state level as well, is that Lancaster County has no designated place to go for the information. It's available, small piece by small piece, from many sources and at many locations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed ombudsman is not a substitute for, and will not be allowed to become, a competitor for any of the organizations you mention in your editorial.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All Marietta residents should attend the borough council meeting on Tuesday at 7 p.m., when council members are expected to vote on the proposed borough-levee system. The council chambers are at 113 E. Market St.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 100 people saw a presentation on this two-mile-long &quot;Marietta Smaller Levee System,&quot; given by engineers from the state Department of Environmental Protection in July. The public has had two months for input.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now there are concerns that council will vote no on the levee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One excuse is that Marietta residents can't afford the small bond required to maintain the system, even though the levee would be constructed and paid with state and federal funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another excuse is that the Harrisburg engineers have canceled the project, regardless whether Marietta Borough citizens want it or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of a bond issue would be more than offset by the savings on the present high cost of flood insurance, with a properly designed levee system, and Marietta residents' lives and properties would be much safer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global warming and climate change are serious issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a special meeting in Geneva, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change discussed a July report on the relation of global warming and water levels. The report can be found at www.ipcc.ch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nationally recognized insurance company is sending letters to home owners throughout Lancaster County about flood insurance, even though they may not be near any rivers or creeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It includes this statement: &quot;Many people assume that their homeowner's or other personal property insurance policy would cover these types of losses when, in fact, a homeowners or other personal-property policy does not cover damage caused by flooding.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Obama's early commercials, he kept calling the White House his house. Now he has one on the seven houses that McCain supposedly has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My question is, how does one go about searching the deed to the White House and see who really owns it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Obama does, how much does he make renting out all the offices that are in the White House?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the time, you hear remarks about our law enforcement that are nasty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on the evening of Aug. 28, when Regional Police searched a very questionable house in Marietta, the officers were very thorough in their investigation, plus they allowed three small children and one handicapped child to leave with their grandmother before they cuffed the mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This shows compassion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marietta has an excellent police force. We thank you for protecting our small but quiet town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joan Parsons,Marietta</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This letter is in response to your editorial of Friday, Aug. 29, on the subject of the proposed &quot;entrepreneurship ombudsman.&quot; I'd like to thank you for bringing this important action to the public's attention, because I'm all for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a budding technology-based community growing in our midst. There are at least nine such companies at the Burle Industrial Park and perhaps an equal number in downtown Lancaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The companies at Burle tend to be &quot;hardware&quot; companies; those downtown tend to be &quot;software&quot; companies. All told, these companies have around 100 employees. Several are growing and actively hiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to build a structure to encourage the formation of new companies of this type, since they represent new opportunities that will help to continue the county's growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, Lancaster has a variety of government and private services available to entrepreneurs. The ombudsman's job is to connect them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is this needed? Very few entrepreneurs start a company with all the necessary skills and experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the technology field, nearly 100 percent of start-up companies bring strong technology knowledge to the party. That's something that can usually be counted upon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, most of the entrepreneurs come from large companies, where the other functions, including sales and marketing and legal affairs, are not within their experience base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They don't know where or how to find the help they need. They need help finding reliable advice and mentoring. That's where the &quot;entrepreneurship ombudsman&quot; comes in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As you point out, Lancaster County is well endowed with people and organizations that can help. (I'd like to point out that the Lancaster Library, the Lancaster Angel Network and our area venture capital people should be included in your list.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem, which is well recognized within the entrepreneurial community, and at the state level as well, is that Lancaster County has no designated place to go for the information. It's available, small piece by small piece, from many sources and at many locations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed ombudsman is not a substitute for, and will not be allowed to become, a competitor for any of the organizations you mention in your editorial. The intent is to avoid competition and duplication entirely, while pointing the entrepreneur in the right direction so he can get the needed answers quickly, skillfully and at no or minimum cost - from the existing sources.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Carolyn Davis; Inquirer Staff Writer</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATIONAL; P-com News for PC Home Page; Pg. A01</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1048 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States won't be electing a Madame President this year. But if there's one thing this campaign season has made especially vivid, it's this:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American women don't speak with a single political voice, not even to each other. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly, any monolithic notion of the &quot;woman voter&quot; has been cracked wide open.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a huge thing,&quot; says former Rep. Pat Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat who ran for president in 1988. &quot;People keep thinking they are of one ilk, but they really all have been very diverse.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many quarters, the political discussion among women has now moved beyond old labels and lingo. &quot;Even women who profess not to be feminists and part of the movement also feel it's time for women to have their say and be on the center stage. That's a huge gain,&quot; Schroeder says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Connecticut Gov. M. Jodi Rell, a Republican, says women are getting to see both sides in this election. &quot;They get the femininity, and they get the hard and challenging, capable women.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days, a lot of Republican women are ecstatic over Sen. John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin, a deeply conservative mother of five, as his running mate. Some critics say Palin's position on abortion, for example - she opposes it even in cases of rape or incest - is extreme, though these beliefs appeal to many GOP faithful. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is the supremely confident first-term governor of Alaska and former co-owner of a commercial fishing operation. Michelle Obama, wife of Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, is an accomplished Chicago hospital administrator with a bachelor's from Princeton and a law degree from Harvard. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's wife, Cindy, is a global humanitarian whose family's beer-distribution business made her a multimillionaire. Jill Biden, a community college professor and wife of Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic vice presidential candidate, has a doctorate in education and two master's degrees. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each woman is successful in her own right - and, in McCain's case, wealthier than her spouse.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early on in the Democratic primary season, some of Michelle Obama's remarks on the campaign trail highlighted differences between African American and white women as they split their support between her husband and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the campaign has exposed a divide between black and white women and feminists,&quot; says Shirley Staples Carter, a University of South Carolina professor who focuses on multicultural communications.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think people in general have a problem with Michelle Obama because of the perception she's outspoken and very well-educated,&quot; says Carter. &quot;It's curious to me that those attributes that we celebrate in Sen. Clinton aren't also celebrated in Michelle Obama and black women in general. When we are strong and confident, we're seen as aggressive and menacing.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research has shown that white feminists are most concerned with &quot;elevating the cause of women per se,&quot; she adds, &quot;whereas with African American women, it's not just about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">our</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> liberation, but also the liberation of African American males.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditional feminists &quot;don't know what to do about black women,&quot; says Anita L. Allen, a University of Pennsylvania law professor specializing in race and race relations. &quot;My concern is that feminists might not notice that some of the things said about Michelle Obama are sexist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">and</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> racist.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, one big debate was whether it was appropriate for Palin to have her baby son, Trig, who has Down syndrome, on stage Wednesday night at the Republican National Convention.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative women have defended Palin, blaming reporters for questions about whether her candidacy renders her a neglectful mother. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christie Whitman, former Republican governor of New Jersey, says it's clear women are held to a different standard than men when children are involved. Joe Biden wasn't grilled about raising his sons after the car accident that killed his first wife and daughter, Whitman says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly, that's still there,&quot; she says. &quot;It's still relevant there's a double standard. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've always found women are harder on other women than they are on their male counterparts,&quot; Whitman says. &quot;I've never bought into the theory that they brought Palin onto the ticket to get the disaffected Hillary Clinton voters.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Palin has electrified the GOP base, and represents this election year's only remaining chance for women to break through the executive-branch glass ceiling - despite the 18 million cracks Clinton likes to say she and supporters inflicted upon it - not all women are rallying around her. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's always satisfaction when a woman goes where no woman has gone before,&quot; says Kim Gandy, president of the liberal National Organization for Women. &quot;But it would unfortunately be bad for the country. It would be a hollow satisfaction. . . . Her policies would injure more women than her example would benefit.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wendy Wright, president of the conservative, biblical-based Concerned Women for America, sees Palin as the same kind of trailblazer Democrats see in Clinton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah Palin has really moved the bar. She has expanded the universe,&quot; Wright says. &quot;It's very bad to see the old guard in the feminist movement being so critical of Sarah Palin.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Star Parker, president of the conservative Coalition on Urban Renewal and Education, says she feels zero kinship toward Michelle Obama, even though both are African American. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The women's movement or politics is similar to race politics. Unless it's liberal, it's not legitimate,&quot; Parker says mockingly. &quot;But the uniqueness of womanhood and diversity of thought has always been there. . . . Now we see through Gov. Palin that the diversity is there. Now we can get to discussions important to all of us. Not just equal pay.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter the party or perspective, this could turn out to be the biggest political year for women since 1992, when 24 were newly elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and four to the Senate, says Robert P. Watson, director of American studies at Florida's Lynn University. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should Palin become vice president, &quot;it sends a very powerful image,&quot; Watson says. &quot;I don't think we can begin to imagine how utterly empowering that would be for a generation of young women today.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">595 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WITH THE conventions in our rear-view mirror (objects are smaller than they appear), the presidential campaigns shift into high gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama hires two staffers to clarify what he meant in his last remarks and John McCain hands Sarah Palin an over-and-under shotgun to guard his Straight Talk Express, now parked on the Mexico/Arizona border for immigrants to use as a comfort stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates are ready for us, but are we ready for them? Over the last four decades, only 54 percent of eligible Americans bothered to vote for president. Appeals to party, patriotism and virtue worked as well as Jell-O handcuffs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, it </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">might</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> be different. Obama appeals to callow, never-before voters, while McCain delights hardened-artery, Social Security seniors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But listen to the Typical American:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most elections, I don't vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I do, it's because I've been goosed by TV commercials, where I get my political opinions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The BEST information I get from blogs and anonymous e-mails. That's how I know the North Vietnamese gave John McCain prostitutes when he was a POW. He didn't take early release because he was having too many seaweed wraps and too much sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From e-mails I learned Barack HUSSEIN Obama is a secret Muslim, trained in a madrassa when he lived in Microsoftnesia, or someplace like that. I don't know what a madrassa is, but it sounds scary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MoveOn.org says McCain would keep U.S. troops fighting in Iran or Iraq (I forget which) for 100 years. That will make them the oldest soldiers in the world. They'd be riding Rascal scooters instead of Humvees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I do bother to vote, I don't know the issues, just one or two that grab my gut. I get my political news from Rush Limbaugh and Jon Stewart. They're super-smart and they care about me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I actually step into a voting booth - Wow! They're electronic now; hope I push the right button, not like some Florida Jews. When I don't know the candidates, I vote for those with my ethnic background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bond Issues and Questions, I ignore. They don't affect me. Do they?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only one Rush talks about is gay marriage, which attacks the institution of marriage, he says. Who knows better than a man with three failed marriages? Stewart likes gay marriage. Because he's gay! At least he looks gay. But it's OK. You can be as gay as a pink squirrel if</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">you're funny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I rarely watch election shows on cable TV, where they have political consultants from past campaigns talk about current candidates. Cable gets them because even a maggot has more dignity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Will James Carville ever say anything nasty about a Democrat (unless it's a Democrat running against Hillary or Bill)? Bob Shrum has been losing elections for Democrats since George McGovern in '72. Conservative Cal Thomas looks like a mortician's practice mannequin. Sean Hannity calls Karl Rove 'the Architect.' Rove got Bush elected, but wrecked the Republican Party. You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pat Buchanan, is he a Republican? Is he an earthling? Instead of an American flag, he wears an Iron Cross on his lapel. Dick Morris is a gas. He hates Hillary, even though he used to strategize for Bill. Then he got caught with a hooker. Dick, I mean. Bill got caught with an intern. And a hillbilly. And a lounge singer. And Barbra Streisand, the blogs say. And if it's on the Internet, you know it's true. Like Palin's infant is really her grandson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race is on. Don't read &quot;old media&quot; newspapers. Tune to Rush and Jon for truthiness. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. PAUL, Minn. - Republicans declared a renewal of hostilities in the culture wars during their national convention last week, with speakers stoking the conservative base to build enthusiasm for presidential nominee John McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, for instance, sneered he was &quot;sorry&quot; that a small Alaska town was not &quot;flashy enough or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">cosmopolitan </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">enough&quot; for Democratic nominee Barack Obama. We are lucky, Giuliani said, that real Americans from small towns pick the president, instead of &quot;Hollywood celebrities.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney, a former Republican governor of Massachusetts with two Ivy League graduate degrees, decried the &quot;Eastern elites&quot; who control the media.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St. Paul gathering was kinder and gentler than the famously bellicose 1992 GOP convention in Houston, remembered for Patrick Buchanan's summons to &quot;cultural war.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But coming from the podium in Minnesota was an unmistakable us-vs.-them theme, with speakers citing Obama, the Democrats and the news media as the forces threatening the values of an idealized small-town America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right rallied around Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the former mayor of tiny Wasilla, who was chosen as McCain's running mate and came under immediate fire in the media. The pick also brought the abortion issue to the fore. A Christian conservative, Palin has become a hero to many evangelicals because she had a baby with Down syndrome four months ago, choosing not to have an abortion although in-utero testing had confirmed the condition. Gun owners love her because she is a hunter and outdoorswoman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, though he has a strong voting record against abortion rights, seldom likes to talk about social issues or his religious faith, and he has urged the GOP to tone down the abortion talk in the past. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new post-Palin nod to the right also contrasted with the 2000 and 2004 Republican conventions, when social issues were rarely mentioned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the conservatives . . . evangelicals, they have got somebody to go out and work for, to root for, to help,&quot; Buchanan said Wednesday on MSNBC. &quot;I think you've really got almost an even race in terms of enthusiasm, energy and fire.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Palin was named, the Obama campaign began running an ad in several states blasting McCain as an enemy of abortion rights. It has also deployed prominent Democratic women on the campaign trail and in TV studios in recent days to counter the GOP's new star. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I think John McCain has done very clearly is to definitely change to embrace the very radical wing of his party on social issues,&quot; Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, a Democrat, said Friday on CNN. &quot;A lot of Republicans and moderates I know here . . . find it very troubling.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson drew an ovation at the convention when he took a shot at Obama's support of abortion rights. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said McCain would be a president who &quot;doesn't think that the protection of the unborn or a newly born baby is 'above his pay grade.' &quot; It was a reference to Obama's answer to a question about when life begins during a forum last month at the Saddleback evangelical church. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Obama presidency, Thompson continued, would mean a Supreme Court &quot;lost to liberalism for the next generation.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It makes strategic sense for the Republicans to energize social conservatives because the party is facing a hostile political environment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP remains tied in the public mind to a president with a near-record-low approval rating; an optional and unpopular war in Iraq, albeit a conflict that has shown recent signs of progress; and economic anxieties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disdain for perceived elitism has a long history in populist movements in both parties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Republicans, it has been an effective wedge in modern elections. President George H.W. Bush's common-man fondness for pork rinds, horseshoes and powerboats, for instance, was hyped as a contrast with the buttoned-down technocrat Michael Dukakis in 1988. Four years ago, the GOP mocked Democrat John F. Kerry's windsurfing, his $5,000 Italian bicycle, and his sometimes-ponderous manner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton showed the effectiveness of the argument against Obama in the late Democratic primaries, rolling up big margins among working-class voters without college educations while portraying him as pedantic and out of touch with real life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans worked the elitism angle heavily at the convention, with more than a few mentions of Obama's off-the-cuff comments at a San Francisco fund-raiser that he believed small-town Pennsylvanians &quot;cling to guns or religion&quot; because of their economic anxiety. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was no accident that the rollout of Palin focused on her ability to hunt and field-dress an elk, her fondness for mooseburgers, and her husband's success in snowmobile racing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had the privilege of living most of my life in a small town,&quot; Palin said. &quot;I might add that in small towns . . . we tend to prefer candidates who don't talk about us one way in Scranton and another way in San Francisco.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the presidential campaign trail, John McCain shies away from pious prose. He is a man for whom the terms &quot;public declaration&quot; and &quot;faith&quot; do not go together, the product of an Episcopalian upbringing who treats religion as a private matter. Yet Mr. McCain identifies himself as a Southern Baptist. And he is not averse to invoking that label when stumping in the Bible Belt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why hasn't the 72-year-old Republican taken the Baptist plunge? Why after attending the North Phoenix Baptist Church for more than 15 years has he yet to be baptized by immersion? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some Christians, Mr. McCain's disclosure last spring that his wife, Cindy, had been baptized but he had not raised questions about the candidate's sincerity. But it was in keeping with Mr. McCain's circuitous journey of faith -- a path that has become something of an obstacle course for wooing the religious conservatives who are an important part of the Republican base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one thing, Mr. McCain's support for embryonic stem-cell research troubles some conservative Christians. They fear that the foundation of his stance against abortion could shift as well. Others question his use of the Baptist label, arguing that by avoiding baptism he has avoided the most sincere public declaration of the Baptist faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there is the acerbic tone Mr. McCain sometimes uses in speaking of religious faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a problem for him in many ways,&quot; said Jim Guth, a political science professor at Furman University in South Carolina who has studied religion and American politics for nearly 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. McCain seems to be sort of tone-deaf to evangelical language,&quot; Mr. Guth said. &quot;One would think he would have a better understanding of that tradition. He very consistently doesn't seem to have an ear for the kind of rhetoric that someone appealing for an evangelical constituency would use.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes Mr. McCain's silence and sarcasm are taken as insensitivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A McCain Web ad featured Mr. Obama as a self-proclaimed messiah. Obama supporters called it an attack ad that equated Mr. Obama with the Antichrist. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Mr. McCain scoffed at critics of that ad, suggesting they &quot;relax, enjoy life and have a sense of humor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps that was his thought when a journalist covering the 2000 campaign asked McCain to recall his favorite Bible verse. When the senator came up with nothing, the reporter suggested John 3:16 -- &quot;For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.&quot; This oft-quoted verse in the New Testament has been called the &quot;Gospel in the nutshell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is that the one about the end of the world?&quot; Mr. McCain quipped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Guth said evangelical Christians would be hard-pressed to find that funny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission, said if he advised Mr. McCain -- and he hasn't -- he would tell him to stay &quot;in his comfort zone.&quot; Anything else will sound contrived and calculated. He also said Mr. McCain's faith doesn't matter as long as he remains a steadfast foe of abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Randall Balmer, author of &quot;God in the White House,&quot; contends that Mr. McCain's comfort zone might be hard to define, given the Arizona senator's struggle to define his own faith. Though Mr. McCain calls North Phoenix Baptist his spiritual home, his profiles in political almanacs, regularly updated by his press office, continue to list him as an Episcopalian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to baptism by immersion in a recent interview, Mr. McCain said, &quot;Oh, it's just something I'll be able to work out with Pastor [Dan] Yeary,&quot; referring to his minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Balmer said that &quot;to be unsure of his own religious moorings makes it difficult to make a persuasive case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I suspect it's a dual identity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is no such thing as a dual identity when it comes to being a Baptist. You either are or you aren't. And without immersing yourself in baptismal waters, you should not claim to be, Mr. Balmer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For McCain to say blithely 'I'm a Baptist' suggests he doesn't fully understand what is entailed,&quot; Mr. Balmer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does this matter? Many would argue it doesn't. There is no religious test for public office, nor should there be. But the reality is that many American voters look to religious identity as a barometer for moral character.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, said evangelicals want to hear that Christ is at the center of Mr. McCain's life and that the senator upholds a biblical worldview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's important to know how a candidate tells his story, how he connects the dots in terms of different policy positions,&quot; the Rev. Mohler said. &quot;McCain has good positions on so many of the crucial issues of the day. I'd like to push him on some of those issues&quot; and figure out how much theology drives his decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He hasn't provided evangelicals the signals that would give him a great deal of traction with the evangelical electorate,&quot; the Rev. Mohler added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Dick Stafford, an associate pastor at North Phoenix Baptist, emphasized that the choice to be baptized is a personal decision. He does not question the depth of anyone's faith if he is not ready to be baptized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Baptism is important because of the word 'membership,' &quot; the Rev. Stafford said. &quot;But we treat every person who drives onto our campus equally because we don't know where they are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain said he came to North Phoenix Baptist because pastors there offered a message of spiritual redemption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The message was more in tune with what I was seeking in the way of spiritual assistance and guidance,&quot; Mr. McCain told the Tribune. &quot;All of us are human. None of us is without sin or failings. The key to it is to try to move forward and be better and do better.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You arrogant ass. You've killed us!&quot; So said the executive officer of a Soviet submarine to his captain in Tom Clancy's novel &quot;Red October&quot; after the captain had recklessly fired a torpedo that homed in on his own sub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC's David Gregory must have had similar thoughts as he noted, ruefully, that the news media's assault on Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin boosted substantially the television audience for her acceptance speech Wednesday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No friend of Barack Obama -- and the last week has demonstrated he has no better, nor more unscrupulous, friends than those in the news media -- can be happy about that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists last week cast aside the mask of objectivity to reveal they are so deeply in the tank for Mr. Obama most have grown gills. For six days, Sarah Palin and her family were subjected to a relentless barrage of innuendo. Journalists were trying to &quot;define&quot; her before she had an opportunity to introduce herself to the people in the lower 48. She was portrayed as an ignorant redneck from a hick town who should be home caring for her children instead of running for high public office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Sarah Palin got her opportunity to speak, and her enemies learned firsthand why her nickname is &quot;Sarah Barracuda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dismiss if you will the rapturous response to Ms. Palin's speech by the delegates in the convention hall and the posters on conservative blogs. The best testament to its power was the lame response of the Obama campaign. They noted she had the help of a speechwriter (the very talented Matt Scully) in preparing her remarks. Well, duh. Every major political figure has speechwriters. Sarah Palin works fine without a script. It's Barack Obama who ums and ahs without a teleprompter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my lifetime, I've only heard three or four speeches (all by Ronald Reagan) that I thought were as good or better than Sarah Palin's. She's as much a natural in politics as Michael Jordan was in basketball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several moderate Democrat friends of mine have been e-mailing -- few if any would ever vote for McCain -- but all agree Palin was very strong,&quot; Michael Crowley wrote on The New Republic's blog. &quot;The more liberal among them are a little panicked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With good reason. With a smile on her face, Ms. Palin sliced and diced Barack Obama with the skill she dresses a moose she just shot. There were a host of good lines which I'm sure we'll see in McCain&nbsp;commercials in the near future. But ultimately the most effective may be this one: &quot;In small towns, we don't know quite what to make of a candidate who lavishes praise on working people when they are listening, and then talks about how bitterly they cling to their religion and guns when those people aren't listening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What gives this line its power is that Sarah Palin is definitely part of the &quot;we&quot; -- the small town, blue-collar Americans who will decide this election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only once in modern times has a vice presidential candidate swung an election. Lyndon Johnson brought Texas and Alabama to John F. Kennedy in 1960, states that otherwise would have been suspicious of a Catholic liberal from New England. I think Sarah Palin will be the second. She has changed the nature of this race in ways ominous for Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, this race is no longer between a candidate who advocates change and the status quo, as Democrats would like to frame it. It's between two different visions of change, and between a ticket that's actually delivered reform, and a ticket that just talks about it. The argument that John McCain represents a third term for George W. Bush was strained to start with. It's ludicrous now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, the Republican base is more fired up, and the party more united than it's been since Ronald Reagan ran for his second term. Conservatives see in Sarah Palin Ronald Reagan in a dress, the brains and backbone of Margaret Thatcher in a younger, prettier package. The Grand Old Party has a bright new face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama owes much of his new troubles to his friends in the news media. Republicans -- and independent and Democratic women appalled by their sexism -- were enraged by the vicious assaults on Sarah Palin and her family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After he learned his fleet had attacked Pearl Harbor before a formal declaration of war, Japanese Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto is reputed to have said: &quot;I fear all we have done is awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vice presidential debate is Oct. 2. If I were Joe Biden, I would be very, very afraid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fresh from the Republican convention, Sen. John McCain's campaign sees evidence that his choice of Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate is energizing conservatives in the battleground of Ohio while improving its chances in Pennsylvania and several Western states that Sen. Barack Obama has been counting on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign intends to focus heavily on the economy, especially in light of the mounting job losses, and to keep up the effort to tie the McCain-Palin ticket to the policies of President Bush. It is banking on holding all the states Sen. John F. Kerry won in 2004 and picking up the additional electoral votes it needs by flipping some combination of Ohio, Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa and Virginia into the Democratic column. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a little more than eight weeks left until Election Day, the two sides are settling into an unusually broad set of state-by-state face-offs, with new advertisements, increased focus on turning out their supporters and tough decisions looming about where to invest time and money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides to Mr. Obama said they were preparing new advertisements tailored to issues important in specific states, like ones about the auto industry in Michigan and nuclear waste in Nevada, even as the Democrats pull back ads in Georgia, a reliably Republican state Mr. Obama had sought to put in play by investing heavily in registering new Democratic voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strategists say Mr. McCain can now count on a more motivated social conservative base to help him in areas like southern Ohio, where the 2004 race was settled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While fortified turnout from this base is probably not enough to ensure victory for Mr. McCain, strategists said, it would be very difficult for him to win without it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that sense, Ms. Palin's presence on the ticket -- if her candidacy holds up under the scrutiny it is receiving -- could be vital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some campaign officials hope that Ms. Palin, an Alaskan, can broaden the ticket's appeal in the Northwest, possibly gaining traction in states like Oregon and Washington, as well as shore up Mr. McCain's standing with social conservatives who, up to now, had been lukewarm at best about his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thursday morning our phones started ringing about how do we get involved, where are the phone banks, where is the literature to distribute,&quot; said Mike Gonidakis, executive director of Ohio Right to Life, explaining that many people had been motivated by Ms. Palin's convention speech Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's amazing to see the attitude and enthusiasm -- especially compared with what it was about 10 days ago,&quot; said Mr. Gonidakis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, said his team was not concerned that independent voters and undecided women might be drawn to Ms. Palin, and that the Obama camp did not plan to run hard against her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the post-convention dust settles, we believe a lot of the battleground states will be close, and that this will remain a race between John McCain and Barack Obama,&quot; Mr. Plouffe said. &quot;She'll be out there promoting John McCain's economic message, which is fine by us because it is so bad for middle-class voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet several Republican leaders, both moderates and conservatives, said they were comfortable with the economic message of the McCain-Palin ticket. The Republican ticket is asserting in its advertising and campaigning that electing Mr. Obama would mean higher taxes and policies too liberal for most voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even in the face of job losses and the mortgage crisis, the core Republican message is still appealing: No higher taxes, get government off your back, cut regulations and make us more competitive,&quot; said California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While McCain aides once believed that his appeal to independents might help him win a traditional Democratic state like New Jersey, and Obama aides thought their candidate's broad appeal could be a lift in traditionally Republican ones like Montana, the emerging battlegrounds picked by both campaigns so far resemble the Bush-Kerry electoral map in 2004 and the Bush-Gore map in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Democrats believe that they will still have the advantage, thinking that Mr. Bush's unpopularity, economic discontent and lingering anger over the Iraq war will make it hard for Republicans to carry all the Bush states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans are hoping that positioning Mr. McCain as a maverick for the final two months, even after he courted the right with his pick of Ms. Palin, could help them hold the Bush states and win some like New Hampshire, which Mr. Bush lost in 2004 but where Mr. McCain is popular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one indication of how Mr. McCain defines the battleground and the message he will emphasize to counter the Democratic strategy, the Republican National Committee recently bought television time in 14 states -- including five that Mr. Kerry won last time around -- for an advertisement calling Mr. Obama and congressional Democrats &quot;ready to tax, ready to spend, but not ready to lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That advertisement will be shown in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Missouri, North Carolina, New Mexico, Nevada, Ohio and Virginia -- all Republican states in 2004 that Mr. Obama is contesting aggressively this time -- and Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Democratic states four years ago that Mr. McCain is trying to win over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama chose not to participate in the public financing system for presidential campaigns, freeing him from limits on how much he can spend in particular states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One indication of the Obama campaign's priorities can be found in a breakdown of how it is distributing large donations to a special fundraising account it has set up for state parties. The breakdown, provided by an Obama fundraiser, shows the campaign funneling money to traditional battlegrounds like Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, but also allocating substantial sums to normally solid Republican states like North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama aides, while recently pulling back commercials in Georgia, are mulling new ads in other states that Mr. Bush carried, like Arizona and West Virginia, where the poor economy could help them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides are intensifying their efforts in a less visible but potentially more important aspect of presidential politics: identifying their likely supporters, household by household, and ensuring that they show up to vote on Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has long been seen as having had a head start in that area, drawing in particular on his campaign's vast army of volunteers for the grunt work of making phone calls, knocking on doors and distributing literature. The campaign has seven offices in Allegheny County alone and has teams devoted to turning out the estimated 600,000 black residents of Florida who were registered in 2004 but did not vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign, after a slow start, is increasing its efforts as well, building on the sophisticated voter-targeting operation built for Bush four years ago.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's planned takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, expected to be announced as early as this weekend, came together hurriedly after advisers poring over the companies' books for the Treasury Department concluded that Freddie's accounting methods had overstated its capital cushion, according to regulatory officials briefed on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal to place both mortgage giants, which own or back $5.3 trillion in mortgages, into a government-run conservatorship also grew out of deep concern among foreign investors that the companies' debt might not be repaid. Falling home prices, which are expected to lead to more defaults among the mortgages held or guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie, contributed to the urgency, regulators said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The details of the deal have not fully emerged, but it appears that investors who own the companies' common stock will be virtually wiped out; preferred shareholders, who have priority over other shareholders, may also end up with little. Holders of debt, including many foreign central banks, are expected to receive government backing. Top executives of both companies will be pushed out, according to those briefed on the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it is not yet possible to calculate the cost of the government's intervention, it could rise into tens of billions of dollars and will probably be among the most expensive rescues ever financed by taxpayers. The takeover comes on the heels of a rescue of the investment bank Bear Stearns, which was sold to JPMorgan Chase in a deal backed by taxpayer dollars. Already, the housing crisis has cost investors and consumers hundreds of billions of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both presidential nominees expressed support for the government's plans to take over the companies as necessary. Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., said as he campaigned in Indiana that not acting could place the housing market in further distress. &quot;These entities are so big and they are so tied into the housing market that it is probably true that we have to take steps to make sure they don't just collapse,&quot; Mr. Obama told an audience in Terre Haute yesterday. But he added that the government needed to take steps to guard against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ultimately profiting from the government assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has long been critical of the mortgage finance giants. His running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, spoke out from a rally in Colorado Springs. &quot;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they've gotten too big and too expensive to the taxpayers,&quot; Ms. Palin said. &quot;The McCain-Palin administration will make them smaller and smarter and more effective for homeowners who need help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big question now is whether the federal government's move to take over Fannie and Freddie will restore investor confidence in the nation's credit markets, help stabilize the stock market and keep loans flowing to creditworthy borrowers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fannie and Freddie, by buying mortgages, provide banks and other financial institutions with fresh money to make new loans, a vital lubricant for the housing and credit markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the government's intervention, the cost of borrowing for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should decline, because the government will be insuring their debts. Equally important, because the government is backing the companies, they will continue to buy and sell home loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the plan will probably do little to stop home prices from falling further. And foreclosures are almost certain to rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just a week ago, Treasury officials were still considering a wide variety of options for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, ranging from doing nothing to taking over the companies completely, according to people with knowledge of those discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., who won authority from Congress last month to use taxpayer money to bolster the companies, always maintained that he hoped never to use that power. But, as the companies' stocks continued to languish and their borrowing costs rose, some within the Treasury Department began urging Paulson to intervene quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, last week, advisers from Morgan Stanley hired by the Treasury Department to scrutinize the companies came to a troubling conclusion: Freddie Mac's capital position was worse than initially imagined, according to people briefed on those findings. The company had made decisions that, while not necessarily in violation of accounting rules, had the effect of overstating the company's capital resources and financial stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, one person briefed on the company's finances said Freddie Mac had made accounting decisions that pushed losses into the future and postponed a capital shortfall until the fourth quarter of this year, which would not need to be disclosed until early 2009. Fannie Mae has used similar methods, but to a lesser degree, according to other people who have been briefed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of both companies did not return calls or declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both companies have the option of challenging the conservatorship and asking for a judicial review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accusations of questionable accounting are not new for either company. Earlier this decade, both companies paid large fines and ousted their top executives after accounting scandals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freddie Mac's current chief executive and chairman, Richard F. Syron, joined the company in 2003 after the former managers revealed they had manipulated earnings by almost $5 billion. The following year Fannie Mae's chief executive, Daniel H. Mudd, was promoted to the top spot after that company was accused of accounting errors totaling $6.3 billion. People familiar with Treasury's plan say that both men, as well as other executives, will be forced to leave the companies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's unemployment rate hit a five-year high of 6.1 percent last month, causing economists to worry that the struggling economy is unlikely to rebound any time soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Labor Department's report, released yesterday, showed that in August employers slashed 84,000 jobs as the jobless rate climbed from 5.7 percent in July. It was the eighth month in a row that employers cut payrolls. The economy lost 100,000 jobs in June and another 60,000 in July, according to revised figures. Previously, the government reported job losses at 51,000 in each of those months. So far this year, job losses totaled 605,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest snapshot was worse than economists were forecasting. They were predicting payrolls would drop by around 75,000 in August and the jobless rate would tick up a notch, to 5.8 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The magnitude of the job losses, 84,000 jobs, is not terrible, but it does continue a very weak pattern,&quot; said Robert Dye, senior economist with PNC Financial Services Group. &quot;The depth of the job losses are not what you would expect in a deep, hard recession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it is the persistence of the job losses and the fact that they are across the board in many industries that is troubling. He said it's not just manufacturing and construction that are affected, as they often are in economic downturns, but this time the job losses are spilling into leisure and hospitality industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grim news comes as the race for the White House kicks into high gear. The economy's troubles are Americans' top worry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the unemployment rate over 6 percent, it is a clear warning sign that this economy is continuing to soften faster than we thought. It is a real concern,&quot; said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors. &quot;Businesses have decided to hunker down. They are not hiring, and they are paring workers where they can. That is making things pretty tough out there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House was disappointed, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no question that the labor market is not as strong as we'd like,&quot; said press secretary Dana Perino. &quot;We want to see the economy return to job growth, and we understand that this is a difficult time for many Americans. We want everyone who wants to work to be able to find a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wachovia Corp., Ford Motor Co., Tyson Foods Inc. and Alcoa Inc. were among the companies announcing job cuts in August. GMAC Financial Services this week said it would lay off 5,000 workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locally, while the job market is cooling down, Mr. Dye said it is not as bad as in other parts of the nation where the mortgage crisis is much more severe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two things the local labor market has going for it, he said, are that the manufacturing sector in Pittsburgh is oriented toward exports and that the medical services sector is very strong in Pittsburgh and that is a growth market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government report showed job losses in August that were widespread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Factories cut 61,000 jobs, with housing-related manufacturers and automakers among the hardest hit. Construction firms eliminated 8,000 jobs, retailers axed 20,000 slots, professional and business services slashed 53,000 positions and leisure and hospitality got rid of 4,000. Those losses swamped employment gains in the government, education and health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Job losses at all private employers -- not including government -- came to 101,000 in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government said workers age 25 and older accounted for all the increase in unemployment in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All told, the number of unemployed rose to 9.4 million in August, compared with 7.1 million a year ago. Economists predict more job losses ahead, pushing the jobless rate to 7 percent by the fall, according to some projections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Workers saw wage gains in August, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Average hourly earning rose to $18.14 in August, a 0.4 percent increase from July. Economists were forecasting a 0.3 percent gain. Over the past year, wages have grown 3.6 percent, but paychecks aren't stretching as far because of high food and energy prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caught between dueling concerns of slow growth and inflation, the Fed is expected to leave a key interest rate alone at 2 percent when it meets next on Sept. 16 and probably through the rest of this year. Concerned about inflation, the Fed at its last two meetings didn't budge the rate. Before that, though, the Fed had aggressively cut rates to shore up the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the Fed on the sidelines, Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama has called for a second round of government stimulus, while his GOP rival John McCain has favored free-trade and other business measures to spur the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates seized on the job figures Friday to take swipes at each other.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can the super-rich former governor of Massachusetts -- the son of a Fortune 500 CEO who made a vast fortune in the leveraged-buyout business -- really keep a straight face while denouncing &quot;Eastern elites&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can the former mayor of New York City, a man who, as USA Today put it, &quot;marched in gay pride parades, dressed up in drag and lived temporarily with a gay couple and their Shih Tzu&quot; -- this was between his second and third marriages -- really get away with saying that Barack Obama doesn't think small towns are sufficiently &quot;cosmopolitan&quot;? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can the vice presidential candidate of a party that has controlled the White House, Congress or both for 26 of the past 28 years, a party that, Borg-like, assimilated much of the D.C. lobbying industry into itself -- until Congress changed hands, high-paying lobbying jobs were reserved for loyal Republicans -- really portray herself as running against the &quot;Washington elite&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, they can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, He Who Must Not Be Named -- Mitt Romney mentioned him just once, Rudy Giuliani and Sarah Palin not at all -- gave a video address to the Republican National Convention. John McCain, promised President Bush, would stand up to the &quot;angry left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's no doubt true. But don't be fooled either by Mr. McCain's long-ago reputation as a maverick or by Mrs. Palin's appealing persona: The Republican Party, now more than ever, is firmly in the hands of the angry right, which has always been much bigger, much more influential and much angrier than its counterpart on the other side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's the source of all that anger?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of it, of course, is driven by cultural and religious conflict: Fundamentalist Christians are sincerely dismayed by Roe v. Wade and evolution in the curriculum. What struck me as I watched the convention speeches, however, is how much of the anger on the right is based not on the claim that Democrats have done bad things, but on the perception -- generally based on no evidence whatsoever -- that Democrats look down their noses at regular people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus Mr. Giuliani asserted that Wasilla, Alaska, isn't &quot;flashy enough&quot; for Mr. Obama, who never said any such thing. And Mrs. Palin asserted that Democrats &quot;look down&quot; on small-town mayors -- again, without any evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the GOP is selling, in other words, is the pure politics of resentment; you're supposed to vote Republican to stick it to an elite that thinks it's better than you. Or to put it another way, the GOP is still the party of Nixon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the key insights in &quot;Nixonland,&quot; the new book by the historian Rick Perlstein, is that Nixon's political strategy throughout his career was inspired by his college experience, in which he got himself elected student body president by exploiting his classmates' resentment against the Franklins, the school's elite social club. There's a direct line from that student election to Spiro Agnew's attacks on the &quot;nattering nabobs of negativism&quot; as &quot;an effete corps of impudent snobs,&quot; and from there to the peculiar cult of personality that not long ago surrounded George W. Bush -- a cult that celebrated his anti-intellectualism and made much of the supposed fact that the &quot;misunderestimated&quot; C-average student had proved himself smarter than all the fancy-pants experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when Mr. Bush turned out not to be that smart after all, and his presidency crashed and burned, the angry right -- the raging rajas of resentment? -- became, if anything, even angrier. Humiliation will do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can Mr. McCain and Mrs. Palin really ride Nixonian resentment into an upset election victory in what should be an overwhelmingly Democratic year? The answer is a definite maybe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By selecting Barack Obama as their nominee, the Democrats may have given Republicans an opening: The very qualities that inspire many fervent Obama supporters -- the candidate's high-flown eloquence, his coolness factor -- have also laid him open to a Nixonian backlash. Unlike many observers, I wasn't surprised at the effectiveness of the McCain &quot;celebrity&quot; ad. It didn't make much sense intellectually, but it skillfully exploited the resentment some voters feel toward Mr. Obama's star quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, the experience of the years since 2000 -- the memory of what happened to working Americans when faux-populist Republicans controlled the government -- is still fairly fresh in voters' minds. Furthermore, while Democrats' supposed contempt for ordinary people is mainly a figment of Republican imagination, the GOP really is the Gramm Old Party -- it really does believe that the economy is just fine, and the fact that most Americans disagree just shows that we're a nation of whiners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Democrats can't afford to be complacent. Resentment, no matter how contrived, is a powerful force, and it's one that Republicans are very, very good at exploiting. </SPAN></P>

Barack Obama on a hot, late-summer afternoon atop the city's Buchanan Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to push that on all my grandchildren,&quot; the Lancaster woman said. &quot;You can do anything. We just heard a man who has.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hope, the expectation of change and a sense of history in the making seemed central themes that drew a diverse crowd estimated by officials at around 15,000 to Obama's third stop in Lancaster this year, and his first since winning the Democratic nomination for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strolling up to a packed security entrance was 78-year-old Jack Spiese, who had been at Obama's other two Lancaster stops - at Stevens College of Technology on March 31 and the Lancaster Amtrak Station on April 19. Spiese also was there when John F. Kennedy made his locally famous campaign speech in a packed Penn Square in 1960.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Columbia resident and retired Temple University professor, Spiese was also at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963 when Martin Luther King delivered his &quot;I have a dream&quot; speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now a dream has become a hope,&quot; he mused, referring to a theme in Obama's campaign. &quot;The man is just a straight shooter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, he Spiese would lead the masses in a chant of O-B-A-M-A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, with an air of equanimity, there was Warren Snyder, 85, of Lancaster. Sitting against a security fence, beside a chatty group of onlookers, the retired city resident wore a hat and brought a book, &quot;Masters of the Air,'' to read as he waited for several hours for the presidential candidate to appear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a registered Republican and just went to pick up my tickets to hear Sen. McCain next week,'' Snyder said. &quot;I want to see both of them and hear what they're going to say. Well, I know what they're going to say,'' he said with a smile, &quot;but I want to hear them say it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times, the event seemed like a rock concert - long lines, souvenir peddlers, pre-show chanting and a buzz of what was about to unfold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were signs, such as &quot;Hockey Moms 4 Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And like many big-name acts, not everyone got to see the star.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign is about accessibility to the masses, but an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 people who braved a searing sun and long wait did not get to see the presidential candidate, instead settling for listening to his words drift down to them from afar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lines to get through security gates with full-body scans began backing up hours before Obama's speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Obama's campaign bus arrived at the Buchanan Avenue entrance, a line still stretched from the top of Buchanan Park, through a part of the Franklin &amp; Marshall campus, down Race Avenue and onto Buchanan Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama noticed and was visibly concerned, reports Mayor Richard Gray, who greeted the candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first thing he said to organizers was, 'Why are all those people outside?'&quot; Gray said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidate then elected to delay his talk for almost 30 minutes to allow more people to get in. He chatted with the welcoming group, signed autographs, reviewed papers and talked on a cell phone, Gray said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Gray was contacted by campaign organizers Wednesday, and was told that 3,000 to 4,000 people were expected to show up, the mayor said he immediately sensed there would be a logistical problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They obviously underestimated the appeal of Obama to the people of Lancaster,&quot; Gray said. &quot;It's unfortunate that we didn't have a place where more people could get in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also unfortunate, he said, was that the four security gates, controlled by a private security contractor, didn't open hours earlier than they did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We feel disappointed for the people who didn't get in,&quot; Gray said. &quot;On the other hand, we are elated at the number of people who showed up. It says a lot about the popularity of Senator Obama in central Pennsylvania.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly before 3 p.m., several people who had been waiting in line gave up and made their way to the snow fences near the top of the ridge - figuring if they couldn't see Obama, they'd at least be able to hear him better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm an Obama supporter,'' Mike Clark, 49, of Lancaster, said, &quot;I'm not registered to vote, but I support him,''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 90-degree heat sent many scurrying for refuge under the few trees in the seating area. Fire company officials at the event reported a few heat-related incidents. One person was transported to a hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the early arrivals was Hillary Clinton supporter Marie Suydam, 67, of East Petersburg. After her favorite lost in the primary, she said she was undecided for a while but is now supporting Obama because &quot;McCain is just a grumpy old man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donna Lindsey of Lancaster was determined for her second-grade son, Johnny, to see the man who may lead their country. She'll try to take him to see John McCain on Tuesday when the Republican presidential nominee speaks in Lancaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great opportunity for a child,&quot; mom said. She's tried to expose her son to the import of a presidential race on TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I only watch the Disney Channel,&quot; the unimpressed Lancaster Country Day School student replied, showing more interest in the sunglassed Secret Service agents than anything else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think if he sees him in person, it really shows the impact,&quot; mom said hopefully.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. PAUL, Minn. - Accepting his party's presidential nomination here last night, John McCain pledged to try to end the partisan rancor that has dominated the nation's politics and questioned the ability of his Democratic rival to do the same. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator, seeking to blunt the charge that his election would simply extend the Republican policies of the last eight years, stressed his record of working with the opposition on some of the most contentious issues on the national agenda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Again and again, I've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed,&quot; McCain said, speaking in confident and measured tones. &quot;That's how I will govern as president. I will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again. I have that record and the scars to prove it. Sen. Obama does not.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the former naval aviator, shot down during the Vietnam War four decades ago, portrayed himself as the candidate best able to defend the nation in dangerous times.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will draw on all my experience with the world and its leaders, and all the tools at our disposal - diplomatic, economic, military, and the power of our ideals - to build the foundations for a stable and enduring peace,&quot; he said to loud applause. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unruffled by hecklers who interrupted him on several occasions, McCain delivered an address that was heavy on principles and light on specific proposals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spoke of Barack Obama with respect but drew their differences sharply, framing the race as a classic choice about the role of government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will keep taxes low and cut them where I can,&quot; he said. &quot;My opponent will raise them. I will open new markets to our goods and services. My opponent will close them. I will cut government spending. He will increase it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should he succeed in his quest this November, McCain, 72, would become the oldest person ever elected to a first term as president; Ronald Reagan was older at the time of his reelection in 1984. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win, the Republican nominee, whose candidacy was given up for dead a year ago, must overcome a set of factors that normally would doom anyone in his position: an extremely unpopular president from his own party, a weak economy, and a lengthy war that has divided public opinion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, McCain predicted victory last night, describing himself and his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, as the true agents of change in a campaign in which that word has seemed to belong to Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He talked about the need for energy independence and for judges who don't legislate from the bench. But what truly held the crowd at the Xcel Energy Center in rapt attention was his discussion, near the end, of the lessons he learned during the 51/2 years he spent in the North Vietnamese prison known as the Hanoi Hilton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else's,&quot; he said. &quot;. . . I loved it because it was not just a place, but an idea, a cause worth fighting for. I was never the same again. I wasn't my own man anymore. I was my country's . . .&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this election, McCain must walk a political tightrope, underscoring his differences with President Bush and stressing his maverick credentials while not alienating the party's conservative base, which still admires the incumbent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has talked about his disagreements with Bush in other contexts. But he did not do so last night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Obama spokesman Bill Burton: &quot;He admonished the 'old, do-nothing crowd' in Washington, but ignored the fact that he's been part of that crowd for 26 years, opposing solutions on health care, energy, and education. . . . With John McCain, it's more of the same.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's acceptance speech marked the high point, at least thus far, of a political career that has included four years in the House, 22 in the Senate, and a crushing defeat in the presidential primaries in 2000 at the hands of George W. Bush. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So that he could be surrounded by delegates when he spoke, the stage was remade overnight, placing him on a long and narrow walkway that jutted far out onto the convention floor. The idea was to turn the hall into an oversized version of a town-hall meeting, his signature format. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator was preceded on the program by two of his closest friends in politics, former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and finally by his wife, Cindy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graham highlighted McCain's leadership in the Senate on the war in Iraq, recalling how he pushed the policy that has come to be known as the surge - over the objections of Obama and other Senate Democrats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying Barack Obama doesn't care,&quot; Graham said, accusing Obama of inspiring those who would have accepted defeat. &quot;I'm just saying - he doesn't get it.. . .&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ridge, in his speech, said the issue in this election was not just who can take the crisis phone call in the White House at 3 a.m. - an image used against Obama by Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton during the Democratic primaries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's about who has answered the call throughout his entire life,&quot; Ridge said. &quot;It's not about building a record. It's about having one. And it's not about talking pretty. It's about talking straight.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cindy McCain made similar points in a more personal way. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Americans want straight talk and the plain truth, they should take a good close look at John McCain,&quot; she said, &quot;a man tested and true.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain came to the arena last night not just as the candidate who will try to lead his party to victory in the fall but as the man who brought Palin to the national stage. She received a thunderous reception when she spoke Wednesday night and again when she appeared last night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the evening, the delegates formalized her nomination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats continued to criticize her selection, saying she is not qualified to run the country. &quot;What if something happens, God forbid, to John McCain?&quot; Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D., Fla.) asked reporters in a conference call. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night marked the end of one of the most remarkable two weeks in recent electoral history, including two conventions, two vice presidential selections, and two presidential acceptance speeches. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, after all the balloons and confetti, it's a 60-day sprint to the finish, with the battle likely to be focused on 10 states, most of them in the Rust Belt and the Mountain West. McCain will be in Michigan and Wisconsin today, Obama in northeastern Pennsylvania. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, perhaps even more than in the last two elections, Pennsylvania is sure to figure prominently in the mix. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while the intensity of the last two weeks is likely to dissipate for the moment, the first presidential debate is only three weeks away, Sept. 26 in Oxford, Miss. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 41 Million Tune In To Palin's Speech </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 40 million people tuned in to the Republican convention Wednesday to hear vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin introduce herself to voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">That rivaled</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last week's audience for Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama. He drew 38.4 million viewers on the commercial networks, topping 40 million with PBS and C-Span  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">added in. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Nielsen Media Research</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> estimated that 37.2 million people watched Palin on either ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel or MSNBC. PBS estimated it had four million viewers for her speech.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pictures come before words - that's the convention of American political conventions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before accepting his party's presidential nomination last night, the Arizona legislator was introduced by &quot;Senator John McCain.&quot; The seven-minute film fanfare framed the candidate both as a &quot;mama's boy,&quot; in the words of his mother, Roberta, and as a mythical phoenix who rose from the ashes of the USS Forrestal and was resurrected after a five-year captivity in the Hanoi Hilton as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam conflict.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Narrated by actor Robert Davi and punctuated with a swelling musical score that echoed the theme to the TV series </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Dallas,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the film sang of the military exploits of the son and grandson of four-star naval heroes. As the narrator chronicled McCain's courageous, uncommon valor, he hinted that it was part of a divine plan. The military man survived, &quot;perhaps, because he had more to do. . . . His is a larger cause.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With celestial language - &quot;the stars are aligned&quot; - intoned over majestic images of Monument Valley in the senator's home state, the effect was that of a candidate proclaimed a national monument. For a political figure known for his &quot;straight talk,&quot; the visual and verbal rhetoric of the video biography was lofty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Produced by Fred Davis, the McCain adviser who crafted the attack ad linking Sen. Barack Obama with celebutantes Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, the film violated the &quot;no-glitz&quot; order of its subject. In contrast to the homespun Obama video at the Democratic convention, this one was finely wrought propaganda, more like the Ronald Reagan hagiography, &quot;A New Beginning,&quot; at the 1984 GOP convention and the Bill Clinton exaltation, &quot;The Man From Hope,&quot; at the 1992 Democratic conclave. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditionally, Democrats have mined Hollywood and Republicans Madison Avenue for these nuggets of visual rhetoric. Davis, a huckster nicknamed &quot;Hollywood,&quot; is an adman from the Left Coast, a practiced packager of candidates, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, and products, such as ARCO oil.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read the article in the Saturday, Aug. 23, newspaper, regarding Kreider wanting his sentence changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do he and his lawyers realize that there are some things in life that just cannot be changed? Death is one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can we change and make the victim's dead bodies become alive? No, we cannot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the money (and time) being spent on trying to change his sentence could be used in a better way. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My opinion is, when those three lives are changed from being dead to alive, then we'll talk about changing his sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats attack Sarah Palin for lack of experience. But having been a mayor and a governor (commander in chief of the National Guard of a state with a Russian border), she has more executive experience than Obama, who has never even run a Dairy Queen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judging from his statements after the Russian invasion of Georgia, Obama doesn't even know that Russia has a veto on the U.N. Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden has been involved with foreign policy for a long time, and he has been wrong most of that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden opposed the first Gulf War; he would have given Kuwait to Saddam. He advocated the tri-partition of Iraq, which would have converted sectarian violence into a genuine civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Obama and Biden opposed the surge, which would have left Iraq in a sectarian and jihadist bloodbath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden is experienced, but foolish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and Biden advocate old-fashioned liberal positions that have failed time and time again. &quot;Talk to your enemies&quot; (remember Hitler at Munich? Arafat at Camp David? Stalin at Potsdam?). Increase federal involvement in every aspect of life, from pre-school education to health care. Raise taxes on, well, someone else - the &quot;rich&quot; or &quot;corporations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Palin, in contrast, will be firm with our enemies, stand by our friends (like Georgia and Columbia), and be good stewards of the public's money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a strong America, with a limited federal government, vote for McCain and Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reading recent headlines in the local newspapers, such as &quot;Iraq, U.S. said to reach pullout goals&quot; and &quot;In Iraq, end in sight,&quot; we might be fooled into thinking that soon all will be well in the Middle East and it was worth it in the end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing could be further from the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though it is good to hear that even the current administration is talking about a possible timetable for bringing our troops home from Iraq, that does not mean that the Middle East is on the verge of peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The instability that the U.S. government has caused by our belligerent approach to world problems will haunt us for generations to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What will happen to all the children in Iraq who have lived through bombings and explosions and are too frightened to walk to school?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about all the children who witnessed soldiers breaking into their house at night, taking away a parent who is forced to wear a bag over his head because he is assumed to be part of the insurgency, whether that is true or not, or worse yet, seeing family members killed in the raid?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What lessons have these tactics taught them? Will they ever be glad that their country was &quot;freed&quot; by the Americans?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about the injustice and shame of Abu Ghraib and those who have suffered for years in Guantanamo Bay or in secret prisons that the U.S has used around the world?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are you proud that our nation is still not sure what techniques should be defined as torture?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I fear that our children and grandchildren for generations to come will be made to pay for the mistakes of our current administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is time to use a different approach to solve world problems. I pray that the next administration works seriously on diplomacy instead of resorting to military solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, two out of five of our members report being pressured to violate their standards of medical ethics. Resident physicians report being denied clinical privileges simply because they oppose abortion. Medical students report not choosing careers in obstetrics because they fear being coerced to perform abortions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such fears appear well-founded. Two obstetrics medical groups recently issued statements that threaten the board certification of physicians who do not perform or refer patients for abortions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abortion ideology has created a climate of coercion and intimidation in the medical profession. Ultimately, patients pay the price of diminished access to conscientious and compassionate physicians who are pressured to change careers because of their life-affirming ethical standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HHS regulation, by implementing three existing federal civil liberties laws, will help ensure patient access to such physicians while restoring First Amendment rights in health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your columnist, Ms. Carol Petersen, has provided a heartwarming account of her father's heart ailment (8/30 New Era). I agree with the method to choose a cardiac specialist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, to make the leap of logic that this experience applies to a decision for choosing our next president, may I ask if Ms. Petersen would have chosen Ronald Reagan to perform heart surgery on her father, with the same logic? Being a movie star didn't express a strong presidential acumen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To form a government doesn't require the knowledge of a heart surgeon. The government that we require must weigh social issues, economical issues and international issues. None of these are hard sciences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are balancing acts of intellect and foresight. These are the qualities that Obama backers see us banking on, not cardiac capabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am not a Republican - duh! But I do recognize that the last successful Republican president, Ronald Reagan, was that because he surrounded himself with a strong team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, Democrat Jimmy Carter, whom many consider one of the most intelligent presidents, could not communicate successfully with other forms of government around him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's success is not relative to his years of experience, but his vision presents a direction that we have all been expecting from Washington, Republican or Democrat.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. PAUL, Minn. - The Republicans returned to convention-politics-as-usual here yesterday, using the second night of their national gathering to paint a glowing portrait of John McCain and defend his choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With Hurricane Gustav out of the picture, speaker after speaker praised the party's presidential nominee-in-waiting as a time-tested former prisoner of war whose love of country has permeated every aspect of his long career of public service. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And a few took verbal shots at McCain's Democratic opponent, Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm here to support John McCain because country matters more than party,&quot; Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, a political independent and former Democratic vice presidential candidate, told the cheering crowd at the Xcel Energy Center, explaining his presence. &quot;I am here tonight for a simple reason: John McCain is the best choice to bring our country together and lead our country forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The senator from Connecticut described Obama as a man of eloquence but no record of substance and one who, unlike McCain, &quot;has not reached across party lines to accomplish anything significant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was left to former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson to use stronger language, calling Obama &quot;the most liberal, most inexperienced nominee ever to run for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The evening's events, which included brief remarks from President Bush via satellite from the White House, served as a prelude to Palin's vice presidential acceptance speech, scheduled for tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Palin's background, both political and personal, has become a subject of intense interest in the five days since McCain named her as his running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conversation has swirled about the pregnancy of her unmarried, 17-year-old daughter and a legislative investigation into whether her firing of the state public safety commissioner constituted an abuse of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a very real sense, the little-known, first-term governor of Alaska has emerged as the main character at this convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thompson brought the delegates to their feet by blasting Palin's critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;She's from a small town, with small-town values, but apparently that's not good enough for those folks who are attacking her and her family,&quot; Thompson said, praising her credentials. &quot;. . . Let's be clear, the selection of Gov. Palin has the other side and their friends in the media in a state of panic. She is a courageous, successful reformer, who is not afraid to take on the establishment. Sound like anybody else we know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thompson, who ran in the Republican presidential primaries this year, also talked of McCain's character, commitment to governmental reform, and determination to do what he thinks is right, not what is politically popular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And he told the story of McCain's five-and-a-half years as a prisoner in North Vietnam after his plane was shot down during the Vietnam War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Being a POW doesn't qualify anyone to be president,&quot; Thompson said. &quot;But it does reveal character. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's pretty clear that there are two questions we will never have to ask ourselves,&quot; Thompson said. &quot; 'Who is this man?' and 'Can we trust this man with the presidency?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In keeping with the night's theme of service, and the goal of extolling McCain's personal strengths, the other speakers largely refrained from attacking the Democrats and their nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Bush, for instance, lauded McCain for his political independence and his commitment to protecting the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need a president who understands the lessons of Sept. 11, 2001: That to protect America, we must stay on the offense, stop attacks before they happen, and not wait to be hit again,&quot; Bush said. &quot;The man we need is John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the original convention program, Bush, whose low job-approval rating is a drag on Republican prospects this fall, was supposed to have been the featured speaker for opening night, in person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As it turned out, the storm-related adjustments caused him to stay away from St. Paul, to speak for only a few minutes, and to be relegated to a slot before the hour of network television coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice President Cheney, also originally set to speak Monday, was kept off the schedule entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In giving a featured role to Lieberman last night, McCain was putting his own distinctive imprint on the convention and stressing his own appeal to independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eight years ago, the Connecticut senator, who caucuses with the Democrats on Capitol Hill, spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, accepting that party's vice presidential nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other speakers yesterday included Wes Gullett, who adopted one of the two sickly infant girls that Cindy McCain brought home from a Bangladeshi orphanage in 1991. The McCains adopted the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think America will be an even better place with John and his wife, Cindy, in the White House,&quot; Gullett said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Monday, in deference to Gustav, the GOP conducted a sober and abbreviated business session, devoid of all of the trappings of an American political convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last night, with the storm weakened and the damage less than feared, all of the music and the cheering were back, as were the funny hats, the oversized buttons and the occasional bursts of partisan oratory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National polls show McCain trailing Obama by an average of about 6 percentage points. That margin has grown slightly since the beginning of this extraordinary two-week run, which has included two conventions and two vice presidential selections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Knowing that much of the thrust of last night's program would be emphasizing McCain's political independence, the Obama campaign put out a commercial making the opposite point &amp;ndash; that the Arizona senator has supported many of the Bush administration's policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ad, which concludes that America &quot;can't afford more of the same,&quot; includes a video clip in which McCain says: &quot;I voted with the president over 90 per cent of the time, higher than a lot of my even Republican colleagues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tonight's session will include the delayed keynote speech from former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani as well as the formal nomination of McCain as the party's presidential candidate for 2008 &amp;ndash; plus Palin's appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's a unique opportunity [for her] to have a conversation with the American public,&quot; McCain campaign manager Rick Davis told reporters yesterday. &quot;It's also a chance to see beyond the media fog of the last 48 hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The convention concludes with McCain's acceptance speech tomorrow night.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IF JOHN MCCAIN hopes to win the key state of Pennsylvania, conventional wisdom holds, he'll have to find his votes outside Philadelphia, which is teeming with devoted African-American supporters of Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those offering that wisdom should make a trip to Mayfair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a white working-class neighborhood of attached brick houses and modest commercial strips in Northeast Philadelphia, where Republicans aren't an endangered species, Democrats can swing any which way and Obama has his work cut out for him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Republican expects McCain to win Philadelphia, but if he and running mate Sarah Palin can hold Obama's margin in the city to 350,000 votes or less, GOP insiders think that they could win the state and its 21 electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why Republicans are looking carefully at Mayfair and the rest of the Northeast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm pulling out all my guns in Philly to make sure John McCain can win Pennsylvania,&quot; said Rob Gleason, state GOP chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign has set up its city headquarters in Mayfair, at Frankford and Cottman avenues. And McCain made a Northeast stop yesterday, serving coffee and doughnuts to firefighters at a fire station in Fox Chase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago, Sen. John Kerry beat President Bush in every ward in the Northeast. In the 55th Ward, which covers Mayfair, his margin was 15 points. But this year's presidential matchup is different, and Republicans are encouraged by what they saw in the April Democratic primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats in the Northeast overwhelmingly backed Sen. Hillary Clinton. Clinton was cheered by an adoring crowd of 1,500 at a rally held outside the Mayfair Diner, and she went on to crush Obama in the Northeast, winning the 55th Ward with 75 percent of the vote. So far, her voters have not all converted to Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you add skeptical Democrats to the 72,000 registered Republicans in the Northeast, you've got a real shot for McCain to shrink Obama's margin in the city Obama needs to win big.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I already made my mind up and I'm a Democrat - McCain,&quot; said Diana Linke, 49, of Mayfair, who supported Clinton. &quot;I don't believe Barack Obama has the experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats have said that Obama needs to win Philly by more than 400,000 to win Pennsylvania. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry secured a 412,000-vote margin in Philadelphia in 2004 and went on to win the state. But McCain's Northeast support could impact that margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think McCain will do well up there,&quot; said political analyst Larry Ceisler. &quot;The problem in some of these places, Obama's message is change, and people in these places don't want a change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republicans struggled in the Northeast four years ago because President Bush was widely disliked. But McCain is favorably viewed as an experienced, independent senator. And, just as in other blue-collar areas, these working-class voters who are worried about gas prices, health-care costs and jobs haven't warmed to Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm voting for McCain because Obama is all b.s.,&quot; said Democrat George Scaricamazza, 67, of Somerton, who voted for Clinton in the primary. &quot;He's not qualified for nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's Pennsylvania spokesman, Sean Smith, said that the campaign must educate voters in Northeast Philadelphia about Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to tell his story and let voters know that Senator Obama's early life was a lot more like their own than they may realize,&quot; Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign also needs to talk with Northeast voters about economic issues, Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats who voted for Senator Clinton were doing so because of the economy and because of health care,&quot; said Smith. &quot;We believe they will vote for Senator Obama on those issues because he is so much better than John McCain.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The selection of Scranton-born Sen. Joe Biden, a Catholic with blue-collar roots, may help Obama in this part of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to vote for Obama and Biden,&quot; said Emily Deane, 52, of Crescentville, who supported Clinton in the primary. &quot;Biden has experience; he's been in the Senate for 30 years. Biden made up my mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, a self-described &quot;hockey mom&quot; with five kids, could also appeal to Northeast voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think she's going to be a great addition to the ticket,&quot; said Gleason. &quot;I think she's a woman who understands a lot of the issues of being a working mom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another element of both sides' strategic thinking is the Northeast's, (and the city's) history of racial identification in voting. In 2003, the 55th Ward voted for white Republican Sam Katz over Mayor John Street, who is black, by an almost 9-to-1 ratio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Northeast also voted for white candidates Tom Knox and Bob Brady in the 2007 mayoral primary, though African-American candidates got a larger share of the Northeast's vote than in previous mayoral contests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think, obviously, race plays a part of this,&quot; said Gleason. &quot;But in America, you can vote for somebody on how they part their hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annette Blumenthal, 47, of Pennypack, said she would support McCain over Obama, in part because of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's a smart guy, he's looks very educated, he has a beautiful wife,&quot; she said of Obama. &quot;I just think the world's not ready for a black president.&quot; * </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coverage of the first day of the 2008 Republican National Convention was more meteorology than politics. Gustav/GOP gave the 24/7 news channels a chance to show what TV can do, and the result was both breathtaking and mind-numbing.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swirling red, blue, yellow and red, Gustav's TV image edged farther and farther northwest throughout the day, and MSNBC, CNN and Fox News made sure that image was usually either center-stage or tucked in the lower right-hand corner of the screen, even during commercials.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what if the Republican Party decided Sunday to &quot;scale down&quot; the first day of the convention into a sort of hurricane-relief telethon? There was a hurricane (one disappointed reporter called it &quot;not the mother of all storms after all&quot;) to overcover. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN's John King, on the convention floor at the Xcel Convention Center in St. Paul, Minn., conjured with the Magic Wall (a digital map that shifts, zooms in, and focuses according to touches and hand signals) to point out bulging levees and endangered neighborhoods. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, with a sweep of King's hand, we slid over to Baton Rouge for a zoom-in. It was fresh, on the fly, a fine diversion from the listless milling of the convention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was comedy: Fox News' Geraldo Rivera, complete with cameramen, ran right up to the slopping lip of the Industrial Canal in the Upper Ninth Ward of New Orleans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high point came during CNN's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Situation Room</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with Wolf Blitzer, when seven live video images ran on one screen: talking heads Blitzer and King, and live shots from five storm-torn locations from Alabama to Mississippi, plus a quotation headline from New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin (&quot;We're not out of the woods yet&quot;) and the ubiquitous crawler, with international news. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An incredible amount of instantly available info. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best coverage of politics had the least commentary. C-Span showed a Barack Obama speech at Detroit's Hart Plaza in which he deftly twinned praise for the union movement with a silent prayer for storm victims. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C-Span also followed the equally deft President Bush as he visited emergency-response centers in Texas. While not flashy, C-Span's commentless mic-and-camera approach is dramatic: We see the politician's art, his charisma and how people respond. You can learn more from an unmediated C-Span camera than from two hours of punditry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A shudder may have gone through convention planners when, toward evening's end, MSNBC weatherperson Bill Kairns said Hurricane Hanna might make landfall anywhere from North Carolina to central Florida on Thursday - just about when John McCain is scheduled &quot;to make the biggest speech of his life.&quot; And behind Hanna, a storm named Ike is building up. The gods must be crazy. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Soon the airwaves will be flooded with commercials, hammering home a message to every American man, woman, child and pet goldfish. No, nothing about Obama or McCain. Major League Baseball would like to remind every living soul that &quot;There's Only One October&quot; and has assembled a list of personalities ranging from Jeff Foxworthy to the animated Stewie from &quot;Family Guy&quot; to join the ubiquitous Rick Gonzalez in getting the word out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thing is, there's not even a disclaimer in the fine print pointing out that there's also only one September. And that for contending teams that don't take care of business now, there won't be any October at all. At least, not one that MLB and its broadcast partners are going to give a hoot about televising. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Phillies fall into that more specific focus group. And on the first day of this make-or-break month, Kyle Kendrick's latest meltdown yesterday set off a four-alarm ripple of concern after a dismal, 7-4 loss to last-place Washington at Nationals Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The narrow question being casually tossed around before the game was whether Kendrick should be skipped the next time around the rotation to allow Cole Hamels to pitch next Sunday night against the Mets at Shea Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real issue now, though, is whether a team that is two games behind New York with just 24 left to play can afford to continue reserving a spot in the rotation for Kendrick at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to see how.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rules are different in September. Phillies manager Charlie Manager demonstrated his belief in that principal a year ago when he went to the whip with closer Brett Myers and setup relievers J.C. Romero and Tom Gordon while basically putting the rest of the bullpen on hiatus. And it paid off with a hot streak that allowed the Phillies to slip past the Mets on the final day of the season, making it to the one-and-only October for the first time in 14 years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's only one March, April, May, June, July and August, too. In those months, though, there's still time to experiment, to allow players to ride out slumps or try to find themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look, Kendrick was a great story last year when he came out of Double A Reading in June and won 10 games. Without his contributions, the Phillies probably wouldn't have made the playoffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ugly reality is that, in his last five starts, he is 1-3 with a 9.14 earned run average. He has allowed 48 batters to reach on hits or walks in 21 2/3 innings. He has walked 14 while striking out just seven. Most damning, he needed 84 pitches to get through just four innings yesterday. And that was the third-longest outing in this span.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lately, he's having a hard time with his command,&quot; Manuel said. &quot;Poise used to be the big thing we talked about with him. He'd just get the ball and throw it. Now he takes a lot of time. He aims the ball. He used to, what I call, throw through the [catcher's] mitt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kendrick has no explanation for his troubles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel good,&quot; he said. &quot;That's what's frustrating about it. I feel good. My arm does. I feel good and strong. I don't know what I'm going through at this point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on the success he's had to this point of his career, Kendrick absolutely deserves the opportunity to figure this out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just not now, not in September, where the shadows are lengthening across their season just as they did across the Nationals Park field late yesterday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manuel, who has been a staunch Kendrick supporter, said no decision has been made. Pitching coach Rich Dubee said the team isn't going to do &quot;anything rash.&quot; Manuel wondered out loud who might replace Kendrick in the rotation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funny thing is, he may have dropped a hint earlier. He had 10 pitchers in the bullpen to choose from to pitch the bottom of the fifth and he chose lefty J.A. Happ who is now, in theory at least, in sync with Kendrick's schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if Happ is a possibility, Manuel didn't blink. &quot;He's down there, isn't he? He's a starter,&quot; the manager said. &quot;We'll just have to wait and see how things go. We're in the last month and we've got to win every game we can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, asked how much weight the shortness of the remaining schedule and the resultant increase in the importance of every game would be given in whatever decision was made, Manuel was blunt again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A whole lot,&quot; he said. &quot;That's the big question. It's something we've definitely got to discuss.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's only one October, sources have confirmed. But for teams that don't do what they need to do in September, it's a pretty empty month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, Chase Utley walking the dog or Brett Myers playing golf or Ryan Howard working out or Jimmy Rollins buying clothes or Brad Lidge playing pingpong or video games isn't exactly must-see TV. Not when there are eight other teams vying for the World Series. *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain has repeatedly made it clear that his wife has her own finances; she files a separate tax return so he has no need to track what is owned only in her name. As such, it is reasonable to assume he cannot quote off-the-cuff the number of investment properties she owns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked how many houses he plus his wife own between them, John McCain appropriately answered he did not know and the answer would have to be researched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, in his attack ad, states that John McCain's response showed Mr. McCain could not identify the number of homes owned by him. Since the question Mr. McCain responded to included properties owned by Mrs. McCain only, turning the quote into an inability of John McCain to keep track of homes under his own name is a false statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's intentional misquote is therefore an outright lie about what Mr. McCain said. This lie not only has Mr. Obama's approval, it also has his voice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">801 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The star of the Democratic National Convention wasn't Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton, Hillary's husband -- certainly not Joe Biden or even Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The single-most riveting presence at the Democratic gathering -- possibly the entire Democratic political season -- was that kooky-bizarro set with the faux-marble columns straddling the 50-yard line of Invesco Field in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this veritable neo-Graeco-Roman-Graceland temple, the Anointed One became the Nominated One. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or so I assume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confession: I wrote on the morning of Obama's evening acceptance speech, confident that nothing could speak more volumes to the American people than the sight of this grandiose venue deliberately crafted for the address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, even as Obama's media squeezes pounded out the anticipatory PR hearts and flowers -- The Washington Post breathlessly revealed that Obama was earlier &quot;crafting a first draft by hand on yellow paper&quot; -- the bookies already reducing the speech to a probable set of cliches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only was it a sure thing that the nominee would use the phrase &quot;I accept,&quot; but bookmaker Paddy Power also gave 12-to-1 odds that he would use the phrases &quot;I'd like to thank my wife,&quot; &quot;as I stand here today,&quot; &quot;fundamental belief&quot; and &quot;defining moment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zzzzz... Sorry. Whatever is remembered about what Obama said, the essential point is this: He decided to say it at a plywood Parthenon by klieg light. At least, I hope he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope he stood firm against the early guffaws elicited by those first fuzzy photos to appear during convention week depicting the temple columns rising amid 76,000 seats and 450 spotlights in Mile High Stadium, a sight that increasingly looked less Leni Riefenstahl and more &quot;This Is Spinal Tap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, the Obama campaign hasn't been immune to similar criticism. According to the London Telegraph, John McCain's&nbsp;commercial depiction of Obama as a vapid &quot;celebrity&quot; after his last rally for the masses in Berlin effectively sent all manner of vapid celebrities into hiding during the convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was because, the paper reported, convention planners had ruled against pop stars making cameo convention appearances -- an indication of &quot;how Republican rival Sen. John McCain's effort to turn Mr. Obama's fame into a weakness has rattled the Democratic campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can't wait what to see what effect Vladimir Putin has on it. But I digress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is, your Ben Afflecks, your Josh Brolins, your Annette Bennings came to Denver, but &quot;mostly kept a careful distance from the main arena and Michelle Obama&quot; because they feared &quot;their presence could be detrimental.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper continued: &quot;Oscar-winner George Clooney, an avowed Obama supporter, even took the unusual step of issuing a statement to deny he was in regular contact with Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have never texted or e-mailed Sen. Obama,&quot; the Telegraph quoted Mr. Clooney as saying. Must have been a slow news day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, celebrity sensitivity and Temple Obama could be connected. Maybe in its efforts to ditch the celebrity image, the Obama campaign thought up the idea for Obama to strike a super-statesmanlike pose on a super-serious set -- Ancient Greece or Rome or whatever. Who are you calling a vapid celebrity now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this has left Obama with another problem: Having chosen to accept the nomination for president of the United States in a setting more suited to a Roman emperor if not the oracle at Delphi, what will his fellow citizens -- still not subjects, after all -- think?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frankly, what the tank ride did for Michael Dukakis, the plywood Parthenon just might do for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then again, this entire event, seemingly a miscalculation of epic proportions, could have been an example of perfect political acumen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, before becoming transfixed by Temple Obama, I was reading up on Obama's relationship with ex-Weather Underground member and unrepentant Capitol- and Pentagon-bomber William Ayers -- news of which the Obama campaign has been eager to downplay if not squelch entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was also trying to unravel the ties between Obama, Obama's unsavory fundraiser Antoin &quot;Tony&quot; Rezko, and Rezko's unsavory money source Iraqi-British billionaire Nadhmi Auchi. (This is another story journalists are being pressured not to cover, as Andrew Walden at Accuracy in Media has shockingly and extensively documented, in this case by Auchi's legal eagles.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And who knew Obama's veep nominee Joe Biden had Rezko connections through a longtime associate named Joseph Cari Jr., who admitted involvement in a Rezko kickback scheme? And on it goes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then, suddenly, Temple Obama went up, and with it, like incense in the fire, all patience for hard news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe this comes under the age-old Roman heading of bread and circuses. Eureka! All Hail Barackus Husseinus Obamaius.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; Pg. A-13</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">806 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The guilty pleasure I miss most when I'm out slogging on the campaign trail is the chance to sprawl on the chaise and watch a vacuously spunky and generically sassy chick flick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So imagine my delight, my absolute astonishment, when the hokey chick flick came out on the trail, a Cinderella story so preposterous it's hard to believe it's not premiering on Lifetime. Instead of going home and watching &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; with Sandra Bullock, I get to stay here and watch &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; with Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheer heaven. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's easy to see where this movie is going. It begins, of course, with a cute, cool unknown from Alaska who has never even been on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; triumphing over a cute, cool unknowable from Hawaii who has been on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; a lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans, suspicious that the Obamas have benefited from affirmative action without being properly grateful, and skeptical that Michelle really likes &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; and &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show,&quot; reject the 47-year-old black contender as too uppity and untested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, they embrace 72-year-old John McCain and 44-year-old Sarah Palin, whose average age is 58, a mere two years older than the average age of the Obama-Biden ticket. Enthusiastic Republicans don't see the choice of Palin as affirmative action, despite her thin resume and gaping absence of foreign policy knowledge, because they expect Republicans to put an underqualified &quot;babe,&quot; as Rush Limbaugh calls her, on the ticket. They have a tradition of nominating fun, bantamweight cheerleaders, like the previous Miss Congeniality types Dan Quayle and W., and then letting them learn on the job. So they crash into the globe a few times while they're learning to drive, what's the big deal?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama may have been president of The Harvard Law Review, but Palin graduated from the University of Idaho with a minor in poli-sci and worked briefly as a TV sports reporter. And she was tougher on the basketball court than the ethereal Obama, earning the nickname &quot;Sarah Barracuda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legacy of Geraldine Ferraro was supposed to be that no one would ever go on a blind date with history again. But that crazy maverick and gambler McCain does it, and conservatives and evangelicals rally around him in admiration of his refreshingly cynical choice of Sarah, an evangelical Protestant and anti-abortion crusader who became a hero when she decided to have her baby, who has Down syndrome, and when she urged schools to debate creationism as well as that stuffy old evolution thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palinistas, as they are called, love Sarah's spunky, relentlessly quirky &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; story from being a Miss Alaska runner-up, and winning Miss Congeniality, to being mayor and hockey mom in Wasilla, a rural Alaskan town of 6,715, to being governor for two years to being the first woman ever to run on a national Republican ticket. (Why do men only pick women as running mates when they need a Hail Mary pass? It's a little insulting.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah is a zealot, but she's a fun zealot. She has a beehive and sexy shoes, and the day she's named she goes shopping with McCain in Ohio for a cheerleader outfit for her daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As she once told Vogue, she's learned the hard way to deal with press comments about her looks. &quot;I wish they'd stick with the issues instead of discussing my black go-go boots,&quot; she said. &quot;A reporter once asked me about it during the campaign, and I assured him I was trying to be as frumpy as I could by wearing my hair on top of my head and these schoolmarm glasses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This chick flick, naturally, features a wild stroke of fate, when the two-year governor of an oversized igloo becomes commander in chief after the president-elect chokes on a pretzel on day one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movie ends with the former beauty queen shaking out her pinned-up hair, taking off her glasses, slipping on ruby red peep-toe platform heels that reveal a pink French-style pedicure, and facing down Vladimir Putin in an island in the Bering Strait. Putting away her breast pump, she points her rifle and informs him frostily that she has some expertise in Russia because it's close to Alaska. &quot;Back off, Commie dude,&quot; she says. &quot;I'm a much better shot than Cheney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then she takes off in her seaplane and lands on the White House lawn, near the new ice fishing hole and hockey rink. The &quot;First Dude,&quot; as she calls the hunky Eskimo in the East Wing, waits on his snowmobile with the kids -- Track (named after high school track meets), Bristol (after Bristol Bay where they did commercial fishing), Willow (after a community in Alaska), Piper (just a cool name) and Trig (Norse for &quot;strength&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The PTA is great preparation for dealing with the KGB,&quot; President Palin murmurs to Todd, as they kiss in the final scene while she changes Trig's diaper. &quot;Now that Georgia's safe, how 'bout I cook you up some caribou hot dogs and moose stew for dinner, babe?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">750 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wrote a column back in June in which I said Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin would be the ideal running mate for Sen. John McCain. But I never thought he'd pick her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I underestimated him. And Democrats will underestimate &quot;Sarah Barracuda&quot; at their peril.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 44, Sarah Louise Heath Palin is the youngest governor in Alaska's relatively brief history as a state. She's also the nation's most popular governor, with an approval rating in the 80s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Palin is popular in part because of her personal qualities. She earned the &quot;Sarah Barracuda&quot; nickname as the point guard on her Wasilla high school basketball team, which she led to the state championship in 1982. Two years later, when she won the Miss Wasilla beauty pageant (and went on to be the first runner up in the Miss Alaska contest) she was also named Miss Congeniality. Fire and nice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's mostly because she's been a crackerjack governor, a strong fiscal conservative and a ferocious fighter of corruption, especially in her own party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Palin touches other conservative bases, some of which Mr. McCain has been accused of missing. A regular churchgoer, she's staunchly pro-life. Her eldest son is a soldier. She's a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association who hunts, fishes and runs marathons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her wholesome family and modest lifestyle contrast with the wealth Mr. McCain married into, and will make it harder for Democrats to portray the GOP ticket as out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Americans. And it doesn't hurt that Ms. Palin's husband, Todd, a Native American, is a commercial fisherman and an oilfield worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Palin is an expert on energy policy, which figures to be the top domestic issue in this election. (She was ethics commissioner of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission before resigning in protest over what she alleged were the lack of ethics by fellow Republicans.) Her presence on the ticket raises hopes that Mr. McCain will soften his opposition to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Preserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimberley Strassel of the Wall Street Journal has said that Mr. McCain should run -- a la Harry Truman -- against a corrupt, do-nothing Congress this fall. If he chooses to do so, Ms. Palin is the ideal partner. She took on a corrupt GOP establishment in Alaska and pushed a landmark ethics reform bill through the state legislature. She's as much a maverick as Mr. McCain, though one who elates, rather than irritates, conservatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If McCain has in fact chosen Gov. Palin, then count me in with both feet,&quot; said radio talk show host Mark Levin, a frequent and often savage critic of Mr. McCain. &quot;Palin is by all accounts a principled conservative and government reformer who can contribute mightily to the decision-making that occurs in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If elected, Ms. Palin would be the first female vice president in history. This prospect may appeal to some disgruntled Hillary Clinton supporters. On the other hand, pro-abortion women might be put off by her pro-life views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no such thing as the perfect candidate. The knock on Sarah Palin would be her relative inexperience. She's been governor for only 18 months, and before that, the mayor of Wasilla, a small suburb of Anchorage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it will be difficult for Democrats to attack Ms. Palin on this without calling attention to Barack Obama's lack of experience. Ms. Palin is the undercard, not the top of the ticket. And her 18 months as governor (not to mention her two terms as mayor) is 18 months more executive experience than Sens. Barack Obama and Joe Biden have combined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether this is a brilliant choice or a bad risk will depend on how Ms. Palin performs on the campaign trail. But if I were Joe Biden, I'd be worried. A former journalist, Sarah Palin is careful about what she says and says it well, qualities for which Mr. Biden is not reknowned. Mr. Obama picked Mr. Biden in part because of his reputed skill as a hatchet man. But if Mr. Biden comes on too hard in the vice presidential debate, he'll look like a bully. And Alaska is littered with the bodies of those who tried to bully Sarah Palin and failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's not in doubt is that Mr. McCain's rollout of his running mate was brilliant. The secret was kept until the last minute, which is remarkable in politics. Speculation about who it would be dominated the morning talk shows Friday, pushing aside discussion of Mr. Obama's acceptance speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain has shown political skills few of us thought he had. I think he's about to take the new kid to school.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illinois Sen. Barack Obama's campaign and its allies, mindful of the lessons of the Swift boat attacks of 2004, have begun an aggressive, multi-pronged attack on an advertisement running in swing states that seeks to link the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee to former domestic terrorist William Ayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With threats of legal action, boycotts and a response ad launched quietly to avoid publicity, the Obama campaign has put conservative donors and television stations on notice that 2008 will not be 2004, when Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kerry, the Democratic nominee, waited weeks to respond to attacks on his Vietnam War record and ultimately did so ineffectively. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christian Pinkston, a spokesman for the American Issues Project, which is airing the anti-Obama&nbsp;ad, called the response intimidation and harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign lawyer Robert Bauer replied: &quot;If someone rides up to a convenience store with a sawed-off shotgun and a prior record, I'm not intimidating anybody by calling the cops. ... If this [Republican] campaign is going to be run in McCarthyite fashion by lawbreakers in an illegal way, they are going to pay a price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ayers was a member of the Weather Underground, a radical organization that claimed responsibility for a dozen bombings between 1970 and 1974. He is now a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago and an expert on public school reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, financed with a $2.9 million donation from Texas billionaire Harold Simmons, a bundler for Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain, says Mr. Obama has defended Mr. Ayers as &quot;respectable&quot; and &quot;mainstream,&quot; and that he launched his political career from Mr. Ayers' home. The Obama campaign says the assertions are demonstrably false.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why would Barack Obama be friends with somebody who bombed the Capitol and is proud of it?&quot; intones a voice on the ad, which is running in conservative stretches of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. &quot;Do you know enough to elect Barack Obama?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is no video stunt, said Evan Tracey of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks political advertising. It began running 10 days ago, and as of Tuesday, $360,000 had been spent on 264 showings, 52 of them in the Grand Rapids, Mich., media market, just under 40 around Cincinnati, 18 in Norfolk, and half a dozen around Pittsburgh, a corner of Pennsylvania that New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton dominated in the spring Democratic primary battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Certainly, it connects with base voters,&quot; Mr. Tracey said. &quot;If you can't get excited about voting for McCain, these are the kinds of ads that get them excited about voting against Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The television spot has left Mr. Obama with the same dilemma that Mr. Kerry faced four years ago: Respond and risk pushing the issue onto the political talk shows and front pages of newspapers, or ignore it and hope that the attack will not sink in. Mr. Kerry, convinced that few would believe that a decorated Vietnam combat veteran would fabricate his war record, chose to ignore the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. When he finally responded, his national advertisement stoked the issue all over again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign officials are taking a different tack. They are running an ad to counter the Ayers spot in the same media markets, but they began with no national media announcement or news conference. The ad itself blames Mr. McCain for the independent Ayers campaign, accusing him of &quot;talking about the '60s&quot; and crimes that Mr. Ayers committed when Mr. Obama was 8 years old, instead of war spending, economic crisis and tax breaks for companies that send jobs overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Simmons, who helped finance the 2004 Swift boat campaign, has raised $50,000 to $100,000 for Mr. McCain's bid, according to the campaign's Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The counter ad is only part of the Obama team's response. Mr. Bauer has written legal letters to television stations, asserting that the Ayers ad is illegal and false, and that its airing is subject to a Federal Election Commission penalty. Mr. Obama did not call Mr. Ayers &quot;respectable&quot; and &quot;mainstream,&quot; Mr. Bauer said. Those words were used by a journalist in an article that was posted along with many others on the Obama campaign Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers called it &quot;100 percent misleading&quot; to blame the Republican for an ad he had nothing to do with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the campaign has had no discussions with Mr. Simmons about the ad, the issue or the organization.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America made history last week, folks. A black man has been nominated by one of the two major parties to run for the presidency of these United States. Gromer Jeffers Jr. of The Dallas Morning News writes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For a nation where the torrents of race have tainted history and threaten the future, Mr. Obama's historic nomination makes him the great hope of his party and a barometer of just how much the racial divide has narrowed. Mr. Obama's nomination could deal a death blow to racial politics and the intolerance it often creates. Or racism could resurge with obvious and subtle attempts to stop a black man from winning the White House. So for the next two months -- and the next four years, if Mr. Obama wins -- the nation is in uncharted territory.&quot; (dallasnews.com) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poor Pittsburgh</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week the U.S. Census told us that Pittsburgh is one of the 10 poorest American cities, based on median household income. The Allegheny Institute blames a Democratic stranglehold on city politics:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For decades, Pittsburgh has been a city ruled by one party and controlled in large part by the labor unions. These politicians have enacted policies that have shackled economic growth and development and pushed businesses and people across its borders. [Their] idea of economic growth has been to subsidize favored projects like retail stores (Lazarus and Lord &amp; Taylor's), large-scale urban development (Marketplace at Fifth and Forbes), and professional sports teams. Joining Pittsburgh at the bottom of the list are the rust belt cities of Detroit, Cleveland, and Buffalo. ... All these cities share the problem of one-party rule and union-dominated policy making.&quot; (alleghenyinstitute.org/blog)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Complicit or incompetent?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world-famous Burgh Report asks this very question of Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, now that URA chief Pat Ford has resigned and in so doing accused the young mayor is promoting a &quot;culture of deception and corruption&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pat Ford's attorney stated to the PG that the corruption was evidenced by 'the way contracts are supposed to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, and the way contributions have been made to the mayor.' ... The URA contract for construction management went to McTish, Kunkel &amp; Associates. Firm President Matthew McTish gave Mr. Ravenstahl's campaign a $10,000 contribution in December 2006. [Is] Ford some rogue, cavalier individual? Is Luke Ravenstahl just some doddering old 20-something asleep at the wheel as the city is sold dahna river? [I'm] saying the sharp money is on complicit.&quot; (burghreport.blogspot.com)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donde esta Pedro?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local sports blogosphere and Bucs fans everywhere had a minor coronary over the Scott Boras / Pedro Alvarez affair: &quot;What's all this business about a missed deadline? About a null and void contract? Why can't I feel my left arm? GAACK.&quot; With Scott Boras, super-agent to the superstars, it's almost always about money, writes Patrick Lackey in his blog &quot;Where Have You Gone, Andy Van Slyke?&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no way Boras is pushing this issue if he doesn't have a leg to stand on. What I'm guessing that Boras wants is for the Pirates to renegotiate with Alvarez for any amount of money at all, to avoid the prospect of having the contract voided by a judge or arbitrator. Even if it's only for $200,000, a precedent will be set for renegotiation after the signing deadline, and the deadline itself is rendered relatively useless. That's still what I think this is about, and I don't think Boras would be doing it without some kind of real plan of attack.&quot; (whygavs.com)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't you know how I hate losing to the Pirates?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With ObamaFest now in the books, Don Surber of the Charleston Daily Mail looks ahead to Sen. John McCain's nomination, and looks back on his resurrection:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain's is one of the biggest comebacks in American political history. He ran out of money last August, had to fire most of his campaign staff and fly commercial. He carried his own baggage. He was down to his last endorsement: Wilford Brimley. On her blog, McCain's daughter, Meghan, recalled how Brimley called in his support and the small group of campaigners left on the McCain staff cheered. Brimley rallied them. With Wilford Brimley on board, all things are possible.&quot; (blogs.dailymail.com/donsurber)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Try as you will, finding Republicans in this town is a veritable snipe hunt. This is not their natural habitat. One of the airport terminals is named for Hubert Humphrey. When a vendor popped into Mickey's, a gritty, dining-car-shaped joint at the corner of 7th and St. Peter, he attempted to hawk some &quot;On Board With McCain&quot; placards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want one that says Obama,&quot; replied the waitress. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business, at least for this guy, will have to wait until tomorrow, when the town is aswarm with conservatives in funny hats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visitors from Planet GOP will be deep in the belly of the beast, and the beast looks very much like a donkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, they've gotta have it someplace. I don't know exactly why they picked here,&quot; said Josh Johnson, who was strolling a courtyard of sidewalk cafes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His companion, Mary Schmidt, mentioned that protesters -- she's not entirely sure what they're protesting -- are renting out apartments near her downtown flat for $2,000 each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if I'll protest. I'll probably go check it out. My brother's coming to protest,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Coney Island Cafe along St. Peter Street, Mary Arvanitis explained to visitors that her family has owned the business since 1923 and the building dated to 1858, the year of Minnesota's statehood. They advertise the coldest beer in town. Bartender Kurt Hinrichsen estimates it at 37 degrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's great for our city. We're proud to have them here in the spirit of this election. We're ready. It's a time for everyone to join in and welcome people,&quot; said Ms. Arvanitis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bar had been closed for 14 years; the owners reopened two days ago to see if the GOP will drink them back to prosperity. On the night they opened Sen. Barack Obama's acceptance speech in Denver was on the bar TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does that mean she'll be voting for the Republicans? She summoned Mr. Hinrichshen, the bartender, and passed the question on to him. He passed it back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erin Meister, a 19-year-old college student picked it up, and promptly turned it on its side. &quot;It's definitely spicing up downtown,&quot; she said of the Republican invasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's great for local businesses,&quot; chimed in her friend, Annie Heideman, also 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressed to answer -- and people in this laid-back slice of the Midwest hate to be pressed -- they conceded that the Land of Hubert Humphrey isn't likely to become the adoptive parent of John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a liberal area,&quot; Ms. Meister said. &quot;I don't think people are easily swayed here. I'm not sure it's going to swing their vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would either of them consider voting for the visiting team? A long pause ensued and the room chilled like the beer at Coney Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly,&quot; said Miss Heideman, &quot;we don't care to answer that question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Generally, said Miss Heideman, they try not to think about labels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody offhand had a precise label for people from St. Paul, save Keith Schmitz, the short-order cook at Mickey's Diner a few blocks from the Xcel Center, where the GOP will convene. &quot;In the wintertime we're called Eskimos,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 24, state dog wardens conducted routine inspections of two licensed kennels in Berks County and found dogs suffering from fleas and fly sores so severe that they required immediate medical attention. Rather than arrange for veterinary care, the kennel owners shot every dog in their kennels. Eighty innocent dogs died that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of this senseless tragedy, we are more determined than ever to put a stop to such cruel practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Humane League of Lancaster County is ground zero for dealing with the area's infamous puppy mills. It is our staff and volunteers who spend hours providing puppy mill survivors with the first physical contact they may have ever had and introducing these pathetic creatures to comfort and love, which they have never before known. We have hundreds of success stories, yet know there are thousands waiting to be rescued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We urge you to contact your local legislator in support of House Bill 2525, which will make it illegal for anyone but a licensed veterinarian to euthanize dogs in commercial breeding kennels and improve the living conditions for those dogs valued only for the puppies they produce. For additional information on getting involved in the fight against puppy mills, contact the Humane League at 393-6551 or visit us online at www.humaneleague.com.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent Internet search for a particular breed of dog, I found a reputable-looking Web site advertising an American Kennel Club-registered kennel in Ronks. The site was inviting, showing very professional pictures of sweet puppies. I called to make an appointment to see the puppies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon arrival, I found an Amish farm with a long, two-story, white building that, by the sight of cages through the windows and barking dogs, I realized was a puppy mill. When I began moving toward the building to see the puppies,I was told I could not enter; they would bring the puppies to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I engaged the kennel owners, it was obvious they knew very little about this particular breed. They knew nothing about the lineage of the parent dogs, and I was prohibited from seeing them. After reporting the kennel to local authorities and the Department of Agriculture, I was told this kennel was denied its 2008 kennel license and the case was in appeal. It continues to be able to sell puppies during this appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bringing some solace to the situation is that the dog-law enforcement officers do make visits to the kennel. But in the meantime, there are puppies and dogs in a building that is not air-conditioned, living in cages 24/7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Bill 2525 must be passed without reservation so that dog-law enforcement officers can put an end to the &quot;gentle folk&quot; abusing and taking innocent lives. Please share your concern with your local legislators.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a county that so little values the rights of animals, based on the unforgivable atrocities taking place at puppy mills, it did not surprise me to be met with the image of a slaughtered pig's head on the front of the Aug. 24 Lancaster section, with the story on the New Holland barbecue cook-off. That is not to say that I was not utterly repulsed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For that pig to end up as &quot;adornment,&quot; as the caption reads, it most likely endured great suffering in the six or so months of its life leading up to slaughter. Castration without anesthetic is commonplace for newborn male pigs, and it is a standard practice to clip both teeth and tails to reduce biting among the animals. As a result of living on a concrete floor, confined to areas with less than a square foot available for movement, they resort to violence. This is far from their natural, affectionate state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As research indicates the growing health risks of a meat-based diet and worldwide demand for food and energy increases, it makes sense to investigate the benefits of a vegan diet. It is rewarding to contribute to saving the lives of countless animals, as well as to helping reduce the strain on our natural resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's celebrate the wealth of local and organic produce available to us in Lancaster County and do our part to ensure a sustainable future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top of the Section B cover last Sunday featured a color photo of the charred and decapitated head of a pig as part of the &quot;Going whole-hog in New Holland&quot; article. I had mixed reactions to the paper's decision to print the photo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the one hand, such a disgusting and barbaric photo was in poor taste for a family newspaper. And, the photo's caption didn't help matters: &quot;The head of the pig adorns a Momo BBQ table.&quot; Adorns?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, printing that grotesque image of the barbecued head of what had been a living, innocent, sentient being certainly put a real face on pork for many readers. That image probably did more to influence readers' attitudes towards eating meat than anything People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or Farm Sanctuary could have accomplished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent shooting of 80 puppy-mill dogs created justifiable outrage - even without the dogs being barbecued or having their heads &quot;adorn&quot; a table as part of a festive, family-oriented event. But because this was just a pig, and not a potential pet, it's somehow acceptable. Explain that logic to the pig - or a child.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for printing the wonderfully uplifting letter from retired teacher Joan Galloway [Aug. 24]. It is immensely reassuring to know there are such valuable people in this world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, the sacrifices! Having to live a lifestyle that holds up to scrutiny. Keeping a clean record. The personal restrictions. The effort that must have gone into achieving excellent credentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no comparison to the average flapjack-flipping, ditch-digging worker. We are not even worthy to carry her ego.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Haus, Conestoga</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having taught social studies in both the private and public sectors for over a quarter century, I am offended by your editorial [&quot;Do the math,&quot; Aug. 24] that serves to mislead and polarize the community. I raise the following points:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-You neglect to mention that teachers are taxpayers, just like everyone else in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-You compare the &quot;average Lancaster County teacher&quot; salary to the &quot;median household income&quot; in the county. That's comparing apples to oranges. It would be appropriate to compare the salaries of teachers to the salaries of professionals who are required to earn a bachelor's degree and state certification and to continue earning academic credits throughout their careers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-By calling on teachers to &quot;do the right thing,&quot; you imply that they are doing the wrong thing by accepting salaries and benefits obtained during contract negotiations with the elected representatives of their school districts. I wonder how many members of the editorial board of your newspaper are willing to give up their employment benefits so that the price of the newspaper could be reduced to benefit the public.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 2007, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. My only real option was the removal of my prostate. I did have two choices to make: the hospital, and the doctor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family and friends spoke out - Philadelphia, Cleveland, Baltimore, that's where you need to go. After looking into everything and knowing I had the means to go anywhere, I chose Lancaster General Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My decision resulted in a full recovery. The LGH staff was absolutely terrific. Urological Associates of Lancaster Drs. Paul Sieber and Chris Theodoran are among the best in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This July, I was again diagnosed with cancer. This time renal cell carcinoma (a nasty kidney cancer). Again, I chose Lancaster General Hospital. From beginning to end, the LGH staff, Urological Associates of Lancaster and Dr. [Michael} Rommel were outstanding, and I am a grateful and humble cancer survivor for a second time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can go wherever you want. But why would you go elsewhere, when the best care and doctors are right here?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nThe West End Cycling Club put on a great bike race Aug. 23, thanks to volunteers and sponsors, as well as the city police and public works departments. More than 120 cyclists from ages 4 to 70 participated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year the city traffic commission approved a Franklin &amp; Marshall College/Public Works Department proposal to construct 10 bulb-outs (curb extensions) and three traffic humps on Race Avenue. Had this plan been carried out, the bike race could not have been held on Race Avenue. Organizers of Saturday's race hope Race Avenue will remain as it is so future bike races can be held here.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLITICS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reader [Aug. 24] claims that because John McCain is pro-life, he will want to invoke the death penalty for women having abortions. This ridiculous statement is typical of the hysteria that abortion advocates attempt to use as they rationalize the horrendous procedures that have been used to terminate the lives of more than 40 million preborn humans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one in the pro-life movement advocates penalties for women who are themselves victims of the culture of death that permeates our society. They need compassion and understanding and efforts to alleviate the circumstances that led to such a life-changing decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If abortion were no longer legal, the so-called doctors who perform these procedures, usually bottom-feeders who can't make a living preserving life, should have penalties imposed on them such as loss of license, fines and even jail time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While McCain knows what human life is, Obama can't figure out when a baby, much less a fetus, has human rights. This is not surprising, since in addition to being the most aggressive proponent in the U.S. Senate for abortion at every stage of development, including the barbaric, medically useless procedure known as partial-birth abortion, he is opposed to the &quot;Born Alive&quot; bill that would demand lifesaving treatment for infants who survive attempts to destroy them in the womb. Is supporting such horror as being left to die alone in a cold broom closet the kind of &quot;change&quot; America really wants?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates for president were chosen prior to the conventions. What a waste of time and money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe the current primary process is extremely unfair to the majority of the voting public. By the time Pennsylvania held its primary, many candidates had already dropped out of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think the primary election should be held in the same way the presidential election is held - on the same day all across the nation, in June or July, with all serious contenders on the ballot. The top two vote-getters from each party would go out and campaign. Then at the convention in September, the final candidates would be chosen. The presidential election would be held in November, as it is now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeanette Miller, Akron</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first presidential election with both a Democratic and Republican candidate took place in 1856, between Buchanan and Fremont. The problem is both parties have evolved into &quot;Republicrats&quot; and are running candidates that philosophically are the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a left-wing senator from Illinois who is running to the mainstream, and a Republican from Arizona who is content with dumping his party's base when necessary. Can all of us believe a genuine change will occur if either Obama or McCain get elected?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What America needs is a third-party candidate. I would recommend to anyone who is concerned with the direction of our country to research Libertarian candidate Bob Barr. He understands the need for a common-sense foreign policy, keeping Uncle Sam out of your wallet (tax reform), respecting privacy, maintaining the Second Amendment, and reforming both Social Security and health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you decide Bob Barr's agenda is common sense, be sure to cast a ballot for him in the general election. If you are content with our government as it is, then I suggest voting for either the Democratic or Republican candidate because each one knows how to play partisan politics and not get anything done for the American people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot has been written about how similar this presidential election is to others, but no one has mentioned the election of 1896.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the second term of Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, the country fell into a economic slump (much worse than this year's), and Democrats suffered huge setbacks in Congress. They nominated a flamboyant, young, handsome and articulate former congressman from Nebraska named William Jennings Bryan. The Republicans nominated the governor of Ohio and Civil War veteran William McKinley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bryan was 36 and McKinley was 53. Bryan was energetic, crisscrossed the country giving spellbinding speeches. McKinley could not match Bryan's eloquence or energy but gave &quot;front-porch&quot; speeches at his home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKinley went on to win the popular vote by 51 percent . He also won in 1900, beating Bryan once more. He was assassinated early in his second term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest, as they say, is history, though Bryan ran one last time in 1908 and lost to Taft.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Americans of all political parties have suffered both moral and financial blows under George W. Bush. Still, the Republicans advertise doom and gloom if Sen. Obama is elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's the worst that could happen? What if we had eight years of peace and prosperity, ending with a budget surplus, as we had under Bill Clinton?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spin doctors are knocking each other out to jump on the candidates for every slip of the tongue, shredding character, and constantly harping on negative perception and flimsy supposition. A better way is to compare the Web sites of each candidate and get their views in their own words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political diehards who follow a wide array of news sources and feel strongly about their choice can toss off the silliness. The &quot;undecideds,&quot; on the other hand, are not just so many percentage points that will determine the winner. They are real people, and they ought to be helped to make a choice based on truth and important issues, not on innuendo and nit-picking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undoubtedly, in the presidential debates and discussions, one of the obvious exploitations will be age versus youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican's notorious political spin machine will inveigh McCain's experience versus Obama's lack of experience. It may be recalled that Reagan's second term manifested some declining cognitive performance, although he won by a landslide. His opponent (Mondale, 56) did not belabor the age issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republicans would be ill-advised to use experience as a club; to wit, we have been blessed with the likes of Cheney, Wolfowitz and others. See what a catastrophe we now have. I will opt for the talented and intellectual individual and his excellent advisers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read the story about Abigail Horn's son Ricky, who has Tourette's Syndrome [Aug. 17]. My husband and I have two sons: Tyler, 14, has had Tourette's since he was 4, and Joshua has facial tics and obsessive-compulsive disorder. We, too, have had a lifelong battle with schools and their lack of knowledge of Tourette's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe some of the blame is with people who publish information about this disability. Every time I read an article, there is always the same description of Tourette's, but there are so many more symptoms that are important to acknowledge. There are mental tics as well: singing a song before performing a task, repeating what someone has just said under the breath, writing and rewriting on top of numbers and letters; the list goes on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I encourage Abigail and her husband to print out a list of all the tics, available on Web sites, and make copies for teachers, especially substitutes and those teachers who will forever think that your child is faking. We have been through it all. Good luck.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 24, state dog wardens conducted routine inspections of two licensed kennels in Berks County and found dogs suffering from fleas and fly sores so severe that they required immediate medical attention. Rather than arrange for veterinary care, the kennel owners shot every dog in their kennels. Eighty innocent dogs died that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of this senseless tragedy, we are more determined than ever to put a stop to such cruel practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Humane League of Lancaster County is ground zero for dealing with the area's infamous puppy mills. It is our staff and volunteers who spend hours providing puppy mill survivors with the first physical contact they may have ever had and introducing these pathetic creatures to comfort and love, which they have never before known. We have hundreds of success stories, yet know there are thousands waiting to be rescued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We urge you to contact your local legislator in support of House Bill 2525, which will make it illegal for anyone but a licensed veterinarian to euthanize dogs in commercial breeding kennels and improve the living conditions for those dogs valued only for the puppies they produce. For additional information on getting involved in the fight against puppy mills, contact the Humane League at 393-6551 or visit us online at www.humaneleague.com.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent Internet search for a particular breed of dog, I found a reputable-looking Web site advertising an American Kennel Club-registered kennel in Ronks. The site was inviting, showing very professional pictures of sweet puppies. I called to make an appointment to see the puppies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon arrival, I found an Amish farm with a long, two-story, white building that, by the sight of cages through the windows and barking dogs, I realized was a puppy mill. When I began moving toward the building to see the puppies,I was told I could not enter; they would bring the puppies to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I engaged the kennel owners, it was obvious they knew very little about this particular breed. They knew nothing about the lineage of the parent dogs, and I was prohibited from seeing them. After reporting the kennel to local authorities and the Department of Agriculture, I was told this kennel was denied its 2008 kennel license and the case was in appeal. It continues to be able to sell puppies during this appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bringing some solace to the situation is that the dog-law enforcement officers do make visits to the kennel. But in the meantime, there are puppies and dogs in a building that is not air-conditioned, living in cages 24/7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Bill 2525 must be passed without reservation so that dog-law enforcement officers can put an end to the &quot;gentle folk&quot; abusing and taking innocent lives. Please share your concern with your local legislators.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nFor a county that so little values the rights of animals, based on the unforgivable atrocities taking place at puppy mills, it did not surprise me to be met with the image of a slaughtered pig's head on the front of the Aug. 24 Lancaster section, with the story on the New Holland barbecue cook-off. That is not to say that I was not utterly repulsed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For that pig to end up as &quot;adornment,&quot; as the caption reads, it most likely endured great suffering in the six or so months of its life leading up to slaughter. Castration without anesthetic is commonplace for newborn male pigs, and it is a standard practice to clip both teeth and tails to reduce biting among the animals. As a result of living on a concrete floor, confined to areas with less than a square foot available for movement, they resort to violence. This is far from their natural, affectionate state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As research indicates the growing health risks of a meat-based diet and worldwide demand for food and energy increases, it makes sense to investigate the benefits of a vegan diet. It is rewarding to contribute to saving the lives of countless animals, as well as to helping reduce the strain on our natural resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's celebrate the wealth of local and organic produce available to us in Lancaster County and do our part to ensure a sustainable future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top of the Section B cover last Sunday featured a color photo of the charred and decapitated head of a pig as part of the &quot;Going whole-hog in New Holland&quot; article. I had mixed reactions to the paper's decision to print the photo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the one hand, such a disgusting and barbaric photo was in poor taste for a family newspaper. And, the photo's caption didn't help matters: &quot;The head of the pig adorns a Momo BBQ table.&quot; Adorns?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, printing that grotesque image of the barbecued head of what had been a living, innocent, sentient being certainly put a real face on pork for many readers. That image probably did more to influence readers' attitudes towards eating meat than anything People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or Farm Sanctuary could have accomplished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent shooting of 80 puppy-mill dogs created justifiable outrage - even without the dogs being barbecued or having their heads &quot;adorn&quot; a table as part of a festive, family-oriented event. But because this was just a pig, and not a potential pet, it's somehow acceptable. Explain that logic to the pig - or a child.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for printing the wonderfully uplifting letter from retired teacher Joan Galloway [Aug. 24]. It is immensely reassuring to know there are such valuable people in this world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, the sacrifices! Having to live a lifestyle that holds up to scrutiny. Keeping a clean record. The personal restrictions. The effort that must have gone into achieving excellent credentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no comparison to the average flapjack-flipping, ditch-digging worker. We are not even worthy to carry her ego.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Haus, Conestoga</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having taught social studies in both the private and public sectors for over a quarter century, I am offended by your editorial [&quot;Do the math,&quot; Aug. 24] that serves to mislead and polarize the community. I raise the following points:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-You neglect to mention that teachers are taxpayers, just like everyone else in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-You compare the &quot;average Lancaster County teacher&quot; salary to the &quot;median household income&quot; in the county. That's comparing apples to oranges. It would be appropriate to compare the salaries of teachers to the salaries of professionals who are required to earn a bachelor's degree and state certification and to continue earning academic credits throughout their careers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-By calling on teachers to &quot;do the right thing,&quot; you imply that they are doing the wrong thing by accepting salaries and benefits obtained during contract negotiations with the elected representatives of their school districts. I wonder how many members of the editorial board of your newspaper are willing to give up their employment benefits so that the price of the newspaper could be reduced to benefit the public.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 2007, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. My only real option was the removal of my prostate. I did have two choices to make: the hospital, and the doctor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family and friends spoke out - Philadelphia, Cleveland, Baltimore, that's where you need to go. After looking into everything and knowing I had the means to go anywhere, I chose Lancaster General Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My decision resulted in a full recovery. The LGH staff was absolutely terrific. Urological Associates of Lancaster Drs. Paul Sieber and Chris Theodoran are among the best in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This July, I was again diagnosed with cancer. This time renal cell carcinoma (a nasty kidney cancer). Again, I chose Lancaster General Hospital. From beginning to end, the LGH staff, Urological Associates of Lancaster and Dr. [Michael} Rommel were outstanding, and I am a grateful and humble cancer survivor for a second time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can go wherever you want. But why would you go elsewhere, when the best care and doctors are right here?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West End Cycling Club put on a great bike race Aug. 23, thanks to volunteers and sponsors, as well as the city police and public works departments. More than 120 cyclists from ages 4 to 70 participated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year the city traffic commission approved a Franklin &amp; Marshall College/Public Works Department proposal to construct 10 bulb-outs (curb extensions) and three traffic humps on Race Avenue. Had this plan been carried out, the bike race could not have been held on Race Avenue. Organizers of Saturday's race hope Race Avenue will remain as it is so future bike races can be held here.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLITICS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reader [Aug. 24] claims that because John McCain is pro-life, he will want to invoke the death penalty for women having abortions. This ridiculous statement is typical of the hysteria that abortion advocates attempt to use as they rationalize the horrendous procedures that have been used to terminate the lives of more than 40 million preborn humans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one in the pro-life movement advocates penalties for women who are themselves victims of the culture of death that permeates our society. They need compassion and understanding and efforts to alleviate the circumstances that led to such a life-changing decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If abortion were no longer legal, the so-called doctors who perform these procedures, usually bottom-feeders who can't make a living preserving life, should have penalties imposed on them such as loss of license, fines and even jail time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While McCain knows what human life is, Obama can't figure out when a baby, much less a fetus, has human rights. This is not surprising, since in addition to being the most aggressive proponent in the U.S. Senate for abortion at every stage of development, including the barbaric, medically useless procedure known as partial-birth abortion, he is opposed to the &quot;Born Alive&quot; bill that would demand lifesaving treatment for infants who survive attempts to destroy them in the womb. Is supporting such horror as being left to die alone in a cold broom closet the kind of &quot;change&quot; America really wants?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 24, state dog wardens conducted routine inspections of two licensed kennels in Berks County and found dogs suffering from fleas and fly sores so severe that they required immediate medical attention. Rather than arrange for veterinary care, the kennel owners shot every dog in their kennels. Eighty innocent dogs died that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of this senseless tragedy, we are more determined than ever to put a stop to such cruel practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Humane League of Lancaster County is ground zero for dealing with the area's infamous puppy mills. It is our staff and volunteers who spend hours providing puppy mill survivors with the first physical contact they may have ever had and introducing these pathetic creatures to comfort and love, which they have never before known. We have hundreds of success stories, yet know there are thousands waiting to be rescued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We urge you to contact your local legislator in support of House Bill 2525, which will make it illegal for anyone but a licensed veterinarian to euthanize dogs in commercial breeding kennels and improve the living conditions for those dogs valued only for the puppies they produce. For additional information on getting involved in the fight against puppy mills, contact the Humane League at 393-6551 or visit us online at www.humaneleague.com.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent Internet search for a particular breed of dog, I found a reputable-looking Web site advertising an American Kennel Club-registered kennel in Ronks. The site was inviting, showing very professional pictures of sweet puppies. I called to make an appointment to see the puppies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon arrival, I found an Amish farm with a long, two-story, white building that, by the sight of cages through the windows and barking dogs, I realized was a puppy mill. When I began moving toward the building to see the puppies,I was told I could not enter; they would bring the puppies to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I engaged the kennel owners, it was obvious they knew very little about this particular breed. They knew nothing about the lineage of the parent dogs, and I was prohibited from seeing them. After reporting the kennel to local authorities and the Department of Agriculture, I was told this kennel was denied its 2008 kennel license and the case was in appeal. It continues to be able to sell puppies during this appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bringing some solace to the situation is that the dog-law enforcement officers do make visits to the kennel. But in the meantime, there are puppies and dogs in a building that is not air-conditioned, living in cages 24/7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Bill 2525 must be passed without reservation so that dog-law enforcement officers can put an end to the &quot;gentle folk&quot; abusing and taking innocent lives. Please share your concern with your local legislators.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a county that so little values the rights of animals, based on the unforgivable atrocities taking place at puppy mills, it did not surprise me to be met with the image of a slaughtered pig's head on the front of the Aug. 24 Lancaster section, with the story on the New Holland barbecue cook-off. That is not to say that I was not utterly repulsed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For that pig to end up as &quot;adornment,&quot; as the caption reads, it most likely endured great suffering in the six or so months of its life leading up to slaughter. Castration without anesthetic is commonplace for newborn male pigs, and it is a standard practice to clip both teeth and tails to reduce biting among the animals. As a result of living on a concrete floor, confined to areas with less than a square foot available for movement, they resort to violence. This is far from their natural, affectionate state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As research indicates the growing health risks of a meat-based diet and worldwide demand for food and energy increases, it makes sense to investigate the benefits of a vegan diet. It is rewarding to contribute to saving the lives of countless animals, as well as to helping reduce the strain on our natural resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's celebrate the wealth of local and organic produce available to us in Lancaster County and do our part to ensure a sustainable future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top of the Section B cover last Sunday featured a color photo of the charred and decapitated head of a pig as part of the &quot;Going whole-hog in New Holland&quot; article. I had mixed reactions to the paper's decision to print the photo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the one hand, such a disgusting and barbaric photo was in poor taste for a family newspaper. And, the photo's caption didn't help matters: &quot;The head of the pig adorns a Momo BBQ table.&quot; Adorns?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, printing that grotesque image of the barbecued head of what had been a living, innocent, sentient being certainly put a real face on pork for many readers. That image probably did more to influence readers' attitudes towards eating meat than anything People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or Farm Sanctuary could have accomplished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent shooting of 80 puppy-mill dogs created justifiable outrage - even without the dogs being barbecued or having their heads &quot;adorn&quot; a table as part of a festive, family-oriented event. But because this was just a pig, and not a potential pet, it's somehow acceptable. Explain that logic to the pig - or a child.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for printing the wonderfully uplifting letter from retired teacher Joan Galloway [Aug. 24]. It is immensely reassuring to know there are such valuable people in this world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, the sacrifices! Having to live a lifestyle that holds up to scrutiny. Keeping a clean record. The personal restrictions. The effort that must have gone into achieving excellent credentials.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having taught social studies in both the private and public sectors for over a quarter century, I am offended by your editorial [&quot;Do the math,&quot; Aug. 24] that serves to mislead and polarize the community. I raise the following points:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-You neglect to mention that teachers are taxpayers, just like everyone else in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-You compare the &quot;average Lancaster County teacher&quot; salary to the &quot;median household income&quot; in the county. That's comparing apples to oranges. It would be appropriate to compare the salaries of teachers to the salaries of professionals who are required to earn a bachelor's degree and state certification and to continue earning academic credits throughout their careers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-By calling on teachers to &quot;do the right thing,&quot; you imply that they are doing the wrong thing by accepting salaries and benefits obtained during contract negotiations with the elected representatives of their school districts. I wonder how many members of the editorial board of your newspaper are willing to give up their employment benefits so that the price of the newspaper could be reduced to benefit the public.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 2007, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. My only real option was the removal of my prostate. I did have two choices to make: the hospital, and the doctor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family and friends spoke out - Philadelphia, Cleveland, Baltimore, that's where you need to go. After looking into everything and knowing I had the means to go anywhere, I chose Lancaster General Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My decision resulted in a full recovery. The LGH staff was absolutely terrific. Urological Associates of Lancaster Drs. Paul Sieber and Chris Theodoran are among the best in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This July, I was again diagnosed with cancer. This time renal cell carcinoma (a nasty kidney cancer). Again, I chose Lancaster General Hospital. From beginning to end, the LGH staff, Urological Associates of Lancaster and Dr. [Michael} Rommel were outstanding, and I am a grateful and humble cancer survivor for a second time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can go wherever you want. But why would you go elsewhere, when the best care and doctors are right here?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year the city traffic commission approved a Franklin &amp; Marshall College/Public Works Department proposal to construct 10 bulb-outs (curb extensions) and three traffic humps on Race Avenue.

Organizers of Saturday's race hope Race Avenue will remain as it is so future bike races can be held here.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLITICS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reader [Aug. 24] claims that because John McCain is pro-life, he will want to invoke the death penalty for women having abortions. This ridiculous statement is typical of the hysteria that abortion advocates attempt to use as they rationalize the horrendous procedures that have been used to terminate the lives of more than 40 million preborn humans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one in the pro-life movement advocates penalties for women who are themselves victims of the culture of death that permeates our society. They need compassion and understanding and efforts to alleviate the circumstances that led to such a life-changing decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If abortion were no longer legal, the so-called doctors who perform these procedures, usually bottom-feeders who can't make a living preserving life, should have penalties imposed on them such as loss of license, fines and even jail time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While McCain knows what human life is, Obama can't figure out when a baby, much less a fetus, has human rights. This is not surprising, since in addition to being the most aggressive proponent in the U.S. Senate for abortion at every stage of development, including the barbaric, medically useless procedure known as partial-birth abortion, he is opposed to the &quot;Born Alive&quot; bill that would demand lifesaving treatment for infants who survive attempts to destroy them in the womb. Is supporting such horror as being left to die alone in a cold broom closet the kind of &quot;change&quot; America really wants?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates for president were chosen prior to the conventions. What a waste of time and money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe the current primary process is extremely unfair to the majority of the voting public. By the time Pennsylvania held its primary, many candidates had already dropped out of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think the primary election should be held in the same way the presidential election is held - on the same day all across the nation, in June or July, with all serious contenders on the ballot. The top two vote-getters from each party would go out and campaign. Then at the convention in September, the final candidates would be chosen. The presidential election would be held in November, as it is now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeanette Miller, Akron</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first presidential election with both a Democratic and Republican candidate took place in 1856, between Buchanan and Fremont. The problem is both parties have evolved into &quot;Republicrats&quot; and are running candidates that philosophically are the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a left-wing senator from Illinois who is running to the mainstream, and a Republican from Arizona who is content with dumping his party's base when necessary. Can all of us believe a genuine change will occur if either Obama or McCain get elected?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What America needs is a third-party candidate. I would recommend to anyone who is concerned with the direction of our country to research Libertarian candidate Bob Barr. He understands the need for a common-sense foreign policy, keeping Uncle Sam out of your wallet (tax reform), respecting privacy, maintaining the Second Amendment, and reforming both Social Security and health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you decide Bob Barr's agenda is common sense, be sure to cast a ballot for him in the general election. If you are content with our government as it is, then I suggest voting for either the Democratic or Republican candidate because each one knows how to play partisan politics and not get anything done for the American people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the second term of Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, the country fell into a economic slump (much worse than this year's), and Democrats suffered huge setbacks in Congress. They nominated a flamboyant, young, handsome and articulate former congressman from Nebraska named William Jennings Bryan. The Republicans nominated the governor of Ohio and Civil War veteran William McKinley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bryan was 36 and McKinley was 53. Bryan was energetic, crisscrossed the country giving spellbinding speeches. McKinley could not match Bryan's eloquence or energy but gave &quot;front-porch&quot; speeches at his home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKinley went on to win the popular vote by 51 percent . He also won in 1900, beating Bryan once more. He was assassinated early in his second term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest, as they say, is history, though Bryan ran one last time in 1908 and lost to Taft.</SPAN></P>

There are mental tics as well: singing a song before performing a task, repeating what someone has just said under the breath, writing and rewriting on top of numbers and letters; the list goes on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I encourage Abigail and her husband to print out a list of all the tics, available on Web sites, and make copies for teachers, especially substitutes and those teachers who will forever think that your child is faking.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 24, state dog wardens conducted routine inspections of two licensed kennels in Berks County and found dogs suffering from fleas and fly sores so severe that they required immediate medical attention. Rather than arrange for veterinary care, the kennel owners shot every dog in their kennels. Eighty innocent dogs died that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of this senseless tragedy, we are more determined than ever to put a stop to such cruel practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Humane League of Lancaster County is ground zero for dealing with the area's infamous puppy mills. It is our staff and volunteers who spend hours providing puppy mill survivors with the first physical contact they may have ever had and introducing these pathetic creatures to comfort and love, which they have never before known. We have hundreds of success stories, yet know there are thousands waiting to be rescued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We urge you to contact your local legislator in support of House Bill 2525, which will make it illegal for anyone but a licensed veterinarian to euthanize dogs in commercial breeding kennels and improve the living conditions for those dogs valued only for the puppies they produce. For additional information on getting involved in the fight against puppy mills, contact the Humane League at 393-6551 or visit us online at www.humaneleague.com.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent Internet search for a particular breed of dog, I found a reputable-looking Web site advertising an American Kennel Club-registered kennel in Ronks. The site was inviting, showing very professional pictures of sweet puppies. I called to make an appointment to see the puppies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon arrival, I found an Amish farm with a long, two-story, white building that, by the sight of cages through the windows and barking dogs, I realized was a puppy mill. When I began moving toward the building to see the puppies,I was told I could not enter; they would bring the puppies to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I engaged the kennel owners, it was obvious they knew very little about this particular breed. They knew nothing about the lineage of the parent dogs, and I was prohibited from seeing them. After reporting the kennel to local authorities and the Department of Agriculture, I was told this kennel was denied its 2008 kennel license and the case was in appeal. It continues to be able to sell puppies during this appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bringing some solace to the situation is that the dog-law enforcement officers do make visits to the kennel. But in the meantime, there are puppies and dogs in a building that is not air-conditioned, living in cages 24/7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Bill 2525 must be passed without reservation so that dog-law enforcement officers can put an end to the &quot;gentle folk&quot; abusing and taking innocent lives. Please share your concern with your local legislators.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nFor a county that so little values the rights of animals, based on the unforgivable atrocities taking place at puppy mills, it did not surprise me to be met with the image of a slaughtered pig's head on the front of the Aug. 24 Lancaster section, with the story on the New Holland barbecue cook-off. That is not to say that I was not utterly repulsed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For that pig to end up as &quot;adornment,&quot; as the caption reads, it most likely endured great suffering in the six or so months of its life leading up to slaughter. Castration without anesthetic is commonplace for newborn male pigs, and it is a standard practice to clip both teeth and tails to reduce biting among the animals. As a result of living on a concrete floor, confined to areas with less than a square foot available for movement, they resort to violence. This is far from their natural, affectionate state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As research indicates the growing health risks of a meat-based diet and worldwide demand for food and energy increases, it makes sense to investigate the benefits of a vegan diet. It is rewarding to contribute to saving the lives of countless animals, as well as to helping reduce the strain on our natural resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's celebrate the wealth of local and organic produce available to us in Lancaster County and do our part to ensure a sustainable future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top of the Section B cover last Sunday featured a color photo of the charred and decapitated head of a pig as part of the &quot;Going whole-hog in New Holland&quot; article. I had mixed reactions to the paper's decision to print the photo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the one hand, such a disgusting and barbaric photo was in poor taste for a family newspaper. And, the photo's caption didn't help matters: &quot;The head of the pig adorns a Momo BBQ table.&quot; Adorns?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, printing that grotesque image of the barbecued head of what had been a living, innocent, sentient being certainly put a real face on pork for many readers. That image probably did more to influence readers' attitudes towards eating meat than anything People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or Farm Sanctuary could have accomplished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent shooting of 80 puppy-mill dogs created justifiable outrage - even without the dogs being barbecued or having their heads &quot;adorn&quot; a table as part of a festive, family-oriented event. But because this was just a pig, and not a potential pet, it's somehow acceptable. Explain that logic to the pig - or a child.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEACHER BENEFITS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for printing the wonderfully uplifting letter from retired teacher Joan Galloway [Aug. 24]. It is immensely reassuring to know there are such valuable people in this world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, the sacrifices! Having to live a lifestyle that holds up to scrutiny. Keeping a clean record. The personal restrictions. The effort that must have gone into achieving excellent credentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no comparison to the average flapjack-flipping, ditch-digging worker. We are not even worthy to carry her ego.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Haus, Conestoga</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having taught social studies in both the private and public sectors for over a quarter century, I am offended by your editorial [&quot;Do the math,&quot; Aug. 24] that serves to mislead and polarize the community. I raise the following points:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-You neglect to mention that teachers are taxpayers, just like everyone else in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-You compare the &quot;average Lancaster County teacher&quot; salary to the &quot;median household income&quot; in the county. That's comparing apples to oranges. It would be appropriate to compare the salaries of teachers to the salaries of professionals who are required to earn a bachelor's degree and state certification and to continue earning academic credits throughout their careers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-By calling on teachers to &quot;do the right thing,&quot; you imply that they are doing the wrong thing by accepting salaries and benefits obtained during contract negotiations with the elected representatives of their school districts. I wonder how many members of the editorial board of your newspaper are willing to give up their employment benefits so that the price of the newspaper could be reduced to benefit the public.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 2007, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. My only real option was the removal of my prostate. I did have two choices to make: the hospital, and the doctor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family and friends spoke out - Philadelphia, Cleveland, Baltimore, that's where you need to go. After looking into everything and knowing I had the means to go anywhere, I chose Lancaster General Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My decision resulted in a full recovery. The LGH staff was absolutely terrific. Urological Associates of Lancaster Drs. Paul Sieber and Chris Theodoran are among the best in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This July, I was again diagnosed with cancer. This time renal cell carcinoma (a nasty kidney cancer). Again, I chose Lancaster General Hospital. From beginning to end, the LGH staff, Urological Associates of Lancaster and Dr. [Michael} Rommel were outstanding, and I am a grateful and humble cancer survivor for a second time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can go wherever you want. But why would you go elsewhere, when the best care and doctors are right here?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West End Cycling Club put on a great bike race Aug. 23, thanks to volunteers and sponsors, as well as the city police and public works departments. More than 120 cyclists from ages 4 to 70 participated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year the city traffic commission approved a Franklin &amp; Marshall College/Public Works Department proposal to construct 10 bulb-outs (curb extensions) and three traffic humps on Race Avenue. Had this plan been carried out, the bike race could not have been held on Race Avenue. Organizers of Saturday's race hope Race Avenue will remain as it is so future bike races can be held here.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLITICS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reader [Aug. 24] claims that because John McCain is pro-life, he will want to invoke the death penalty for women having abortions. This ridiculous statement is typical of the hysteria that abortion advocates attempt to use as they rationalize the horrendous procedures that have been used to terminate the lives of more than 40 million preborn humans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one in the pro-life movement advocates penalties for women who are themselves victims of the culture of death that permeates our society. They need compassion and understanding and efforts to alleviate the circumstances that led to such a life-changing decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If abortion were no longer legal, the so-called doctors who perform these procedures, usually bottom-feeders who can't make a living preserving life, should have penalties imposed on them such as loss of license, fines and even jail time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While McCain knows what human life is, Obama can't figure out when a baby, much less a fetus, has human rights. This is not surprising, since in addition to being the most aggressive proponent in the U.S. Senate for abortion at every stage of development, including the barbaric, medically useless procedure known as partial-birth abortion, he is opposed to the &quot;Born Alive&quot; bill that would demand lifesaving treatment for infants who survive attempts to destroy them in the womb. Is supporting such horror as being left to die alone in a cold broom closet the kind of &quot;change&quot; America really wants?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates for president were chosen prior to the conventions. What a waste of time and money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe the current primary process is extremely unfair to the majority of the voting public. By the time Pennsylvania held its primary, many candidates had already dropped out of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think the primary election should be held in the same way the presidential election is held - on the same day all across the nation, in June or July, with all serious contenders on the ballot. The top two vote-getters from each party would go out and campaign. Then at the convention in September, the final candidates would be chosen. The presidential election would be held in November, as it is now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeanette Miller, Akron</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first presidential election with both a Democratic and Republican candidate took place in 1856, between Buchanan and Fremont. The problem is both parties have evolved into &quot;Republicrats&quot; and are running candidates that philosophically are the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a left-wing senator from Illinois who is running to the mainstream, and a Republican from Arizona who is content with dumping his party's base when necessary. Can all of us believe a genuine change will occur if either Obama or McCain get elected?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What America needs is a third-party candidate. I would recommend to anyone who is concerned with the direction of our country to research Libertarian candidate Bob Barr. He understands the need for a common-sense foreign policy, keeping Uncle Sam out of your wallet (tax reform), respecting privacy, maintaining the Second Amendment, and reforming both Social Security and health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you decide Bob Barr's agenda is common sense, be sure to cast a ballot for him in the general election. If you are content with our government as it is, then I suggest voting for either the Democratic or Republican candidate because each one knows how to play partisan politics and not get anything done for the American people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot has been written about how similar this presidential election is to others, but no one has mentioned the election of 1896.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the second term of Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, the country fell into a economic slump (much worse than this year's), and Democrats suffered huge setbacks in Congress. They nominated a flamboyant, young, handsome and articulate former congressman from Nebraska named William Jennings Bryan. The Republicans nominated the governor of Ohio and Civil War veteran William McKinley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bryan was 36 and McKinley was 53. Bryan was energetic, crisscrossed the country giving spellbinding speeches. McKinley could not match Bryan's eloquence or energy but gave &quot;front-porch&quot; speeches at his home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKinley went on to win the popular vote by 51 percent . He also won in 1900, beating Bryan once more. He was assassinated early in his second term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest, as they say, is history, though Bryan ran one last time in 1908 and lost to Taft.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Americans of all political parties have suffered both moral and financial blows under George W. Bush. Still, the Republicans advertise doom and gloom if Sen. Obama is elected. What's the worst that could happen? What if we had eight years of peace and prosperity, ending with a budget surplus, as we had under Bill Clinton? The spin doctors are knocking each other out to jump on the candidates for every slip of the tongue, shredding character, and constantly harping on negative perception and flimsy supposition. A better way is to compare the Web sites of each candidate and get their views in their own words. Political diehards who follow a wide array of news sources and feel strongly about their choice can toss off the silliness. The &quot;undecideds,&quot; on the other hand, are not just so many percentage points that will determine the winner. They are real people, and they ought to be helped to make a choice based on truth and important issues, not on innuendo and nit-picking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nUndoubtedly, in the presidential debates and discussions, one of the obvious exploitations will be age versus youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican's notorious political spin machine will inveigh McCain's experience versus Obama's lack of experience. It may be recalled that Reagan's second term manifested some declining cognitive performance, although he won by a landslide. His opponent (Mondale, 56) did not belabor the age issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republicans would be ill-advised to use experience as a club; to wit, we have been blessed with the likes of Cheney, Wolfowitz and others.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SASHA: Hi, Daddy!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SASHA: What city are you in, Daddy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICE-OVER: It was after 10 o'clock, and she didn't know where her daddy was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHN McCAIN: I'm John McCain and I approve this message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICE-OVER: Out-of-control gas prices. An uncertain economy. A health care crisis. A wasteful war in Iraq. And what do we get from the John McCain campaign?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SASHA: Hi, Daddy!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICE-OVER: More of the same old political nonsense from some guy who doesn't even know how many houses he owns. He criticizes Sasha Obama, but does he have any ideas of his own?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SASHA: Hi, Daddy!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICE-OVER: And who's John McCain's daddy? George Bush. McCain has supported George Bush's failed policies more than we can ever say in a short TV ad. Are we ready for four more years of George Bush?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SASHA: No, Daddy!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICE-OVER: Like a lot of young people, Sasha believes in hope. She hopes for a better America. And ending tax breaks for big oil companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SASHA: I'm Sasha Obama and my daddy approves this message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICE-OVER: Sasha Obama says she believes in hope. But it'll take more than hope and cute kids to get this country back on track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SASHA: Hi, Daddy!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICE-OVER: She is very cute, but where was she when John McCain was a prisoner of war for 5 1/2  years in Vietnam? Was she even aware that John McCain was a prisoner of war for 5 1/2  years in Vietnam? Did she even care?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SASHA: Hi, Daddy!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICE-OVER: She's a little kid who's not ready to lead. She's not the kind of change we can believe in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SASHA: Hi, Daddy!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICE-OVER: This kid is getting annoying. Does she even care that John McCain was a prisoner of war for 5 1/2  years in Vietnam? Did you know that John McCain was a prisoner of war for 5 1/2  years in Vietnam? This snot-nosed little brat stands there looking all cute and everything, not even knowing that John McCain was a prisoner of war for 5 1/2  years in Vietnam. Little brat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SASHA: Hi, Daddy!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICE-OVER: Shut up, already!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCAIN: I'm John McCain and I approve this message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICE-OVER: John McCain thinks he can call Sasha Obama a snot-nosed little brat? Where does he get off? The guy doesn't even know how many houses he owns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCAIN: My friends . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICE-OVER: And what's with him always referring to us as &quot;my friends&quot;? We're not his friends. When's the last time he called us up and asked how our dog was doing? When's the last time he stopped by the house to borrow money to buy another house? When's the last time he invited you over to one of his seven or eight houses to watch a football game?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCAIN: My friends . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICE-OVER: He doesn't know what that means. He doesn't even know how many houses he has. My friends. Please.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OBAMA: I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICE-OVER: Recently, the Democrats have attacked John McCain because he doesn't know how many houses he owns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCAIN: I'll have my staff get back to you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICE-OVER: He doesn't need to know how many houses he has to be president. He has a staff for that. He's not the kind of elitist person who knows, just off the top of his head, how many houses he owns. He's a regular American, just like all of you. If someone were to ask you how many pairs of socks you own, could you tell them? And he was a prisoner of war for 5 1/2  years in Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCAIN: I'm John McCain and I approve this message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICE-OVER: The same old politics. Only one candidate believes we should get back to discussing the important issues facing America: Is Sasha Obama cute or what?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aug. 31--Ron Smith of Dallastown said he'll probably catch some of the Republican National Convention on TV next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's OK with John McCain, if not exactly enthused. He wishes that McCain had a stronger record against abortion and in favor of gun rights. But he figures that when it comes to national security and the economy, the Arizona senator stands head and shoulders above Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So there's no question Smith will vote for McCain come November. He wouldn't be averse to doing some campaign work for the candidate, either. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's not my first selection, but I'm willing to support him,&quot; Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Craig Smith, a professor of communications studies at California State University, Long Beach, said McCain's going to need voters such as Ron Smith if</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he's going to win the general election. With the margin of potential swing voters already narrowed since 2004, they'll need crossover Democrats as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the next few days, Craig Smith said, expect to see the national Republican Party reinforcing Ron Smith's reasoning -- that McCain might not be flashy, but he's by far the more pragmatic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They understand that the economy is very important, and they would be wise to talk about it,&quot; Craig Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Smith knows a thing or two about trying to get out a message during a national convention, and the difference that message can make in the subsequent vote. He's a former speechwriter for two presidents: Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the start of the Republican National Convention in 1988, Michael Dukakis led George H.W. Bush in the polls by 10 points. By the time the convention was over, the elder Bush led by six points and never fell behind again for the rest of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What made the difference, Craig Smith said, is that Dukakis was vague enough to let his Republican opponents define him at their convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since his ascendancy to presidential contender, Obama has struggled with a similar perception of vagueness, Craig Smith said. If McCain and his advisors are smart, they'll play off that and present McCain as the man with nuts-and-bolts solutions to the nation's problems. In effect, they'll use Obama's considerable charisma against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though McCain's campaign ended the week with an ad complimenting Obama, Smith said the campaign took a gamble by running negative ads during the Democratic convention. They now leave themselves vulnerable to the Democrats using a similar tactic in the coming week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In previous years, both parties have observed a kind of gentleman's agreement in staying clear of each other during their respective conventions. But this year, of course, is far from typical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extended primary battle between Obama and Hillary Clinton led to unusually late conventions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain selected first-term Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, making her the first Republican woman on a presidential ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throw in the scheduling conflict with the Olympics, and you end up with the first back-to-back political conventions since the 1920s, Craig Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of that, neither party can count on the distinctive bump in the polls they'd ordinarily get after their respective conventions. That may be why the race is getting so contentious so early, Craig Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's more of a gloves-off mentality among the two campaigns,&quot; Craig Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Carville &quot;Peck&quot; Foster, chairman of the York County Republican Party, compares the effect of the back-to-back conventions with two out-of-synch waves that collide and diminish each other's power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Foster said the two conventions will be distinct. He acknowledges that the Democratic convention had more inherent drama, with the questions surrounding Obama and Clinton's reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he also said a lack of drama will work to the Republicans' advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think in the Republican convention, you'll see a very, very unified convention,&quot; Foster said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tjoyce@ydr.com; 771-2089</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE DELEGATES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates to the Republican National Convention from the 19th congressional district are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--- Main delegates: Nancy Ostot of Enola, Dick Stewart of New Cumberland, Marilyn Gillispie of Jacobus and Muriel Anne Crabbs of Hanover.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John S. McCain's daring choice of Gov. Sarah Palin gives him the chance to bolster his appeal to two very different constituencies -- former supporters of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and conservative activists with whom he has had a sometimes rocky relationship over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the relatively short resume of the new Alaska governor risked undercutting one of the core arguments of his candidacy -- his relentless contention that Sen. Barack Obama lacks the experience to be commander-in-chief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the long-term effect of the surprise selection, it was clearly a success by one crucial measure. Mr. McCain's appearance yesterday with the 44-year-old mother of five robbed the Democratic ticket of some of the media afterglow that they might have expected from Mr. Obama's spectacular speech the night before in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speech was witnessed by 80,000 people inside Denver's Invesco Field and 40 million nationwide on television, an audience larger than the one that witnessed the Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It created a buzz for sure, and I don't know that any of the other [potential] picks would have created the same kind of buzz,&quot; Brad Coker, managing director of Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Research, said of Mr. McCain's choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign will use Ms. Palin, a governor from a state about as far beyond the Beltway as possible, to reinforce the maverick image that Mr. McCain has long embraced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that image has often come at the expense of Mr. McCain's relationship with the movement conservative leaders traditionally influential with the GOP base. Ms. Palin's strong social conservatism and reputation as a fiscal hawk were applauded yesterday by a variety of conservative figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is great news,&quot; said Grover Norquist, whose Washington roundtable has had an outsize influence on conservative polices and talking points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She ran in a Republican primary on tax and spending issues ... she's very Reaganesque in that sense,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Palin herself spotlighted the effort to peel away the support of former Clinton partisans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was rightly noted in Denver this week that Hillary [Rodham Clinton] left 18 million cracks in the highest, hardest glass ceiling in America,&quot; she said with Mr. McCain at her side. &quot;But it turns out that the women of America aren't finished yet, and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Brabender, a Republican political consultant, argued that &quot;there's a lot of women who probably look at the Democratic ticket and say 'Why couldn't you pick a woman?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Palin, who gave birth to her fifth child in April, is an ardent opponent of abortion. Her stand on the intensely felt issue figures to be a high hurdle for support for many Democratic feminists, such as the activists who bid a reluctant farewell to Mrs. Clinton's candidacy this week in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no way,&quot; Tom Vilsack, the former Iowa governor and early Clinton supporter, said of the prospect of the New York senator's partisans migrating to the McCain camp. &quot;It's all about the Supreme Court,&quot; said his wife, Christie Vilsack, herself a prominent figure in Democratic politics in the battleground state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Coker maintained that the Democratic activists at the core of the Clinton campaign were probably beyond the GOP's reach regardless of how disappointed they may be with the fate of the Clinton candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said that the Palin pick could reinforce the GOP ticket's appeal with some other women voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a broader body of women 35 to 55 that Obama has had problems with, and she gives McCain more of a chance with those women,&quot; the pollster said. &quot;[Mrs. Clinton] got a lot of women in places like Kentucky and West Virginia to vote for her in some of the later primaries; [Ms. Palin] is going to help give him a shot with some of those.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Palin's rugged Alaskan roots -- she's married to an oil field worker and commercial fisherman who holds a United Steelworkers card -- could serve as a counter to recent Democratic efforts to portray Mr. McCain as an out-of-touch plutocrat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can you go wrong with a mooseburger-eating, ice-fishing governor,&quot; Sandra Froman, a former NRA president said in a conference call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But her relatively short record in government will raise questions about her credentials as a president-in-waiting, particularly as she joins a ticket headed by the 72-year old Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her dearth of foreign policy experience will produce an even sharper focus on her performance in the vice presidential debate against Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose foreign policy expertise was noted by figures including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice after his selection by Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chuck Rocha, the political director of the United Steelworkers, applauded the fact that Ms. Palin's husband is a USW member, but insisted that fact would have little influence with the union's members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain is the candidate and he has the record that steelworkers will be voting against,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of the United Steelworkers union in Pennsylvania said the fact that the husband of John McCain's vice presidential running mate belongs to the union will have no impact on the union's support for the Democratic ticket.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our membership doesn't care whether a candidate is a Democrat, Republican or independent,&quot; said John DeFazio, president of the union in Pennsylvania, which has about 70,000 members and supports Democrats Barack Obama and Joe Biden. &quot;They care about the issues. When they cast their vote, they will be looking for people they believe will work in the best interests of labor.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain on Friday selected Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate. Palin's husband, Todd Palin, is a commercial fisherman and oil field worker. He worked for 18 years on Alaska's North Slope for BP and is a member of the United Steelworkers union. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DeFazio said Palin &quot;doesn't have the qualifications to run the country.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union's international president, Leo W. Gerard, issued a statement echoing DeFazio's sentiments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important to realize that while the governor's husband is a member of a union, this does not automatically qualify her for an on-the-job training program to become a heartbeat away from the presidency,&quot; Gerard said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And while her husband is one of 850,000 dues-paying members ... it does nothing to absolve Senator McCain of his long history of anti-union sentiment and anti-worker actions.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITOR'S NOTE As the presidential campaign rolls through its final weeks, The Associated Press is offering an occasional series of stories looking closely at how ordinary voters are sizing up the issues and candidates and making up their minds. This kickoff story takes the pulse of people along &quot;Main Streets&quot; in communities coast to coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">%byline(By PAULINE ARRILLAGA%)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">%bytitle(AP National Writer%) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">%endtag(%)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the political conventions play out on TV, real life plays out along America's main streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters there say they are living the issues that convention speakers go on and on about. To them, the sputtering economy is not a policy dilemma, it's working extra shifts to cover the bills. Energy? They see it at the pump and in the pass-along price hikes at their small businesses. The war? They worry for kids they've watched grow up, now marching off to Iraq and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what folks interviewed along five thoroughfares across the country say people like Debra Scavo, an out-of-work interior designer who lives on Central Avenue, Phoenix's version of &quot;Main Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Living off credit cards and dwindling savings, driving a friend's car after selling her own, praying each night for a job so she can pay her mortgage, she describes herself as ordinary, average, one of those everyday Americans the politicians on TV talk about as the parties gather Democrats last week in Denver, Republicans this week in St. Paul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's politics, says Scavo. &quot;Entertainment,&quot; she declares, like &quot;Survivor&quot; or &quot;American Idol&quot; or any other reality program that comes off as more style than substance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Real life is found on Central Avenue and streets like it in places like Sunbury, Pa., Wake Forest, N.C., Fremont, Calif., and Miami Beach where more Americans who think of themselves as &quot;ordinary&quot; are grappling with the issues and pondering the traits they're looking for in their leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These main streets of America hubs of their respective communities and, in a larger sense, the heart of our nation reflect good times past, the struggles of the present and a mostly optimistic, sometimes cynical, spirit guiding the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the front porch of &quot;Pop&quot; Snyder's Lunch, owner Bill Hudson takes a drag on his cigar and surveys the world in front of him. This is Market Street, the main thoroughfare of Sunbury, Pa., pop. 10,000. It's a lovely downtown, with pleasing architecture and a small-town bustle that masks deeper problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is what Hudson sees: Traffic, but the cars seem to be passing through. Parking that's too plentiful. A large commercial building that sits vacant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though economists say otherwise, Hudson, 61, believes the country is headed for another depression. He sees it in his own business, where he is trying to hold the line on prices. He sees it in Sunbury, and in the nation as a whole: &quot;I don't know how people who are retired and living on Social Security are going to survive the winter with food prices and oil prices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's voting, unenthusiastically, for the Republican, John McCain, though Hudson admits he doesn't pay much attention to politics. Working 12-hour days, he doesn't have the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up the block at McGuigan's Public House, 25-year-old waitress and bartender April Cornell sits on the front steps, too, waiting patiently for the first customer of the day. It's almost noon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life hasn't turned out as Cornell envisioned it. When her daughter Kianna was born five years ago, she planned to be a stay-at-home mom. For a while, her husband's income was enough. But gas was $1.59 then, and everything else a bit cheaper, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, she logs 16 hours each Tuesday, another 16 on Friday, and five hours each on Wednesdays and Thursdays at McGuigan's, earning $4 an hour plus tips. She cleans houses, to boot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cornell, a registered independent, is avidly following the campaign &quot;I'm a huge CNN fan&quot; but is torn about her choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither McCain nor Democrat Barack Obama are talking about the things that matter, she says. Maybe they don't know how.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want McCain or Obama to walk one week in my shoes. Neither one of them are like me. I don't get carted around in a limousine. I don't get trips to Hawaii. I didn't even go on vacation this year. I can't even tell you the last time I was to a beach. You know, (Obama) being in Hawaii, McCain's wife owning what is it, a brewery? and not even knowing how many properties they own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know how many properties I own.&quot; She laughs. &quot;I own one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-five minutes later, Cornell picks herself up off the steps and heads back inside the restaurant, still waiting for her first customer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As main streets go, Wake Forest's South White Street has done a better job than most at reinventing itself. Except for the occasional empty storefront, the brick and stucco buildings are occupied by businesses that have found a niche like Shorty's grill, here for 92 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For $1.65, third-generation proprietor Bill Joyner will serve you the house specialty a beef-and-pork hot dog with onions, mustard and homemade chili, &quot;all the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We ain't got anything that's low-cholesterol,&quot; the 56-year-old Joyner says from behind a counter lined with honey buns and Moon Pies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When times are tough, Joyner's trade booms. People want &quot;something cheap.&quot; Nonetheless, during July Fourth week Joyner had to raise prices: hot dogs, by 20 cents; everything else, by a quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fuel delivery charges, he explains. &quot;They used to not ever do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the counter, diner Rusty Kelley, who owns of a grading and hauling company, notes his fuel costs have quintupled to around $50,000 a month, while his profits have dipped 30 percent &quot;easy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As smart as our country is, we ought to be able to come up with some kind of alternative fuel. ... Whether it's water, whether it's steam or whether it's electric, we as a whole are smart enough to get away from some of this fuel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 45-year-old registered Republican thinks Obama is leaning in the right direction on that issue, but he worries about the candidate's youth and inexperience. That bothers Joyner, too, but so does McCain's age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's too old,&quot; he says. &quot;It'll take a toll on you, being president. It does everybody else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman is hard at work, smoothing out and folding four baskets of clothes at the Wash and Dry on Thornton Avenue in Fremont, nestled between San Francisco and Silicon Valley. But Estela Peinado knows hard work. It is as much a part of her as her Mexican heritage, or the children she put through college on money earned baking bread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This main street is a pollster's dream. If the statistics tell us the economy and the war are foremost on Americans' minds, the Americans here agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's Peinado, 61, for whom retirement is a fantasy. She and her 65-year-old husband share a house with a grown daughter, a son and his wife, helping them out as they look for work. She hears the candidates' speeches on Spanish-language television, but she wishes she could address them instead. Fix the economy, she'd say. Now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I go shopping, I can't buy meat; we're sticking to chicken. We don't go out to eat,&quot; she says in Spanish, smoothing and folding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next door, his elbows on the worn counter of Tariq Insurance Agency, Tariq Malik has given the election a lot of thought. He has nothing but time to think and worry, ever since the bottom fell out of the housing market and his business went from issuing 200 policies a month to two or three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one is refinancing, no one is selling, there is nothing, nothing, nothing,&quot; says Malik, 44, waving the Pakistan Times as he talks, frustrated with standing all day in an empty shop and with the sacrifices he's asked of his wife and four boys. He's lost much of what he'd built since arriving in the United States from Pakistan in 1991 and then becoming a U.S. citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Escalating mortgage payments cost the family their five-bedroom home; they crowd now into a three-bedroom place. Credit card bills have gone unpaid, and creditors are clamoring. There were no vacations this summer. Instead, Malik blew off steam playing pickup soccer with other Pakistani-Americans against a team of Brazilians in a local park. His team lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the presidential race: &quot;I don't care who wins or who loses, as long as there is food in our kitchen, and the killing stops,&quot; he says, referring both to the violence in Pakistan and the war in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This killing weighs heavily on Rick Gonzalez, too, a barber nearby. He knows eight young men and women who have served in Iraq or signed up, including a nephew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are kids I saw grow up, and join right out of high school. One of them, he came back, tried to get a job, but was really shaken up. You know how they come back. ... He couldn't make it outside the service, so he signed up for another round.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami's Ocean Drive is a place that lives up to stereotypes: shirtless men in board shorts and women in bikini tops; big, frozen, unnaturally colored drinks; costumed dancers atop a bar. But there are apartments, too, and offices, which remind visitors this main street is not just a tourist playground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drew Hockemeier is no tourist, this place no playground for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven-day work weeks have caught up with the 26-year-old, and so on a weekday morning, he's asleep on the bright red couch with leopard print pillows at Tattoo Lounge. It's too early for tattoos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hockemeier grew up in Philadelphia. He dropped out of college, moved to Florida about six months ago and eventually gained a job here, near 5th and Ocean, where people come for tattoos and piercings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will vote in November, but he doesn't get excited when talking about his candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess,&quot; he says, &quot;I'm going to vote for Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tattooed in black script on his right forearm is the word &quot;integrity.&quot; He wishes politicians had more of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Irene Marie mentions that same word. She is 57 and over the last 25 years has built Irene Marie Models into a thriving firm. This is the offseason, though, and Marie has found time to follow the political campaigns. She has voted for Democrats, but has leaned Republican. This year, she's not sure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama has the breadth of possibilities for a new beginning, a new way. But I'm not sure if he has the capability to achieve it. I'm not sure if he has the wisdom,&quot; she says. &quot;John McCain has a little bit more wisdom. But in an interesting way, he doesn't have what Obama has, which is he has a connection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, she says, &quot;integrity&quot; means more to her than any portrayal of a candidate as being a regular Joe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't have to have a drink with my candidate. What's most important to me is they're honest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone cares. Not everyone sees this election as historic, or important, or life-changing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a bar-restaurant called Durant's back on Central Avenue in Phoenix, a patron cozying up to an Irish whiskey dismisses the whole electoral process with a bathroom-humor reference borrowed from &quot;South Park.&quot; He chuckles, saying he has no intention of voting for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some, there is the cynicism born of mistrust in all things Washington, or the apathy that comes with living the good life. Besides, asked some on this main street: How much can one man do for me?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Phoenix library, 48-year-old Margaret Zamora, an Obama supporter, offers one answer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The difference that the president makes isn't so much what he does, but it's how he gets people to think. They're looking at a president for hope. And if they have hope, people start thinking different. Then things start changing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, from a woman who lives in a domestic violence shelter. For her, health insurance isn't part of a platform, but that thing that could mean the difference between a toothless grin and a new set of dentures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debra Scavo, a McCain backer, shares that kind of faith, too, even as she shoulders so many of the concerns of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not just a lack of work. She has Medicaid, but it runs out next month. Social Security? She's 50 and wonders how much will be left when she retires, if she's able to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As bad as all of it is, the tears don't come until talk turns to her son, Phillip, 20 years old and a newly minted Marine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her future is uncertain; his could mean war and life-or-death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The military has a saying: They break you down to build you up. Sometimes, in our world, our country, our economy, sometimes we might have to go through difficult times and things will have to get worse before they get better. But you have to find the right person ... to keep us afloat and keep us above water while we go through those difficult times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She tells herself that, too: &quot;Keep you head above water, girlfriend. You'll be OK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so she gets up at 4:30 a.m. to hike the mountain near the home that she clings to. And she comes back and sits at her desk, across from a window bare of any curtains or shades, and calls the clients who once paid $25,000 for window treatments, to see if they might have work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then she keeps herself busy, trimming her trees and sweeping the scraps from her driveway on Central Avenue her tears, for now, gone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER - Sen. Barack Obama, accepting the Democratic presidential nomination last night, sought in language by turn uplifting and scathing to frame the change he wants to bring to a nation whose promise, he said, is imperiled by &quot;broken politics.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;America, we are better than these last eight years,&quot; Obama declared amid the roar of 84,000 people jammed into a football stadium. &quot;This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama linked Republican candidate John McCain to George W. Bush's &quot;failed policies&quot; and questioned McCain's judgment on foreign affairs and national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Sen. McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time?&quot; Obama said. &quot;I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a nation whose founders included slave owners, the first-term Illinois senator made history as the first African American nominated by a major political party. Adding to the resonance, he spoke on the 45th anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's Jr.'s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech - one in which people heard, Obama said, &quot;that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He spoke of his grandfather, a World War II veteran who went to college on the GI Bill; his grandmother, who rose from secretarial work to middle management; and his mother, a single parent who once turned to food stamps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine,&quot; he said, alluding to McCain's ads comparing Obama to the likes of Paris Hilton. &quot;These are my heroes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama spelled out specifics, promising to cut middle-class taxes, close loopholes that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas, end the &quot;oil addiction&quot; that makes the United States vulnerable to Middle Eastern instability, wind down the war in Iraq &quot;responsibly,&quot; and defend the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain remains more inflexible on the question of withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq than either that country's leaders or the Bush administration, Obama said, adding that the war has distracted from the pursuit of terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That's not the judgment we need. That won't keep America safe,&quot; he said. &quot;We need a president who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And he declared that neither he nor his Republican rival should question the other's patriotism. &quot;I've got news for you, John McCain,&quot; Obama said. &quot;We all put our country first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Obama finished his 40-minute acceptance, flashbulbs ricocheted around Invesco Field at Mile High, the audience waved small flags, and fireworks burst over the stadium, the home of football's Denver Broncos. He was joined on stage by his running mate, Delaware Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., and their families, as confetti shot off by air cannon rained down upon them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier, former Vice President Al Gore carried the theme of McCain as Bush III.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Hey, I believe in recycling, but that's ridiculous,&quot; Gore said, referring to McCain's support of tax cuts skewed toward the wealthy and an unwise war in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;So why is this election so close?&quot; Gore asked. &quot;Well, I know something about close elections, so let me offer you my opinion: I believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change Barack Obama represents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The stadium filled as the setting sun played on the distant Rocky Mountains. Thousands of people stood in lines that snaked through surrounding streets and over a bridge across Interstate 25, waiting up to two hours to clear security. Inside, they found a carnival atmosphere, more a concert interrupted by the occasional political speech than a convention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Olympic gold-medal gymnast Shawn Johnson - a native of Iowa, the state that started Obama's rise with a caucus victory in January - opened the celebration by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Academy Award winner Jennifer Hudson belted out the national anthem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama himself walked onto a stage flanked by Greek columns and jutting like a peninsula into the crowd at the 50-yard line. Republicans had mocked the setup as a pretentious &quot;Temple of Obama,&quot; continuing their attack line that he is a narcissistic celebrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Campaign officials said they wanted to open up the convention and believed that would help Obama carry Colorado, a closely contested state with nine electoral votes. The campaign wanted to turn the event into a &quot;working, organizing experience,&quot; spokesman Dan Pfeiffer told reporters in a conference call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama was the first presidential candidate to make an acceptance speech outdoors since John F. Kennedy was nominated at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum 48 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the speech, Obama and his advisers sought to downplay expectations, in the wake of attacks that he is prone to high-flown rhetoric without specifics. Some Democratic leaders have fretted in recent weeks as Obama's lead in the polls dwindled that he was not forceful enough in addressing GOP attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama took on that concern in his speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values,&quot; Obama said. &quot;And that's to be expected. Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters. If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama and Biden go to Beaver County, Pa., today to begin a bus tour that will continue into Ohio and Michigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the Democrats closed down their four-day convention, suspense mounted on the the Republican side as McCain prepared to name his running mate today, ahead of next week's GOP convention in St. Paul, Minn. The unusual political split-screen moment had the potential to limit the traditional public-opinion &quot;bounce&quot; that Obama could expect from a successful convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain also appeared in a TV ad last night speaking directly into the camera to congratulate Obama on his historic achievement, a sharp departure from the harshly negative tone of the campaign in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Senator Obama, this is truly a good day for America,&quot; McCain said in the ad. &quot;Tomorrow, we'll be back at it. But tonight, Senator, job well done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds issued a statement last night calling Obama's speech &quot;misleading&quot; and decrying his record as &quot;meager.&quot; &quot;The fact remains,&quot; Bounds said, &quot;Barack Obama is still not ready to be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama accepted his historic Democratic presidential nomination with soaring oratory that sought to identify his biography with the American dream and his campaign with a populist call to mend the American economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America, we cannot turn back,&quot; Mr. Obama said at the end of his prime-time speech at Denver's Invesco Field, &quot;Not with so much work to be done.... At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As waves of cheers broke over a crowd of nearly 80,000, Mr. Obama's speech aimed to bind his life with the lives of struggling voters. At the same time, he and other Democratic speakers joined in portraying his Republican opponent, Sen. John McCain, as the unquestioning heir to the policies of an unpopular administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story -- of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to,&quot; he said, recalling the electrifying convention speech that made him a national figure even before he was elected to the U.S. Senate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is that promise that has always set this country apart -- that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a summer of partisan debate on national security, Mr. Obama focused on the economy, arguing that Republican policies had failed to respond to crises in housing, health care and credit markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America, we are better than these last eight years,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times the stadium almost shook with the foot-stomping, roaring appreciation of the partisans who'd copped the toughest ticket in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less,&quot; he said at another point. &quot;More of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach. These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed presidency of George W. Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his speech, Mr. Obama finally took the full spotlight after a convention in which his unprecedented candidacy had competed for attention with Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the woman he had defeated in the longest and most expensive nomination fight in American political history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking earlier in the week, his wife, Michelle, called his march to the nomination an improbable story. Few would accuse her of hyperbole. Mr. Obama claimed his party's standard for the race against Mr. McCain after being raised in Hawaii and Indonesia by a single mother. He overcame much of his party's political establishment as he vanquished the wife of the last president of his party with a campaign that seized a message of hope and exploited the new tools of digital communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to Republican characterizations of him as an elitist, he described a commonplace American background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the face of these young veterans who come home from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's army and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the face of the young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift,&quot; he continued, &quot;I think about my Mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her college degree -- who once turned to Food Stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alongside the uplifting notes, however, Mr. Obama's words included a flurry of criticisms of his opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now I don't believe that Sen. McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to Mr. McCain's observation at their recent twin appearances with the Rev. Rick Warren in California, he added, &quot;Why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not because John McCain doesn't care; it's because John McCain doesn't get it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another answer to Republican attacks, he put a harder edge on the post-partisan theme that resonated so strongly in his convention address four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some have died together under the same proud flag,&quot; he said sternly. &quot;They have not served a Red America or a Blue America -- they have served the United States of America. So I've got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scheduling evoked political history. The first African-American nominee of a major party spoke on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's &quot;I Have a Dream speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the outdoor setting, and even the Greek columns -- the object of immediate GOP ridicule as the &quot;Temple of Obama&quot; -- were reminiscent of the Los Angeles Coliseum address where President John F. Kennedy gave his acceptance speech in 1960.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most prominent among a parade of speakers that preceded the nominee in the five-hour program was former Vice President Al Gore. The Nobel Prize winner alluded to his own bitter election experience to underline the stakes in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000, though it may be even more obvious now, because John McCain, a man who earned our respect on many levels, is now openly endorsing the policies of the Bush-Cheney White House and promising to actually continue them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The same policies all over again?&quot; the environmental activist demanded. &quot;Hey, I believe in recycling, but that's ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recognizing the power of the event, the GOP campaign took the unusual step of producing a commercial featuring Mr. McCain congratulating Mr. Obama on his nomination that was to be broadcast in battleground states across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The close of the speech was heralded with a ring of fireworks surrounding the stadium as first Mr. Obama's family and then his new running mate, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., joined the nominee on stage as the crowd's cheers competed with the fireworks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alongside its uplifting notes, however, Mr. Obama's words included a flurry of criticisms of his opponent, whom he and other speakers cast as a born-again clone of President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush was right more than ninety percent of the time?&quot; Mr. Obama asked the crowd. &quot;I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most prominent among a parade of speakers that preceded the nominee in the five-hour program was former Vice President Al Gore. The Nobel Prize winner alluded to his own bitter election experience to underline the stakes in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000, though it may be even more obvious now, because John McCain, a man who earned our respect on many levels, is now openly endorsing the policies of the Bush-Cheney White House and promising to actually continue them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The same policies all over again?&quot; the environmental activist demanded. &quot;Hey, I believe in recycling, but that's ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recognizing the power of the event, the GOP campaign took the unusual step of producing a rebuttal commercial featuring Mr. McCain that was to be broadcast in battleground states across the country. In terms of grabbing a share of national media attention, the rollout of Mr. McCain's vice presidential candidate today appeared calculated to compete with the roadblock coverage of the Obama speech. Calculated leaks reported that the Republican had informed his running mate of his choice sometime during the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The afternoon preceding the main speakers included what one Obama aide called a &quot;a super, on-steroids voter registration camp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Plouffe, the Obama campaign manager made the case that the venue was as much about grass-roots organizing as grand political stagecraft. He called on the swelling crowd to join in a campaign of voter outreach and registration from here to Election Day. Mr. Plouffe urged the crowd not to wait until they left the rally, urging them to make calls from their seats as the afternoon and evening wore on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited Pennsylvania as a model of this kind of organizing, noting the state's significant gains in Democratic registration over the last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pennsylvania is now much harder for John McCain to win because of those registrations,&quot; he said. &quot;This election is in your hands, not mine, not anyone on the campaign staff, not the pundits, not the Democratic Party ... you need to own this campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than an hour before the program began at 3 p.m. local time, a line of thousands of Democratic partisans snaked for nearly a mile from the stadium, inching its way toward the choke point of the magnetometer tents. Organizers passed out bottles of water as the line slowly made its way toward the stadium's gates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">813 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Something unusual happened during the run-up to the Democratic convention: A presidential candidate was subjected to a highly prejudicial, not particularly honest personal attack, and for once the victim was a Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, the political press jumped on it, happily trashing John McCain for two clueless remarks he never actually made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are Democrats finally learning to fight dirty? Should the rest of us feel good about it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the McCain campaign is running TV commercials mocking Barack Obama for not asking Hillary Clinton to be his running mate -- a job she surely didn't want.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Republicans, of course, admire Hillary so. They've even found a Clinton delegate from Wisconsin to make a pro-McCain commercial, because ...Well, because why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anybody calling themselves a Democrat who doesn't understand how important it is for both parties, not to mention the nation, that Republicans pay the price for the catastrophic presidency of George W. Bush needs to turn in their party ID and Magic Decoder Ring and find another hobby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">See, because it's not simply his trademark arrogance and incompetence that have earned Bush the lowest approval ratings of any president since political polling began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not merely the interminable morass in Iraq, worsening conditions in Afghanistan, manufactured &quot;intelligence,&quot; a legacy of torture, of epic corruption and cronyism, of one massive financial scandal after another, of runaway budget deficits and economic stagnation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, it was foolish and self-deluded of Republicans to imagine somebody of Bush's limited abilities capable of handling the presidency. But the failure's more than personal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So-called &quot;conservative&quot; ideology has lost contact with reality. The GOP has become the party of illusion, incapable of seeing the world as it is, infuriated by anybody who does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contemporary Republicanism isn't a governing philosophy so much as a rationalized series of &quot;talking points&quot; useful in winning elections since the Reagan presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But back to Democratic dirty tricks. Everywhere you looked, from the Washington Post to Keith Olbermann's MSNBC News program, you saw John McCain pilloried for two classic &quot;gaffes.&quot; As the Post put it, the GOP candidate's &quot;inability to recall&quot; how many houses he and his wife own jeopardized his strategy of framing Obama as an &quot;elitist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning in Wisconsin, the Democratic nominee lampooned McCain's forgetfulness, also mocking him for defining as &quot;rich&quot; only somebody with an income exceeding $5 million a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point was clear: The famous &quot;straight-talking maverick&quot; is basically a gigolo (to use a word Republicans used to describe John Kerry in 2004), whose much-younger second wife inherited more money than the Bush family and Scrooge McDuck combined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Obama, it was a two-fer, also hinting that the 71-year-old McCain's memory might be fading. Alas, neither of these things ever happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by a reporter how many homes he owned, McCain simply advised the reporter to check with his staff. He wasn't unable to recall, merely unwilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's much the same with the $5 million thing. Asked to define &quot;rich&quot; by Pastor Rick Warren, McCain jokingly ducked the question. &quot;If you're just talking about income,&quot; he said &quot;how about $5 million?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He laughed, Warren laughed, the audience laughed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But seriously,&quot; McCain continued &quot;... and I'm sure that comment will be distorted. But the point is that we want to keep people's taxes low and increase revenues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the comment was distorted, even in supposedly straightforward newspaper stories and TV broadcasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Bob Somerby, who's long documented this kind of skullduggery against Democrats, writes, &quot;If you want to know who the press corps is hunting, just see which candidate's jokes they transform into straight assertions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, so what? Wasn't McCain himself, with that gibberish about increasing revenues by lowering taxes, shamelessly citing delusional GOP propaganda? He was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, McCain voted against the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, explaining that they'd do exactly as they've done: Blow a huge hole in the federal budget, endangering the nation's financial security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now McCain wants to be president, so he's joined the Republican War on arithmetic. And given that millions of low-information &quot;undecided&quot; voters don't get it, shouldn't Democrats act on what GOP strategists have long known -- that a presidential election is basically a TV game show: &quot;Battle of the Celebrity Politicians?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Replace the &quot;straight-talking maverick&quot; with the &quot;blustering old hypocrite and you've won?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Something like that, yes. Not that I have to approve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, if I were Obama, I'd put that famous photo of McCain giving President Bush a big, warm hug on television so often people would start thinking his name was George W. McCain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tomorrow in Western Pennsylvania, Sen. Barack Obama will kick off his campaign as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, Sen. John McCain - perhaps with his newly named running mate - will touch down in the state for the 16th time since becoming the Republican Party's presumptive nominee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that is just the beginning. Both parties agree there will be a blizzard of presidential campaign stops in Pennsylvania between now and November. Once again, the state is a crucial election battleground; in June and July, for instance, more TV ad money was spent here than in any other state.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consensus among political leaders and pundits is that the state will play a decisive role in determining who wins the White House - with Obama having more at stake. If the Illinois senator loses the state, with its 21 electoral votes, they say, he loses the election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Keystone State is key,&quot; said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. &quot;Obama can't win without it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer put it even more bluntly when speaking earlier this week to members of the Pennsylvania delegation at the Democratic National Convention in Denver: &quot;We're counting on you, Pennsylvania. If you don't deliver your votes to Barack Obama, it's over before the polls even close in Montana.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign is making no secret of how important a role Pennsylvania will play in its overall political strategy. And Obama is making that clear by picking Beaver in Western Pennsylvania as the launching ground for his general-election campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At tomorrow night's event, where Obama will meet with voters, he will be joined by his wife, Michelle Obama. With them will be vice-presidential candidate Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill Biden. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entourage then will board a bus for weekend appearances in two other battleground states, Ohio and Michigan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sean Smith, Obama's spokesman in Pennsylvania, said: &quot;The fact that the first stop we're making is in Beaver shows how seriously the Obama campaign is taking Pennsylvania. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know this race is going to be close, and we know Sen. McCain will be making an all-out effort to win the state,&quot; Smith said. &quot;But we like our chances here.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political analysts believe Obama has some clear advantages in Pennsylvania heading into the fall campaign, including an enormous boost in Democratic voter registration across the state - much of it fueled by excitement over April's Democratic primary fight between Obama and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. As of Monday, there were 4.2 million registered Democrats in the state to the Republicans' 3.1 million. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the latest Quinnipiac University poll shows Obama with a 7-point lead in Pennsylvania. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic strategist Neil Oxman said that while Pennsylvania remained a key swing state, Obama was in a much more comfortable position here than in other battleground states, such as Ohio and Michigan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxman said he believed that if Obama wins the state's southeastern counties and Pittsburgh, and does &quot;respectably&quot; with voters in Western Pennsylvania counties, &quot;he'll win Pennsylvania by a very comfortable margin.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Western Pennsylvania could pose a problem for Obama, analysts say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During April's primary, Clinton commanded wide margins among Western Pennsylvania's predominantly white working-class voters. That is the segment of the state's voting populace that McCain will make herculean efforts to win over. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, McCain has made almost half of his visits to Pennsylvania in the western part of the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain sees all kinds of weakness for Obama there,&quot; said Chris Borick, a professor of political science at Muhlenberg College. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sabato, director of the the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said the issue of race was the silent unknown that also could influence how well Obama did in Pennsylvania. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It shouldn't be a legitimate issue,&quot; he said, &quot;but we all know it's in the closet.&quot;  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The old saw, &quot;If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all&quot; works as motherly advice or as a pithy rule of thumb to aid character formation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it fails spectacularly as a guiding political strategy for a presidential campaign. As Aaron Tippin sings in that most red, white and blue musical genre -- country -- &quot;You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything. You've got to be your own man, not a puppet on a string.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, &quot;Nearly three in 10 voters, 29 percent, pointed to McCain as the candidate running a negative campaign, compared to just 5 percent who said Obama is running a negative campaign.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prevailing wisdom would label this perception a minus for Big Mac. But it shouldn't. Consider this example from the recent past:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Republican presidential primary season earlier this year, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney weathered heavy criticism for daring to run ads that harshly contrasted his attributes with the perceived failings of a major opponent, Mike Huckabee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His first such ad, which ran in Iowa in December, described Romney and Huckabee as &quot;two good family men,&quot; both pro-life and both in favor of keeping marriage between a man and a woman. But the similarities ended there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad continued: &quot;Mitt Romney stood up and vetoed in-state tuition for illegal aliens, opposed driver's licenses for illegals. Mike Huckabee? Supported in-state tuition benefits for illegal immigrants. Huckabee even supported taxpayer-funded scholarships for illegal aliens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What, pray tell, is wrong with an ad like that? It makes its point decently, by taking a hard look at the respective records -- exactly how a candidate should clarify the differences between himself and an opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite some initial dithering about scruples, Huckabee eventually fired back, running an ad that accused Romney of &quot;dishonesty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other things, the ad aimed to present Romney as something other than a law-and-order executive. As the Annenberg political fact-checking Web site, FactCheck.Org, pointed out, though, that portrayal was a bit misleading:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ad says Romney's record as governor of Massachusetts includes 'no executions.' That's true, but the reason is that Massachusetts doesn't have a death penalty. Furthermore, Romney tried and failed to get the death penalty reinstated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact of the matter is that Huckabee, in spite of his professed dislike of negative advertising, wanted to win, and knew the power that such ads command -- although in this case, they stretched the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pastor in him wanted to say (or thought he should say), &quot;Negative is bad.&quot; But in his political heart, he knew what was right for his cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's more than that: Politics cannot always center on the quest for popular celebrity. Barack Obama is reminded of this whenever he's made to talk about real political issues. John McCain should make him do it more often.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling attention to the many stark contrasts between himself and his opponent often brings out the best in the Republican presidential hopeful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know whether involving Paris Hilton -- as the McCain campaign recently did to the delight of late-night pundits everywhere -- is always the answer, but if voters don't know what you support and oppose, and how you are different from your opponent, they've got no good reason to vote for you and against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without facts, both positive and negative, there is no true choice. So McCain should continue to make ads about policy, about funding for troops, and taxing and spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign should make clear the differences between the Arizona senator and Obama. (On abortion, specifically; Obama wouldn't oppose infanticide in the Illinois State Senate.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain should continue to use humor, to be a happy warrior, even as he forthrightly criticizes Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He should seek to drive home the biggest difference between the candidates: Their stances on the unpopular war in Iraq. The &quot;maverick&quot; McCain should be bold enough to go negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then voters will know the truth. And that's always a positive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER - With a forceful and gracious Hillary Rodham Clinton setting the tone, the Democratic Party last night called for unity behind Barack Obama and escalated its verbal assault against Republican John McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unequivocal call to come together was sounded by the New York senator, who ran the most successful presidential campaign ever by a woman and whose most devoted supporters have had trouble accepting that she came up just short. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My friends, it is time to take back the country we love,&quot; Clinton declared, urging her voters to join her as a &quot;proud&quot; Obama supporter. &quot;And whether you voted for me or voted for Barack, the time is now to unite as a single party, with a single purpose. We are on the same team, and none of us can sit on the sidelines.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And lest anyone not get the point, she added: &quot;No way. No how. No McCain.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd at the Pepsi Center, which had erupted in a thunderous, 2 1/2-minute ovation when daughter Chelsea introduced her as the evening's headliner, roared its approval. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton thanked her loyalists, including &quot;my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits,&quot; praised Michelle Obama and vice presidential candidate Joseph R. Biden Jr., and cited at length the positions she and Barack Obama share. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And she joined in the McCain-bashing that had characterized most of the evening. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It makes perfect sense that George Bush and John McCain will be together next week in the Twin Cities,&quot; she said of the Republican convention in St. Paul, Minn., &quot;because these days, they're pretty hard to tell apart.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's enthusiastic endorsement of Obama was the highlight of a night in Denver that differed markedly from the first - which some analysts had criticized as too weak and amorphous. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks on McCain, missing on Monday, came from every quarter, including from the normally mild-mannered Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casey, in a prime-time speech, said the Republicans deserve &quot;not four more years. Four more months.&quot; The crowd picked up the chant, &quot;Four more months!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he declared: &quot;John McCain calls himself a maverick, but he votes with George Bush 90 percent of the time. That's not a maverick. That's a sidekick.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaker after speaker drew the choice in this election in stark terms, labeling Obama as the voice of the middle class and change - and McCain as the candidate of big business and the status quo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he's the answer, then the question must be ridiculous,&quot; New York Gov. David Paterson said of the Republican. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland: &quot;While families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day, John McCain is sleeping better than ever . . . because he thinks 'Americans, overall, are better off' . . . thanks to President Bush.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius took on McCain's multiple homes and his inability, when asked, to remember how many he and his wife owned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure you remember a girl from Kansas who said, 'There's no place like home,' &quot; said Sebelius, referring to Dorothy in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Wizard of Oz</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;Well, in John McCain's version, there's no place like home. And a home. And home. And home.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, appearing at a town-hall meeting in Kansas City, Mo., also talked economics, albeit slightly less stridently: &quot;Over the last eight years, your lives are less secure. Those are the facts, and John McCain is not promising to do anything different than George Bush did.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exception to the tone of the day came, oddly, in a future-oriented keynote speech by former Virginia Gov. Mark Warner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know we're at the Democratic National Convention, but if an idea works, it really doesn't matter if it has an 'R' or 'D' next to it,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before last night's session, several of the strategists behind Bill Clinton's two election victories, James Carville among them, had criticized the early tone of the convention as not being tough enough on the Republicans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They appeared to be speaking for party leaders who wonder whether Obama's reluctance ever to look fighting mad helps explain why downscale white Democrats have been slow to warm to him - and why the polls are so tight, nationally and in the key states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to start smacking back in short understandable bites,&quot; Gov. Rendell told the Washington Post. &quot;Everybody is nervous as all get out. Everybody says we ought to be ahead by 10, 15 points. What the heck is going on?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's obvious personal gifts, the Pennsylvania governor added, make him &quot;not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republicans, for their part, were offering a clear message in a tough tone, one meant to feed public doubts that Obama does not have enough experience to be president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overnight, the McCain campaign put out a new ad, one recalling the famous ad Clinton used against Obama in the primaries, asking who Americans would want answering a 3 a.m. crisis phone call in the White House.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It quotes a remark Clinton made when she, too, was trying to raise the experience issue and was suggesting she'd be the better opponent for McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know Sen. McCain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the White House,&quot; she says in a video clip used in McCain's&nbsp;ad. &quot;And Sen. Obama has a speech he gave in 2002,&quot; referring to Obama's early declaration of his opposition to war with Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later yesterday, party leaders including former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a possible McCain running mate, reinforced the message at a news conference here under the title: &quot;Not Ready '08: A Mile High and an Inch Deep.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Romney: &quot;Barack Obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family. But he's not ready to be president of the United States of America.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Clinton didn't help matters with his own comments, made yesterday in Denver. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Suppose you're a voter, and you've got candidate X and candidate Y. Candidate X agrees with you on everything, but you don't think that candidate can deliver on anything at all,&quot; he said. &quot;Candidate Y you agree with on about half the issues, but he can deliver. Which candidate are you going to vote for?&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former president quickly added, &quot;This has nothing to do with what's going on now.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the view of some worried Democrats, these are the kinds of attacks that have allowed McCain to dominate the political dialogue for much of the summer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today brings the presidential and vice-presidential roll calls, the formal nominations of Obama and Biden, and Biden's acceptance speech. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER -- Hillary Rodham Clinton summoned millions of voters who supported her in the primaries to send Barack Obama to the White House Tuesday night, declaring in a Democratic National Convention speech that the man who defeated her &quot;is my candidate and he must be our president.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a prime time address, the former first lady added, &quot;we don't have a moment to lose or a vote to spare.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The packed convention floor became a sea of white &quot;Hillary&quot; signs as the New York senator strode to the podium, and thousands of Democrats cheered as she took a pre-speech sip of water.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While her prepared remarks included a full-throated endorsement of Obama, she did not indicate whether she would have her name placed in nomination or seek a formal roll call of the states when the nomination is awarded by delegates on Wednesday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling herself a &quot;proud supporter of Barack Obama, she dismissed Republican John McCain with a few choice words. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No way. No how. No McCain,&quot; she said as the hall erupted in cheers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't need four more years ... of the last eight years,&quot; she added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like other failed candidates at conventions past, Clinton recalled her own quest for the White House. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You taught me so much, you made me laugh and ... you even made me cry,&quot; she said to supporters in the Pepsi Center and millions more watching on nationwide television. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You allowed me to become part of your lives, and you became part of mine.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want you to ask yourselves, 'Were you in this campaign just for me?'&quot; she asked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton was the featured speaker of the second night of the convention, and she followed a series of other Democrats to the podium who had ripped into Republican McCain as indifferent to the working class and cozy with big oil. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he's the answer, then the question must be ridiculous,&quot; New York Gov. David Paterson said of the GOP presidential candidate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, &quot;It's time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Call the roll!&quot; urged Ted Sorensen, a party elder eager to propel Obama toward the White House as the first black president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not yet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's formal nomination was set for Wednesday night. First came Clinton, his tenacious rival in a riveting battle for the nomination, closing out her own history-making quest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The convention hall was packed for her appearance, so much so that officials sealed the entrances. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite lingering unhappiness among some delegates nursing grievances over Clinton's loss, party chairman Howard Dean declared the convention determined to make Obama the nation's 44th president. &quot;There is not a unity problem. If anyone doubts that, wait till you see Hillary Clinton's speech,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the convention keynote address, former Virginia Gov. Mark Warner said Obama will &quot;appeal to us not as Republicans or Democrats, but first and foremost as Americans.&quot; He added, &quot;We need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast to many of speeches delivered earlier in the day, out of prime time, Warner's remarks were more a sketch of the &quot;post-partisan&quot; possibilities that Obama often speaks of, rather than criticism of McCain and President Bush. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know we're at the Democratic National Convention, but if an idea works, it really doesn't matter if it has an 'R' or 'D' next to it,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As keynoter, Warner's task was the same one that Obama -- then an Illinois state lawmaker running for the U.S. Senate -- used four years ago to launch his astonishing ascent in national politics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, 47 and in his first Senate term, campaigned in Missouri as he slowly made his way toward the convention city. Speaking to airline workers in a giant hangar, he accused the Bush administration of failing to enforce health and safety laws and said McCain &quot;doesn't get it&quot; when it comes to the concerns of blue collar workers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was more of the same -- much more -- as a parade of speakers criticized McCain at the convention several hundred miles away. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said the Republican has voted against &quot;real sex education, voted against affordable family planning. And if elected, John McCain has vowed to appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade,&quot; she said, referring to the landmark 1973 case that affirmed women's right to abortion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland focused on economic issues. &quot;While families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day, John McCain is sleeping better than ever,&quot; he said, recalling that McCain had recently said Americans were better off because of President Bush's policies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Iowa Gov. Chet Culver said oil companies were &quot;placing their bets on John McCain, bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain offers four more years of the same Bush-Cheney policies that have failed us,&quot; summed up Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sorensen was a link to some of the party's glory years, John F. Kennedy's closest aide. As was the case with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's emotional appearance on the convention's opening night Monday, Sorensen's presence on the podium was designed to strengthen the image of Obama as Kennedy's worthy heir. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a recurrent theme. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is our time to revive the spirit of Kennedy,&quot; said Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama delivers his acceptance speech Thursday night at a football stadium. An estimated 75,000 tickets have been distributed for the event, meant to stir additional comparisons with Kennedy's appearance at the Los Angeles Coliseum in 1960. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Convention meets in St. Paul, Minn., next week to nominate McCain and his still-unnamed running mate. That will set the stage for a final sprint to Election Day in a race that is remarkably close. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dean, the party chairman, said the Democrats' imperatives were &quot;to make sure people know who Barack Obama is, who Joe Biden is.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden, a Delaware senator, is Obama's vice presidential pick, already making the rounds of the convention city. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever tone the Democrats took, there was no mistaking McCain's intentions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the second time in three days, his campaign sought to use Clinton to wound Obama. This time it was a television commercial that made use of a memorable ad she ran in the primaries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It shows sleeping children and a 3 a.m. phone call into the White House portending a crisis. In the new ad Clinton is shown saying: &quot;I know Sen. McCain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the White House. And, Sen. Obama has a speech he gave in 2002.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A narrator adds: &quot;Hillary's right. John McCain for president.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Democrats expressed concern about the potential for at least the appearance of disunity on television later in the week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don Fowler, a former party chairman, said there was more of a problem than he had anticipated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All you need is 200 people in the crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times. And that's not what you want out of this.&quot;  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton met with Hispanic supporters in Denver on Monday, she urged them to get behind soon-to-be Democratic nominee Barack Obama for the sake of party unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's fans wanted none of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They chanted her name so loudly it drowned out the few Obama supporters shouting &quot;Si se puede,&quot; Obama's motto &quot;Yes we can,&quot; according to one account of the event. Clinton was greeted like a &quot;conquering hero&quot; and given a nearly one-minute-long ovation, said another. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They weren't having any part of unity yet,&quot; said G. Terry Madonna, a Franklin &amp; Marshall College political analyst who is attending the Democratic National Convention this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are some delegates here who are not on board with Obama. There are still rumblings around this place from delegates about Clinton not being vetted, her not having her due, her not being the nominee,&quot; Madonna said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That undercurrent is worrisome for the Obama campaign, which finds itself in a tighter race with Republican U.S. Sen. John McCain than it expected. And it places Obama's success squarely on the shoulders of Clinton, who takes the stage tonight for what is perhaps the second-most-anticipated speech of the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line: How genuinely she promotes her former rival in the hard-fought primary tonight will likely say a lot about the willingness of Democrats to unite in the coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She needs to make it pretty clear, right out of the box, that she's solidly behind Obama --and do it with conviction,&quot; Madonna said. &quot;Her speech really needs to set the right tone. Whether it moves people over or not remains to be seen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opinion polls show it will be a tough job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A USA TODAY/Gallup Poll taken Thursday through Saturday found that fewer than half of her supporters in the presidential primaries - 47 percent - said they definitely will vote for Obama in November. Another 23 percent said they support him but might change their minds before the election. Thirty percent say they will vote for Republican John McCain, someone else or no one at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll of registered voters, released Sunday, found that about two-thirds of Clinton supporters are backing Obama. Still, another 27 percent of the registered voters in that survey said they will vote for McCain instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that only about 52 percent of Clinton supporters are behind Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dissension is evident in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is a real problem,&quot; said Fletcher McClellan, a professor and chairman of Elizabethtown College's Political Science Department. &quot;If you go back to nomination processes and conventions past, the party that has the more divided convention since the 1960s has lost the election. It's a real concern for Democrats to display their unity and Hillary has got to perform, and I'm sure she will.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think tonight's speech will be extremely important,&quot; McClellan said. &quot;Since she lost the nomination she's appeared with him, and I think made it clear that she strongly supports his election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this is before a national audience. This is before a convention which will be nearly half filled with her supporters. And I think this will be kind of the exclamation point on the end of her campaign and for stating her support for Obama,&quot; McClellan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Glenn, the chairman of Millersville University's Government and Political Affairs department, said Clinton must at least appear genuine tonight - for Obama's sake as well as her own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If she comes across as appearing as a barrier, I think the party will most certainly pass the Clintons by,&quot; said Glenn. &quot;Politically, this is a tough call. If John McCain were to win this fall, Hillary Clinton is a player in 2012. If Barack Obama were to win this fall, she's probably not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are personal ambitions and there are political ambitions. Everything she's said, though, suggests she's going to put the party first,&quot; said Glenn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Clintons are pragmatists at heart. Both realize that 2008 has passed them by in terms of the presidential election. If she has any future as a leader in the Democratic Party, she has to say, 'We fought hard. Thank you. But now is the time to support Barack Obama,'&quot; Glenn said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I were a betting man, I would say she'll come through for Barack Obama,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER - The 2008 Democratic National Convention opened last night with an impassioned Michelle Obama talking about the values that shaped her husband and the party paying a moving tribute to its cancer-stricken liberal lion, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michelle Obama framed the candidate's success story, and her own, as emblematic of the American dream and said he would achieve his goals as president by &quot;reminding us how much we share and how alike we really are.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You see, Barack doesn't care where you're from, or what your background is,&quot; she said. &quot;. . . He knows that thread that connects us - our belief in America's promise, our commitment to our children's future - is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When she finished, Barack Obama himself appeared on the giant video screens, live from Kansas City, Mo. - and the younger of their two daughters, Sasha, who had joined Michelle on stage, called out, &quot;Hi, Daddy!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said of his wife, &quot;Now you know why I asked her out so many times even though she said no. You want a persistent president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behind the scenes, representatives of Obama and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, whom he defeated for the nomination, were still working out precisely how to stage the events of the next few days - in which Clinton will play a leading role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The goal was to minimize hard feelings among her most deeply committed supporters, encourage party unity, and deflect attention from those Clinton backers who have not reconciled themselves to Obama's victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was no sign of that difficulty at the Pepsi Center last night. For the thousands gathered, the emotional highlight of the evening was the appearance of Kennedy, who walked onstage with his wife, Vicki, after a video tribute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans, it is so wonderful to be here,&quot; Kennedy said, speaking with surprising force for a man who was thought to be too ill to come to Denver. &quot;And nothing, nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And nothing, said the veteran senator from Massachusetts, would stop him from being in the Senate chamber in January when he hopes to serve under a President Obama, whom he supported enthusiastically during the primaries. The crowd chanted, &quot;Teddy, Teddy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For me,&quot; Kennedy said, &quot;this is a season of hope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He ended his seven-minute address by adapting the famous closing lines of his speech from the 1980 Democratic convention, proclaiming of himself and Obama, &quot;The work begins anew, the hope rises again, and the dream lives on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The video tribute was introduced by his niece Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of John F. Kennedy and one of the managers of Obama's search for a running mate. She described Obama as the first politician she had ever encountered who &quot;inspires me the way people tell me my father inspired them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aside from the Kennedy tribute, the opening-night program was directed more at the television audience than the delegates in the hall, to flesh out Obama for those voters only now starting to pay serious attention to the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michelle Obama, introduced by her brother, said that this most unconventional man - born to a white mother and a Kenyan father, raised in Hawaii and Indonesia - embodied an approach to life that all Americans could embrace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you're going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And Barack and I set out to build lives guided by these values, and pass them on to the next generation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She also made a point of saluting Clinton for her near-triumph in the primaries, putting &quot;those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling, so that our daughters - and sons - can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher.&quot; The mention of Clinton's name was greeted by a loud roar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michelle Obama's speech seemed designed in part to address any lingering doubts about her patriotism that sprung up after she said earlier this year that her husband's political success had made her feel &quot;really proud&quot; of her country for the first time as an adult. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other speakers yesterday, including a steelworker from the Chicago neighborhood where Obama worked as a community organizer in the 1980s, testified to the candidate's ability to relate to working people, countering the Republicans' portrayal of him as an intellectual elitist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A prominent slot was given to a Republican, former Iowa Rep. Jim Leach, who said of Obama, whom he now supports, &quot;Seldom has an emerging leader so matched the needs of the moment.&quot; Leach added, &quot;Little is more risky than more of the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Democrats also began to draw contrasts between themselves and the Republicans, something they didn't do in the 2004 convention that nominated John Kerry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rattled off issues facing the country, including the economy, health care, energy, and the war in Iraq, leading the crowd in a recurring chant: &quot;Barack Obama is right and John McCain is wrong!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Representatives of the Obama and Clinton camps were deep in negotiations yesterday over how to orchestrate the presidential roll call slated for tomorrow night. Tonight, Clinton will be the featured speaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a speech to the Pennsylvania delegates, most of whom were Clintonites, Gov. Rendell said the time for &quot;looking back&quot; had passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nobody worked harder for Sen. Clinton than I did,&quot; Rendell said. &quot;. . . If you care about Hillary, you've got to work for Sen. Obama.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Obama's campaign released an ad designed to link President Bush, McCain and hard economic times. It features a parody of the song &quot;Wonderful World (Don't Know Much).&quot; Instead of starting, &quot;Don't know much about history,&quot; it begins &quot;I'm not up on the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It ends with the image of Bush patting McCain's back and a question: &quot;Do we really want four more years of the same old tune?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOR A SECOND DAY, protesters from the group &quot;Re-create '68&quot; demonstrated against the Democrats' decision to cordon them off in a &quot;demonstration zone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to stay here for just a couple of minutes to state our disgust with this abomination, the way the city and Secret Service are tearing the Constitution of the United States to shreds and then we will leave,&quot; &quot;Re-create '68&quot; organizer Mark Cohen told the Associated Press yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why somebody would want to re-create '68 beats us. If it did happen, it would beat them, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1968, in what an investigative commission later called &quot;a police riot,&quot; hundreds of cops bashed in the heads of anti-Vietnam War and anti-establishment yippies and hippies at the Democratic convention in Chicago.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Denver group, unlike that in Chicago, is a smorgasbord of causes: anti-war and pro-environment, mixed in with black-flag-waving anarchists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the anarchists said he &quot;opposed all authority.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hey, been there, done that, got the bloody T-shirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hillary's harridans</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clout dispatched special correspondent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Yanik Ruiz-Ramon </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">to the protest zone yesterday and he found a gaggle of Republicans, of all things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOPers were expressing their support for three </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hillary Clinton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democrats who said they were going to vote for presumptive Republican nominee</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three women were wearing T-shirts that read &quot;NO-bama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though Clinton herself has urged support for Obama, Hillaryite </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Robin Carlson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">said, &quot;I refuse to be emotionally blackmailed to vote for a candidate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carlson and her group marched down 16th Street to Union Station, where MSNBC was taping &quot;Hardball with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Chris Matthews</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During commercial breaks, Ruiz-Ramon told us, &quot;A tall blond producer was waving her arms trying to get more passion&quot; from the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We always thought that TV is just supposed to cover the stuff. Was Matthews waving a black flag off camera?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Kenney: Biden made time</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was fall 1974. President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Gerald Ford</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had just pardoned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Richard Nixon </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">for crimes committed in the Watergate scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A young attorney from Delaware, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Joe Biden</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, was in his first term as a U.S. senator. And 15-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Jimmy Kenney</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had a paper due.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The future city councilman, then a sophomore at St. Joe's Prep, called Biden's office and asked for an interview. Kenney was surprised at how quickly Biden's staff put it together. The young man was instructed to take the train to Washington, D.C., to meet the new senator on the platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together, they rode a northbound train back to Wilmington, with Kenney asking questions and Biden giving answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenney doesn't recall the grade he got on the paper - &quot;An A or a B-plus, I think.&quot; But he does remember the lesson. When a student contacts him for a school project, Kenney makes the time to help out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It just always inspired me that a person at that level would make time for me,&quot; Kenney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Narberth kid makes good</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denver Mayor </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">John Hickenlooper</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> kicked off the convention by welcoming delegates to his city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This makes us proud 'cause Hickenlooper is a Main Line kid who grew up in Narberth and Wynnewood, and graduated from the Haverford School in 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How did he get to Denver? Practice, practice, practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, it was his career as an exploration geologist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the late 1980s, however, he switched to a more Philly-style business: He opened a brewpub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Denver: Different century </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was exactly 100 years ago that the Democrats last held their convention in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some things haven't changed since 1908: Nominee </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">William Jennings Bryan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called the Republicans &quot;the party of privilege.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other things have changed: Although Bryan was progressive on labor issues and foreign policy, he refused to consider a civil-rights plank in the platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Bryan, fearful of losing votes in the segregationist South, would not even allow the platform to include a denunciation of lynching. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Michelle: Soccer mom?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last February, Clout said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Michelle Obama's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> style reminded us of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Jackie Kennedy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, not so much. No pearls, for one thing. And that teal dress. Talbots?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We checked in with our style expert, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Daily News </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">columnist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Jenice Armstrong</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to find out if we were missing something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She talked the soccer-mom talk, but didn't look the soccer-mom part,&quot; Armstrong told us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dress was indeed &quot;simple and understated,&quot; Armstrong said, &quot;but do you think she looks like a soccer mom?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, she looks more like a sophisticated Harvard-trained lawyer to us, but what do we know?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats' plan was to introduce Michelle as a down-to-earth Everymom. In that department it was her daughters who carried the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interaction between Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, and their mom after her speech did more to create the image the Dems sought than anything Michelle said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing says it more than when she brought those girls out,&quot; Armstrong said. &quot;How beautiful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now if only their dad could figure out the difference between St. Louis and Kansas City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Best of the blogs</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Democratic veep pick </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Joe Biden </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">gets up there and talks poignantly about the typical American family sitting around the kitchen table late at night worrying how to pay its bills, and then twists the dagger on John McCain's &quot;seven kitchen tables,&quot; it's a great line politically, but . . . </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">New York Times </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">makes it out to be something of a crock, because of Biden's long record of backing the Delaware-centric credit-card industry, especially the former MBNA Corp., which hired the senator's son </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hunter Biden</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for a lucrative lobbying gig.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2005, Biden helped win passage of a conservative, anti-working-class bill that made life a lot harder for that struggling family that he depicted at that kitchen table.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the presidential campaign turns increasingly personal and the new Obama-Biden ticket strikes a decidedly more populist tone, Democrats believe a McCain-Romney ticket would provide a near-perfect frame for their class-conscious message.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many in Denver, the only story is whether Obama and Clinton can get along:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And even those who are not passionately committed to one side or the other are trying to figure out why Obama didn't just go through the motions of vetting Clinton [for the vice presidency]. Tell her that she was high on the list and go through the entire process. It wouldn't have been true, and Clinton probably would have known it wasn't true, but what could she have done? As it turned out, since Obama blew her off, she can now claim that she was disrespected in all this.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL OPINION; DN Columnists; Pg. 19</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">859 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE were things I didn't like about Sen. Joe Biden when I worked with him and his staff on the Senate Judiciary Committee when Biden was the chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I thought he compromised too easily and was too deferential to the committee's Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the qualities I didn't much appreciate then may be just what is necessary now if Barack Obama is to reach out and win over the voters he needs to prevail in this election.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The choice of Biden for the second slot on the Democratic ticket has been greeted with much praise, including from several GOP senators. Even Fox News admitted Biden is &quot;solid and serious,&quot; and &quot;a real political scrapper who knows how to throw a punch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dems in southeastern Pennsylvania are particularly happy because Biden is so popular here, especially in the suburbs considered crucial to a Democratic victory, in Pennsylvania and the nation. Biden has worked hard enough for the region to be called our third senator. Gov. Rendell, who helped Hillary Clinton beat Obama in Pennsylvania, likes Biden and will no doubt work harder for the ticket now that Biden's on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Iowa, Biden was an effective campaigner stymied by lack of money. He connected with people in small-town America, but was crushed by the historic nature of the race. Many were disappointed when he had to drop out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The kid from Scranton grew up in a family struggling to make ends meet. He can empathize with the white working-class voters who Obama has yet to convince. In his first speech as Obama's choice, Biden said, &quot;Your kitchen table is like mine. You sit there at night . . . after you put the kids to bed, and you talk about . . . how to pay the bills . . . That's not a worry John McCain has . . . He'll have to figure out which of the seven tables to sit at.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the kind of red meat Biden can deliver. He'll turn the focus back where it should be, on bread-and-butter issues, rather than on GOP attack ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden is well-known and respected on the world stage. He's trusted in the Jewish community, which can help win over some who mistrust Obama. And with a son getting ready to ship out to Iraq with his National Guard unit, Biden should have enough credibility to make inroads with military families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden also has a solid record in support of issues of special concern to women and families. Clinton supporters should note that at 65, Biden won't be a vice president busy planning his own administration, leaving the door open for her to run again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there's no one better than Biden, who presided over the hearings that led to the rejection of Judge Bork, to make the case that the nomination of Supreme Court justices will determine the future of our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE'S NO doubt McCain will nominate justices who not only would overturn Roe v. Wade, but fundamentally change our system of checks and balances by denying Congress the power to legislate national health and safety protections like those for the workplace while greatly expanding the powers of the executive, including giving the president the power to ignore laws passed by Congress. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, no candidate, including Biden, is without a downside. He's famously gaffe-prone and bound to slip up, but he also has a laser-sharp wit. He's the guy who flattened then-GOP presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani of New York in a debate by reducing him to &quot;a noun, a verb and 9/11.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope Biden will see that his old friend McCain has become a noun, a verb and a POW.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some wonder how a campaign for change can include someone who's been in Washington for 36 years, even longer than McCain. But Biden has never moved to Washington, and with his nightly commute home on Amtrak, has avoided socializing with lobbyists after hours, when many questionable deals are done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, Biden's Washington experience is a plus, not a minus. In Biden, Barack Obama will have a partner who knows the ways of Washington well enough to find the last few votes that may be needed to implement Obama's agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Republicans have said that in choosing Biden, Obama is showing how weak his experience is. I agree that his choice says a lot about Obama. But I think it shows that his ego doesn't overwhelm his judgment, and that's good for the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does having a 65-year- old on the ticket blunt the age issue dogging McCain? I don't think so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vibrant senator who ran on stage to embrace Obama is a bundle of energy, highlighting the flaws of a sometimes slow and forgetful McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an Obama opponent in the primary season, Biden had some critical things to say about him, and McCain wasted no time in running an ad to remind us. Yes, Biden has strong opinions. But Obama, unlike President Bush, doesn't intend to surround himself just with people who agree with him. He wants to listen to all arguments, and with Biden, he'll hear them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's an awful lot that goes into choosing a vice president. It's an opportunity to see how a candidate makes decisions. I think Obama passed this test with flying colors. O and Joe make a winning ticket. *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT LEAST BEFORE LAST night, there had never in American history been a memorable political-convention speech delivered by a woman seeking to become first lady.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then, there's never been an applicant for the job quite like Michelle Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her husband, in seeking to become America's first African-American president, presents an exotic backstory with his Kenyan father and his upbringing in Hawaii and Indonesia.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Michelle Obama's tale of rising from humble origins on the South Side of Chicago is a more familiar one - yet one that has generated a surprising amount of controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night was finally her rebuttal, a chance to answer all the critics who questioned her patriotism, often based on unfounded rumors, and who pounced when she said during the primaries that she was proud of her country &quot;for the first time in my adult life.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michelle Obama presented herself to the nation last night as the daughter of working-class parents and as a proud working mom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world. They're the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning, and the last thing I think about when I go to bed at night,&quot; she said. &quot;Their future - and all our children's future - is my stake in this election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bounding out to the strains of Stevie Wonder's &quot;I Was Made to Love Her&quot; in a teal dress, the candidate's wife larded her speech with references to faith and to patriotism, talking about hope and &quot;why I love this country.&quot; She also went out of her way to praise Hillary Clinton in front of hundreds of Clinton delegates, saying her campaign had put &quot;18 million cracks in the glass ceiling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She had an emotional lead-in - a brief appearance by party patriarch Sen. Ted Kennedy, ailing with terminal brain cancer. The brother of slain president John F. Kennedy told delegates at Denver's Pepsi Center that &quot;nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stakes are high for Michelle Obama. Wrote Glenn Thrush on the Web site Politico last night:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Her tasks are twofold: to introduce herself to the convention as a strong-willed, nonthreatening surrogate who has always been proud of her country - while portraying her Barack as a messy, absentminded, regular dad who likes playing with his daughters when he's not out inspiring the millions. How she is received could determine how much she is used on the road this fall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so Michelle Obama, joined after her talk by her husband via a big screen from Kansas City, where he was campaigning, sought to humanize the sometimes aloof candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer, inching along at a snail's pace, peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror, feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands, determined to give her everything he'd struggled so hard for himself, determined to give her what he never had: the affirming embrace of a father's love,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One poll taken earlier this year by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press showed that Michelle Obama had an unfavorable rating of 22 percent, which is unusally high for a potential first lady. The same survey found that Republican John McCain's wife, Cindy, had an unfavorable rating of 16 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, as has been so often the case in this intensely contested race, which polls now show as a dead heat, the McCain camp was mounting a speedy and aggressive response to the Michelle Obama showcase last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c10">Time</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> magazine is reporting that Cindy McCain left yesterday with a mission to assess civilian casualties from the Russian assault on the nation of Georgia, a crisis that her husband has placed on the center stage of his national-security-oriented campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while GOP officials were fairly careful not to go directly after Michelle Obama on the night of her televised address, there were new signs that pro-McCain operatives were stepping up their attack on Barack Obama's patriotism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group calling itself the American Issues Project is reportedly spending about $3 million to run ads in key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, that seek to tie Obama to Bill Ayers, a former member of the 1960s radical group the Weather Underground and now a college professor and an Obama acquaintance from his Chicago neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign was on the air with a response ad in a matter of a few hours, and that in turn drew a direct retort from the McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that Barack Obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about Senator Obama's judgment than any TV ad ever could,&quot; said Brian Rogers, a McCain spokesman. * </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats yesterday opened a week of speeches and celebrations in which they hoped to give voters a red-white-and-blue introduction to the first African-American nominee of a major party in the nation's history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While offering an only-in-America portrayal of their own candidate, convention architects planned a contrary portrayal of his opponent, Sen. John S. McCain, as an out-of-touch plutocrat wedded to the policies of an unpopular administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evening's headliner was would-be first lady Michelle Obama, but its emotional high point was the appearance of the ailing Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, the liberal icon whose early endorsement gave a crucial boost to the insurgent Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His niece, Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of President John F. Kennedy, introduced a taped tribute to her &quot;Uncle Teddy,&quot; who was diagnosed with malignant brain cancer this spring. While focusing on the veteran senator, the piece, and Mr. Kennedy's speech, suggested Mr. Obama as the political heir of his family's political tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them, but I do now -- Barack Obama,&quot; Caroline Kennedy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The footage, which included the senator at the helm of a sailboat filled with members of his extended family, was followed by the senator's surprise appearance on stage and a huge outpouring of appreciation from the delegates crammed into the Pepsi Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have come here tonight to change America,&quot; Mr. Kennedy said, his voice strong, but his gait unsteady, &quot;and to elect Barack Obama president of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kennedy spoke in a strong voice in a speech repeatedly interrupted by chants of &quot;Teddy, Teddy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For me this is a season of hope,&quot; he said. Later echoing the rhetoric of his brother John's inaugural address in 1961, and his own eloquent valedictory to his failed presidential bid in 1980, he said, &quot;The torch will be passed again to a new generation of Americans. ... The work begins anew; the hope rises again, and the dream lives on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator waved to a sea of dancing Kennedy signs in the crowd and worked his way smiling around the convention podium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The endorsements from Mr. Kennedy and the daughter of the slain president came just before Mr. Obama managed to battle Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton to a draw on February's Super Tuesday, a multi-state primary and caucus competition that many had expected to cement Mrs. Clinton's hold on the nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warm moments last night were a contrast to the persistent reports and speculation over lingering ill will between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, the candidate he so narrowly defeated in the longest primary battle in the party's history. Both camps put on a show of unity with Mrs. Clinton insisting that her support for Mr. Obama was unqualified. But the slow-to-be resolved discussions on how the roll call vote would proceed tomorrow did little to dispel the speculation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans seized on the opening in a new commercial in which a former Clinton supporter said she planned to vote for Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an appearance before her home state delegation, Mrs. Clinton dismissed the report, joking, &quot;I'm Hillary Clinton, and I do not approve that message,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a lot in that story that was wrong,&quot; David Plouffe, the Obama campaign manager said of one report of lingering friction between the senior figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While promoting their own candidate, the Obama partisans were relentless in targeting Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an early evening speech, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led he delegates in a call-and-response mockery of the Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And John McCain was wrong,&quot; the crowd thundered again and again to a litany of policy contrasts between the two candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day, Mr. Obama's campaign manager pointed once again to Mr. McCain's offhand definition of $5 million as the threshold point for moving out of the middle class, and his amnesia over the number of houses he owns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last week is going to be a seminal week in the campaign. ... There's a real sense that he is out of touch,&quot; he said. &quot;We are going to drive a truck through that this week and the rest of the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The star of the four-day gathering remained off stage, campaigning in Iowa as the convention was called to order at 3 p.m. local time, and watching his wife's address in Kansas City later last night. For all the publicity he has attracted during he in the 19 months of his precedent-shattering presidential run, Mr. Obama's advisers maintain that voters still don't know him in depth, They planned to fill in those blanks this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, in another echo of the Kennedy tradition, Mr. Obama will accept his nomination in a speech before more than 70,000 partisan in nearby INVESCO Field. In 1960, President Kennedy accepted the Democratic standard in a similarly non-traditional speech in the Los Angeles Coliseum.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER -- Sen. Hillary Clinton's speech tonight at the Democratic National Convention may go down as one of the most highly anticipated in convention history. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rarely has a runner-up's message to the delegates been given such a buildup. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton will strive to persuade her die-hard delegates to rally behind Barack Obama, the Illinois senator who bested her in the Democratic primary season leading up to Thursday's nomination. Fewer than half of Clinton's primary supporters say they definitely will vote for Obama in November, according to a USA TODAY/Gallup Poll released Monday.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If she can't deliver a big enough majority of the 18 million people who voted for her -- people for whom she has claimed to be a champion -- Clinton could lose her hard-won stature as a power broker. It could make Obama's quest to defeat Republican John McCain all the more difficult. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Ed Rendell, one of Clinton's strongest early supporters, said he believes the New York lawmaker will get the job done.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guarantee you that you are going to hear a message from Hillary Clinton ... that's going to be loud and clear and unequivocal. If you love Hillary, get out there and work your hearts out for Barack,&quot; Rendell told Pennsylvania delegates at a breakfast meeting yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's going to be the theme for us. We've got to leave here as a delegation fired up, united and ready to do what's necessary to take this country back,&quot; Rendell said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Gallup Poll taken Thursday through Saturday, 47 percent of Clinton supporters say they are solidly behind Obama, and 23 percent say they support him but might change their minds before the election. Thirty percent say they will vote for McCain, someone else or no one at all. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're not focusing on her future. They seem to think if Obama loses, that gives her a chance in 2012,&quot; said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. The rest of the party &quot;will never forgive her and (former president) Bill (Clinton) if Obama loses.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign released a television ad aimed at chipping away at the Democrats' plan to unify the party behind Obama during the four-day national convention here. The ad features Debra Bartoshevich, a Clinton delegate from Wisconsin, who says she proudly supported Clinton because &quot;she had the experience and judgment to be president.&quot; Bartoshevich says in the ad she's supporting McCain because &quot;now he's the one with the experience and judgment&quot; and says &quot;it's OK&quot; for Democrats to vote for the Republican. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad comes after McCain released another spot laden with Clinton's quotes criticizing Obama during the primary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is trying to sway voters like Amber and Gavin Ekstron, a Denver couple who brought their three young children downtown to get a glimpse of a national political convention. The registered Democrats backed Clinton but are unsure about Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do like Hillary,&quot; said Amber Ekstron, 29, who is in the real estate business. &quot;Now we're a little confused. We're trying to educate ourselves.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gavin Ekstron, 34, a mortgage lender, said Obama's pick of Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware as a running mate seems a good choice. He's uncertain whether he'll vote for Obama or sit the election out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I need to be convinced,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So do some delegates.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are some people who are still having a hard time. They put their hearts and souls in the campaign and are disappointed, but I don't see any movement on any of the Clinton officials to fire that up and keep that going,&quot; said Michael Crossey of Mt. Lebanon, a former Allegheny County councilman and Clinton delegate.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County Chief Executive Dan Onorato, who endorsed Clinton in the primary, said he expects no ruckus on the convention floor from upset Clinton supporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Hillary Clinton has a great and golden opportunity (tonight), and I think she will do it in a great way,&quot; Onorato said. &quot;Anything I've seen or heard of her across the country, she's for Barack Obama. I don't know what more she could do to say 'Go vote for him.' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far as I'm concerned, we're all Obama supporters,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Onorato said Obama has started shoring up support from the white, blue-collar Democrats who went for Clinton in the primary by picking Biden, a Scranton native, as his running mate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden was a great pick for Pennsylvania. Obviously, he has roots from Scranton, but he has that image as the blue-collar senator,&quot; Onorato said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton is expected on Wednesday to release the delegates she won in primaries and caucuses and encourage them to support Obama. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Obama campaign ad linking John McCain to former Christian Coalition executive Ralph Reed and the Abramoff lobbying scandal fails to provide an accurate picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad says that Reed &quot;is now raising money for McCain's campaign.&quot; But McCain has said he has not sought, nor does he want Reed's support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad says that McCain, as a Senate committee chairman, &quot;never even called Reed to testify&quot; about Abramoff, which is true. But McCain's public report embarrassed Reed and damaged him politically nonetheless. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's presidential campaign released the ad Aug. 20 in Georgia where Reed lost a bid for state office in 2006 in part because of unfavorable publicity over his Abramoff ties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad says that Reed is &quot;now raising money for McCain's campaign.&quot; That is true. The Hill newspaper reported that Reed sent out an e-mail to friends and associates urging them to contribute to McCain's campaign and attend a fundraiser for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there isn't any formal connection between McCain's campaign and Reed's activities. McCain flatly told the Atlanta Journal Constitution that, &quot;I neither seek nor want his support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reed appears to have gotten the message. He didn't even appear at the fundraiser he told friends to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad calls Reed a &quot;power broker&quot; who was &quot;in the middle&quot; of &quot;one of Washington's biggest scandals,&quot; the Jack Abramoff affair. And it says that McCain, as chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, &quot;never even called Reed to testify&quot; in the Abramoff investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's all true, but what's not said is that McCain's report caused Reed political embarrassment, making public evidence that contradicted Reed's claim that he hadn't known that his lobbying activities among anti-gambling Christian activists had been paid for by casino-owning Indian tribes who wanted to suppress competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's Committee on Indian Affairs held a series of three tribal lobbying hearings in 2005 on Abramoff's lobbying for tribes with gaming interests. The result of those hearings was a damning 373-page report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists had uncovered Reed's activities as a &quot;stealth lobbyist&quot; for tribal casino interests the year before and had traced $4 million in fees to Reed's company from the Coushatta tribe of Louisiana and the Choctaws of Mississippi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Reed denied knowledge that he'd been working for gambling interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When McCain's report was issued, however, it contained evidence that Reed was a willing and knowing partner, stirring up anti-gambling Christians to oppose gambling operations that might have competed with the tribes who were Abramoff's clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report described, for example, how Reed reached out to his old college friend Abramoff in 1998 seeking paid lobbying work after leaving the Christian Coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a $20,000 monthly retainer, Reed promised to stir up anti-gambling sentiment among a network of 3,000 pastors and 90,000 religious conservative households in Alabama. The object: to kill legislation that would have legalized video poker games at dog tracks in Alabama, which would have competed with the Silver Star casino in neighboring Mississippi, owned by Abramoff's client, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also worked against a bill to create an Alabama state lottery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later on, in 2001, Reed worked to support the efforts of the Texas attorney general to shut down casinos owned by two tribes in that state, while working secretly on behalf of the Coushatta tribe, which owned the Grand Casino across the state line in Louisiana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should McCain have been tougher on Reed, as Obama's&nbsp;ad suggests? Perhaps. But we should note that Reed was never the main focus of the federal criminal investigations that were under way at the same time that McCain was holding his Senate hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Abramoff and his partner Michael Scanlon were charged and then pleaded guilty to felony conspiracy charges. Reed, on the other hand, was not charged with any criminal wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's investigation focused primarily on how Abramoff and Scanlon fleeced tribes by charging them millions in lobbying fees for lobbying work they never performed. But as the report details, Reed actually performed the lobbying work he was paid to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what could Reed have told the committee if McCain had called him as a witness?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't know, and the Obama&nbsp;ad doesn't say.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER - As the Democrats prepared to open their convention tonight, top Republicans were doing all they could to stir any lingering resentment among delegates over Barack Obama's decision not to include Hillary Rodham Clinton on the ticket. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats said that the ploy wouldn't work, that the party would leave its convention energized and united, and that Obama's selection of Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware as his running mate was proving popular throughout party ranks.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain's campaign set the terms of the day's political conversation by unveiling a commercial suggesting that Clinton had been passed over because of her critical remarks about Obama during their long and sometimes bitter fight for the Democratic presidential nomination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She won millions of votes but isn't on his ticket,&quot; an announcer says. &quot;Why? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For speaking the truth.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad includes clips of Clinton raising questions about the presumptive Democratic nominee and concludes: &quot;The truth hurt, and Obama didn't like it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Sunday talk shows, Republican spokesmen sounded the same theme. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what he thought of Obama's selection of Biden, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani called it a choice made out of weakness and added: &quot;The story here is more the Obama-not-Clinton ticket.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a potential McCain running mate: &quot;If I were a Hillary Clinton supporter this morning, I'd be scratching my head.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats said any effectiveness that the commercial might have would be short-lived. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Rendell predicted that Clinton's much-anticipated speech tomorrow night &quot;will blow this ad out of the water.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, who was a finalist in the vice-presidential selection process, agreed. &quot;Right now, I don't think there's any question that the Clintons are wholeheartedly behind Barack Obama,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Associated Press reported that Clinton was inviting her pledged delegates to a reception Wednesday, before the presidential roll call. There, in a show of support for Obama, she reportedly was planning to release her delegates from their pledges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's aides said their man spoke to both Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton by telephone late last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In seeking the roll call, Hillary Clinton said the event would provide &quot;catharsis&quot; for her most devoted supporters, many of whom are delegates. How all of this plays out will help determine how much of a problem Obama still faces in trying to bring the party together before November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls are all over the lot on the question of what percentage of Clinton's 18 million primary voters are prepared to support Obama in the fall. But the surveys indicate that at least one-third of them, and perhaps more, have yet to commit themselves, and a substantial minority say they will vote for McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonight's opening session, which has the theme of &quot;One Nation,&quot; will begin to answer the question of how much emphasis the Obama team plans to put this week on fleshing out its candidate and how much on drawing the contrasts between his positions and those of his Republican opponent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago, strategists for then-nominee John Kerry were widely criticized after the fact for having refrained from attacking their opponent, President Bush, and focusing almost exclusively on Kerry's biography. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Axelrod, Obama's chief strategist, suggested that his campaign would not leave itself open to that kind of criticism in 2008. &quot;We're not going to shy away from making the contrast,&quot; he said, and telling the story &quot;of what's happened to this country&quot; in the last eight years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Night One, though, the emphasis will surely be on the Obama biography. The headline speaker is his wife, Michelle, and she will be preceded by his half-sister and his brother-in-law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on the program is a tribute to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who is suffering from brain cancer and unable to attend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's choice for vice president, Biden, continued to be a center of attention yesterday, even though he stayed largely out of public view in Delaware. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain offered his own reaction to the choice. In an interview with Katie Couric of CBS News, he called it &quot;a very wise selection&quot; and described Biden, his longtime Senate colleague, as &quot;a good friend and a good man.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In honor of Biden's prospective nomination, convention organizers moved the seats set aside for the Delaware delegation from the rear of the Pepsi Center to a prime location on the floor. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, traffic in the downtown area was occasionally disrupted by about 1,000 peaceful antiwar demonstrators who marched through the city streets. </SPAN></P>

And they're in Denver for the quadrennial TV infomercial known as the Democratic National Convention. While you won't be seeing any slogans about bright and clean (except during the Tide commercials), you will be seeing and hearing a lot about change.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of U.S. Sen. Barack Obama's presidential acceptance speech is &quot;change you can believe in.&quot; His newly minted running-mate, Delaware Sen. Joe Biden, who is about as inside the Beltway as you can be, &quot;has brought change to Washington,&quot; Obama said. The convention will air clips daily of everyday Americans calling for change. Panhandlers outside the Pepsi Center will be asking for change. Change, change, change. Then the Republicans will be in your face next week with their convention. Their theme: &quot;Country First.&quot; Yeah! We'll be ready for some LeAnn Rimes after all that loose change talk. But first, here's a look at the week ahead: Tonight: Michelle night! The Dems' subject tonight is &quot;One Nation,&quot; but the highlight will be Michelle Obama's speech. Right-wing pundits have portrayed her as a bitter radical. The National Review featured her on the cover under the headline &quot;Mrs. Grievance.&quot; Look for her to undermine that image by talking about her daughters and showing a bit of Jackie O style. Tomorrow night: Hillary night!The subject is &quot;Renewing America's Promise,&quot; but the mission is for primetime speaker U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton to protect Obama from a PUMA attack. PUMA is the acronymn for &quot;party unity my ass,&quot; a coalition of Clinton supporters who resent her treatment by Obama and the media. Wednesday night: Biden night!The topic is &quot;Securing America's Future,&quot; which will give Biden a chance to strut his best issue &amp;mdash; foreign policy &amp;mdash; in his acceptance speech. Also speaking: Bill Clinton. Forecast: Windy. Thursday night: Obama night! Obama, whose &quot;we're one people&quot; keynote speech at the 2004 convention brought down the house, will try to top it with his acceptance speech before 75,000 people at Invesco Mile High Stadium. Adding to the pressure: It will be the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. Friday: McCain day! Republican presidential nominee-to-be John McCain is expected to knock the Dems off the evening news by announcing his vice-presidential pick. Eddie's big mouthGov. Rendell, who's habit of speaking his mind gets him in more hot water than Michael Phelps, did it again. During a panel discussion on TV coverage yesterday, Rendell complained about the treatment of Hillary Clinton, whom he supported, calling MSNBC &quot;the official network of the Obama campaign,&quot; according to Politico.com This won't help calm down the PUMAs. Biden's big mouth A national Democratic consultant who likes Obama's pick of Joe Biden cautions nonetheless against Biden's habit of blunt, sometimes controversial statements. &quot;One thing is certain,&quot; this consultant tells us, &quot;three times between now and November, someone in Chicago [Obama's headquarters] will be answering the phone with these three words: &quot;HE SAID WHAT!?&quot; Rendell's trip: He's paying With the flap over Mayor Nutter using tax dollars to pay for his five-person entourage to attend the convention, we wondered how Gov. Rendell was paying. According to spokesman Chuck Ardo, Rendell, like Nutter, is paying his own way with campaign money. Unlike Nutter, however, his campaign fund is also paying for his staffers (two) to attend. But Rendell is always accompanied by a security detail. Who's paying for them? &quot;I can't discuss security,&quot; Ardo said. Translation: Taxpayers are paying for security. Best of the blogs So far, Hillary Clinton has been full of praise for Barack Obama's vice presidential pick, Joe Biden, and their service together in the Senate surely helped Clinton and Biden bond. But there may be more here than meets the eye. Many believe that Clinton wants one more grab at the brass ring, and Biden makes that more possible. Now 66, Biden would turn 74 shortly after the 2016 election. So even if Obama can win two terms, the Delawarian would be unlikely to run to succeed him. That means that Clinton could either run against a President McCain in 2012 or for a wide open White House in eight years, when she'll be a mere 68. Or as McCain might say, &quot;a spring chicken.&quot; &amp;mdash; Will Bunch's Daily News blog Attytood (www.attytood.com.) Joe Biden, teenagebabe magnet? &quot;Anyhow, I would be lying if I said that young Joe seemed destined for politics, let alone greatness. He had little to distinguish himself from the teenaged crowd that I aspired to be a part of beyond having overcome a bad stutter to become a handsome and loquacious babe magnet who happened to have the nicest parents in the world.&quot; &amp;mdash; The blog Kiko's House (kikoshouse.blogspot.com), by former Daily News staffer Shaun Mullen, who knew Biden back when. Not every Democrat was thrilled with Biden's selection. He's alienated many progressives over the years, especially when he voted with the GOP in 2005 on a bankruptcy bill viewed as a sop to big credit-card companies, many of which are based in Delaware. &quot;Biden is a reliable supporter of virtually every prevailing bit of conventional wisdom within the American elite political consensus, which is why his selection has been widely praised by the establishment,&quot; blogged Salon.com's Glenn Greenwald. * Staff writers Gar Joseph, Will Bunch and John Baer compiled this report. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EAU CLAIRE, Wis. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the eve of the Democratic National Convention, Sen. Barack Obama yesterday framed the November election as a choice between watching the country &quot;get run into the ground&quot; under another Republican president or &quot;solving the big problems&quot; that America faces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama also gave a preview of the speech that his wife, Michelle, will give tonight at the Denver gathering. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You'll have a sense of who she is, and what our values are, and how we're raising our kids,&quot; Mr. Obama told a few hundred supporters gathered under towering weeping willows in a lakefront park in western Wisconsin, a quadrennial White House battleground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I think what you'll conclude is: He's sort of like us. He comes from a middle-class background. He went to school on scholarships. He had to pay off student loans. He and his wife had to worry about child care. They had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, meanwhile, came under attack from Republicans, who took an unusual swipe at him for bypassing Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton as his running mate and instead selecting Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Sen. John McCain took a day off from the campaign trail and attended church and a baseball game, his organization released a new TV spot asserting that Mrs. Clinton was overlooked for the No. 2 slot on the Democratic ticket because she judged Mr. Obama harshly during the primary. The ad quotes Mrs. Clinton saying &quot;you never hear the specifics&quot; of Mr. Obama's plans and that his campaign had turned &quot;increasingly negative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She won millions of votes but isn't on the ticket,&quot; the announcer on the ad says. &quot;Why? For speaking the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who will deliver the keynote address at the Republican National Convention next week, contended yesterday that by not picking Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama's &quot;choice was made from weakness, not strength.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The strong choice would have been Hillary Clinton,&quot; Mr. Giuliani said on ABC's &quot;This Week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice-presidential pick of the Democratic Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, also on the show, responded that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee &quot;has a high regard for Sen. Clinton. She's going to be an important voice in this campaign, she's going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration. He felt that Sen. Biden would be the best fit for him at this time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Clinton spokeswoman released a statement responding to the ad by saying, &quot;Hillary Clinton's support of Barack Obama is clear. She has said repeatedly that Barack Obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country, getting us out of Iraq, and expanding access to health care. John McCain doesn't. It's interesting how those remarks didn't make it into his ad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republicans' line of attack appeared to be an attempt to stoke the lingering resentments among Clinton supporters who watched their candidate fall barely short of the votes needed for the presidential nomination. Mrs. Clinton and her husband have prime speaking slots at the convention in Denver, which begins today. Her name will be formally placed in nomination Thursday night, when Obama is expected to be chosen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, polls show that some Clinton supporters are not rallying behind Mr. Obama. In an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll last week, only 52 percent said they planned to vote for Mr. Obama, while 21 percent supported Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's surrogates argued yesterday that the Biden selection showed their candidate's strengths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What it really shows is Barack Obama has the confidence and the judgment to pick someone who is really experienced and is willing to speak their minds,&quot; Caroline Kennedy, daughter of the late President Kennedy and one of the lawyers in charge of vetting Obama's vice-presidential candidates, said on &quot;Meet the Press.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Biden is to spend the week in Denver, where the party is holding its convention, while Mr. Obama swings through battleground states before arriving in Colorado Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before leaving Eau Claire for Chicago, Mr. Obama talked with reporters on an airport tarmac about his acceptance speech, which he has been working on over the past several nights at a Chicago hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am still tooling around with my speech a little bit,&quot; he said. &quot;It may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights, but hopefully it will make clear the choice that the American people are going to face in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama also said Mr. Biden would be a &quot;great counselor on international crises that may come up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he stuck mostly to the economy on his morning visit to Wisconsin, using sarcasm to portray Mr. McCain as out of touch with working Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He ridiculed McCain for losing track of how many homes he owns and saying that $5 million defines a person as rich. Mr. Obama joked that those making $4 million a year were &quot;scrimping.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're having a tough time,&quot; he told the laughing crowd in the park. &quot;You're middle class. If you only have 1 million, I don't know what -- you qualify for food stamps.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER -- On the eve of their national convention, Democrats appeared eager to woo a segment of the electorate more identified with the GOP in recent presidential elections: the God vote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 3,000 delegates, party officials and others participating in the Democratic National Convention assembled Sunday afternoon at the Colorado Convention Center for an interfaith worship service. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The service, including choirs singing hymns and spiritual leaders offering prayers from a variety of faiths -- Christian, Jewish, Islamic, Buddhist and others -- was touted as the first time an interfaith event kicked off the party's convention week.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's about time,&quot; said delegate Valerie McDonald Roberts, a former Pittsburgh city councilwoman and Allegheny County recorder of deeds, who attended the event. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a great event to kick things off, basically an invocation for the weeklong process of our convention that we are about to participate in,&quot; she said. &quot;Look, we are a big-tent party and that was one big tent in there. We had Buddhist and Jews, Catholics and evangelical Christians all talking quite frankly and respectfully about their role within the party.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The convention officially starts today as an estimated 50,000 delegates, visitors, politicians and journalists converge for the first formal session from 3 to 9 p.m. Opening hoopla gives way to business sessions and caucus meetings throughout the day, while nightly sessions allotted for prime-time speeches will build to a climax on Thursday with Sen. Barack Obama's acceptance speech. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, the first black person to be nominated for president by a major party, is scheduled to accept the nomination before a crowd of 75,000 at Invesco at Mile High Stadium. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, hoping to unite the Democratic Party and cement her future in it, will gather her hard-won primary delegates Wednesday at a reception where she is expected to formally release them to Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton has invited her pledged delegates to a reception at the Colorado Convention Center, not far from the main Democratic National Convention arena. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high-profile gathering of political regulars who once fought against Obama serves a dual purpose for Clinton: Show fellow Democrats that she can be a team player and display her still formidable political strengths for the future. Many of her supporters want her to run for president again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Clinton delegates still plan to vote for her at the convention, even if she releases them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is much bigger than Hillary,&quot; said Pam Durham, a Clinton delegate from Fort Worth, Texas. &quot;I have a responsibility. I do not own my vote. I have to represent the voters who sent me.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pittsburgh City Council President Doug Shields, a delegate and Obama supporter, said it's appropriate for the party to allow Clinton backers to express themselves. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Politically, it's a smart move,&quot; said Shields of Squirrel Hill. &quot;Democratic primaries are always hard fought. I think it's out of respect, and that's good.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, started a television ad suggesting Obama snubbed Clinton for the vice presidential spot because of her criticism of him during the Democratic primary fight. McCain's campaign hopes to persuade disenchanted Democrats who backed Clinton to vote for him in the Nov. 4 election.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton aides responded that she clearly supports Obama and agrees with him on important issues such as health care and the Iraq war, and doesn't agree with McCain on those issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter welcomed the crowd at the interfaith service, saying Democrats need to &quot;remind the rest of the country that in our party there is absolutely an intersection of faith and politics.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic strategist Dane Strother said the interfaith service event, called &quot;Faith in Action,&quot; sends an important signal.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot cede the evangelical voter any longer,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christian conservatives played a significant role in President George W. Bush's victories in 2000 and 2004.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democrats are doing a much more inclusive job this year in reaching out to people of faith,&quot; Strother said. &quot;And, we are showing much more respect beginning with the convention having the interfaith service and asking various religious leaders to give invocations at the convention.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burns Strider, who was dubbed Hillary Clinton's &quot;Faith Guru,&quot; said the service inspired him.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democratic Party has allowed something extremely authentic and unusual to happen today: an event absent of sound bites and controlled message. What a breath of fresh air,&quot; said Strider, a consultant to politicians, businesses and nonprofits on faith issues. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER -- Gov. Ed Rendell today made his strongest pitch for party unity since the hard-fought Democratic primary, telling Pennsylvania delegates to the national convention it's time for Hillary Clinton backers to join Barack Obama's bandwagon.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you love Hillary, get out there and work your heart out for Barack,&quot; Rendell said during a delegation breakfast at the Marriott Tech Center Hotel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor said the Republican party has targeted Pennsylvania as one of three states that went to the Democrats in 2004 that the GOP hopes to carry for John McCain in November. </SPAN></P>

I think she would make a great president. We worked our hearts out. So did many of you. We carried the state of Pennsylvania -- but that's over. If you want Hillary Clinton to be president -- I think someday she might be, but it's not going to be this year.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She has told us loud and clear that we can't waste a minute looking back,&quot; Rendell said. &quot;We've got to elect Senator Obama. He's a good man. His policies are almost identical to Senator Clinton's. If you care about Hillary, you've got to make sure we do the things she's asked us to do. She has asked us to give our heart and soul and the energy we displayed on her behalf to Senator Obama.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first Democratic National Convention in Denver in 100 years will get underway at 3 p.m. local time (5 p.m. in Pittsburgh).

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 15,000 journalists will be taking notes as approximately 4,440 delegates, ranging in age from 17 to 91, get down to business at the Pepsi Center leading up to Obama's expected nomination Wednesday night. Obama is scheduled to deliver his acceptance speech Thursday night before a crowd of 75,000 at Invesco Field at Mile High. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign today released a television spot trying to chip away at the Democrats' plan to unify the party behind Obama. The ad features Debra Bartoshevich, identifying herself as a Democrat who proudly supported Clinton because &quot;she had the experience and judgment to be president.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman says she's supporting McCain because &quot;now he's the one with the experience and judgment.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama holds a town hall meeting with Iowans today in Davenport.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER - Sen. Barack Obama, who has built his campaign on the theme of change, yesterday opted for Washington experience and foreign-policy expertise in making Delaware Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. his choice for vice president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a rally at the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Ill., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee described the 36-year veteran of the Senate as someone &quot;uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once ratified by the party convention in Denver this week, Biden, 65, a two-time presidential candidate himself, will become the first Delawarean in history to run on a major national party ticket. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden is what so many others pretend to be - a statesman with sound judgment who doesn't have to hide behind bluster to keep America strong,&quot; Obama told the crowd at the site where he launched his own candidacy 19 months ago. &quot;Joe won't just make a good vice president - he will make a great one.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Obama finished the introduction, inadvertently referring to his running mate as the next &quot;president&quot; before correcting himself, Biden jogged the length of the stage and embraced him. In his own remarks, Biden talked of the values the two men shared and bemoaned the state of America under Republican stewardship. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I say with every fiber in my being: We cannot stand four more years of this,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he attacked Republican presidential candidate John McCain, his Senate colleague and longtime friend, saying McCain's election would amount to four more years of President Bush. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These times call for total change in Washington's worldview,&quot; said Biden, before turning his focus to McCain more directly. &quot;These times require more than a good soldier. They require a wise leader.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In explaining his choice, Obama cited the character, expertise and accomplishments of a senator who has been in Washington for more than half his life - a fact that McCain and the Republicans sought to turn into a negative by suggesting that Obama, in turning to Biden, was admitting he did not have enough experience to be president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign put out a television commercial showing footage from a debate in August 2007, in which Biden confirmed that he had said of Obama: &quot;I think he can be ready, but right now I don't believe he is. The presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training.&quot; The ad also shows Biden praising McCain, saying he &quot;would be honored to run with or against&quot; the Arizona senator because &quot;the country would be better off.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prominent Democrats, though, were quick to express their approval. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who many of her backers hoped would get the call, hailed Biden as &quot;exceptionally strong, experienced leader and devoted public servant&quot; who would be a &quot;purposeful and dynamic&quot; vice president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kim Gandy, who chairs NOW's political action committee and favored Clinton, described Biden as &quot;a friend of women and a strong selection.&quot; The Rev. Jesse Jackson said that Obama &quot;has struck Olympic gold.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Carper, Biden's fellow Democratic senator from Delaware, said Obama had shown &quot;exemplary judgment&quot; in his choice, adding: &quot;Joe brings experience to Barack's message of change.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Republican senators - including Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, who had been mentioned as a possible Obama running mate himself - had kind words for Biden, as did his close friend and frequent Amtrak seatmate, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specter complimented Obama on the selection, spoke of the contrast in experience between the two men, and added: &quot;If it were a race between Sen. McCain and Sen. Biden, it would be a very different race.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden is scheduled to arrive here in time to begin campaigning among the delegates before speaking to the full convention Wednesday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in Scranton, Biden moved with his family to the Wilmington area when he was 10. After graduating from the University of Delaware and Syracuse University Law School, he got elected to the New Castle County Council at age 27. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years later, he won the Senate seat that he has held ever since by upsetting Caleb Boggs, a longtime Republican incumbent. He hasn't had a tough race since. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Biden could take office, however, his life was shattered by an automobile accident that killed his wife and his daughter and injured his two young sons. He took the oath of office in his sons' hospital room. In order to spend more time with them, he began commuting to Washington on Amtrak, a practice he never abandoned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He quickly gained a reputation as one of the Democratic Party's most compelling orators, a reputation that helped thrust him into the battle for his party's presidential nomination in 1988. But his candidacy crashed and burned after the revelation that he had virtually stolen his stump speech from a British politician. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Senate, Biden served as chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee in the 1980s and 1990s. He played prominent roles in the successful fight to prevent Robert Bork from taking a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court and in the failed attempt to block the confirmation of Clarence Thomas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Starting in 1997, Biden shifted his focus to foreign relations - as chairman and ranking member on that committee - and ultimately became his party's leading spokesman on the subject in general and the Iraq war in particular.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he voted to authorize the war in 2002, he went on to become a staunch critic of the Bush administration's handling of the situation, saying the solution rested in dividing Iraq into three, semiautonomous regions, one each for the Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis. He also opposed the surge strategy, advocated by McCain and adopted by the administration, predicting it would fail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden's presidential candidacy this time around lasted only through the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucus. But he got strong reviews for his debate performances, in which he showed a new ability to control his tendency to talk too much. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years, Biden, whose nomination is expected to be ratified by the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, has compiled a voting record in the Senate that has been more liberal than conservative. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is up for reelection to the Senate this year, seeking a seventh term. Delaware law allows him to run for senator and vice president at the same time. Biden did not indicate yesterday whether he would do so, although his Republican opponent in the Senate race, Christine O'Donnell, called on him to step aside. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight years ago, Joseph Lieberman ran for both in Connecticut. He won a third term in the Senate even as he failed to win the vice presidency on the Democratic ticket with Al Gore. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Age: 65; born Nov. 20, 1942, in Scranton, the oldest of four siblings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> Experience:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. senator from Delaware since 1973; current chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and past chairman of the Judiciary Committee; New Castle County Council member, 1970-72; presidential candidate, 1988 and 2008. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> Education: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bachelor's degree in history and political science, University of Delaware, 1965; law degree, Syracuse University, 1968.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year ago, Democratic Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware was tramping around Iowa without a police escort or one of those attendant press mobs bristling with microphones. Running for president in the shadow of two celebrities, he was 20 years past his status as The Next Big Thing in American politics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, TV networks went live when Biden made his first appearance in Springfield, Ill., as Sen. Barack Obama's vice presidential running mate.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden, 65, an authority on foreign policy and a longtime Washington insider, shores up the perceived weaknesses of the 47-year-old Obama, who, in his first Senate term, lacks significant foreign-policy or legislative experience. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama made the critical strategic decision that he needed to reassure voters in his tightening race with Republican Sen. John McCain, picking a 36-year veteran of the Senate instead of an outside-the-Beltway choice that might have underscored what has been his core appeal, as the &quot;change&quot; candidate of a new generation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was another important imperative at work: opening a possible entr&eacute;e to the working-class white voters who mostly shunned Obama for Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in the final months of their Democratic primary battle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden comes from a blue-collar background and is a native of the battleground state of Pennsylvania, born in Scranton. His favorite TV show: any Philadelphia Eagles game. Biden also is Roman Catholic, a group that Obama had trouble connecting with during the primaries - though he supports abortion rights, making him acceptable to the party's feminist groups. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Illinois, Obama called Biden that &quot;scrappy kid from Scranton who beat the odds&quot; and said he would be a &quot;fighter&quot; for the middle class. Clinton also highlighted her Scranton ancestry - her father came from there - and used similar pugilistic language to win big in the Pennsylvania primary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm here for the cops and the firefighters, the teachers and the line workers . . . folks whose lives are the measure of whether the American dream endures,&quot; Biden said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his short-lived campaign for the 2008 nomination, Biden dwelled in briefing-book detail on foreign affairs and stressed the need to be careful in withdrawing from Iraq - at a time when most voters in the Iowa caucuses just wanted the troops out as soon as possible. &quot;Telling the truth is more important than making you feel good,&quot; Biden said at a corn-boil in eastern Iowa in August 2007, a sentiment he repeated often on the trail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inevitably, after Biden spoke in an Iowa home, VFW hall or a community center to a handful of Democrats, somebody would say something like: &quot;He's so qualified, so impressive. Too bad he can't win. Maybe he should be secretary of state.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Biden will be on a kind of diplomatic mission for Obama, though he is an envoy with bite. Biden has gravitas - sometimes he sounds like the prototype of a windy senator - but he also has a mischievous Irish gleam in his eye and loves the fight. He should be able to go after McCain while Obama stays above the fray. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe's out there hugging and kissing people - he just keeps going,&quot; John Martilla, Biden's media consultant since 1972, said last year, admiring how his client was working rooms in Iowa despite trailing in the polls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden prizes loyalty. Most of his aides have been with him for decades, and his closest adviser is his sister, Valerie Biden Owens, who managed his first campaign for county council years ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden's mouth also just keeps going. He's blunt and sardonic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Democrats consider the best sound bite of the campaign so far a shot that Biden took at Republican Rudy Giuliani in a televised debate last October at Drexel University. Every sentence that Giuliani utters has &quot;a subject, a verb and 9/11,&quot; Biden said. His rivals burst out laughing. In another debate, the moderator asked Biden if he could exercise enough verbal discipline to be president. His succinct answer: &quot;Yes.&quot; At still another debate, with rivals scoring one hit or another, Biden began his answer with, &quot;You know, the American people could care less about what's going on up here.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, Biden tweaked McCain for his many houses, saying that before McCain could empathize with families' kitchen-table issues, he'd have to figure out which of seven tables at which to sit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The downside to his fluency is that Biden also has a long history of verbal gaffes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, Biden had to apologize just as Obama was kicking off his campaign last year because he said that Obama was &quot;the first mainstream African American [presidential candidate] who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.&quot; Campaigning in New Hampshire, Biden said that in Delaware, &quot;You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Republicans are already using Biden's remark last year that Obama was not qualified to be president in an attack ad - and Pennsylvania GOP chairman Rob Gleason said that the pick &quot;weakens their ticket&quot; by pairing the &quot;consummate Washington insider&quot; with the candidate of change. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama may have been looking at Biden's biography differently. He has overcome tremendous obstacles: the accident that killed his wife and daughter and critically injured his two sons before he was sworn in to the Senate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His first presidential campaign, in 1988, ended in accusations of plagiarism, and then a brain aneurysm almost killed him. Becoming Obama's running mate represents getting up after you get knocked down, as Biden likes to put it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a seasoned guy . . . and I really feel completely at ease,&quot; Biden said in an interview last year during a snowstorm in Muscatine, Iowa.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER - One of the most intense two weeks in modern political history begins today as Democrats arrive here to nominate Sen. Barack Obama as their candidate for president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not since 1916 have the two major parties met back to back, as they are doing this year; the Republicans will assemble next week in St. Paul, Minn., to bestow their nomination on Sen. John McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And never before have both conventions been held so close to Election Day.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an age when nominations are won and lost in the primaries, political conventions have become little more than carefully staged, nationally televised infomercials designed to showcase the candidate, stir the faithful, and woo the undecided.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, Obama has a lot he'd like to accomplish during four days in Denver starting tomorrow. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His overriding goal is to reinvigorate a campaign that has stalled in the last month - losing some of its sense of being special - and boost a polling lead that has dwindled to almost nothing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ideal convention for Obama, who still benefits from a national political landscape that favors the Democrats, would accomplish the following, analysts say: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cast his unusual life story as a classic American tale of success, built on the familiar elements of merit, hard work and achievement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make undecided voters more comfortable with a man who has limited foreign-policy experience and only four years on the national stage, starting with his breakthrough speech at the last convention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Complete the unification of a party that split almost precisely in half - with a majority of Democratic women on the other side - during his long, tough nomination fight with Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portray a McCain presidency, despite the Arizonan's reputation as a maverick, as four more years of George W. Bush, particularly when it comes to economics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Address the concerns among some party leaders that there isn't much that drives Obama beyond vague notions of change and hope, and that he's having trouble making a visceral connection with blue-collar voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his campaign appearances and television commercials, the Illinois senator has begun trying to develop more of a traditional, meat-and-potatoes economic message. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has sought to depict McCain as a politician out of touch with the woes of struggling families - to which the Arizonan contributed by not knowing how many homes he and his wife own - and himself as a populist who understands their fears and would cut their taxes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said last week that he wanted voters to look at him and say, &quot;This is somebody who's going to fight for me.&quot; A new campaign ad, now airing in Philadelphia, ends with the words: &quot;Barack Obama: The middle class first.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the convention, the trick for the Obama team will be to avoid unwanted drama without putting the country to sleep. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any hint of drama is likely to come courtesy of the Clintons, the former president and the current senator, whose relationships with Obama remain a subject of intense interest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday night, in a move intended to heal wounds rather than reopen them, Hillary Clinton's name will be put in nomination. A roll call will then proceed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How it all plays out - and how the die-hard supporters of the most successful female presidential candidate in history react - will determine the degree to which the event provides the &quot;catharsis&quot; leading to unity that Clinton says she wants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another element of uncertainty involves Obama's acceptance speech, set for Thursday night at Invesco Field at Mile High, the football stadium where the NFL's Denver Broncos play. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the weather could gum up the works, the forecast is for fair skies. More important, delivering the speech before 75,000 screaming fans could feed into the Republican theme, developed after Obama's massive rally in Berlin last month, that the man is more celebrity than leader. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If all goes well, the week should produce a &quot;bounce&quot; in the polls for Obama. But a study by the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank, shows that the bounces produced by recent conventions were modest and short. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2000, for instance, the last election without an incumbent, Bush got an 8-percentage-point boost from the Republican convention in Philadelphia. But two weeks later, Al Gore got the 8 points back after his gathering in Los Angeles.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What bounces there will be in 2008, with the conventions right on top of each other, remain to be seen. In any event, McCain appears ready to try to steal some of Obama's thunder by naming his running mate as early as Friday, the day after Obama's big speech. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Democrats get down to business tomorrow night, the focus will be squarely on Obama himself, even though he won't get to town until midweek. The featured speaker is his wife, Michelle, to be preceded by his half-sister and his brother-in-law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton will occupy the spotlight. Wednesday's program includes former President Bill Clinton and the acceptance speech by the vice presidential nominee, Delaware Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The finale on Thursday will be Obama's acceptance speech, which comes, remarkably, on the anniversary of the &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania, which has seen more television commercials thus far than any other state, will get a lot of attention at the convention as well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The roster of speakers includes Rep. Patrick Murphy of Bucks County, the first Iraq war veteran to be elected to the House; Gov. Rendell, one of Clinton's leading supporters in the nominating fight; and Sen. Bob Casey, an antiabortion politician whose antiabortion father, the former governor, wanted to give a speech about his position at the 1992 convention but was kept off the podium. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denver has hosted a national political convention only once before, precisely 100 years ago, when the Democrats came to town to nominate William Jennings Bryan for the third time. He lost the election, as he had the previous two. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Twin Cities have gone even longer without a convention; the Republicans met in Minneapolis in 1892, nominating Benjamin Harrison. Despite being the incumbent, Harrison lost, too. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time around, one of them is pretty much guaranteed to pick a winner. What happens the next two weeks will help determine which one. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election chatter has been picking up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pizza Hut ran a national commercial earlier this year showing a college student thinking about not voting; thousands bought American Eagle Outfitters' T-shirts that urge voting; then, those old enough to be a part of the &quot;Dewmocracy&quot; weighed in on the next hot Mountain Dew flavor ... or was it the best combo dinner at Smokey Bones restaurants that they were being asked to vote on?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as John McCain and Barack Obama spend millions of dollars on messages meant to reverberate with the American electorate, marketers selling everything from pulled pork to cars are making a bid for relevancy by dropping electoral themes into their ad campaigns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The election is going to consume our attention from now until October,&quot; predicted Tom Dowling, managing director with marketing firm Burson-Marsteller's Downtown office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the Olympics are over, he's so convinced the nation, its media and its consumers will be tuned into the showdown over the White House that he's been telling his firm's public relations clients to think about how their message might relate to the political scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His advice: &quot;If your story doesn't somehow, some way connect to the election, don't even bother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political flavoring of the commercial environment is a cyclical thing, as predictable as the battle for the presidency every four years, according to Kathleen Hall Jamieson, professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania who studies campaign rhetoric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When it's clever, it potentially works,&quot; she said. &quot;The danger, of course, is it's clever and you forget the product.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertisers generally avoid any appearance of taking sides, Dr. Jamieson said. Nobody expects to see a spot asking Republicans to buy Chevy trucks or pushing Volvos to Democrats. &quot;You don't ever want to divide your audience,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumers get enough of the serious, sometimes negative, messages from candidates, political action groups and others trying to influence the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, marketers often link their product to politics through humor. A recent Smokey Bones promotion put images of cows, chickens, turkeys and pigs -- no donkeys or elephants -- in star-spangled red, white and blue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Maytag repairman has been seen fixing a voting machine. Were those hanging chads he discovered?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Mr. Opportunity character who pitches Hondas picked up on a phrase made familiar by federal election guidelines: &quot;I approve this message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Jamieson joked some opportunities haven't been truly exploited. She recommends trying political themes in spots for mouthwash and aids to indigestion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I were an advertiser, that's what I would do,&quot; she said, with a laugh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seemingly irresistible are quirky quests for the nation's highest office, and not just for entertainment figures such as comedian Stephen Colbert and celebrity heiress Paris Hilton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few days ago, Captain Morgan, a brand character who sells rum for London-based Diageo, announced a run for the presidency using the slogan &quot;putting the party back in politics.&quot; Back when Morris the Cat of 9Lives cat food fame worked for the H.J. Heinz Co. (he's now an employee of Del Monte Foods), he took a shot at the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another popular way to link to politics includes the kind of get-out-the-vote messages that have been produced by brands such as Pizza Hut and KFC. The Rock The Vote organization began voter registration campaigns more than a decade ago and has been associated with MTV, Fox, even Comcast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for South Side-based American Eagle said the teen retailer has had a good response to its &quot;Vote&quot; T-shirts and planned to continue offering them online through the election, although they're no longer available in stores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to go wrong just urging people to claim their right to weigh in on the nation's future. Patriots, not to mention fans of both radio host Rush Limbaugh and Comedy Central's political satire &quot;The Daily Show,&quot; can support that message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, since this is politics, observers see nuances even in that theme. Mr. Dowling said advertisers who target a younger demographic might be noticing how many young people are gravitating toward the Obama message and trying to catch that wave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Depending on where companies place get-out-the-vote ads, such messages have the potential to influence the actual vote, if only in a small way, said Dr. Jamieson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It can create a political message,&quot; she said. Advertisers typically buy spots on certain TV shows or in certain publications because they know who is paying attention to those media outlets. If the audience skews toward fans of one candidate or the other and the get-out-the-vote campaign increases turnout among those people, it could mean a few extra levers pulled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A T-shirt promotion announced by KFC in June may accomplish the marketing feat of avoiding an appearance of conflicts while making chicken wings top of mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fast-food chain is selling three $15 shirts: a &quot;right wing&quot; red one, a &quot;left wing&quot; blue one and, for the undecided, a white one that says, &quot;Left wing, right wing: Tastes the same to me.&quot; All have a small image of Colonel Harland Sanders tucked into the artwork.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats begin their national convention with a queasy feeling in the pits of their stomachs. Barack Obama has plunged in the polls, falling into a statistical tie with John McCain. The election that was supposed to be in the bag isn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats blame the plunge on negative ads. They plan to respond in kind. The first few days of their convention will feature nonstop assaults on the presumptive GOP nominee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats' strategy is driven by what they think happened to John Kerry in 2004. His plans to run as a war hero came a cropper when 15 of the 23 officers who served with him in Vietnam declared him &quot;Unfit for Command.&quot; Democrats believe Sen. Kerry's sluggish response to their charges is what cost him the presidency. Sen. Obama has declared he will not be &quot;swift-boated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Democratic strategy has two serious flaws. The first is the blithe assumption by Democrats that if voters prefer the Republican candidate, it has to be because the Republican played a dirty trick. The thought that voters might prefer the Republican because of perceived shortcomings in the Democrat never crosses their minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should. The Swifties' charges hit home because they were credible and came from a credible source. It is Sen. Obama's inexperience and ego, not the brilliance of Sen. McCain's&nbsp;ad writers, that have made his ads mocking Sen. Obama's celebrity status resonate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second is their tendency to confuse rudeness with toughness. Liberal bloggers imagine they're being tough when they use profane language to say nasty things about their opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whining isn't toughness, either. After Sen. McCain bested their man at Pastor Rick Warren's presidential forum last weekend, Sen. Obama staffers told reporters the old white guy must have cheated. Mr. Obama complained, falsely, to the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Tuesday that Mr. McCain has been questioning his patriotism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor is braggadocio. In North Carolina on Tuesday, Mr. Obama said: &quot;John McCain doesn't know what he's up against.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All that is missing is the quivering lip and foot-stomping,&quot; wrote Jennifer Rubin of Commentary Magazine's blog about Mr. Obama's remarks in North Carolina. &quot;I am too tough! I am not going to lose! Presidential it is not. Panicky and defensive it is.&quot; There's more to being tough than talking tough. Unless Sen. Obama resolves rising doubts about his toughness, talking tough just makes him seem wimpier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats plan to paint Mr. McCain as the reincarnation of George W. Bush. This will be difficult to do, since it is so obviously untrue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that truth has been much of a barrier to a Democratic line of attack. Obama surrogates have been referring to Sen. McCain as &quot;Exxon John&quot; because both he and the giant oil company favor offshore drilling. But Exxon employees have given more money to Mr. Obama ($42,100) than to Mr. McCain ($35,166), and Mr. Obama voted for the 2005 energy bill that gave massive tax breaks to oil companies, while Mr. McCain voted against it because he opposed those tax breaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even if Democrats succeed in tarnishing Mr. McCain, it won't solve their fundamental problem, because this election is mostly about Barack Obama. Who is he? What does he really believe? Does he know enough, is he strong enough to lead?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain's message is pretty clear and essentially twofold,&quot; wrote liberal blogger Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo. &quot;Obama is, in so many words, a frivolous phony, someone who really doesn't have any business running for president. McCain is a strong leader who can defend the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From Obama, honestly, I don't sense a really clear message,&quot; Mr. Marshall said. &quot;There are attacks on McCain, some of which are quite good. There are positive, uplifting commercials ... But it's hard for me to come up with a clear-cut Obama message in the way that it's pretty simple for me to do with McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mr. Obama wants to stop his slide in the polls, he must recognize he has been chiefly responsible for it. If people think Mr. Obama has a big head and a thin skin, he must act in a way that belies that. He must be more forthcoming about his past. And when he makes a mistake or changes a position, he should acknowledge it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has to be clear about where he plans to lead the country and explain why he is qualified to do so. Hopenchange won't cut it anymore. His acceptance speech in Denver will be the most important of his life. What will he say?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sharpening rhetoric between Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama over their competing plans to overhaul the nation's tax system has underscored one of the most profound differences between them -- how they would target America's wealthiest taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Mr. McCain, the rich would see their tax burden ease. Under Mr. Obama, their rates would rise dramatically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For much of the campaign, the two candidates have talked sparingly and obliquely about how they would deal with affluent taxpayers. But a recent volley of acid-edged campaign ads stirred up the tax issue, and a question posed last weekend by Orange County pastor Rick Warren zeroed in on how both men defined &quot;rich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said the dividing line was income of $250,000 a year, while Mr. McCain responded somewhat flippantly that it was $5 million. McCain aides said later that the senator was joking, but his remark quickly became a campaign flashpoint. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess if you're making $3 million a year, you're middle-class,&quot; Mr. Obama sniped, prompting a McCain aide to fire back: &quot;It's not the job of the government to define who is rich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where to draw the line among the nation's wealthiest taxpayers is the central difference between rival tax blueprints that offer starkly differing formulas for reviving a faltering economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, new ads from both camps played on the public's rising anxiety about taxes, incomes and the volatile economy. &quot;Three Times,&quot; an Obama television ad airing from Virginia to Colorado, savages Mr. McCain for lavishing $200 billion tax &quot;giveaways&quot; on &quot;big corporations.&quot; Mr. McCain responded with &quot;Millions,&quot; a radio ad that predicts Mr. Obama will &quot;raise taxes on your income, your electric bills, even your life savings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two camps immediately issued rebuttals, each claiming its position on taxes was being distorted by the opposition. The Obama campaign contended that the overwhelming majority of Americans would not see a tax increase under his plan, only the wealthiest 5 percent or so. The McCain side retorted that the &quot;$4 billion&quot; in tax breaks for oil companies mentioned in Mr. Obama's&nbsp;ad was misleading because Mr. McCain is proposing an across-the-board tax cut for all corporations and is not favoring the oil industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A close look at their proposals shows that the differences fall neatly along the traditional policy gulf that has long divided Republicans and Democrats: liberating the wealthy with tax cuts to stimulate the nation's prosperity versus raising their rates to redistribute the tax burden and pay for crucial government programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The real fault lines are over how to treat people in the highest tax brackets. It gets to the heart of their economic philosophies,&quot; said Leonard E. Burman, a senior fellow with the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan Washington-based tax reform group that has questioned the details of both tax plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates have promised to balance their tax relief programs with budget cuts designed to trim soaring deficits. But the Tax Policy Center has warned that both plans -- coupled with the candidates' high-cost healthcare proposals -- would balloon the $9.6 trillion national debt. The center's analysis reported that Mr. McCain's tax proposals would add $5 trillion to the debt over the next 10 years, while Mr. Obama's would add $3.6 trillion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both tax plans take for granted a big peace dividend from ending the war in Iraq,&quot; Burman said. &quot;That's a big assumption.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's plan would cater to wealthy taxpayers and corporations by extending and expanding the Bush tax cuts, slashing corporate taxes and weakening the estate tax, but it would also aid taxpayers across the board by making the full Bush cuts permanent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A deficit hawk and formerly a critic of the massive tax cuts launched in 2001 by the Bush administration, Mr. McCain now embraces the tax policies of supply-side economists who contend that lifting the tax yoke on the rich would encourage investment and stimulate the economy. &quot;Wealth creates wealth,&quot; Mr. McCain said during a primary debate in Michigan last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under his proposals, Mr. McCain would make all the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts permanent. That would keep the two highest tax brackets at their current rates of 33 percent and 35 percent -- rather than reverting to 36 percent and 39.6 percent, where they were during the Clinton administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've been law for eight years now, and taxpayers are used to those rates,&quot; said J.D. Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington. &quot;Allowing them to expire would be tantamount to a massive tax increase.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain also has proposed a sharp reduction in corporate taxes. He would pare the highest two corporate tax brackets, 35 percent and 34 percent, down to 25 percent. The top bracket would be immediately eliminated and the 34 percent bracket would be phased down to 24 percent between 2009 and 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would also maintain the 15 percent tax rates on dividends and capital gains for the highest-tier taxpayers. And starting in 2010, Mr. McCain would substantially reduce the estate tax. He would increase the exemption on inherited funds from $3.5 million to $5 million and sharply lower taxes on remaining wealth from 45 percent to 15%, moves that would enable affluent families to hold on to more of their wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic-leaning economists say Mr. McCain's plans offer little new aid to squeezed middle-class families. And they question whether corporations and wealthy taxpayers would convert McCain-era tax savings into new investments that would bolster the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's tax plan is aimed at strengthening benefits for lower-rung taxpayers and raising rates at the top. His plan would restore the Clinton-era rates for the highest two tax brackets to 36 percent and 39.6 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Springfield, Mo. last month, Mr. Obama pledged that if &quot;you're a family making less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes go up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama would exempt seniors making less than $50,000 from paying any income tax. And he would make the Bush cuts permanent for poor and middle-class Americans, adding tax breaks like a refundable credit for wage earners and a higher education credit for students who agree to work 100 hours of community service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Mr. Obama's plan, the highest corporate tax tier would hold at 35 percent -- a nod to Wall Street, but higher than Mr. McCain's slashed rate. But Mr. Obama would raise the highest rates on dividends and capital gains from 15 percent to 20 percent. And he would keep the estate tax in the same form approved by Congress for 2009, with an exemption for the first $3.5 million and a top tax rate of 45%. That would mean a higher rate on the wealthy than Mr. McCain would allow.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They stood as opponents on the stage at the Des Moines Register debate last December. Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. defended himself against a tough question on whether some of his off-the-cuff statements, including one about Sen. Barack Obama, suggested insensitivity on issues of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His rival stepped in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have absolutely no doubt about what is in his heart and the commitment that he has made to racial equality in this country,&quot; Mr. Obama volunteered. &quot;So I will provide some testimony, as they say in church.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the eve of the convention where he will accept his historic nomination, Mr. Obama yesterday provided more profound testimony to his appreciation of the Delaware senator as he united their political destinies by choosing his older, more experienced colleague as his runningmate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden is that rare mix -- for decades, he has brought change to Washington, but Washington hasn't changed him,&quot; Mr. Obama said as he introduced his new runningmate from the steps of the old state Capitol in Springfield, Ill. &quot;He's an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has stared down dictators and spoken out for America's cops and firefighters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like his trip to the Middle East and Europe earlier this summer, the selection of the foreign policy veteran suggests an effort to shore up a gap in Mr. Obama's own foreign policy credentials. The gamble is that he will reassure some voters about the Democratic ticket rather than reminding them that Mr. Obama is a very junior member of the Foreign Relations Committee panel that Mr. Biden chairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two candidates made repeated references to Mr. Biden's Catholic, working-class roots in Scranton, demonstrating their hopes that he will be the ticket's ambassador to working-class voters. Mr. Obama lost overwhelmingly to Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in Scranton in the April Pennsylvania primary and was weak everywhere among the white, working class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within moments of jogging to Mr. Obama's side on the Springfield stage, to the strains of Bruce Springsteen's, &quot;The Rising,&quot; Mr. Biden jumped right into vice presidential candidate's traditional role as aggressor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While describing Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, as his friend, he repeatedly tied him to the Bush administration. Trying to reinforce the story Democrats had pushed all week, he said that although many Americans sit at their kitchen tables worrying over their finances, Mr. McCain would have to first figure out which of his seven kitchen tables to sit at.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't have to have four more years of George Bush and John McCain,&quot; Mr. Biden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, Mr. McCain told Katie Couric on CBS News that he believes Mr. Obama picked a good man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe and I have been friends for many, many years, and we know each other very well, and so I think he's made a very wise selection. I know that Joe will campaign well for Sen. Obama, and so I think he's going to be very formidable. Obviously, Joe and I have been on different philosophical sides, but we have been -- I consider him a good friend and good man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's campaigners tried to portray the pick as one that diminished Mr. Obama. Seizing on a slip in which, before immediately correcting himself, Mr. Obama referred to Mr. Biden as &quot;the next president,&quot; a McCain spokesman said in a statement, &quot;Barack Obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor.... The reality is that nothing has changed since Joe Biden first made his assessment that Barack Obama is not ready to lead,&quot; said Ben Porritt, the McCain spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He referred to Mr. Biden's observation, made when he was still running against his new partner, that Mr. Obama lacked the experience to be president. Videotape of the remark was fodder for a television commercial the Republican camp had prepared within hours of the middle-of-the-night text message that announced the ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Pennsylvania's third senator'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats appeared almost uniformly positive about the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton said, &quot;Sen. Obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong, experienced leader and devoted public servant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">T.J. Rooney, the state Democratic chairman who had been a Clinton supporter during the Pennsylvania primary, said it was the best choice the nominee could have made -- with the exception of Mrs. Clinton herself. His ally, Gov. Ed Rendell, had argued even before the decision was revealed that the senator from neighboring Delaware would be Mr. Obama's best bet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Pennsylvanians noted that Mr. Biden has often described himself as &quot;Pennsylvania's third senator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates hope that their joint venture will be more successful than either of Mr. Biden's previous attempts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1988, his first presidential bid foundered when a rival campaign leaked a videotape that showed that passages of a stump speech delivered at the Iowa State Fair had been lifted nearly intact from a speech by British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock. Mr. Biden had used the passage on other occasions but had attributed it. He ended up dropping out before the first vote was cast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, he was stopped in the snows of Iowa, failing to break through to the top tier of candidates during the caucuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Biden joked about his long tenure yesterday -- he was first elected in 1972 at the age of 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While noting that only four senators had more seniority, he turned and said, &quot;But Barack, I want you to know there's 44 older than me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's unusual path</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In choosing Springfield for introducing Mr. Biden, Mr. Obama was returning yesterday to the spot where he launched his then improbable presidential bid on a cold day in February 2007. Babies that weren't yet born then, Mr. Obama has often joked, are now walking and talking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During that time, his campaign has also matured amid occasional stumbles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Springfield appearance was the official beginning of the campaign, but Mr. Obama's emergence as a plausible presidential candidate came with his heralded keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in Boston four years ago. The Illinois senator will figuratively echo that performance Thursday with his acceptance speech in INVESCO Field, continuing the extended process of introducing himself to American voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The site is symbolic of the theme of change that the campaign has sought to make its brand. The audience will include most of the Democratic Party hierarchy that will have gathered over the previous three days in the Pepsi Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bulk of the crowd filling the Denver Broncos' home will comprise voters who didn't qualify for credentials for the traditional party gathering. The contrast is emblematic of the way the Obama forces have built a campaign aligned with but not dependent on traditional party structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania is an example. The Obama campaign has made its peace with the majority of state party leaders that opposed them in the spring, but its grass-roots registration and organizing efforts represent a separate if overlapping organization from the pre-existing Democratic Party structure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The path that led Mr. Obama back to Springfield and on to INVESCO Field was unprecedented. He began as an intriguing long shot, seemingly a remote threat to Mrs. Clinton, the acknowledged front-runner. But his campaign's meticulous organization and command of new media and new voters brought him to a stunning upset in the Iowa caucuses that shattered all turnout records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not all of the changes since he last spoke in Springfield were as welcome. In the run-up to the Iowa showdown, where Mr. Biden was a distant also-ran, one common element among Democratic voters was that Democrats were happy with their field of candidates, and optimistic of their chances no matter which one emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That amity wore thin as Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton battered one another through the later primaries. And the party's wide optimism that emerged from their gains in the 2006 congressional elections was tested through the summer by Mr. Obama's failure to put any real polling distance between himself and Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that nervous climate, Mr. McCain's halting accounting of his real estate holdings emerged as manna from political heaven this week, a self-inflicted rebuttal to his own campaign's effort to portray Mr. Obama as the candidate out of touch with the mores of the working class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of this week, it may be difficult to disentangle the effects of the housing exchanges, the vice presidential choice and Mr. Obama's renewed oratory on whatever polling shifts may emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anticipating the possibility of a Biden choice, a Washington Post-ABC News poll completed just before the announcement found that three-quarters of voters said picking Mr. Biden would not affect their vote. Roughly 13 percent said it would make them more likely to vote Democratic and a nearly equal proportion, 10 percent said it would make them less likely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Jason Altmire, D-Bradford Woods, represents a southwestern Pennsylvania district that proved a tough target for Mr. Obama in the April primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He predicted the Biden choice would be popular with his constituents, but cautioned that voters are swayed by the top of the ticket not the No. 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a good choice for southwestern Pennsylvania, but Sen. Obama still has some work to do,&quot; he said of his district's reaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That work will continue over the next four days as the Democrats officially make him the first African-American nominee in history.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Barack Obama will fight for the presidency beside one of the Senate's happy warriors.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing before the Old State Capitol here in Abraham Lincoln's hometown, Obama announced Saturday the selection of Senate colleague Joe Biden as his running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket. Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, brings more than 30 years of domestic and foreign policy experience to a campaign that had been criticized as lacking both. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the campaign trail, he's described as a pit bull with sharp teeth and loose lips. Biden's aggressive criticisms of his opponents could balance Obama's more staid approach to political combat, although Biden's occasional impertinent statements might cause headaches for Obama's tightly organized campaign.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden wasted no time showing both sides yesterday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the least wealthy members of the Senate, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, Biden excoriated Republican presidential hopeful John McCain for saying he didn't know how many houses he owned. Biden said he, like many others, has sat around his kitchen table trying to figure out how to make ends meet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's not a worry John McCain has to worry about,&quot; Biden said. &quot;He'll have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes later, he seemed to stray off his prepared speech when he described his wife, Jill, as &quot;drop-dead gorgeous,&quot; then said she &quot;also has her doctoral degree, which is a problem.&quot; He quickly added he was kidding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experience, foreign policy -- those are all pluses,&quot; said Jack Treadway, chairman of the political science department at Kutztown University near Reading. But, Treadway said, &quot;The guy's a gaffe machine.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verbal slips won't outweigh the authority Biden brings to the Democrats' ticket, said Allegheny County Treasurer John Weinstein, who has known Biden for 15 years. Biden once headlined a campaign fundraiser for Weinstein. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think, at the end of the day, when you look at what's facing this country -- the economy, the war -- it's more important than any off-the-cuff comment Senator Biden may make,&quot; Weinstein said. &quot;You're looking at someone who doesn't need any on-the-job training and can fill any type of void when talking about foreign policy. ... Joe Biden has respect worldwide.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans attacked the choice as verification that Obama doesn't have a background deep enough to run the country, a key charge of McCain's campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is really an admission that, really, Obama doesn't think he has enough experience to serve as president,&quot; said Rob Gleason, chairman of the Pennsylvania Republican Party.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours after Obama's announcement -- which came about 3 a.m. through text messages to supporters -- Republicans circulated an ad featuring comments last year by Biden, who was seeking the presidential nomination for the second time, that Obama is too inexperienced for the office.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters in Pennsylvania do not agree with Joe Biden on every issue, but they do agree with him on the fact that Barack Obama is not ready to be president,&quot; said Paul Lindsay, McCain's spokesman.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, they weren't as quick to attack Biden. Although he is considered one of the Senate's more liberal members, some of the country's most prominent Republicans have a decades-long relationship with him. McCain called Biden yesterday to congratulate him, according to The Associated Press, and Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter praised Biden. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think if it were a race between Senator McCain and Senator Biden, it would be a very different race,&quot; Specter said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden, 65, is a Catholic with working-class roots who could help attract blue-collar voters, like the ones that gave Sen. Hillary Clinton a 9-point victory over Obama in the Pennsylvania primary in April. Rather than getting a residence in Washington, Biden commutes there on an Amtrak train in the morning and returns home at night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden is what so many others pretend to be -- a statesman who doesn't have to hide behind bluster,&quot; Obama said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's also a tenacious campaigner, said former Democratic National Committee executive director Mark Siegel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When he sinks his teeth into your neck, he doesn't let go until you go limp,&quot; Siegel said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands braved the sweltering heat to attend the Springfield event, which took place at the location where Obama announced his candidacy for president 19 months ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This ticket brings real hope that things will change in Washington,&quot; said John Holmes, a retired policeman from Chicago who attended the event at Illinois' Old State Capitol with his wife. &quot;Maybe now people will begin to appreciate what Biden has been trying to do.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holmes said Biden was a &quot;very pragmatic&quot; choice and that selecting him as a running mate was a &quot;very mature judgment move&quot; for Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amber Traugott, a surgery resident from St. Louis, agreed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Obama needed to choose someone with strong foreign policy credentials who's not afraid to speak his mind. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he'll win it,&quot; Traugott said of Obama's chances in November. &quot;It'll be a really interesting race to watch.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josh Brinkley, a college student from Decatur, said he hoped Obama would choose Clinton as his running mate to bring some of her supporters on board with Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary supporters are a little uneasy, but I think they will come around,&quot; Brinkley said. &quot;I think it's going to be an easy contest.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUPPY MILLS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owners of dogs know what most dogs give them: unconditional love and trust (almost a mirror image of God's love for us).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman brothers in neighboring Berks County betrayed that love and trust by shooting 80 helpless dogs. It is bad enough they operated a puppy mill, but to take advantage of an obscure, outdated law that allows owners to destroy their animals is worse. They killed man's best friends in cold blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some puppy mill owners claim they are trying to save the family farm or make some other excuse for their actions. They can save the family farm, but they do not need to be cruel, abusive or neglectful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lives of innocent, trusting animals should not be forgotten. Call or write your state senator or House representative immediately. The archaic law allowing owners to destroy their own dogs and cats needs to be abolished. The laws presently are not tough enough to properly punish savages like the Zimmermans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Hornock, Elizabethtown</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a lifelong resident of Lancaster County, I have always been proud of my heritage - until now. I am ashamed to live in a state and county known as &quot;The Puppy Mill Capital of the East.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent slaughter of 80 dogs in Berks County is just one example of the horror experienced by innocent dogs in puppy mills. Mass breeding, cruelty and neglect are common in puppy mills, and hundreds of such kennels are in Lancaster County. These abuses will continue until the health and welfare of dogs are seen as more important than profits. Every person who allows these atrocities to continue devalues what it means to be a compassionate, caring human being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can help by contacting your legislators (www.legis.state.pa.us) and urging them to pass House Bill 2525, which would make it illegal for anyone but a veterinarian to euthanize dogs in commercial breeding kennels and improve the conditions for thousands of dogs suffering behind the closed doors of Pennsylvania's infamous puppy mills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sylvia Evans, Lancaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I sympathize with those standing vigil for the slaughtered kennel dogs. I extend this compassion to all creatures that collectively inhabit and support life on earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;green&quot; movement may promise better things, but people and animals have long suffered the effects of our exorbitant lifestyle. Many lives have been lost so that we could be the powerful consumers we are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us remember the atrocities committed to protect our national interest - in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, in Cambodia, Chile, El Salvador and Guatemala. Yet we continue to tolerate half-thought-out, illegal regime changes (Iraq) and support for sleazy governments in which our political and business leaders have friends (Saudi Arabia).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other developed nations can learn from our dead dogs, too. In one town in Chile, a huge trading partner of the U.S. whose grapes flood our supermarkets, stray dogs are rounded up once a year and disposed of quietly. Witnessing this, I thought, should we invade?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert McLane IV, Millersville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Pennsylvania to put up with the horror of puppy mills for so many years is a sad statement about our state government, lawmakers, and those who elected them. Is this how we teach our youth the value of life ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case is so disturbing I have lost sleep, wondering how exactly do you shoot 80 dogs? How many shots did it take to kill each of them ? I am sure the breeders' association is going to have to put some serious spin on this story. I hope their lobbyist is up to the task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What now for the Zimmermans?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps a nice roadside stand selling produce, using their discarded product as fertilizer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please contact your state representatives and urge them to pass House Bill 2525, which seeks to improve life for dogs living in the state's commercial breeding kennels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the Amish farmers whom tourists find so quaint and charming , it is customary for them to treat their animals like this - not as fellow beings but as commodities to be disposed of like garbage when they no longer have commercial value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sherry Wolfe, Lebanon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Animal rights are OK, but when you try to anthropomorphize pets that takes it too far. While many people cite the horrors of dog fighting, people don't seem to realize that human politics can be very similar, and more important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians around the world do kill each other and torture other countries' peoples- and, ironically, may be invested in by both sides of a conflict. Our country is gambling all right, but not on dogs. The stakes are trillions of dollars this time, and instead of sending those kids to college on a fraction of that money, we sent them to die in ... you finish the sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are far too many places in the world where human beings are being treated as animals. God gave human beings an ability to reason far above any animal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do not let your love of animals become your ignorance of humans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEX OFFENDERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in reference to the letter to the editor from Fay Hess Aug. 10, &quot;Let Them Alone!&quot; Fay, I think the letter is a disgrace to your womanhood in praising Tom Armstrong and suggesting help for these sex offenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These kinds of men are pariahs, not fit to live in our communities or society as a whole. If our courts and laws see fit to keep releasing them, our communities need to pull together and and try to get unfair laws changed. The alternative is to sit these pariahs in the middle of the desert, surrounded by high electric fencing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fay, I shiver to even think that one of your children or grandchildren would ever encounter one of these monsters who you seem to think can be redeemed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our town is far from perfect, but on the subject of what matters the most, the safety of our innocent children, our town is - praise be to God - right on target.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEACHER HEALTH CARE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lengthy article scrutinizing health care costs within school districts in Lancaster County [Aug. 17] was enlightening to be sure and, as districts are taxpayer-funded, perhaps relevant during such economic times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But remarks such as those made by Susan Friedman, attorney for several districts, questioning the fairness of providing health care coverage for family members of teachers, are themselves quite unfair and somewhat inflammatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Friedman would have us pit one teacher against the next, predicated on who is married, has children or perhaps has a child in need of special care. What a selfish system that would be, and an insult to one of the core foundations of our society, the American family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, the true solution to this issue, all the other misery caused by the myriad health care systems this country has, and all the poor souls who go to bed each night worrying whether their illness will be cared for is a simple, complete, national health plan. One group that for the most part opposes such a plan is lawyers, who make a fine living keeping things confused and in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Franchot Egry, Ephrata</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a retired teacher from New Jersey, I take serious issue with the statistics quoted in the Aug. 17 article &quot;Teachers assigned more health care costs.&quot; By comparing average teacher salaries with average salaries of local workers, the public is again fooled into &quot;teacher-bashing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having applied to substitute-teach in Lancaster, I have undergone intense scrutiny of excellent credentials and teaching history. It brings to mind the quality of life one must lead to teach. How then can one compare the salaries paid to those who have lived lifestyles that hold up to such scrutiny to the overall working population, including the many who flip flapjacks, dig ditches and so forth?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who deal with our youth must have made frequent lifestyle choices and personal restrictions to qualify. How about comparing teacher wages and benefits with other professional careers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teachers have the right to seek the best wage and benefit packages for themselves, just as local taxpayers expect only the highest caliber of individual to be working with their youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unfair to expect public employees to sacrifice clean lifestyles and records just because it is decided to compare them with &quot;average&quot; workers!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joan Galloway, Lancaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SMALL GAMES OF CHANCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once a year, the Department of Pennsylvania American Legion holds &quot;Legion college.&quot; State police and members of the Liquor Control Board conduct separate classes that day, and many questions are asked on small games of chance. Guess what never gets the same answer from both organizations? Seems to me it is about time for them to get together and get rules printed so all are on the same level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think the public realizes what the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars help to sponsor with the money generated from small games of chance. They help youth baseball teams, scout troops, school programs, fire companies, ambulance organizations, police departments and many more. With this crackdown on only paying out $5,000 in a seven-day period, organizations have to cut back on the amount they can contribute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wise up, Sen. Armstrong. You and others in Harrisburg have cut the budget for the above-mentioned groups, so bring the small games bill out for a vote so the American Legion and the VFW can increase their donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earl B. Rettew, Landisville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OTHER SUBJECTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the last public meeting of the Lancaster County Office of Aging, it was announced that more than 300 people are on the waiting list for services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it because there are not enough people to provide these services? No, it is because the funding has been exhausted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these are very simple issues, such as getting a meal or someone to help you with a bath, or maybe help pay for a Lifeline alert. These people are striving to maintain their independence and just need a little help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cannot always look for funding to be provided by federal and state programs. We must start to look locally. Local government, businesses and individuals can help by sending a check to the Lancaster County Office of Aging. I am sending my check today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David A. Boas, Lancaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in regards to the bike race through Farmersville Aug. 17. I guess it really is a race, seeing as how they did not yield to stop signs and passed buggies and cars that had to slow down due to bikers taking up the entire lane. Also, there was no respect for vehicles sitting at stop signs waiting for a chance to pull out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think I am safe in saying most of these bikers also drive cars. If you were treated this way, wouldn't that make you cross?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all have places to go. So let's use the utmost respect for our fellow citizens on the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Beth Zimmerman, Ephrata</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Were you paying attention to the &quot;debate&quot; between Barack Obama and John McCain [Aug. 16]? In case you weren't listening, let me repeat:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: &quot;At what point is a baby entitled to human rights?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: &quot;At the moment of conception. I have a 25-year pro-life record in the Congress, in the Senate. And as president of the United States, I will be a pro-life president, and this presidency will have pro-life policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's my commitment to you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No equivocation. No hesitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allow me to translate:If you have an abortion, my presidency will be committed to seeking to charge you with murder of another human being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one likes abortion. No one I know is in favor of abortion as a policy. But what John McCain is saying, what the Republican position presents, is that at the moment of conception, no matter what the circumstances, you surrender all your rights to make a decision for yourself about your body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that there has been some misconception going around that John McCain respects the value of every human being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember that in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeffrey Thal, Lancaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did you hear the joke about the nine Republicans and two Democrats who spent 18 months studying their county government and determined that its 200-plus-year-old form of government is outdated and needs upgrading?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The joke is that both parties appear to support their own political agenda rather than guiding Lancaster Countians to a more representative, responsive government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be a joke, but it ain't funny! When will both parties realize that this charter is good for the people and support the results? Why would they selfishly maintain their good ol' boy politics to the detriment of the public?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is nothing funny about ineffective government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUPPY MILLS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owners of dogs know what most dogs give them: unconditional love and trust (almost a mirror image of God's love for us).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman brothers in neighboring Berks County betrayed that love and trust by shooting 80 helpless dogs. It is bad enough they operated a puppy mill, but to take advantage of an obscure, outdated law that allows owners to destroy their animals is worse. They killed man's best friends in cold blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some puppy mill owners claim they are trying to save the family farm or make some other excuse for their actions. They can save the family farm, but they do not need to be cruel, abusive or neglectful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lives of innocent, trusting animals should not be forgotten. Call or write your state senator or House representative immediately. The archaic law allowing owners to destroy their own dogs and cats needs to be abolished. The laws presently are not tough enough to properly punish savages like the Zimmermans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Hornock, Elizabethtown</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a lifelong resident of Lancaster County, I have always been proud of my heritage - until now. I am ashamed to live in a state and county known as &quot;The Puppy Mill Capital of the East.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent slaughter of 80 dogs in Berks County is just one example of the horror experienced by innocent dogs in puppy mills. Mass breeding, cruelty and neglect are common in puppy mills, and hundreds of such kennels are in Lancaster County. These abuses will continue until the health and welfare of dogs are seen as more important than profits. Every person who allows these atrocities to continue devalues what it means to be a compassionate, caring human being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can help by contacting your legislators (www.legis.state.pa.us) and urging them to pass House Bill 2525, which would make it illegal for anyone but a veterinarian to euthanize dogs in commercial breeding kennels and improve the conditions for thousands of dogs suffering behind the closed doors of Pennsylvania's infamous puppy mills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sylvia Evans, Lancaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I sympathize with those standing vigil for the slaughtered kennel dogs. I extend this compassion to all creatures that collectively inhabit and support life on earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;green&quot; movement may promise better things, but people and animals have long suffered the effects of our exorbitant lifestyle. Many lives have been lost so that we could be the powerful consumers we are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us remember the atrocities committed to protect our national interest - in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, in Cambodia, Chile, El Salvador and Guatemala. Yet we continue to tolerate half-thought-out, illegal regime changes (Iraq) and support for sleazy governments in which our political and business leaders have friends (Saudi Arabia).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other developed nations can learn from our dead dogs, too. In one town in Chile, a huge trading partner of the U.S. whose grapes flood our supermarkets, stray dogs are rounded up once a year and disposed of quietly. Witnessing this, I thought, should we invade?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert McLane IV, Millersville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Pennsylvania to put up with the horror of puppy mills for so many years is a sad statement about our state government, lawmakers, and those who elected them. Is this how we teach our youth the value of life ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case is so disturbing I have lost sleep, wondering how exactly do you shoot 80 dogs? How many shots did it take to kill each of them ? I am sure the breeders' association is going to have to put some serious spin on this story. I hope their lobbyist is up to the task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What now for the Zimmermans?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps a nice roadside stand selling produce, using their discarded product as fertilizer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please contact your state representatives and urge them to pass House Bill 2525, which seeks to improve life for dogs living in the state's commercial breeding kennels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the Amish farmers whom tourists find so quaint and charming , it is customary for them to treat their animals like this - not as fellow beings but as commodities to be disposed of like garbage when they no longer have commercial value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sherry Wolfe, Lebanon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Animal rights are OK, but when you try to anthropomorphize pets that takes it too far. While many people cite the horrors of dog fighting, people don't seem to realize that human politics can be very similar, and more important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians around the world do kill each other and torture other countries' peoples- and, ironically, may be invested in by both sides of a conflict. Our country is gambling all right, but not on dogs. The stakes are trillions of dollars this time, and instead of sending those kids to college on a fraction of that money, we sent them to die in ... you finish the sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are far too many places in the world where human beings are being treated as animals. God gave human beings an ability to reason far above any animal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in 2000, you might recall, John McCain was running for president against the guy who would eventually become the nation's court-appointed president, and he was the victim of some of the sleaziest politics the world has ever seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign of our then soon-to-be-court-appointed president implied that McCain had fathered a black child out of wedlock. It ran what are called push polls, polls which pollsters use to spread rumors. In McCain's case, pollsters were calling Republican voters and asking them, something like, &quot;Would your opinion of John McCain be favorable or unfavorable if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, there was absolutely no truth to it. But McCain had been accompanied on some campaign stops by his wife and their adopted child from Bangladesh, who has dark skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the brilliant handiwork of our court-appointed president's right-hand man and evil poisoned toad, Karl Rove, who knew that white Republicans in South Carolina didn't cotton to miscegenation and were easily duped into, well, just about anything. Rove has made a career, and millions, by never underestimating the stupidity of the American electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was reprehensible and accompanied other attacks that implied that McCain was mentally unstable, that his wife was a drug addict, that he was gay, that he had been brainwashed by his Vietnamese captors and was some sort of Manchurian Candidate sent here by the Commies to bring down the United States from within.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain lost the nomination, starting in South Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So as he embarked on his current trivial pursuit of the presidency, with that history, McCain pledged to run an above-board campaign, one that gives voters a reason to elect him, not one aimed at scaring the bejesus out of gullible voters with misinformation, innuendoes and lies about his opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have pledged to conduct a respectful campaign,&quot; he said. &quot;And I have urged, time after time, various entities within the Republican Party to also do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He uttered those words on April 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April Fools!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it should come as no surprise that the McCain campaign has sunk to its current level, essentially accusing Democrat Barack Obama of treason, among other specious charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's ads airing here now are full of misrepresentations, innuendoes and flat-out lies. Factcheck.org, a nonpartisan group that monitors the factual accuracy in political ads, lists numerous occasions where McCain ads have lied about Obama's record and proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's ads consistently have contained lies about Obama's tax proposals, including the claim that Obama will raise taxes on the middle class, which is true if you define the middle class as families with annual income above $250,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another ad claimed that Obama declined to meet with wounded troops unless TV cameras could go along. Actually, the visit in question was canceled by the military, and Obama never made the demand that TV cameras had to accompany him. That ad also claimed Obama had time to go to the gym but not to meet with our troops. The ad also featured a shot of Obama playing basketball -- with our troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are loads of other examples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the worst accusation wasn't made in an ad. It came from McCain and his lap-dog, former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman. McCain has said repeatedly that Obama would rather win the campaign and lose the war than lose the campaign and win the war -- essentially accusing Obama of treason. The other day, at the Toyota Center, Lieberman said the choice in this election is &quot;between one candidate, John McCain, who's always put the country first, worked across party lines to get things done, and one candidate who has not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, McCain might not think he's conducting a negative campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, after the ad comparing Obama to Paris Hilton and Britney Spears aired, after the ad accusing Obama of being un-American aired, after he had repeatedly questioned Obama's patriotism, McCain said, &quot;This is a very respectful campaign. I've repeated my admiration and respect for Sen. Obama. I don't think our campaign is negative in the slightest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Really?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I guess he's expressed his admiration and respect by hinting that Obama's in league with terrorists and enemies of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then again, McCain might not know what's going on. A couple of weeks ago, McCain appeared on &quot;Meet The Press&quot; and said that increasing taxes to save Social Security wasn't out of the question. Previously, he had pledged that he wouldn't raise any taxes, no matter what.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That reversal prompted a McCain campaign official to tell reporters that McCain doesn't speak for the McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, someone spoke the truth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arizona Sen. John McCain's inability to recall the number of homes he owns during an interview yesterday jeopardized his campaign's carefully constructed strategy to frame his Democratic presidential rival, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, as an out-of-touch elitist and inspired a round of attacks that once again ratcheted up the negative tone of the race for the White House. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week dominated by vice-presidential speculation and the run-up to the Democratic National Convention was quickly overtaken by the McCain miscue. In an interview with Politico.com, the presumptive Republican nominee was asked how many houses he and his wife, Cindy, heir to a beer distributorship, owned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think -- I'll have my staff get to you,&quot; he replied. &quot;It's condominiums where -- I'll have them get to you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign and the Democratic National Committee pounced with remarkable speed. By mid-morning, reporters had received a video log featuring Cindy McCain's childhood estate in Phoenix, an Architectural Digest spread on a property the McCains had owned previously and tax records and photos detailing seven houses and condominiums, in Coronado and La Jolla, Calif.; Phoenix and Sedona, Ariz.; and Arlington, Va.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 11 a.m., the Obama campaign had produced a television ad, titled &quot;Seven,&quot; answering the question Mr. McCain could not. &quot;It's seven, seven houses, and here's one house Americans can't afford John McCain to move into,&quot; the ad concludes over an image of the White House. (If a California beachfront condo that Cindy McCain purchased for their children this year is included, the number of homes owned by the McCains rises to eight.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That provoked a furious response by McCain campaign and Republican National Committee aides, who charged hypocrisy and argued that the Illinois senator had received help purchasing his South Side Chicago mansion from businessman Tony Rezko, a convicted felon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does a guy who made more than $4 million last year, just got back from vacation on a private beach in Hawaii and bought his own million-dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses?&quot; McCain spokesman Brian Rogers asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator also quickly assembled a response ad, in which a narrator intones, &quot;Barack Obama knows a lot about housing problems.&quot; The spot raises Mr. Obama's relationship with Mr. Rezko, saying &quot;one of Obama's biggest fundraisers helped him buy his million-dollar mansion,&quot; and charges that, in return, &quot;Rezko got political favors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By day's end, the Democratic National Committee was threatening to escalate the fight further, by highlighting Mr. McCain's connections to the &quot;Keating Five&quot; savings-and-loan scandal, in which the senator ended up before the Senate ethics committee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the dead of night in a small hideaway office in the deserted Capitol, a clandestine meeting takes place between two senators with one goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They grin at each other as they lift their celebratory shots of brutally cold Stolichnaya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's to The One,&quot; they toast in unison. &quot;He's toast!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama should have picked you, Hillary,&quot; John McCain tells her. &quot;It isn't fair, my friend. But it just makes it easier for me to whup him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't worry, John, I've put it behind me,&quot; Hillary replies. &quot;I'm looking toward the future now, a future that looks very bright, once we send Twig Legs back to the back bench.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They chortle with delight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's a bright young man, but he got ahead of himself,&quot; McCain says. &quot;He needs to be taught a lesson, and we're the ones to do it. Have you seen the new polls? Obama's dropped and we're even again. The Bullet's getting all the credit, but you and I know, Hillary, that it's these top-secret counseling sessions we're having. And thanks again for BlackBerrying me the Rick Warren questions while I was in the so-called cone of silence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, John, you know I love you and I'm happy to help,&quot; Hillary says. &quot;The themes you took from me are working great -- painting Obama as an elitist and out-of-touch celebrity, when we're rich celebrities, too. Turning his big rallies and pretty words into character flaws, charging him with playing the race card -- that one always cracks me up. And accusing the media, especially NBC, of playing favorites. It's so easy to get the press to navel-gaze; they're so insecure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're all pinko Commies,&quot; McCain laughs. &quot;Especially since they deserted me for The Messiah. Seriously, Hill, that Paris Hilton-Britney Spears ad you came up with was brilliant. I owe you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking pleased, Hillary expertly downs another shot. &quot;His secret fear is being seen as a dumb blonde,&quot; she says. &quot;He wants to take a shortcut to the top and pose on glossy magazine covers, but he doesn't want to be seen as a glib pretty boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain lifts his glass to her admiringly. &quot;If I do say so myself, while the rookie was surfing in Hawaii, I ate his pupus for lunch. Pictures of him pushing around a golf ball while I'm pushing around Putin. Priceless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a little secret to tell you about that, John. Bill made it happen. He loves you so much. He called Putin and told him that if he invaded Georgia, he could count on being invited to the Clinton Global Initiative every year for the rest of his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow. Should I call him? I saw your husband's kind words about me in Las Vegas on Monday, saying I'd be just as good as Obama on climate change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he'd like that,&quot; Hillary smiles. &quot;He's still boiling at Obama. And you don't have to worry about my army of angry women. We've spread the word in the feminist underground -- as opposed to that wacky Obama Weather Underground -- that 'catharsis' is code for 'No surrender.' My gals know when I say 'We may have started on two separate paths but we're on one journey now' that Skinny's journey is to the nearest exit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Obama's says he's finally ready to hit back,&quot; McCain says, frowning. &quot;He's starting a blistering TV campaign and attacking me for attacking his patriotism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, John, you know that every time he tries to get tough, he quickly runs out of gas. Sometimes in debates, he'd be exhausted by the third question. He must use up all his energy in the gym. He doesn't have any stamina, and he certainly doesn't have our bloodlust. Besides, you can throw that Mark Penn stuff at him that I couldn't use in a Democratic primary about how he's not fundamentally American in his thinking and values. While he's up on his high-minded pedestal, you'll scoot past him in your Ferragamos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can I ever thank you, my friend?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can announce that you won't be running for re-election because you'd be 76, and you can pick somebody really lame to run with, like your pal Lieberman. That means one term for you, and two for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a deal,&quot; McCain says, sticking out his hand to shake on it. &quot;That was inspired to snatch his convention away -- makes him look so weak. Listen, why don't you stop in Sedona on the way to Denver? Wear a black wig and I'll spirit you up to the cabin for the night. I'll catch a catfish in the mill pond and grill it for you. It will be an adventure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a knock on the door. Jesse Jackson sticks his head into the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is it over?&quot; he asks his co-conspirators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, he's over,&quot; they respond in unison.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic nominee-presumptive Barack Obama last week misrepresented his working relationship with his Republican counterpart, John McCain, on ethics legislation in the U.S. Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illinois Sen. Obama's claim Saturday at the nationally televised Saddleback Civil Forum on the Presidency, at the Rev. Rick Warren's megachurch in Lake Forest, Calif., was that he &quot;worked with John McCain&quot; on that issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the two worked together for barely a week, after which McCain accused Obama of &quot;partisan posturing&quot; and added, &quot;I won't make the same mistake again.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arizona Sen. McCain later voted against the ethics bill that Obama supported, stating that it was written by Democrats with &quot;no input&quot; from Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Forum, where both candidates vied for the evangelical Christian vote, Obama wrongly claimed that abortions &quot;have not gone down&quot; under President Bush. In fact, the abortion rate has gone down 9 percent, and the annual total has declined by more than 100,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same event, McCain exaggerated the extent of his proposals to cut taxes, incorrectly claiming he would give a &quot;tax credit&quot; of $7,000 per child, which would be seven times as high as the current credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His actual proposal would gradually increase the current $3,500 exemption, which benefits high-bracket taxpayers most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama offered a twisted account of his working with a Republican and &quot;against party loyalty.&quot; His short-lived collaboration with McCain collapsed into bitter public wrangling long before any bill resulted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama approached McCain on the floor of the Senate in early 2006, amid the unfolding Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal, and suggested that they work together on an ethics bill. But their joint efforts quickly produced a remarkable public falling-out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two publicly made up later at a hearing on lobbying and ethics reform held by the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, two years later, The Washington Post said of their failed collaboration: &quot;It was the first, and only, time the two ever tried extensively working together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also at the forum, Obama, who favors a legal right to abortion, noted that he was trying to &quot;reduce the number of abortions.&quot; But he went too far when he falsely accused President Bush of failing to meet that same goal, saying incorrectly that &quot;over the last eight years, abortions have not gone down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same claim was debunked more than three years ago when it was being repeated by Democratic Party chairman Howard Dean and Sens. Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is, it is false. The best source we know of for statistics on the number of abortions is the Guttmacher Institute, whose figures are cited regularly by both sides in the abortion debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Guttmacher says prominently on its Web site: In 2005, 1.21 million abortions were performed, down from 1.31 million abortions in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Guttmacher's most recent published figures show 106,800 fewer abortions in George Bush's fifth year than in Bill Clinton's last year in office. That represents an 8 percent decline in the number of abortions and an even larger decline 9 percent in the rate of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 through 44.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, McCain made his tax plan sound way too generous to middle-income taxpayers, incorrectly describing one of his own proposals and omitting a key feature of another</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current child tax credit is $1,000, and McCain is not proposing any increase at all. What McCain actually is proposing is a gradual increase in the $3,500 exemption for each dependent child, starting in 2010 and increasing $500 each year until it reaches $7,000 in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his Web site McCain describes this as a &quot;doubling&quot; of the exemption, but even that is misleading. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, the exemption is expected to go up to $4,200 per child in that time period under current law, which calls for annual adjustments for inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said he proposed giving every family &quot;a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go out and get the health insurance of their choice.&quot; But he failed to mention what he would also take away. Under his plan, workers would be taxed on the value of any health benefits paid for by their employers, which isn't the case under current law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain didn't include that fact in an ad his campaign aired in May touting his health care plan, either. As we said at the time, the credit isn't a $5,000 windfall it's designed to cover the increased taxes families with employer-sponsored insurance would have to pay.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we all know by now, China chose pretty little Lin Miaoke to lip-synch the national anthem in place of Yang Peiyi, who actually did the singing. Chinese officials thought that Peiyi wasn't pretty enough because of her less-than-perfect teeth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This speaks volumes about China, especially when you think about how women have historically been treated so poorly there. (Foot-binding, unwanted female babies . . .) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China is a newly minted world commercial colossus that holds some of our financial future in its hands, yet is still backward in terms of human rights. But even after being exposed, Chinese officials stand by their deceptiveness, putting us avid Olympics fans in a decided moral quandary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to the lip-synching, I sought out my brother-in-law, bassist Marcus Miller (appearing locally tonight in the sold-out Thunder Tour with Stanley Clarke and Victor Wooten). He said that long before the pop duo Milli Vanilli was busted for lip-synching a decade ago, faking it on stage was common throughout the music biz. One reason, he said, is that, especially for female performers, attractiveness can be as important as talent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But truth matters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it's China's Olympic deceits, the stain of lies told by embattled Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick or John Edwards' foolish affair, I'm always miffed when liars disrespect us like this. They think they're slick enough to pull the wool over our eyes - and when they get busted, their lies just keep growing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many, I'm revolted by John Edwards' infidelity, even though on some level I think his affair is none of my business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's the political connection that set me off. What effect did it have on his behavior during his presidential quest - and how could he run knowing that at any time he could be blown out of the water if the cover were blown on his affair with Rielle Hunter?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he were anyone else but a presidential candidate, I couldn't care less about his indiscretions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I'm distressed at the thought that the mainstream press may have sat on this story because Edwards was at one time such a media darling. We thought he was a charming, handsome Southern gentleman and real family man who stood by his wife Elizabeth during her fourth-stage breast cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When her illness recurred, critics were mad at him for staying in the race. And conservative bloggers were hot in pursuit of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">National Enquirer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s &quot;scoops,&quot; knowing that the supermarket tab can be relentless when on a mission to unveil truth, especially when it's sordid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I started to realize this while I was reporting on the O.J. Simpson murder trial for a New York radio station. I faithfully digested CNN and the major newspapers as well as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Time</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Newsweek</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">New Yorker</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. And yes, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">National Enquirer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I realized then that some of the networks were pulling their lead stories right from the disdained tabloid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Edwards' devoted spouse was apparently complicit in keeping the affair a secret. Unfortunately, he won't be the last politician caught having an affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we shouldn't judge Elizabeth Edwards too harshly, at least for the part where she was forgiving her husband to keep their family intact. Particularly since she may well be near the end of her life. (The political deception is another thing.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now the question of truth has moved to the presidential arena, in the form of the swiftboating of Barack Obama by John McCain's twisted commercials (which falsely accuse him of snubbing wounded soldiers) or by Jerome Corsi's new book &quot;The Obama Nation,&quot; which the Obama camp insists is infested with lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the problems with the truth are only compounded when we realize how long it took for us to find out the scary details of the emergency landing of Obama's campaign plane in St. Louis last month during a flight from Chicago to North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHY DID the Federal Aviation Administration hold back reports of the mechanical malfunction, and why was the plane allowed to fly in bad weather in the first place? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hate deception. It insults our intelligence when people try to get over on us. As Sufi master Bawa Muhaiyaddeen put it, &quot;The truth is the only everlasting joy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's really up to each of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">us to hold those we trust accountable - and to remove our blinders. * </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- In case you're wondering which books to read this fall, Michael Moore has a suggestion: Don't read any. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not the new fiction by Toni Morrison or Philip Roth or Stephen King. Not that policy book by Sen. Barack Obama, whom Moore is supporting for president; or Bob Woodward's latest on the Bush administration; or Thomas Friedman's manifesto on the environment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not even a little paperback meant as a handbook to the political campaigns. It's called &quot;Mike's Election Guide 2008&quot; and it's written by a certain Academy Award-winning filmmaker and well known agitator named Michael Moore. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There really is no time for any frivolity. People are already working two jobs to put gas in the tank, so they can drive from the first job to the second job. People need to spend as much of their free time as possible for candidates,&quot; says Moore, who believes that electing progressives will improve the economy, and in the long run, enable people to read more.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would rather you go and work for a local candidate then read my book.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A multibillion-dollar industry has been built around such &quot;frivolity,&quot; and if Moore is looking for an argument -- as he often is -- he can begin with the team at Grand Central Publishing that's releasing &quot;Mike's Election Guide.&quot; Grand Central publisher Jamie Raab says she agrees with him &quot;on the issues, and on the importance of the election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I don't agree about reading his book. If people are going to vote wisely, they need to understand what's at stake.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booksellers, including officials at Amazon.com and Barnes &amp; Noble, say the releases look surprisingly strong for a time when the public supposedly will be too preoccupied to care. Barnes &amp; Noble fiction buyer Sessalee Hensley says the literary work is as good as any in recent years, while Amazon's senior books editor, Brad Parsons, finds a &quot;nice mix&quot; of fiction and nonfiction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some books might even appeal to two people likely to be among the busiest on Earth this fall: Obama, the Democrats' presumptive nominee, and his presumed opponent, Sen. John McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has said he's a fan of John Updike, who will be releasing &quot;The Widows of Eastwick,&quot; his sequel to the best-selling &quot;The Witches of Eastwick.&quot; Three writers cited favorably by Obama will have novels out: Marilynne Robinson, whose &quot;Home&quot; is a companion to her Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;Gilead&quot;; Morrison, with &quot;A Mercy,&quot; set on a plantation in the 17th century; and Roth, whose &quot;Indignation&quot; takes place on a Midwestern college campus in the 1950s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other anticipated titles include Kate Atkinson's &quot;When Will There Be Good News?&quot; -- the new literary crime thriller from the author of &quot;Case Histories.&quot; Wally Lamb, author of &quot;She's Come Undone,&quot; has completed his first novel in a decade, &quot;The Hour I First Believed.&quot; Pulitzer Prize-winner E. Annie Proulx has a new story collection, &quot;Fine Just the Way It Is.&quot; Booksellers also are hopeful about &quot;2666,&quot; by the late Chilean author Roberto Balano, whose &quot;Savage Detectives&quot; was a critical and commercial success last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I expect you'll see a lot of editorial excitement from us on that book,&quot; Parsons says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some fiction fits right into an election year, such as Christopher Buckley's &quot;Supreme Courtship,&quot; a satire of the judicial branch, and Curtis Sittenfeld's &quot;American Wife,&quot; which fictionalizes first lady Laura Bush. Sittenfeld, author of the best-seller &quot;Prep,&quot; continues a tradition of novelists imagining the private lives of American leaders, like such recent works as Pulitzer Prize-winner Robert Olen Butler's &quot;Intercourse,&quot; a story collection that includes a peek into the bedroom of the current first couple. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this world of celebrity, blogs and entertainment gossip television, we are intensely aware of public figures who perform the same function as mythological figures did in an earlier period,&quot; Butler says. &quot;It's our own private lives writ large.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought it was absolutely brilliant,&quot; Hensley said of Sittenfeld's book. &quot;When I first started to read it, I thought, 'Oh, it was going to be a hatchet job.' But I enjoyed it anyway. I was amazed with what she could do with so few pages at the beginning.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Familiar names such as King, Michael Crichton, Candace Bushnell, Gregory Maguire, Dennis Lehane, Nelson DeMille, David Baldacci and Vince Flynn will be back. Sister Souljah has written a sequel to &quot;The Coldest Winter Ever,&quot; which helped kick off the &quot;Urban Lit&quot; phenomenon. Anne Rice has a new book, &quot;Called Out of Darkness,&quot; a memoir that details her Christian faith and its influence on her vampire novels. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publishers did hold some books until after Election Day, such as Patrick Tyler's &quot;World of Trouble,&quot; a history of presidents and the Middle East that Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux will publish in December. Around the same time, Collins will release &quot;My Word is My Bond,&quot; a memoir by actor Sir Roger Moore. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We just felt the media coverage would benefit from a clearer field postelection, and that is looking increasingly true,&quot; says Steve Ross, president and publisher of Collins, a HarperCollins division. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three September releases that won't be overlooked: Obama's &quot;Change We Can Believe In,&quot; a policy book and collection of speeches; Woodward's fourth volume about the Bush administration; and Friedman's &quot;Hot, Flat and Crowded,&quot; his first since the million-selling &quot;The World Is Flat.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Topical works are scheduled from Michael Moore, Paul Begala and Ann Coulter. Topical thoughts will be transmitted from ancient times through Garry Wills' translation of epigrams by the Roman satirist Martial, including a couplet that reads like an ode to campaign fundraising: &quot;I did not ask wealth for my own/It was just to make my rival groan.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scholastic Inc., the U.S. publisher of the Harry Potter books, starts a new series this fall, &quot;The 39 Clues,&quot; 10 planned novels by 10 different authors, packaged with multimedia games, contests and trading cards, and enhanced by a movie deal with Steven Spielberg. A well-established franchise, Christopher Paolini's &quot;Inheritance&quot; fantasy series, continues with &quot;Brisingr.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abraham Lincoln's bicentennial is not until February, but fall offers a warmup for the deluge: John Stauffer's &quot;Giants: The Parallel Lives of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass&quot;; Harold Holzer's &quot;Lincoln President-Elect&quot; and &quot;Tried by War,&quot; by James M. McPherson, a Pulitzer Prize-winner and leading Civil War historian who thinks, despite thousands of books about the president, that Lincoln's war leadership deserves more attention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His functions as commander in chief have been undertreated compared to many other aspects of his life and career,&quot; says McPherson, winner of the Pulitzer for &quot;The Battle Cry of Freedom,&quot; widely regarded as the best one-volume history of the Civil War. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alice Schroeder's &quot;The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life&quot; is an authorized biography of the billionaire investor. David Hackett Fisher, winner of the Pulitzer for &quot;Washington's Crossing,&quot; has written &quot;Champlain's Dream,&quot; about the founding of Quebec. Malcolm Gladwell of &quot;Blink&quot; and &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; fame ponders the mystery of success in &quot;Outliers.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Library of America will honor poet John Ashbery with a volume of his early work, a rare tribute to a living artist. The letters between Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop, celebrated poets and equally intense correspondents, have been compiled. Poet Jay Parini has written &quot;The Promised Land: 13 Books That Changed America,&quot; including essays about &quot;On the Road,&quot; &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; and &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A ritual for any season: celebrities telling all. Ted Turner gets personal in &quot;Call Me Ted,&quot; Alec Baldwin sounds off on parenthood and divorce in &quot;A Promise to Ourselves,&quot; Prince takes you onstage for &quot;21 Nights&quot; and Maureen McCormick adds to the mini-mountain of &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; literature with &quot;Here's the Story.&quot; Memoirs also are coming from Eminem, Tony Curtis and Bill O'Reilly, who calls his book &quot;A Bold Fresh Piece of Humanity,&quot; a title that Barnes &amp; Noble buyer Edward Ash-Milby declined to comment on, saying, &quot;I'd rather keep it PG here.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don Rickles, 82 and fresher than ever, is working on a book of letters that should be out in November. They're not real, just messages he's made up for departed friends (Frank Sinatra, Johnny Carson), living friends (Bob Newhart) and some he's never met, such as Lincoln and George Washington. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I call myself the Jewish Mark Twain,&quot; says Rickles, who acknowledges he'd rather publish a book than read one, just the kind of man who might take up Michael Moore on his offer to keep his nightstand clear. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had trouble with English class in high school. Thank God there was World War II or I might still be there. That should give you an idea of my reading background.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notable books coming out this fall </SPAN></P>

And so that awesome collection of bone and muscle behind '80s Cold War studmeisters Rambo and Rocky, who so valiantly battled the so-called Evil Empire in the movies, has signed a deal to shill for a brand of Russian vodka called Russian Ice. (Did you know both film series were banned in the U.S.S.R.?) Sylvester Stallone will appear in print and TV ads for an estimated $1 mil payout. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The advertising campaign concept was based on the fact that the actor has . . . roots&quot; in what used to be Soviet territory, the drink company Synergy said Friday, referring to Sly's great-grandma </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rosa Rabinovich</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, from the Ukrainian town of Odessa.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What were you thinking?,&quot; the newsman asked. Quipped McCain: &quot;If there is anything I am lacking in . . . it is taste in music and art and other great things in life.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton resisted smearing Barack Obama as unpatriotic, but John McCain is showing no such reluctance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest person to unleash this underhanded tactic by Team McCain was none other than Sen. Joseph Lieberman (I., Conn.), the former vice-presidential nominee of the Democratic Party.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Introducing McCain at a campaign event in York, Pa., Lieberman said the presidential race was a choice &quot;between one candidate, John McCain, who has always put the country first, worked across party lines to get things done, and one candidate who has not.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That makes Obama, by insinuation, someone who doesn't always put his country first. This dishonorable strategy is beneath a candidate who once had higher standards. It sounds more like a job for the old House Un-American Activities Committee, which was disbanded in 1975. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent weeks, McCain's campaign falsely claimed that Obama wouldn't visit wounded U.S. soldiers because there were no TV cameras. Then McCain said he was &quot;proud&quot; of a campaign ad comparing Obama to Britney Spears. Real honorable, John. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, a new book by the same author who did a hatchet job on John Kerry in 2004 further exploits the suspicion among some that Obama is less than a full U.S. citizen. At its worst, this view manifests itself among the willfully ignorant who believe Obama is a sleeper Muslim with a secret allegiance to Islam. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a tactic that Clinton's top adviser urged her to pursue in the Democratic primary. In March 2007, adviser Mark Penn wrote a memo detailing Obama's perceived weaknesses, according to a recent article in the Atlantic magazine. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited,&quot; Penn wrote. &quot;I cannot image America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and in his values.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton, to her credit, didn't go there. But McCain and his surrogates are showing a willingness to do whatever it takes to get elected, adopting Penn's line. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The smear against Obama obviously has Democrats worried. The Pennsylvania AFL-CIO recently sent a glossy mailer to union households seeking to clarify rumors, lies and innuendo being spread mainly about Obama through the Internet. The bullet points include: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does he wear a flag pin on his lapel? Yes, but not always. Sometimes he wears a Senate pin, or a breast-cancer awareness pin, or - gasp - no pin at all. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is he a Christian? Yes, a &quot;committed Christian.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was he sworn in on the Bible? Yes, his personal family Bible (in fact, that's Vice President Cheney, a known Christian, standing with him in the photo)!  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was Obama born in America? Yes, in Honolulu, Hawaii, on Aug. 4, 1961. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does he place his hand over his heart when he says the pledge? Yes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is Democrats talking to Democrats, in 2008. But the questions are reminiscent of the commie-hunting era of the 1950s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters deserve a higher level of debate in the campaign. There are two wars to finish, a faltering economy, rising home foreclosures, soaring energy costs, and a retirement system headed toward insolvency, to name just a few of the challenges for the next president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain should refocus his campaign on those issues, instead of raising false questions about patriotism and Paris Hilton.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Thomas Fitzgerald; Inquirer Staff Writer</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATIONAL; P-com News; Pg. A01</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1087 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the last week, Sen. Barack Obama seemed to evaporate from the presidential race as he vacationed in Hawaii, his days filled with &quot;shave ice&quot; treats, golf, body surfing, and walks on the beach instead of political combat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Obama plunges back into the campaign at a pivotal moment, with the Democratic convention a week away and the announcement of his vice presidential nominee expected any day. The selection process has been free of serious leaks, just the way &quot;No Drama&quot; Obama likes it, but Democratic strategists hope that whomever he picks will help him get his mojo back.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since returning from his triumphal tour of Afghanistan, Iraq and Europe, Obama has been thrown on the defensive, and Republican Sen. John McCain has crept closer in national and battleground-state polls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before, Obama was surging and dominated the race's narrative. Many analysts thought McCain was a long shot, considering his campaign's stumbles, the sagging economy, the GOP's unpopularity, and Obama's advantages of money and magnetism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the generic ballot questions in the polls show voters want a Democratic president. The problem is they're not sure they want Obama,&quot; said Peter A. Brown, an independent pollster at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut. &quot;He hasn't closed the sale. Every historical fact says he should be farther ahead than he is.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain gained traction on the energy crisis with his call to &quot;drill here, drill now&quot;; expand the use of nuclear power; and develop alternative fuels. He also hammered Obama as &quot;the biggest celebrity in the world&quot; - aloof, presumptuous, and incapable of relating to average Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using images of 200,000 chanting Berliners from the world tour, McCain's campaign cut one ad that compared Obama to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. Another piece, for the Internet, tagged Obama as &quot;the One,&quot; using video of Charlton Heston playing Moses in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Ten Commandments</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. And while Obama vacationed last week, McCain talked tough on the Russian invasion of Georgia, hoping to demonstrate his experience in world affairs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama lost the summer, and part of it was he got arrogant and overreached. He started talking about transition planning and going to all these red states, like Montana, where he has no chance,&quot; Washington GOP strategist John Feehery said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the tipping point was Berlin,&quot; Feehery said. &quot;A lot of Americans were left scratching their heads, thinking, 'Why isn't he talking to me?' &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's new tack - a contrast to his earlier pledges to run a &quot;respectful campaign&quot; - resulted after he shook up his campaign organization, bringing in Karl Rove protege Steve Schmidt and seasoned veterans of other presidential campaigns to focus the message. A new, more disciplined McCain no longer conducts a rolling salon with reporters in the back of his bus, and his events are more tightly controlled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he wants to win, McCain has no choice but to go negative on Obama,&quot; Brown said. &quot;This election is about Obama,&quot; and polls show him with a high favorability rating. &quot;Who's not for change and unity?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August has been a cruel month for previous Democratic candidates, as they shrugged off Republican attacks that sank in and then sank their campaigns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1988, Michael Dukakis had a 17-point lead in the polls as summer came to a close, and he did not respond forcefully to criticism that he was soft on crime and not sufficiently patriotic. Though considered a new kind of Democrat, cerebral and cool, he was blown out by Vice President George H.W. Bush. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry windsurfed in August, giving devastating footage to GOP ad makers. He also did not respond to attacks on his Vietnam War record. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has greater rhetorical gifts than either of those candidates, but still, some Democrats have gotten nervous during his rough patch. Obama's campaign has fought back, quietly placing attack ads tying McCain to President Bush in some battleground states, and his strategists say most voters won't pay attention to campaign back-and-forth in earnest until after Labor Day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign is entering a three-week stretch that is packed with potential game-changing moments: the vice presidential choices, and the infomercials of the Democratic and Republican nominating conventions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the GOP wraps up on Sept. 4, only eight weeks will remain in the campaign, with three televised debates ahead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts and strategists say Obama needs to manage the Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton drama at the Democratic convention. In the aftermath of their bitter primary fight, Obama agreed last week to allow Hillary Clinton's name to be placed in nomination. Depending on how the roll call unfolds, that gesture could promote party healing or spark an emotional reaction that undercuts Obama on national TV. And the former president has damned Obama with faint praise. What will he say in Denver? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also needs a vice presidential pick who can reassure voters concerned about his inexperience, Brown said. Among those considered finalists are Sen. Joseph R. Biden of Delaware; Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana, who also was governor there; Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine; Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a military veteran well-versed in foreign affairs; and Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, meanwhile, has to reassure the GOP base - which has often distrusted his maverick nature - while persuading independents that he is different from Bush. That imperative applies both to the convention and to McCain's choice of running mate.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican possibles include former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, the first secretary of homeland security; Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty; Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democrat-turned-Independent; former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney; and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the recent turbulence, the underlying dynamics of the race have not changed much, analysts said. Polls indicate that both candidates have largely locked down their party bases, and that the race should stay close unless something happens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fight is for the independents, about 20 percent of the electorate,&quot; said Democratic strategist Neil Oxman, who said he believed the race would be won by 3 or 4 percentage points. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are liabilities on both sides,&quot; Oxman said. &quot;For McCain, it's the ties to Bush and the desire for change. And it's Obama's age, inexperience and race. There's enough to give people pause with each of them.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain and the adjective &quot;maverick&quot; were once seemingly inseparable, and his quixotic attempt in 2000 to win the Republican presidential nomination helped weld that link.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now that the Arizona senator is about to become his party's nominee, he finds himself in an uncomfortable spot: having to defend his reputation as a political independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's campaign unveiled an ad this month that calls him &quot;the original maverick,&quot; and he has retooled his stump speech to remind independent voters disenchanted with Republicans that he defied his party on campaign finance reform, tobacco regulation and the early Iraq strategy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats, sensing a weakness, have started to chant that this year's John McCain is not the voluble insurgent who terrorized his party's establishment eight years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Elkhart, Ind., Mr. McCain's Democratic opponent hit this theme hard. &quot;The price he paid for his party's nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position,&quot; Illinois Sen. Barack Obama told voters at a town hall meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, he embraces the failed Bush policies over the last eight years -- politics that helped break Washington in the first place. And that doesn't exactly meet my definition of a maverick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This debate over Mr. McCain's maverick-ness reflects a new challenge in his second bid for the presidency: the dilution of the McCain brand. To win the GOP primary this year, Mr. McCain embraced party dogma in ways big and small, from switching his opposition to President Bush's tax cuts, which he had criticized as skewed to the rich, to making amends with religious leaders he once denounced as &quot;agents of intolerance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign has also undercut Mr. McCain's image as a straight-talker by dramatically limiting the national media's access to the candidate, who once charmed reporters and voters alike with his easy, free-wheeling, common-man conversational style on his campaign bus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2000, few questioned Mr. McCain's maverick credentials. He had stirred anger among conservatives by pushing a ban on the unlimited contributions to the parties that were used to finance campaigns. He locked horns with the tobacco lobby in 1998, when he sponsored an anti-smoking bill that would have raised cigarette taxes and was ultimately derailed by Republicans. He had long rankled colleagues with his campaign against earmarked projects, farm subsidies and pork-barrel spending. And he famously called televangelists Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell &quot;agents of intolerance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His iconoclastic path continued into the early Bush years. He opposed the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, he pursued lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his associates, who were accused of bilking tribes of millions of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. McCain's positioning for the 2008 race undercut that firebrand image. He now supports making the Bush tax cuts permanent. He has vowed to appoint conservative judges. And he gave the commencement speech at Mr. Falwell's college, Liberty University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not believe in holding grudges in life or in politics,&quot; Mr. McCain said at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Around 2005 or so, he realized he was running for president ... He was going to do whatever was necessary to win this office,&quot; said Matt Welch, editor in chief of Reason magazine, whose book &quot;McCain&quot; is subtitled &quot;The Myth of a Maverick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, analysts say Mr. McCain still fits into a venerable tradition of legislators who tend to back their political party, but will go against it on key issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A maverick doesn't mean you're always against your party,&quot; said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University history professor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Zelizer pointed to the lingering distrust of Mr. McCain within the GOP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So many Republicans just hate him because he doesn't play ball,&quot; he said. &quot;That's the definition of what a maverick is.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arizona Sen. John McCain and the Republican National Committee started August with a hefty $96 million, financially flush and strongly positioned to compete with his presidential rival, prolific fundraiser and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and the Democrats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have been trying to even out the financial playing field after trailing Democrats in overall fundraising for most of the election cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain has been a subpar fundraiser and has lagged the much-more adept Mr. Obama in monthly campaign tallies. But the RNC, with big-draw President Bush helping, has trounced its Democratic counterpart in collections. That has helped Mr. McCain and the GOP stay competitive financially with Mr. Obama and the Democratic National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The July numbers reflect how far Mr. McCain and the Republicans have come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain raised $27 million in July, his largest one-month fundraising haul since clinching the GOP presidential nomination, and had $21 million available to spend, while the RNC brought in nearly $26 million, and had $75 million on hand to compete with the Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, himself, now has 600,000 donors, while the party announced that it had reached 1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By comparison, Mr. Obama alone recently surpassed 2 million contributors, giving him a larger pool of donors to hit up for money again. He and the DNC have not yet disclosed their monthly takes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our fundraising continues to be very healthy,&quot; Rick Davis, Mr. McCain's campaign manager, said in a conference call with reporters, noting that July was the fifth-straight month that Mr. McCain has improved his cash flow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite lackluster fundraising earlier this year, the campaign's improved money situation has allowed the GOP nominee-in-waiting to keep pace with -- if not exceed -- his Democratic rival in advertising, including $6 million during the ultra-expensive Olympics and three straight months of multimillions for commercials in 11 battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's overall advertising budget for August is expected to exceed $20 million, and, by the convention in early September, Mr. Davis said Mr. McCain is on track to spend some $60 million on TV expenditures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He released a new TV ad yesterday in key states that criticizes Mr. Obama on taxes. &quot;Celebrity? Yes. Ready to lead? No,&quot; the ad says, with the Democrats' name chanted in the background and pictures of him before adoring crowds. The commercial claims that &quot;Obama's new taxes could break your family budget,&quot; mean &quot;higher prices at the pump&quot; and are a &quot;recipe for economic disaster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan responded: &quot;This ad is just more of the same old, false and discredited attacks that Senator McCain knows aren't true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the general election, Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama are operating under different financial scenarios of their own choosing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain has agreed to accept $84 million in public financing for the general election and the spending restraints that come with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the party committee can raise and spend as much as it wants to help him, the taxpayer money is the only cash that Mr. McCain can spend after accepting his party's nomination at the convention next month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wreak havoc on her breasts no matter how much synthetic material they're made of, Pamela Anderson may be saying enough to the flaky, stringy-haired rock stars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Marc Malkin</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at eonline.com, Pam has her sights set on royalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someday her prince will come. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May have already happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been kept quiet, but the star of E!'s &quot;Pam: Girl on the Loose&quot; (ah, synergy!) is reportedly seeing a handsome dude from Abu Dhabi's royal family, whom she lovingly has nicknamed &quot;Milk-Sheik.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, that could also be her nickname.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malkin says that Pam got Milk when she was in Abu Dhabi in June for the Make a Wish Foundation, making more than one wish come true. She made such a well-rounded impression that she has since teamed up with the royals to build an eco-friendly, vegan-friendly hotel in the desert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're just curious how the royal family is going to react when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Tommy Lee</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> moves back in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Oops</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">We thought that that $75,000 lawsuit number was too small in our story yesterday about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Paris Hilton </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">being taken to court for not promoting a movie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turns out it was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worldwide Entertainment Group, which made &quot;National Lampoon's Pledge This!&quot; is seeking unspecified damages </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">in excess of</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> $75,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 75G is the minimum amount needed to get the case into federal court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">House decision not so Random</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Salman Rushdie</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strongly criticized his publisher, Random House, for pulling a historical novel about the prophet </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Muhammad</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his child bride over concerns about angering Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rushdie's &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; led to a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">fatwa</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 1989 from Iran's Ayatollah</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> Ruhollah Khomeini </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">and forced him to live under police protection for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am very disappointed to hear that my publishers . . . have canceled another author's novel, apparently because of their concerns about possible Islamic reprisals,&quot; Rushdie said yesterday in an e-mail to the Associated Press. &quot;This is censorship by fear, and it sets a very bad precedent indeed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Random House has acknowledged pulling</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> Sherry Jones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">' debut novel, &quot;The Jewel of Medina,&quot; which it had planned to release this month. The publisher said that &quot;credible and unrelated sources&quot; had warned that the book &quot;could incite acts of violence by a small, radical segment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Random House spokeswoman </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Carol Schneider</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, &quot;We certainly respect Mr. Rushdie's opinion, but we stand by our decision, which we made with considerable deliberation and regret.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Lawyers in love</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Billboard.com reports that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Jackson Browne</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is suing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">John McCain</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Republican party for using his song &quot;Running on Empty&quot; in a TV commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the suit, filed in L.A., Browne claims that McCain and the GOP did not obtain permission to use the song for an ad which mocks </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Barack </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s suggestion that the country could save some gas with proper tire inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only have Senator McCain and his agents plainly infringed Mr. Browne's copyright in 'Running on Empty,' but the Federal Courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singer's voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singer's right of publicity,&quot; says Browne lawyer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Lawrence Iser</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Browne is seeking unspecified damages, as well as a permanent injunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seeking another tune, the McCain campaign may now consider &quot;The Pretender.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">832 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain recently tried to underscore his seriousness about pushing through a new energy policy, with a strong focus on more drilling for oil, by telling a motorcycle convention that Congress needed to come back from vacation immediately and do something about America's energy crisis. &quot;Tell them to come back and get to work!&quot; Sen. McCain bellowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sorry, but I can't let that one go by. Sen. McCain knows why. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was only five days earlier, July 30, that the Senate was voting for the eighth time in the past year on a broad, vitally important bill -- S. 3335 -- that would have extended the investment tax credits for installing solar energy and the production tax credits for building wind turbines and other energy-efficiency systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the wind and solar industries depend on these credits -- which expire in December -- to scale their businesses and become competitive with coal, oil and natural gas. Unlike offshore drilling, these credits could have an immediate impact on America's energy profile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. McCain did not show up for the crucial vote July 30, and the renewable energy bill was defeated for the eighth time. In fact, John McCain has a perfect record on this renewable energy legislation. He has missed all eight votes over the last year -- which effectively counts as a no vote each time. Once, he was even in the Senate and wouldn't leave his office to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain did not show up on any votes,&quot; said Scott Sklar, president of The Stella Group, which tracks clean-technology legislation. Despite that, Sen. McCain's campaign commercial running during the Olympics shows a bunch of spinning wind turbines -- the very wind turbines that he would not cast a vote to subsidize, even though he supports big subsidies for nuclear power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama did not vote July 30 either -- which is equally inexcusable in my book -- but he did vote on three previous occasions in favor of the renewable-energy legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Congress has failed eight times to renew them is largely because of a hard core of Republican senators who either don't want to give Democrats such a victory in an election year or simply don't believe in renewable energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What impact does this have? In the solar industry today there is a rush to finish any project that would be up and running by Dec. 31 -- when the credits expire -- and most everything beyond that is now on hold. Consider the Solana concentrated solar power plant, 70 miles southwest of Phoenix in Mr. McCain's home state. It is the biggest proposed concentrating solar energy project ever. The farsighted local utility is ready to buy its power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But because of the Senate's refusal to extend the solar tax credits, &quot;we cannot get our bank financing,&quot; said Fred Morse, a senior adviser for the American operations of Abengoa Solar, which is building the project. &quot;Without the credits, the numbers don't work.&quot; Some 2,000 construction jobs are on hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Efird is president of Suntech America -- a major Chinese-owned solar panel maker that actually wants to build a new factory in America. They've been scouting the country for sites, and several governors have been courting them. But Mr. Efird told me that when the solar credits failed to pass the Senate, his boss told him: &quot;Don't set up any more meetings with governors. It makes absolutely no sense to do this if we don't have stability in the incentive programs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the biggest canards peddled by Big Oil is that, &quot;Sure, we'll need wind and solar energy, but it's just not cost-effective yet.&quot; They've been saying that for 30 years. What these tax credits are designed to do is to stimulate investments by many players in solar and wind so these technologies can quickly move down the learning curve and become competitive with coal and oil -- which is why some people are trying to block them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Richard K. Lester, an energy-innovation expert at MIT, notes, &quot;The best chance we have -- perhaps the only chance&quot; of addressing the combined challenges of energy supply and demand, climate change and energy security &quot;is to accelerate the introduction of new technologies for energy supply and use and deploy them on a very large scale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, he argues, will take more than a Manhattan Project. It will require a fundamental reshaping by government of the prices and regulations and research-and-development budgets that shape the energy market. Without taxing fossil fuels so they become more expensive and giving subsidies to renewable fuels so they become more competitive -- and changing regulations so more people and companies have an interest in energy efficiency -- we will not get innovation in clean power at the scale we need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is what this election should be focusing on. Everything else is just bogus rhetoric designed by cynical candidates who think Americans are so stupid -- so bloody stupid -- that if you just show them wind turbines in your Olympics ad they'll actually think you showed up and voted for such renewable power -- when you didn't.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">598 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arecent presidential campaign ad for Sen. Barack Obama features video of Sen. John McCain walking toward the camera with a group of people in power suits, as the narrator says, &quot;the lobbyists, running his low road campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the people pictured are lobbyists, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad also repeats a misleading claim that McCain favors &quot;billions in tax breaks for big oil and drug companies.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain's tax policy doesn't target those industries. He calls for lowering the corporate tax rate for all companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign has been very forthright about criticizing John McCain for having lobbyists work for his campaign. But the new Obama TV ad, released Monday, gives a false picture -- quite literally -- of who exactly they are. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But none of the folks pictured are even former lobbyists. And two are Secret Service agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Times' noted the discrepancy in the ad identifying those pictured as, from left to right, &quot;an unidentified Secret Service agent, eBay executive Meg Whitman, McCain, another Secret Service agent, traveling press aide Brooke Buchanan and Greg Wendt, a San Francisco Democrat and volunteer adviser who travels with McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign confirms that those are the identities of the people pictured. Granted these smartly dressed folks may well fit the bill at a Hollywood casting call for &quot;lobbyists.&quot; But they're not lobbyists in real life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whitman is well known as the recently retired eBay CEO with a lengthy business career. She's a campaign co-chair. Wendt's career has been in mutual fund management. Both are McCain fundraisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad's narrator says: &quot;For decades, he's been Washington's biggest celebrity. And as Washington has embraced him, John McCain hugged right back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lobbyists, running his low road campaign. The money, billions in tax breaks for big oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours. Lurching to the right then the left, the old Washington dance, whatever it takes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain: a Washington celebrity playing the same old Washington games.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign justifies the ad's statement that &quot;the lobbyists&quot; are running McCain's campaign by citing various press reports about McCain campaign manager Rick Davis, who is a former telecommunications lobbyist; senior adviser Charlie Black, who was chairman of the lobbying firm BKSH &amp; Associates and who recently stepped down to work for McCain; and several other McCain advisers that have worked as lobbyists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said in February that while lobbyists serve as his advisers, &quot;they're honorable people, and I'm proud to have them as part of my team,&quot; as reported by the Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, the McCain camp announced a new conflict-of-interest policy saying that no one working for the campaign could be a currently registered lobbyist. There are now former lobbyists in the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we asked the Obama camp about its use of an image lacking any actual lobbyists, former or otherwise, spokesman Tommy Vietor told us, &quot;I think everyone knows which lobbyists are running his campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If so, everyone should also know they're not pictured in this ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad also expands upon a misleading claim we've written about before. It says that McCain supports &quot;billions in tax breaks for big oil and drug companies.&quot; (Last week, the claim was only about oil companies.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either way, McCain's proposal is actually to lower the corporate tax rate for all companies, not just those in unpopular industries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress, Pennsylvania's senior senator said emphatically, ought to be in session when the nation is facing sky-high fuel bills and people are opting to take stay-at-home vacations rather than pay inflated gas prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Congress has been gridlocked and dysfunctional,&quot; he said, citing heavy bickering between parties that has been &quot;detrimental to the country.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be very salutary for the American people to see Congress at work,&quot; Specter said. There's no guarantee Congress will make great gains during an August session, he added, &quot;but if we're not at work, nothing is certain to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specter also voiced dissatisfaction with the shift in federal power in recent years, noting that President Bush has broken constitutional and international laws as he consolidates control in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since 9/11, we have seen the greatest expansion of executive authority in the history of this country,&quot; Specter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush is likely to veto the Free Flow of Information Act, a shield bill for reporters co-sponsored by Specter, Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) and Charles Shumer (D-N.Y.), Specter said. But he said, &quot;This is a season where vetoes are being overridden. I think we have the votes to override that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let him veto it. I think we ought to push it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specter also wants to push for solutions to the oil crisis that has hamstrung the U.S. economy. Unfortunately, he said, there's no quick fix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody who says there is a short-term answer to the problem is not realistic,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specter said he favors eliminating an anti-trust exemption given to OPEC nations, which have lowered the supply of oil despite increased demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a commercial function, and we can take it away,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also supports limited offshore drilling but said the government should offer tax credits to encourage development of alternative fuel sources, from clean coal to hydropower, solar energy and wind power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything has to be handled with appropriate concern for the environment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That includes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge without disturbing caribou breeding grounds, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He concedes, however, that offshore and Alaskan oil reserves are not a long-term solution to the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be a sign, if we do it thoughtfully, that we're making an effort,&quot; Specter said. &quot;But we're not going to be able to drill our way out of the oil crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to more immediate events, Specter said the U.S. response to the conflict between Russia and Georgia must be a firm hand - but not a warlike posture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the President could be a little stronger in his denunciation of (Russia's) actions,&quot; Specter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not going to go to war over this. But we ought to condemn it in the strongest terms possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. should do its part to bring international pressures to bear on Russia to withdraw from Georgia, he said, but &quot;to get U.N. peacekeepers there, you'd have to start with a peace to keep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the presidential campaign, Specter said the race for the Oval Office &quot;could be won by either man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specter said he has a great deal of respect for Republican candidate McCain, his colleague in the Senate for more than two decades, as well as his Democratic challenger, Barack Obama, whose office in Washington, D.C., is just down the hall from his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama is a very talented guy,&quot; Specter said. &quot;And he's been a phenomenon as a campaigner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specter, nattily dressed in a blue blazer, red, white and blue tie and flag lapel pin, remained upbeat during the hourlong interview Tuesday afternoon with reporters and editors from the Intelligencer Journal - even when the conversation turned to his health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specter was diagnosed in 2005 with an advanced form of Hodgkin's lymphoma and completed a second round of chemotherapy treatments in July. He said he has been keeping busy and his spirits are high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grueling cancer treatments were &quot;tough, but tolerable,&quot; he said. &quot;I worked all through it ... and maintained my voting record.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and MICHAEL YODER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what has become a tradition when prominent Republican politicians make appearances in Lancaster County, local protesters took to the streets Tuesday to challenge the visit of Sen. John McCain, the presumptive GOP presidential candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spoke in Manheim after holding a town-hall-style meeting in York County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters were kept in the dark, however, as to McCain's ultimate destination in the county, creating uncertainty as to the best place to voice their concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 30 demonstrators, representing the Lancaster Coalition for Peace and Justice as well as Students for a Democratic Society, gathered at Penn Square Tuesday evening, ready to speak their minds about McCain's visit to Lancaster County and his foreign policy and domestic issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(McCain's) trying to position himself as a green candidate, but yet (he had) a score of zero from the League of Conservation Voters last year,&quot; Millersville resident Bill Adams said. &quot;That's the worst record for the Senate for environmental issues. From commercials, you get the feeling that he's environmentally friendly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters - holding signs reading &quot;Honk if you want change,&quot; &quot;McSame&quot; and &quot;Want More War? Vote McCain&quot; - were greeted by enthusiastic honks and occasional rude gestures from people in cars passing by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Schreck, LCPJ's administrator and public spokesman, said he feels McCain's campaign has been misleading on important issues, focusing more on pop culture with his Britney Spears and Paris Hilton ad than on the Iraq War or the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schreck, a Lancaster native and Millersville University graduate who joined LCPJ in 2004, said large media organizations have not been doing their job to educate the public about McCain's positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a problem, and its not being addressed, and we have three months until the election,&quot; Schreck said. &quot;McCain, he's just doing the Republican thing - being misleading because he wants to be in power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LCPJ protests are not new to the area. A March protest against the Iraq War garnered 600 people, and 400 people came out to protest President Bush's visit in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 people lined Lincoln Highway East at the Lancaster Host Resort in 2006 to demonstrate against former Bush adviser Karl Rove, who spoke at the Lancaster County Republican dinner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams was at all those demonstrations, speaking out against the Iraq War. His son, Brent, was killed in Ramadi, Iraq, on Dec. 1, 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams echoed Schreck's sentiments, saying McCain's campaign has been geared toward base-level emotional responses and stays away from actual issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time to get an accurate timetable&quot; for withdrawal from Iraq, Adams said. &quot;The Iraqi people want a timetable. The majority of Americans favor a timetable. Why don't our leaders favor timetables as well?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several members of SDS, from high school and college chapters, also were at Penn Square. Among them was Becca Rast, 18, a McCaskey High School graduate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rast said people walking by the demonstration were very receptive to their message as she handed out voter guides. She said she doesn't necessarily support either of the candidates but wants to inform voters about what they stand for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The American people deserve to hear the truth about candidates, and when (Sen.Barack) Obama is here, we'll do the exact same thing - telling people what's going on here,&quot; Rast said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YORK, Pa. - Using the Russian attacks on Georgia as Exhibit A, Republican presidential candidate John McCain yesterday portrayed himself as better prepared to protect the national security in a dangerous world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, we are all Georgians,&quot; McCain told several thousand people at the York Fairgrounds, recounting what he had said in a telephone conversation earlier in the day with the country's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, whom he has befriended during several visits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We live in a dangerous world. We never know what's around the corner,&quot; McCain said in a veiled rebuke of his vacationing rival, first-term Democratic Sen. Barack Obama.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, an Arizona senator since 1987, said Americans should care about the conflict not only because Georgia is a close U.S. ally but also because it is at a &quot;strategic crossroads&quot; for oil pipelines from the Caspian Sea region to Western markets. He said Russia had &quot;ambitions&quot; to threaten countries that are, like Georgia, U.S. allies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he had the day before, McCain urged that vigorous diplomacy be used to halt Russia's actions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a return to a familiar GOP theme - national security - for McCain as he campaigned in York and Lancaster, the heart of the Republican base in Pennsylvania. On the second of a two-day visit, McCain was accompanied again by former Gov. Tom Ridge, the nation's first secretary of homeland security. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also with them was Sen. Joseph Lieberman (I., Conn.), who was blunter, launching a harsh attack on Obama, though he did not use the Illinois senator's name. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my opinion, the choice could not be more clear: between one candidate, John McCain, who's had experience, been tested in war and tried in peace, and another candidate who has not,&quot; said Lieberman, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000, who introduced the soon-to-be GOP nominee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The choice, Lieberman continued, is &quot;between one candidate, John McCain, who has always put the country first, worked across party lines to get things done, and one candidate who has not. Between one candidate who's a talker, and the other candidate who's the leader America needs.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lieberman's remarks came on the same day that Obama's campaign announced a group of prominent Republicans who have endorsed him, led by former Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Obama's campaign said McCain's claim to bipartisan leadership was a sham, saying McCain had voted with President Bush 95 percent of the time. The campaign yesterday also launched a Pennsylvania radio ad that accuses McCain of not doing enough to prevent manufacturing jobs from going overseas, and that refers to Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are made in York. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad quotes McCain's comments at a South Dakota biker rally this month: &quot;Not long ago a couple hundred thousand Berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent. I will take the roar of 50,000 Harleys any day.&quot; Not &quot;when it comes to his record,&quot; an announcer intones. As motorcycles rev up, the ad concludes, &quot;It's time to hear the roar of a strong American economy again.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the event at the fairgrounds began, a large garage door in the York Expo Center clattered open and McCain's campaign bus rolled up to the stage as that iconic Pennsylvania political song, the theme from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Rocky</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, played at eardrum-bursting volume. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, McCain said he relished being behind in the race with Obama, and he vowed to visit as many Pennsylvania hamlets as possible - reminding voters, of course, that Obama once said the state's small-town residents &quot;cling&quot; to guns and religion because they are bitter at their economic plight. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to tell them I think they are the heartland of America, that the values they hold dear are the strength and character of America,&quot; McCain said. &quot;They're the reason why the people in Georgia today are looking to America . . . a beacon of hope and liberty.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;I think we're going to be up late on election night.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to a questioner who worried whether he was conservative enough, McCain stressed his desire to nominate Supreme Court justices who interpret the Constitution strictly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's going to be two, maybe three vacancies on the Supreme Court, according to people that decide these things,&quot; McCain said, correcting himself by adding: &quot;People that pay close attention.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When McCain campaigned Monday in Erie, he teased Ridge, who has been mentioned as a potential running mate. The two men are close. Yesterday, however, McCain did not allude to that possibility but praised Ridge for his work as the first chief of the nation's Homeland Security Department. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not an accident that there has not been another attack on the United States of America,&quot; McCain said. &quot;For that, we owe a debt of gratitude to Tom Ridge.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YORK -- Conservative voters' anxiety over John McCain was made plain here Tuesday, when the presumptive Republican presidential nominee was accused of forsaking traditional GOP principles.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We conservatives believe that you dismissed our serious quest for responsible, limited government,&quot; said a woman at the town hall-style meeting at the York Expo Center.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a senator, I understand that you have had to adopt a compromising stance with the Democrats to get legislation passed,&quot; she said. &quot;But in your quest for the presidency, we want to know if it is in you to become a passionate and forceful leader with a conservative agenda to fight the lure of socialistic programs promoted by Senator (Barack) Obama?&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's one-word response -- &quot;Yes&quot; -- brought a roar of applause from a crowd estimated at nearly 3,000.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event capped McCain's two-day swing across Pennsylvania with Tom Ridge, the former two-term governor and secretary of Homeland Security, at his side. Another staunch McCain supporter, Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., introduced McCain as a leader who always put &quot;America first&quot; ahead of partisan ties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am supporting John McCain because he's ready to lead America,&quot; said Lieberman, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Sen. Arlen Specter told the crowd that &quot;we have a very high calling&quot; in the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This election may very well be decided by Pennsylvania,&quot; Specter said. He added that he believes McCain's reputation as an independent could win over Keystone State voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign, seeking to undercut McCain's support in the traditionally conservative central part of the state, released a 60-second radio spot accusing McCain of backing policies that hurt American workers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a Harley-Davidson motorcycle engine roaring in the background, the ad says McCain called a law that would have required the U.S. government to buy American-made motorcycles &quot;disgraceful.&quot; The York Harley-Davidson factory recently cut 300 jobs, according to the campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, of Arizona, appeared at the Sturgis motorcycle rally in South Dakota last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain should be ashamed of himself, not just for voting against protecting an American company like Harley-Davidson, but then for going in front of a group of motorcyclists in Sturgis and pretending to be one of them,&quot; Lancaster Mayor Rick Gray, a Democrat, motorcycle owner and Obama supporter, said in a statement announcing the ad.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specter accused the four collar counties surrounding Philadelphia of not pulling their weight in recent elections, in which many voters in the traditionally Republican areas have crossed party lines to vote for Democrats. Voters there have &quot;been derelict in not polling&quot; for Republicans, Specter said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain has the ability to carry the Southeast,&quot; Specter said. &quot;Combine that with the steadfastness of the 'T' (the traditionally conservative region encompassing central, northeast and northwest Pennsylvania), and he will be the next president of the United States.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poll released today shows McCain and Obama tied in Central Pennsylvania, which could hurt McCain's chances in November. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lieberman said McCain can win over those voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If McCain is himself, then he will earn people's respect, which leads to their support and their vote,&quot; Lieberman said. &quot;They will know they can count on him.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel D. Graham, a laid-off factory worker from Harrisburg, was among a crowd of onlookers waiting outside the Harrisburg Hilton yesterday morning for a glimpse of McCain boarding the Straight Talk Express, his big blue campaign bus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graham, a Democrat who supported Hillary Clinton in the primary, said he plans to vote for McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was hoping and praying to God that Hillary would not only win the Pennsylvania primary but also the nomination,&quot; Graham said. &quot;McCain is honest and he seems like a good Christian man. He has good character and courage to do what's right. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't like Obama's arrogant attitude. Obama doesn't have the experience in government and qualifications that we need.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aug. 13--Saying its candidate's plan would protect American jobs like those inside York County's Harley-Davidson plant, the presidential campaign of Sen. Barack Obama launched a radio ad Tuesday attacking Sen. John McCain's stance on the issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad came the day McCain visited York County for a town hall-style discussion at the York Expo Center's Toyota Arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a script released by the Obama campaign, the ad begins with McCain speaking at a South Dakota motorcycle rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain says he would take the roar of Harleys over the roar Obama received from a German crowd while touring overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest of the ad rebukes McCain for not supporting a requirement to mandate the American government buy American-made motorcycles, saying McCain called the idea &quot;disgraceful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also says McCain supports tax breaks resulting in jobs going overseas, with motorcycles rumbling in the background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad itself does not specifically mention Harley's actions this year to cut about 300 union workers in Springettsbury Township from its payroll, but a news release about the radio ad does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harley-Davidson has said it has no plans to outsource American workers. At most, it would consider operating facilities near overseas markets it wants to expand business into, the company has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain declined comment Tuesday about the radio ad, saying his campaign would respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Lindsay, spokesman for McCain in Pennsylvania and Ohio, issued a statement late in the day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that said McCain voted against the &quot;Buy America&quot; restriction because he does not believe in protectionist tariffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, because it would have cost the American taxpayer $5 billion per year, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lindsay also took his own swing at an Obama policy that could affect &quot;hard-working Americans,&quot; citing Obama's vote for next year's budget that would have included a tax hike for Americans making about $42,000 or more per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has said in past weeks his budget resolution votes were not tax-hike votes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential hopeful John McCain likely will stop in Lancaster County today after a town-hall event in York County, an anonymous Republican official said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, just where and when McCain will make the stop remains unknown. And a number of local Republican leaders say they're in the dark, too. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know it was something they were looking to do, but when and where they're going to do it, they haven't told me,&quot; said Dave Dumeyer, chairman of the Lancaster County Republican Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Paul Lindsay would only confirm the town-hall meeting scheduled for 11:45 a.m. today at the Toyota Center at the York Fairgrounds. McCain is on a two-day tour of Pennsylvania with former Gov. Tom Ridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After speaking in York and making any stops in Lancaster, McCain will depart from Lancaster Airport in Manheim Township, according to Frank Orban III, McCain's co-chair in Lancaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, acting on a hunch that McCain will make a Lancaster appearance, members of Lancaster Coalition for Peace and Justice and Lancaster Students for a Democratic Society plan to protest in Penn Square today at 3:30 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Democrats gathered Monday morning with state Democratic Party spokesman Abe Amoros to unveil a new Web ad by the Democratic National Committee aimed at countering McCain's tour of Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad features 40 seconds of ominous piano and string music while twice playing a clip of McCain in a New Orleans town-hall meeting last April in which he said, &quot;I'm not going to keep (all jobs) in America.&quot; He was responding to a question from an audience member about how he would retain American jobs and make the country &quot;more self-sufficient.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad also features text messages slamming McCain and his campaign adviser, Rick Davis, whose firm once lobbied Congress on behalf of DHL Express, a global packaging company looking to buy Airborne Express and move 8,000 jobs out of southeastern Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's a little scary myself, but it's an effective ad,&quot; Amoros said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blair Latoff, spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said McCain was being blunt with voters in the video and suggested Democrats were just playing politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The DNC and Barack Obama are more intent on politicizing job losses than they are seeking solutions to improve our challenging economic times,&quot; Latoff said. &quot;Maybe Barack Obama should take John McCain's lead and meet with the hardworking individuals who risk losing their jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Monday, Gov. Ed Rendell, in a conference call with the media set up by the Obama campaign, targeted McCain's record in the Senate, specifically mentioning votes the Arizona senator made to give American companies tax breaks for creating jobs abroad, to provide government subsidies to laid-off workers who lost jobs due to trade agreements and to give oil companies billions of dollars in tax breaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He would do nothing to shorten the gap between America's poorest, more challenged citizens and America's richest citizens,&quot; Rendell said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad also features text messages slamming McCain and his campaign adviser, Rick Davis, whose firm once lobbied Congress on behalf of DHL Express, a global packaging company looking to buy Airborne Express and move 8,000 jobs out of southeastern Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's a little scary myself, but it's an effective ad,&quot; Amoros said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blair Latoff, spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said McCain was being blunt with voters in the video and suggested Democrats were just playing politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The DNC and Barack Obama are more intent on politicizing job losses than they are seeking solutions to improve our challenging economic times,&quot; Latoff said. &quot;Maybe Barack Obama should take John McCain's lead and meet with the hardworking individuals who risk losing their jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Monday, Gov. Ed Rendell, in a conference call with the media set up by the Obama campaign, targeted McCain's record in the Senate, specifically mentioning votes the Arizona senator made to give American companies tax breaks for creating jobs abroad, to provide government subsidies to laid-off workers who lost jobs due to trade agreements and to give oil companies billions of dollars in tax breaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He would do nothing to shorten the gap between America's poorest, more challenged citizens and America's richest citizens,&quot; Rendell said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Barack Obama TV ad attacks John McCain over his staunch support for storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama opposes opening Yucca. He'll protect families,&quot; the announcer says ruefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what the ad does not say is that Obama twice voted to fund the proposed repository for spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad also tries to give the impression that McCain is misleading the people of his home state of Arizona, citing a short clip of a TV interview in which McCain seemed to be saying that he would oppose the hauling of nuclear waste through Arizona on its way to Yucca. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ad does not include McCain's full comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain told the Associated Press he believes the transport of nuclear waste could be made safe, and that the current storage situation is dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What people forget is the option of leaving this waste in areas outside - maybe unprotected, certainly not well protected - all over America, rather than having a safe and secure repository for it,&quot; McCain said. &quot;I preferred not having the status quo. And, I think it is a national security issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama tries to explain away his voting record on the matter, saying the Yucca funding was part of a comprehensive energy bill which he supported because of its &quot;historic&quot; investment in alternative-energy sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, Obama opposes Yucca - sorta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama says he opposes Yucca, but he allows funding for the project to go through - the contradiction is not lost on Nevadans, who oppose the facility by a large margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, on the other hand, has been consistent. Some may disagree with him, but they at least can respect his view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's attack on McCain is calculated to hurt the presumptive GOP nominee in Nevada, a crucial Western state this presidential-election year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, it also gives political cover for Democrat Obama, who has expressed little interest in Western issues, such as federal ownership of land, water, growth and Native American concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's view, therefore, seems to be more of a political calculation than conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, Obama's view on the entire subject of nuclear energy issue is suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While both candidates include nuclear power in their energy programs, Obama says only that existing nuclear plants must play a role in the country's energy future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for new reactor construction, Obama says, &quot;... only so far as it is clean and safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How's that for going out on a limb? What candidate for president supports dirty and unsafe nuclear power?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, meanwhile, calls for building 45 nuclear power plants by 2030, saying the technology is safer and cleaner than it has been in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he supports research into nuclear-waste reprocessing (which could render Yucca unnecessary or have it play a lesser role). Finding a long-term solution for nuclear waste is sure to be one of the challenges facing the next president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue resonates with Lancastrians, because of the proximity - and history - of the Three Mile Island nuclear facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, Pennsylvania is one of the largest producers of low-level radioactive waste (largely from nuclear medicines).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Short of a nuclear weapon, there is nothing more dangerous to the well-being of the planet than spent nuclear fuel temporarily stored alongside power plants. John McCain has a plan to store this material permanently. Barack Obama has no plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Arlen Specter and Democrat Joe Lieberman made a surprise visit to the York Expo Center to campaign for fellow Sen. John McCain, who today wraps up his two-day Pennsylvania campaign swing.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greeted warmly by the crowd of about 3,000 McCain supporters, Specter told the crowd that &quot;we have a very high calling&quot; in the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This election may very well be decided by Pennsylvania,&quot; Specter said. He added that he believes McCain's reputation as an independent could win over Keystone State voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign of Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, seeking to undercut McCain's support in the traditionally conservative central part of the state, released a 60-second radio spot accusing McCain of backing policies that hurt American workers. With a Harley-Davidson motorcycle engine roaring in the background, the ad says McCain called a law that would have required the U.S. government to buy American-made motorcycles &quot;disgraceful.&quot; The York Harley-Davidson factory recently cut 300 jobs, according to the campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, of Arizona, appeared at the Sturgis motorcycle rally in South Dakota last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain should be ashamed of himself, not just for voting against protecting an American company like Harley-Davidson, but then for going in front of a group of motorcyclists in Sturgis and pretending to be one of them,&quot; Lancaster Mayor Rick Gray, a motorcycle owner and Obama supporter, said in a statement announcing the ad.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specter accused the four collar counties surrounding Philadelphia of not pulling their weight in recent elections, where many voters in the traditionally Republican areas have crossed party lines to vote for Democrats. Voters there have &quot;been derelict in not polling&quot; for Republicans, Specter said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain has the ability to carry the Southeast,&quot; Specter said. &quot;Combine that with the steadfastness of the 'T' (the traditionally conservative region encompassing central, northeast and northwest Pennsylvania), and he will be the next president of the United States.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Sen. John McCain met with a small group of reporters, including one from The York Dispatch, after his town hall meeting in York on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting around a table at the back of his blue &quot;Straight Talk Express&quot; bus on his way to Lancaster, McCain outlined his position on topics including the conflict in Georgia, energy and his campaign strategy in Pennsylvania. Joining McCain were U.S. Rep. Todd Platts, R-York County, and Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a transcript of some questions posed to McCain, and his answers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some parts have been edited for clarity and length.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Do you think the president is handling the situation well in Georgia?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: &quot;I think we'll be able to get a better retrospective view of how the situation evolved in the weeks ahead. Everything I've heard so far is that Russians had planned this massive response for a long time. Whether they chose the Beijing Olympics to be the timing for it, I have no idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a military background and I don't think you can orchestrate that kid of offensive over a short period of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: McCain was asked to address the importance of Pennsylvania in his election campaign and how he plans to win considering there are more registered Democrats than Republican, third-party and non-affiliated voters combined in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: &quot;That would be true nationally. According to recent polls, we are a couple of points behind so obviously we have already made inroads in that direction.I really hate to be repetitive and boring, but I say again, we've got a lot of work to do. We are underdogs. I am the underdog. We have a lot of work to do. I don't underestimate the challenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: How does this trip fit into your campaign strategy in Pennsylvania?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I think our campaign strategy is to really do two things: Have town hall meetings and be on the bus. People want to see you, they want to hear from you, they want their questions answered. Suppose maybe I answered 20 questions today, just to take that number off my head. People feel like they've been part of the process. A woman asked about health care. That was on the minds of 500 or 600 of the people there. They got their question answered, responded to. Maybe not answered. At least they got responded to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: How can you maintain support from conservatives while also highlighting your ability to work in a bipartisan manner?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I think I've been able to do both, number one. Number two is that the frustration level that Americans feel whether they are conservatives, or moderates or liberals about our failure to act in their interests is overwhelming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why I was talking about the 9 percent approval rating of Congress. They (voters) want us to get things done and they want to do it in view of issues that they don't particularly feel is partisan in nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They want us to fix Social Security, like that young man who stood up. What's partisan about fixing social security? What's conservative or liberal? You've got a system that is going broke!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have to show them (voters) that I have a concrete plan of action for our economy, for housing, for all of these challenges we face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What are you hearing, what are you learning in Pennsylvania that is unique? Is there anything?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: No, except that the heartland -- Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan other states -- that experienced great loss in manufacturing jobs. They were hurting before the housing crisis and so their challenges are even greater than some other parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've got a big job to show them I have a concrete plan of action to fix our economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Your support of offshore drilling has won support. But what happens to that strength in your campaign if the price of gas drops to, say, $3 per gallon?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Three dollars a gallon is incredibly high. Americans because of $4 a gallon...are becoming more and more (aware of) the fragility of the whole supply and demand. They've figured it out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And I don't know of any expert, maybe there is one, but I have not heard of one or talked to one, who doesn't believe that the price of a barrel of oil will eventually increase over time because you have got two economies, India and China, drawing on a finite resource and that argues for long-term oil independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope some of us who are old enough to remember, don't want to repeat the mistakes of the '70s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What's your response to the recently released Obama campaign ad criticizing McCain for not supporting policies that require the U.S. government to buy American?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I will have to have my campaign respond. We don't really respond to their campaign ads. We just have other things to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: You've said a lot of nice things today about former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge. How much do you think he would help you out in Pennsylvania?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I think Tom Ridge is a national figure. As head of Homeland Security, he became well known to a lot of Americans. I think he would be a valuable contribution to any administration that I would be a part of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(McCain said the process to choose a vice president was ongoing and declined to discuss the viability of particular individuals as his running mate.)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anew McCain campaign ad shows pictures of wind-driven turbines while the narrator says: &quot;Renewable energy to transform our economy, create jobs and energy independence, that's John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, in fact, his energy plan doesn't specify any new federal spending for renewable energy and says only that he'd &quot;rationalize&quot; existing tax credits to provide incentives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, however, the Arizona Republican senator and Republican nominee-presumptive has opposed extending such tax credits when paid for by tax increases elsewhere. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad also insinuates that Illinois Sen. Barack Obama , his Democratic counterpart, would bring &quot;higher taxes&quot; for &quot;your family,&quot; another in what has become a pattern of misrepresentations of Obama's tax plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama actually proposes to cut taxes for all but the most affluent families. He wants to restore tax rates to pre-Bush levels only for those making over $250,000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign released its latest spot Aug. 6, criticizing Barack Obama for his stance on the Bush tax cuts and highlighting McCain's plans for &quot;renewable energy.&quot; The ad is running in &quot;key states,&quot; including Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His ads, including this one, have featured images of wind turbines, which, like solar, hydropower or biomass projects, tap energy sources that will never run out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain's energy plan and statements about such renewables are vague and left to interpretation. He's offered more specifics, and federal dollars, for nuclear power and &quot;clean coal&quot; technologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A McCain press release says that to develop these and other sources of renewable energy will require that we rationalize the current patchwork of temporary tax credits that provide commercial feasibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're not sure what &quot;rationalize the current patchwork of temporary tax credits&quot; means. And neither are wind or solar industry spokespeople.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frank Maisano, a spokesman for energy companies including utilities and wind, told us when we read that line from McCain's plan. &quot;It means that they don't want to tell people what that means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We asked the McCain campaign for clarification and whether the candidate had proposed any new federal spending for renewable energy (none is included in his plan).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain camp replied that the candidate has committed to a generous and reformed R&amp;D tax credit to spur innovation across industries, including the energy sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sounds like McCain supports long-term tax credits, something renewable energy advocates would welcome, though it's not something he has supported in the past -- even the very recent past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal investment tax credit, which provides incentives to businesses and individuals to invest in renewable energy, is set to expire at the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renewable energy groups have lobbied for passage of Senate measures that would have extended the credit for eight years, but the legislation has been blocked eight times by Republicans who object to other tax increases that would cover the cost of the credits. McCain, and Obama, missed the most recent vote on such legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's statements on &quot;rationaliz[ing] the current patchwork&quot; and establishing &quot;a regime of federal support that will remain predictable&quot; don't offer enough detail for renewable energy advocates to say what his proposals would accomplish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sara Birmingham, director of western U.S. policy at the Solar Alliance, a state-based advocacy group of solar industry companies, told us: &quot;We absolutely like longer predictability,&quot; but she couldn't really say how the group felt about McCain's proposal &quot;until we actually see what he has in mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monique Hanis, director of communications for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said: &quot;He really needs to fill in with specifics like what energy sources should be stimulated, what are his goals, what mix would he want to see by what timeframe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while the McCain camp didn't mention this in its back-up material for the ad, we also note that McCain supports a cap-and-trade program that would limit companies' greenhouse gas emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a plan could encourage corporations to invest in renewable energy by making the burning of coal, natural gas or petroleum more expensive. Obama also proposes a cap-and-trade program in a different form.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MADISON, Wis. -- A radio ad unveiled by Barack Obama's campaign invokes a signature American product -- Harley-Davidson motorcycles -- to criticize John McCain's economic policies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad blasts the Arizona senator for his long opposition to provisions that require government agencies to buy American-made goods. McCain has repeatedly said those provisions can't ensure taxpayers the best deal and restrict free trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad takes aim at McCain for opposing such a measure in a 2005 homeland security bill that required the Secret Service to purchase American-made motorcycles. Harley-Davidson is the market-leading U.S. motorcycle company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad features a clip of McCain speaking to thousands of motorcyclists in Sturgis, S.D., last week. McCain noted Obama's recent speech to an estimated 200,000 people in Berlin and then said, &quot;I'll take the roar of 50,000 Harleys any day!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But when it comes to his record, American-made motorcycles like Harleys don't matter to John McCain,&quot; a narrator says. &quot;Back in Washington, McCain opposed a requirement that the government buy American-made motorcycles. And he said all Buy American provisions were quote 'disgraceful.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Wisconsin audience: Obama campaign spokesman Phil Walzak said the ad was running on radio stations in Milwaukee and was the first of the general election campaign tailored to a Wisconsin audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This ad uses an American icon and a Milwaukee institution to demonstrate some of the differences in this campaign,&quot; he said. &quot;Sen. Obama believes that taxpayer dollars should be used to support American jobs and American companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad comes as Obama's double-digit lead in Wisconsin appears to be shrinking. The Democrat's most recent visit to the state was in June, while his Republican rival stopped here most recently in Racine two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's reaction: McCain's campaign stood by his 2005 description of the motorcycle provision on the Senate floor as &quot;gross examples of protectionist trade policy&quot; that cost taxpayers more money by restricting competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a budget watchdog group, said McCain's position does not mean he's against buying American. Critics who suggest otherwise &quot;don't think American companies can produce the best, most cost-effective products,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody who has ridden a Harley can say clearly they can compete&quot; with foreign firms for government business, he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a presidential campaign freighted with war, recession and energy woes, a jibe featuring Paris Hilton, of all things, seems to have struck a nerve in Democrat Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the second time in two weeks, he aired a TV ad Monday rebutting Republican John McCain's claim that Obama is little more than a celebrity, like the blonde hotel heiress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first time, Obama dismissed the assertion as &quot;baloney.&quot; On Monday, Obama took a different tack with a commercial that says McCain, not he, is &quot;Washington's biggest celebrity.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The back-and-forth may seem as frothy as a boardwalk milkshake in mid-August. But it suggests McCain is making some headway in trying to fight the campaign on his terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For weeks, Obama has tried to frame the election largely as a referendum on President Bush, using every chance to tie McCain to the unpopular incumbent. McCain has tried to make it about Obama by arousing concerns about the first-term senator's experience and depth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has aired a series of TV ads that showed far more images of Obama than himself, a somewhat risky approach. All of them tried to turn Obama's crowd-pleasing talents against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A July commercial blaming Obama for high gasoline prices which the watchdog group FactCheck.org called &quot;a tank full of nonsense&quot; portrayed crowds chanting Obama's name. A subsequent ad mixed images of Obama on his recent European trip with video clips of pop figures Hilton and Britney Spears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is &quot;the biggest celebrity in the world,&quot; the announcer said. &quot;But is he ready to lead?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even some Republican strategists questioned whether the strategy was smart or dignified. And Hilton herself produced a video poking fun at McCain that drew large Internet viewership. But Obama's latest ad suggests the &quot;celebrity&quot; taunt has some sting, and efforts to dismiss it as silly have not been effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They woke up this weekend and figured out that that ad resonated and they needed to do something about it,&quot; said Terry Holt, a Republican strategist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the McCain campaign was lampooned for its Hilton ad on late night television and blogs, it kept hammering at the celebrity theme. A McCain TV ad introduced last week showed Obama waving to cheering crowds, along with his picture on the covers of the magazines GQ, US Weekly and Vanity Fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his new ad, Obama tries to turn the celebrity theme to his advantage, grafting it to his claim that a McCain presidency would amount to a third term for Bush. That claim has generated a defensive response from McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain daily tries to beat back the idea that he'd represent a continuation of Bush, as he did Monday while campaigning in Erie and Harrisburg, Pa. Nearly 85 percent of Americans think the country is on the wrong track, McCain told workers at an Erie manufacturing facility, and &quot;we've got to reform and reform and reform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Obama&nbsp;ad shows McCain hugging Bush while the voiceover says, &quot;as Washington embraced him, John McCain hugged right back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokesman Bill Burton said the ad is designed to say voters have a choice between Obama, who stands for change, and McCain, &quot;who overwhelmingly favors the status quo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holt, the GOP strategist, said, &quot;If the celebrity issue were not hurting them, they would have ignored it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Obama adviser, who talked on background because he is not authorized to speak for the campaign, said the new Obama&nbsp;ad is meant mainly to poke fun at McCain because he is one of Washington's most celebrated and TV-friendly politicians, yet he is calling a relative newcomer a big celebrity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHN McCain's campaign is attempting to divert the real issues involved in the ongoing battle for the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are saying Obama and his camp are playing the race card. This is what right-wing Republicans do best. They use diversionary tactics to keep the masses distracted from focusing on the reasons why we're in the economic catastrophe we're now facing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration lets corporations like Exxon/Mobil raise gas prices so they can achieve the biggest quarterly profits in history. The working men and women of America again take it on the chin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a sad day when we have to make a choice over filling our gas tanks or filling our families' bellies. It is crucial that we stay focused on the real issues like the state of the economy and the fight for good jobs, and the health-care crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony Mastrome, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Philadelphia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Paris Hilton didn't enjoy celebrity, she wouldn't be offered perks such as $1 million just to attend an Australian millionaire's New Year's party, as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">New York Post's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Page Six reported in 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike Obama, McCain has not produced any commercials that are deceitful. In Obama's first campaign ad, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Wall Street Journal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> noted (June 26), &quot;Obama claims credit for having extended health care for wounded troops, citing the 2008 defense authorization. That bill passes 93-3, but Mr. Obama was one of only six senators who didn't show up to vote.&quot; In his next commercial, Obama lauded his support for welfare reform when in fact he opposed it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Edwards was considered egocentric when he decided he deserved to be president even though he decided not to run for re-election after his one term in the Senate. But he did finish his term. Obama had served a mere 142 days in the U.S. Senate when he started an &quot;exploratory committee&quot; for a run for the presidency. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayear ago, it was impossible to get through a day without some mention of Paris Hilton -- the ingenue famous mostly for being famous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, how we complained. Can't we please have just one day when we don't talk about Paris?! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then one day, America's prayers were answered. Not only did Hilton disappear, she vanished into a jail cell where she spent 22 days for violating parole. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When finally she did emerge, a repentant and humble Hilton claimed she had found God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not the same person I was,&quot; she averred. &quot;God has given me this new chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who knew God's messenger would be John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his recent ad trying to convey that Barack Obama is just another celebrity whose status is based on a thin resume, McCain effectively resurrected Hilton's career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Familiar to most by now, the ad shows Obama before a cheering crowd, then the camera pans to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. &quot;He's the biggest celebrity in the world, but is he ready to lead?&quot; asks the narrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Something about higher taxes and foreign oil got lost in the reaction to the ad's allegedly racist imagery. Apparently, a black male cannot be viewed in the same frame with white females without a suggestion of racist undertones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least that was my first response to the controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a white female, I saw the ad as simply dumb and beneath McCain. Too easy. Too cliched. We all get the celebrity bit. But upon further reflection, the ad was subliminally loaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a fact that few other faces -- black, white, male or female --are as well known as Hilton's and Spears'. It's also a fact that few celebrities, if any, are as comparably well-known for gaining their status without much resume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is a more important fact that the two ladies are perceived as being of questionable character. Their celebrity is based in part on their sexual displays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hilton's career was launched with a homemade porn movie. Spears is known to forget to wear undergarments in public. Their value as examples of celebrity is overshadowed by their sexual symbolism, in other words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first association upon viewing the ad might well be celebrity, but the second connection is surely sex. Despite racial progress in this country, the black man/white woman sexual taboo still burbles just beneath the surface of America's unconscious mind -- and easily roils to the top in some pockets where racism is still easily tapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did McCain intend it that way? My sense is no, owing to McCain's own profoundly painful experience with a similar tactic in 2000 when his daughter was the target of an ugly racist attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Push pollers placed calls in South Carolina saying that McCain's adopted daughter (from Bangladesh) was really his illegitimate black child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if baiting racists would win him the election, it is highly doubtful McCain would allow it. But he did allow this ad, which, at the very least, showed poor judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A subsequent Obama-celebrity ad is missing the missies, but the damage has been done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's&nbsp;ad, meanwhile, was a gift to Hilton. Her video rebuttal not only is more clever than McCain's original, but she manages to mock the elder statesman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seated on a chaise in bathing suit and gold heels, Hilton introduces herself: &quot;Hi, I'm Paris Hilton and I'm a celebrity, too. Only I'm not from the olden days and I'm not promising change like that other guy. I'm just hot.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because McCain put her in his ad, Hilton says she figures she must be running for president. So she presents her &quot;hybrid&quot; energy plan -- a combo of McCain's drilling and Obama's new technology. Something to tide us over until, you know, the problem's solved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unsolved problem for both McCain and Obama is they have too many people telling them what to do. Too many polls, managers and handlers later, they're losing their true selves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both were once unique in different ways. Mavericks in their own time, they were original men who each had transcended challenging circumstances, if of different orders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politics has become so shallow that a poor little rich girl, America's icon of shallowness, can spoof a war hero and veteran U.S. senator and make him seem silly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worse, Paris Hilton is back in the buzz.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who started it? That's what parents usually want to know when an argument breaks out among siblings. Everyone loses privileges but the instigator suffers most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So who started the latest dustup between the presidential candidates that has Paris Hilton inserting herself in the middle of the campaign?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's go to the videotape. In an ad that John McCain's campaign put up last week, Sen. Barack Obama is compared to Ms. Hilton and, in case people didn't get the point, her evil twin, Britney Spears. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's the biggest celebrity in the world,&quot; an announcer intones, making Mr. Obama the third of the trio. &quot;But is he ready to lead?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a world chock-full of cheesy celebrities, is it an accident that the two most intentionally vulgar, proudly promiscuous and artificially blonde were featured in this one? We'll have to ask the author. The ad ends with the voice of the Republican candidate for president. &quot;I'm John McCain and I approved this ad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama had the maturity not to respond. Not so Ms. Hilton, who took time out from her busy schedule of shopping, shopping and shopping to notice there was an election in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the help of glossy magazine publisher Jason Binn, she quickly filmed a response to Mr. McCain, whom she called a &quot;wrinkly, white-haired guy.&quot; In a cut-out swimsuit, lounging, pouting and posturing by a pool, she announced her plans to make America energy independent and to paint the White House pink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Team McCain couldn't have been happier. Two, two, two ads for the price of one. Now if they can only get Ms. Spears to take the bait. She's busy at the moment with a photo shoot swimming in a white bikini with the dolphins in Cabo, which she is selling to an unnamed tabloid for $1 million. Surely her agent is busy cobbling together her own riposte, which could double her fee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is part of the McCain effort to turn Mr. Obama's strength into a weakness, to make large crowds, intense supporters and excited young people bad. More deftly, Sen. Hillary Clinton tried to do the same thing with a hyperdramatic parody of Mr. Obama (celestial choirs will be singing and the heavens will open), but she didn't get two weeks of coverage from one end of cable and the Internet to the other out of it. That takes some trash talk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With all the noise Team McCain generated with the spot, it's hard to be heard on matters of substance. Perhaps that's why Mr. McCain, once a flyboy celebrity himself known for coming in near the bottom of his class and scoffing at rules, is trying to get some of the attention he darkly accuses Mr. Obama of having too much of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a rally of motorcyclists in Sturgis, S.D., Mr. McCain, keeping with his platinum-blonde theme, offered his wife up to the Harley-ites as a potential biker queen. He predicted she could win the contest famous for its competitors going topless and bottomless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as first lady and Miss Buffalo Chip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the middle of all this, it's hard to hear the debate, if there is one, over Afghanistan and Iraq, the subprime-mortgage crisis, or to take stock of the candidates' dueling energy policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latter has been drowned out by the effort to turn a suggestion by Mr. Obama that keeping tires properly inflated will save on gas into the equivalent of that hint from Homeland Security a few years ago in which citizens were advised to use plastic secured with duct tape to protect themselves in a terrorist attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's smart to use the one thing to attack the whole but not if your own side is advocating the one thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. McCain is handing out tire gauges to the press and offering them for a $25 donation on his Web site, the merits of keeping your tires inflated are being pushed by some of his closest allies: Florida Gov. Charles Crist, who's on Mr. McCain's list of potential vice presidential choices; by NASCAR, the race-car circuit, which his wife recently visited; by President Bush's Department of Transportation, which says that a little more air in your tires could save more oil in one year than new offshore drilling could produce in four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush Jr. may have gotten the idea from his dad, with whom Mr. McCain recently shared a golf cart; he advocated the same thing 18 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The combination of Paris, Britney and the tire gauges finally got Mr. Obama to snap back at Mr. McCain, something he usually avoids. After citing the widely known statistics on gas savings, Mr. Obama said, &quot;It's like these guys take pride in being ignorant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ignorance can be bliss when cable clocks hours retailing your ad and this and other columns devote inches to it. Let's hope the candidates' first joint appearance since the end of the primaries at Rick Warren's Saddleback Church this week yields more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until then, maybe Mr. McCain should listen to his mother, Roberta. They always talk straight and know who started it. When she was asked about the blonde girls spot, she brusquely labeled it &quot;kind of stupid.&quot; Moms always talk straight and they know who started it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People either old enough to know such things or those young enough to still have hope like to bombard you with statistics about why you should vote in the presidential election this November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their rhetoric doesn't seem to vary much, usually just a reference to John F. Kennedy's 1960 defeat of Richard Nixon, or maybe an urging about how important it is to &quot;rock the vote.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senators John McCain and Barack Obama both have amassed impressive credentials over the years, something commercials will surely remind us about in the next few months, but we're at the point of just treading water until the two debate. In the past few weeks, Obama has name-dropped Lil' Wayne (as a talented rapper, no less) and McCain joked about his opponent being &quot;Dr. No&quot; for not drilling in ANWR (that particular Bond reference is nearly 50 years old).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What matters here is that none of these things do. I love politics and look forward as much as the next guy to a new commander in chief who doesn't leave his final G8 summit by saying &quot;Goodbye from the world's biggest polluter&quot; with an alleged fist-pump. I mean, I even read the insufferable Charles Krauthammer. But when these candidates give speeches or answer questions about establishing a national language or how a &quot;gas tax holiday&quot; is a &quot;good&quot; idea, know that it's all silly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why I think it's OK most people don't vote. For example, I go to college, so I am shouted at daily to sign a petition, donate some money or register to vote. I am registered and do plan on casting my ballot for the first time come November, but I realize it bears little importance in the grand scheme of things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the harassing others do of uninformed and uninterested potential voters, it doesn't change the fact that our voices are rarely heard. To suggest in a nihilistic sense that few politicians care and the Electoral College is an antiquated idea is probably true, but not really my point. There's no gain for anyone by pushing someone who is apathetic toward voting. If differentiating between the candidates is difficult, something admittedly possible in 2004 but not so this year, then why subject yourself to looking for a voting booth?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to say politics can't be fun; the movies &quot;Predator&quot; and &quot;Stuart Saves His Family&quot; prove some of the many races are. Two stars from &quot;Predator,&quot; a movie about running through the jungle and shooting numerous rounds at an alien, have been elected governors in the United States. Jessie Ventura of Minnesota and Arnold Schwarzenegger from California were probably not the most qualified to do the job, but definitely the most intimidating. And now Sonny Landham, who had also appeared in the film, is aiming to represent Kentucky in the Senate. If elected, he would work alongside fellow Kentuckian Senator Jim Bunning, famous for throwing a perfect game with the Phillies as well as all that comes with being very Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A little more notorious is Al Franken, who played hapless loser Stuart Smalley on &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; The Harvard graduate is running for Senate in Minnesota, and seems to have a decent shot. Bill O'Reilly hates him, and that's important to many Democrats. He is not funny, but neither was Rick Santorum, so it hardly matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yep, this is a strange election. You should take part in history if you want to; or just go to class, work and nap on a Tuesday night. Both are equally American, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the Aug. 4 Ruth Ann Dailey column stating that &quot;the Democrats are playing &quot;the racist card&quot; (&quot;Race Card? What About the 'Racist Card'?&quot;), a closer look may be in order. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While talk radio and the Internet are not under the control of either party or candidate, they certainly have become vicious &quot;allies&quot; of the Republican candidate. An endless loop of blatant lies about race and religion relentlessly circulate to the detriment of the voter who might be seeking the truth. You can fault Barack Obama only for not being specific regarding the source of such racist innuendos and lies. He would not be &quot;without evidence to support the charge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subliminal messages conveyed by the juxtaposition of Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, various towers and an African-American man have been a common mechanism of destructive political campaigns for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Gergen, an adviser to one Democratic and three Republican presidents, got it right last weekend. He said, &quot;I think the McCain campaign has been scrupulous about not directly saying it, but it's the subtext of this campaign. Everybody knows that. There are certain kinds of signals. As a native of the South, I can tell you, when you see this Charlton Heston ad, 'The One,' that's code for, 'he's uppity, he ought to stay in his place.' ... When McCain comes out and starts talking about affirmative action, 'I'm against quotas,' we get what that's about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the upcoming debates, if Barack Obama is aggressive and brilliant will he be called &quot;uppity&quot;? Conversely, would he be weak and unpresidential if he were &quot;to stay in his place&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who believes race is not a potential make-or-break issue in this presidential race is delusional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a white American born, raised and educated in the deep South, I have been watching the presidential contest closely, especially in view of its historic inclusion of the first black candidate from a major party. Just recently, the role race will play became absolutely clear to me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I viewed for the first time the John McCain TV ad that was explained by Mr. McCain as questioning Barack Obama's substance. It purported that Mr. Obama is basically just a celebrity with no substance. To emphasize this, the ad pictures two celebrities who are vapid and troubled people. But did Mr. McCain select two celebrities who might to any degree be compared to Mr. Obama, such as Tiger Woods, Will Smith or some other black &quot;celebrity&quot;? No, instead the ad pictures two young white girls!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a Southerner, I thought that sent a clear message. The ad showed the pictures of the two white girls and then faded into the picture of Mr. Obama. Could the message to Southern whites have been clearer? The message being, here are these two pretty white girls whom we must protect from the big, black man Obama! Pure unadulterated &quot;race-baiting&quot;! That is the exact type of messages I saw repeatedly as I grew up in the pre- and post-civil rights law days in the Deep South. They were messages of fear and hatred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I now know who introduced race and played the race card -- it was John McCain, and in an overtly racist and bigoted manner at that! It is clear to me whom I will not vote for as I seek a united America -- united being the only way we can overcome the serious problems of the 21st century. I will not vote for John McCain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 200 local Democrats, dressed in hippie, casual, hip-hop or business attire, crammed into Obama campaign headquarters in Lancaster city Thursday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have to demean him,&quot; Mayor Rick Gray said, speaking of recent Republican attack ads aimed at Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential candidate. &quot;They have to reduce him to the lowest common denominator, because if they don't Barack Obama will be the next President of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Television advertisements by presumptive Republican nominee John McCain and the GOP have aired in recent weeks, often attacking Obama for lacking government experience and for a celebrity-like status at home and abroad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a study released last week by the University of Wisconsin, the media market in and around Harrisburg, including Lancaster, is among the top 10 targeted by both presidential candidates for television advertising. That underscores the region's importance to the Nov. 4 election, not only in Pennsylvania but in the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both campaigns see Pennsylvania ... in the sense that it's central to their path to the White House,&quot; said Chris Borick, a political science professor and pollster at Muhlenberg University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is coming to York County Tuesday, and a report from the Allentown Morning Call said he will be traveling with former Gov. Tom Ridge and that they will stop Tuesday in Lancaster, too. The McCain camp did not return messages seeking comment on this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain earlier this week predicted Pennsylvania, with its 21 electoral votes, would be not only a pivotal state in the election but the decisive state, the way Ohio was in 2004 and Florida in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win the White House, and Pennsylvania has more electoral votes than the other battleground states this year: Michigan, Ohio, Virginia and Colorado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between June 3 and July 26, the candidates and the Republican National Committee spent $10.3 million on television advertising in Pennsylvania, the most of any state and about $4 million more than second-place Ohio. The Democratic National Committee did not spend any money on television ads during the same time frame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can tell you from the attention we're getting from the national (Republican Party), we're absolutely one of the focuses, if not the focus of the entire nation,&quot; said Michael Barley, spokesman for the state Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abe Amoros, spokesman for the state Democratic Party, said Obama needs to spend millions on television advertising because he lost Pennsylvania's primary to Hillary Clinton in April by about 10 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The smart money always goes into television,&quot; Amoros said. &quot;It has an emotional impact as it connects to voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A breakdown in the number of commercials and where they air shows the geography of McCain and Obama's strategies. Philadelphia and its suburbs received the most ads of any region in the nation, a total of 3,311, according to the Wisconsin study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local media market ranks sixth overall with 2,519 advertisements, the study said. It is ahead of such pivotal regions as Columbus, Ohio; Denver, Colo., and Lansing, Mich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to pundits and party officials, Gov. Ed Rendell crafted a winning strategy in 2002 and 2006 by dominating the Philadelphia region, including the suburbs, where the number of Democrats has drastically increased, while performing poorly in the rest of the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's strategy, then, would be to weaken Obama's numbers in and around Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, while rallying a strong GOP turnout in the rest of the state - which pundits have taken to calling &quot;the T.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;T&quot; is roughly the shape of Pennsylvania minus the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh areas. It is considered Republican territory, and if McCain is to win Pennsylvania, he needs high voter turnout in this region, including Lancaster and the rest of the Harrisburg media market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain can't lose (the Philadelphia area) by 90,000 or 100,000 votes,&quot; said G. Terry Madonna, director of Franklin &amp; Marshall College's Center for Politics &amp; Public Affairs. &quot;If he loses it by 15,000 and keeps Obama down in the Pittsburgh region, McCain has a chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain needs incredible turnout,&quot; Borick said. &quot;He would have to have big victory margins in the T and big turnout, which is anything but certain given the conservatives' lukewarm reception for him. He's never been a darling of the conservatives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, all the ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tickets for McCain's town hall meeting will be available at Lancaster County Republican Committee headquarters between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. today and Monday. Headquarters is at 902 Columbia Ave., and the local GOP has only 1,000 tickets to give out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain event will be held Tuesday at the Toyota Center in the York Fairgrounds. Doors open at 9:45 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Thursday, the Obama campaign opened its local headquarters at 252 Harrisburg Ave. The telephone number is 606-9393.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Mary Lou Kelsey Lebanon Daily News</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMNISTS</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">837 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She wore an itsy bitsy, teeny weenie, yellow polka dot bikini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well perhaps it wasn't the itsy bitsy, teeny weenie, yellow polka dot bikini of lore. It was more of a leopard print bathing suit with lots of windows and lots of skin. The body inside that revealing suit was none other than Paris Hilton's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pig-tailed Paris was tastefully lying on a lounge chair reading a magazine, which is definite proof that Paris can read. She looked lovely. Her appearance on line was to make a tasteful rebuttal to John McCain's claim that Barack Obama is nothing more than a celebrity like Paris Hilton and Brittany Spears. The McCain&nbsp;commercial implied that Barrack was a publicity seeking celebrity and not ready to lead the country. When you think about it, you had better seek celebrity or no one will know who you are and you won't win the election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was surprised that Sen. McCain paid any attention to Brittany Spears and Paris Hilton. My husband doesn't even know who Hannah Montana is. He couldn't get her name in a crossword puzzle. That is being pretty far out of the loop. He began to pay more attention to the teen wonder kid when he found out her father is Billy Ray Cyrus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad caused a fervor. It even caused an on-air fight between McCain's campaign manager Rick Davis and MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell. Mr. Davis explained the purpose of the ad was to portray Obama as frivolous and irresponsible as Hilton and Spears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have no true favorites in this race. I did like Mike Huckabee. I didn't approve of his politics, but I thought he was darned funny. He amused me. The two chosen candidates on both sides of the aisle are not particularly amusing. In the beginning, the ad amused me, yet I began to have deeper thoughts. Don't you think the McCain campaign camp should stop reading People magazine and visiting celebrity blogs and spend more time on the issues? It gives me pause that a man who is president spends any of his time thinking about Paris Hilton and Brittany Spears</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do they actually watch the news shows or do they tune into &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;? Could it be possible that McCain's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spin doctors are trying to make their candidate seem younger and &quot;with it&quot; because he knows all about this young celebrity buzz?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris Hilton's grandfather, William Barron Hilton, co-chairman of the Hilton Hotel Empire, was not amused. He was upset with the comparison between his granddaughter and Barack Obama. I'm not sure how to take that. Was he angry because he thought Obama was far smarter than his granddaughter or was he upset because he thought his granddaughter was far smarter than Obama? They both get the same amount of press although in a celebrity poll Paris is watched more than Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic senator countered, &quot;The only way they figure we are going to win this election is if they make you scared of me. So they are saying, you know, we are not very good, but you can't risk electing Obama. You know. He is new, he doesn't look like any other president on the currency and, you know, he has a funny name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is way too many &quot;you knows.&quot; He sounds like a teenager. Besides, Paris Hilton wouldn't look bad on currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said that he was proud of the ad. &quot;I respect and admire Sen. Obama, but we have differences that need to be drawn.&quot; I imagine he respects Paris and Brittany too or he wouldn't have them in his commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At first Paris ignored the commercial. She then must have had second thoughts. If McCain considers her a celebrity, then go for the brass ring. In Paris' case it would be the platinum ring. Paris Hilton knows how to play the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She responded with a poolside spoof aired on the Web site, &quot;Funny or Die.&quot; &quot;Hello America. I am Paris Hilton and I am a celebrity too. Only I am not from the olden days. I am not promising change like that other guy. I'm just hot. But then that wrinkly white-haired guy used me in his campaign ad, which means I guess I am running for president. So thanks for the endorsement white-haired dude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want America to know that I'm, like, totally ready to lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She enters the debate on the energy crisis and suggests combining McCain's offshore drilling plan and Obama's incentives for new energy technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Energy crisis solved. I'll see you at the debates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She excuses herself by saying that she has to pick a vice president. Rihanna may be her choice. And then she ends her spoof with her ideas for the White House. &quot;I think I will paint it pink, if that's OK with you guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The satire concludes with the signature, &quot;I am Paris Hilton and I approve of this message. I think it is totally hot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I never thought I would agree with Paris Hilton, but I think it is totally hot too. Good for you, Miss Hilton. Let the candidates think about that. Paris you have chutzpah, a grand sense of humor and a wonderful publicist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have been hearing the promises of a fair campaign, which would include respectful ads. When does that part of the campaign begin? The closer these elections loom on the horizon, the closer the real circus is to coming to town.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris Hilton to the rescue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential campaign was starting to sound silly, what with John McCain's&nbsp;ad comparing rival Barack Obama's celebrity to the hotel heiress'.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When your famous face is exploited in a TV ad about high gas prices, what's a princess with a bottomless bank account to do? Hilton responded with her own </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">campaign</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;ad video. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lounging poolside in a swimsuit that wouldn't cover one of Gov. Rendell's thighs, she thanks &quot;that wrinkly white-haired guy&quot; for his endorsement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hilton's ad calls McCain &quot;the oldest celebrity in the world . . . old enough to remember when dancing was a sin.&quot; (Fact check: Abe Vigoda is way older.) &quot;I want America to know I'm, like, totally ready to lead,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hilton's platform - which sounds halfway sensible - combines McCain's plan for offshore oil drilling with Obama's emphasis on manufacturing hybrid vehicles. And repaint the White House a nice shade of pink. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hilton gave a needed tweak to a campaign drifting into petty sideshows. Her image may be shallower than a kiddie pool, but at least she understands the power of self-deprecating humor. Poking fun at himself was a McCain strength before he began behaving like a jilted suitor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's scary is that the most memorable ad of the presidential campaign so far belongs to a &quot;candidate&quot; best known for late-night partying and turning a chihuahua into a fashion accessory. Surely all those highly paid consultants in her rivals' campaigns can find a way to knock the wafer-thin heiress off message. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">NATIONAL Enquirer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inches closer to a Frances Quinn Hunter blood test - taken with a 200-foot needle aimed from a very steady helicopter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those of you who haven't been paying attention to Tattle or the (growing) handful of outlets who've picked up on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Enquirer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s story, Frances is reportedly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">John Edwards</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">' love child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Love child. Lust child. Whatever. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramping up its story from a mere hotel sighting to large hush-money payoffs, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Enquirer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is now running a photo of Edwards, wearing a &quot;baby&quot; blue T-shirt, holding Frances in a hotel room at the Beverly Hilton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tattle can't figure out where the photographer was to get the photo - in a potted plant? Coiled up in the mini-fridge? - but it's clearly Edwards and he's holding a baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tattle has held many babies we had not fathered - at least not to our knowledge - and it remains a possibility, albeit an ever-diminishing one, that Edwards and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rielle Hunter</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are just campaign buddies and his old paternal instinct kicked in when he saw the toddler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But come on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the photo and the hush-money allegations and the dwindling chance of a role in a possible </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration, it's time for Edwards to either publicly and unequivocally deny the whole thing and sue the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Enquirer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, tell a Clinton-esque lie - &quot;I did not . . . impregnate . . . that woman&quot; or make a YouTube video in which he kneels before </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Elizabeth</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and she beats the sanctimonious Ken doll stuffing out of him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Morgan to be a free man</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other marriage news, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Morgan Freeman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s is on the rocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With speculation high as to what he and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Demaris Meyer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were doing together in her 1997 Maxima when it somersaulted off Route 32 in rural Mississippi, Freeman's pal and business partner, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bill Luckett</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, told &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; that Morgan and his wife of 24 years, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Myrna Colley-Lee</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, &quot;are involved in a divorce action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For legal and practical purposes, [they] have been separated since December of 2007,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, that nosy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">National Enquirer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reported in its July 14 edition that Myrna had met with a divorce attorney because Morgan was cheating on her with a family friend. But according to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Enquirer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that friend was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">not</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Demaris Meyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retired policeman </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bill Rogers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who was the first person to arrive at the scene and seems to have more to say about it every day, said Tuesday that Freeman and Meyer were friends &quot;and she had offered him a ride home and she didn't really know the way and so he was going to drive the vehicle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rogers said that he talked to Freeman and Meyer to keep them conscious - something he was trained to do as a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said they were coming from Clarksdale,&quot; Rogers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freeman owns several businesses in Clarksdale, about 40 miles from his home, including the Ground Zero Blues Club and a restaurant named Madadi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Tattbits</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">* </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Lisa Marie Presley</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is expecting twins this fall, her spokeswoman, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Cindy Guagenti</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The daughter of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Elvis </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Priscilla Presley</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> announced her pregnancy on MySpace in March, saying that she was forced to go public after chunky photos of her taking up MoreSpace were ridiculed in the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lisa Marie, 40, married music producer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Michael Lockwood</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in January 2006. She has two children from her marriage to musician </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Danny Keough</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which ended in 1994. She was briefly married to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Michael Jackson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Nicolas Cage</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's her time to celebrate with her husband,&quot; Priscilla said Tuesday in an interview with &quot;Entertainment Tonight.&quot; &quot;My daughter is a very family girl. She loves children, and I know that she and Michael have been hoping for this for a long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that twins run in the family &quot;on Elvis' side, and on my side, too. I have twin brothers, and then, of course, Elvis had a twin brother [who died at birth].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Paris Hilton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> memorized her entire monologue, including her energy plan, in an online spoof posted on funnyordie.com, content director </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Amy Rhodes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-founder </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Adam McKay</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> came up with the concept for a mock ad starring Hilton, which has received over 3 million views since it was posted Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Adam thought it would be really funny to get Paris to respond to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">John McCain</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;ad that featured her,&quot; Rhodes told the Associated Press. &quot;Adam contacted Paris directly, and she agreed to do it. He wrote the sketch. And she really, really loved it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the video, Hilton - clad in a leopard-print swimsuit and heels while lounging poolside - announces her candidacy for president and suggests an energy plan that combines elements of McCain's offshore oil drilling plan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Barack Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s incentives for new energy technology. Her running mate? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rihanna</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want America to know that I'm, like, totally ready to lead,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hilton was not paid &quot;because she decided she just wanted to do it for fun,&quot; Rhodes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She may also have wanted to counter the misperception that when she first saw the McCain spot she wondered who the black guy was in her commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Californian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Matthew O'Sullivan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, identified as an employee of the company that makes &quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot; videos, has been arrested on charges that he groped a 20-year-old woman aboard a bus outside Nubar in Smithtown, N.Y.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot; held an event at Nubar Tuesday night. Afterward, the woman told police that she was invited onto the bus and subjected to &quot;unwanted sexual contact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She thought it was the &quot;Girls Gone Mild&quot; bus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Billboard.com reports that</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> Dr. Dre </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Drinks Americas will introduce Aftermath Cognac plus an 80-proof flavored and unflavored sparkling vodka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new drinks will hit stores the same time as Dr. Dre's long awaited album - &quot;Detox.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AW GEESH, AM I hallucinating or is Paris Hilton making sense? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not about running for president or painting the White House pink, should she get elected. I'm talking about the over-exposed celebutante's proposal to combine elements of both Sen. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">John McCain</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s and Sen. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Barack</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s energy plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a spoof of a campaign advertisement produced just days after McCain's now infamous Obama &quot;celebrity&quot; ad - the one that compared him to Hilton and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Britney Spears</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Hilton offers up a surprisingly sensible compromise on how to solve the current gas crisis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack wants to focus on new technology to cut foreign oil dependency and McCain wants off-shore drilling,&quot; says Hilton, as she lolls poolside in a low-cut leopard swimsuit and gold stilettos. &quot;Well, why don't we do a hybrid of both candidates' ideas?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can do limited off-shore drilling - with strict environmental oversight - while creating tax incentives to get Detroit making hybrid and electric cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That way, the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in, which will then create new jobs and energy independence. Energy crisis solved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm no expert on energy, but the bipartisan compromise she's come up with makes a whole lot of sense once you get past the shock that it comes from the pouty lips of Paris Hilton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, both presumptive presidential candidates have potentially workable ideas about how to get us out of this energy fix. For instance, Obama, wants to give American carmakers $4 billion in loans and tax credits to help build more fuel-efficient cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, McCain has proposed coming up with a $300 million award to encourage &quot;the development of a battery package that has the size, capacity, cost and power to leapfrog the commercially available plug-in hybrids or electric cars.&quot; At this point, why does it have to come down to either/or? Given the seriousness and the enormity of the energy situation, a little well-reasoned bipartisan cherry-picking makes sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And you thought Paris Hilton was just another Cristal-sipping, party girl with an X-rated sex tape floating around the Internet. Tsk, tsk. That's so not hot. It turns out that the Tinkerbell-toting, hotel heiress isn't living such a simple life after all and has at least a little more going for her than people think. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the very least you've got to give her credit for not getting another DUI and also for pulling off a clever little pushback at McCain, who she refers to in the ad as &quot;that wrinkly white-haired guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was McCain thinking when he decided to allow his folks to invoke the name Paris Hilton in a campaign ad anyway? Did he just want to be indelibly linked with Hilton and Spears in the public's mind? You know how it is when you start accusing folks. It has a way of indicting the indicter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, it just drags down the debate and trivializes the race. Hilton's spoof picks up on this and opens with a voiceover saying how McCain is &quot;like, super old. Old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket.&quot; Would she have even gone there if he hadn't, well, started it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Paris Hilton's ad will turn out to be the most memorable of the campaign,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Carrie Anna Criado</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Houston told me in e-mail yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Annie Wilson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a Washington, D.C.-based communications consultant, agreed. &quot;McCain clearly underestimated the power of a bikini-clad blonde bombshell with lots of money and even more time on her hands to hit back and let America know what's up. That's hot.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not since Iago and Othello obsessed on the comely Cassio, not since Richard of Gloucester killed his two nephews, not since Nixon and Johnson glowered at the glittering JFK, has there been such an unseemly outpouring of boy envy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Clinton, Jesse Jackson and John Edwards have all been crazed with envy over the ascendance of the new &quot;It&quot; guy, Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike his wife, Bill Clinton -- the master of fake sincerity -- still continues to openly begrudge his party's betrothed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by Kate Snow of ABC News in Africa whether Mr. Obama was ready to be president, Mr. Clinton gave a classic Clintonian answer: &quot;You could argue that no one's ever ready to be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As always, the Big Dog was more concerned with himself -- asserting that he's not a racist -- than his party. Bill Clinton is not a racist. We can posit that. But he did play subtle racial politics in the primary. It's way past time for him to accept the fact that there's a new wunderkind in town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as Bill Clinton looks at Mr. Obama and sees his own oblivion, so does Jesse Jackson. As Shelby Steele wrote in The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Jackson and his generation of civil rights leaders &quot;made keeping whites 'on the hook' the most sacred article of the post-'60s black identity,&quot; equality pursued by manipulating white guilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now John McCain is pea-green with envy. That's the only explanation for why a man who prides himself on honor, a man who vowed not to take the low road in the campaign, having been mugged by W. and Rove in South Carolina in 2000, is engaging in a festival of juvenilia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator who built his reputation on being a brave proponent of big solutions is running a schoolyard campaign about tire gauges and Paris Hilton, childishly accusing his opponent of being too serious, too popular and not patriotic enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even his own mother, the magical 96-year-old Roberta McCain, let slip that she thought the Hilton-Spears ad was &quot;kinda stupid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's 2000 strategist, John Weaver, was equally blunt with Newsweek's Jonathan Alter: &quot;It's hard to imagine America responding to 'small ball' when we have all these problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Mr. McCain's old pals in the Senate are cringing at what they see as his soulless transformation into what he once scorned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John's eaten up with envy,&quot; said one. &quot;His image of himself was always the handsome, celebrity flyboy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now somebody else is the celebrity,&quot; the colleague continued, while John looks in the mirror and sees his face marred by skin cancer and looks at the TV and sees his dashing self-image replaced by visions of William Frawley, with Letterman jokes about his membership in the ham radio club and adventures with wagon trains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. McCain, being cool meant being a rogue, not a policy wonk; but Mr. Obama manages to be a cool College Bowl type, which must irk Mr. McCain, who liked to play up his bad-boy cool. Now the guy in the back of the class is shooting spitballs at the class pet and is coming off as more juvenile than daring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around the McCain campaign, they grouse that Mr. Obama &quot;hasn't bled.&quot; He hasn't bled literally, in military service, just like W., the last holder of an E-ZPass who sped past Mr. McCain. And he hasn't paid his dues in the Senate, since he basically just stopped by for directions to the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a new senator, Mr. Obama was not only precocious enough to pounce on turf that Mr. McCain had invested years in, such as campaign finance lobbying, ethics reform and earmarks. When Mr. Obama did reach across the aisle for a mentor, it was to the staid Richard Lugar of Indiana, not to the salty Republican of choice for Democrats, Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Illinois freshman took back a private promise to join Mr. McCain's campaign finance reform effort, Mr. McCain told his aide Mark Salter to &quot;brush him back.&quot; Mr. Salter sent an over-the-top vituperative letter to Mr. Obama. &quot;I guess I beaned him instead,&quot; Mr. Salter told Newsweek's Howard Fineman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain could dismiss W. as a lightweight, but he knows Mr. Obama's smart. Mr. Obama wrote his own books, while Mr. McCain's were written by Mr. Salter. Mr. McCain knows he's the affirmative action scion of admirals who might not have gotten through Annapolis without being a legacy. Mr. Obama didn't even tell Harvard Law that he was black on his application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain upbraids Mr. Obama for being a poppet, while he's becoming a puppet. His mouth is moving but the words coming out belong to his new hard-boiled strategist, Steve Schmidt, a Rove protege, nicknamed &quot;The Bullet&quot; for his bald pate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Schmidt has turned Mr. Straight Talk into Mr. Desperate Straits. It's not a good trade.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris Hilton wants American voters to know she's &quot;totally ready&quot; to lead the country, even though she'll have to wait a few years to run for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The socialite and pop personality has fired back at Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain's use of her image in an ad comparing the worldwide celebrity of his Democratic presidential rival, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, with that of the Hilton Hotel chain heiress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tongue in cheek, Ms. Hilton tweaks both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama in the video done for the comedy Web site funnyordie.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a celebrity too, only I'm not from the olden days, and I'm not promising change like that other guy -- I'm just hot,&quot; Ms. Hilton, sitting poolside and clad in a leopard-print swim suit, says in her video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But then, that wrinkly, white-haired guy used me in his campaign ad, which I guess means I'm running for president. So thanks for the endorsement, white-haired dude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She later presents her own energy proposal, a hybrid of Mr. McCain's offshore oil drilling plan and Mr. Obama's incentives for new energy technology. &quot;Energy crisis solved! I'll see you at the debates,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's&nbsp;ad, which raised the ire of the Obama campaign, juxtaposed pictures of the crowd that the Democratic senator drew for a speech in Berlin with images of Ms. Hilton and another celebrity icon, singer Britney Spears. The narrator asked whether Mr. Obama was &quot;ready to lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hilton ad turns that same line against Mr. McCain, while also getting in a jab at the Republican senator's age, 71: &quot;He's the oldest celebrity in the world, like super-old -- old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket,&quot; the narrator says at the start. &quot;But is he ready to lead?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the video airs images of Mr. McCain with, among others, Yoda from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie series. &quot;I want America to know that I'm, like, totally ready to lead,&quot; Ms. Hilton announces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She actually won't be ready until the 2016 election. Now 27, she doesn't meet the constitutional requirement that the president be at least 35 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds responded by saying of Ms. Hilton's video, &quot;Paris Hilton might not be as big a celebrity as Barack Obama, but she obviously has a better energy plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain is continuing to press the fame theme in attacking Mr. Obama. In an ad the campaign released yesterday, an announcer calls Mr. Obama &quot;the biggest celebrity in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Hilton's mother, Kathy Hilton, criticized the original McCain&nbsp;ad, writing Aug. 3 on a liberal-leaning website, huffingtonpost.com, that it was &quot;a complete waste of the money John McCain's contributors have donated to his campaign.&quot; Federal Election Commission records show that Kathleen Hilton and her husband, Richard, have donated $4,600, the maximum allowable individual contributions, to Mr. McCain's White House bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comparison between Ms. Hilton and Mr. Obama isn't original with the GOP contender. In December 2004 at the annual Gridiron Club dinner in Washington, Mr. Obama made light of the attention he was getting then and compared himself to Ms. Hilton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Andy Warhol said we all get our 15 minutes of fame,&quot; Mr. Obama said after he won a Senate seat, according to a Washington Post account. &quot;I mean, I'm so overexposed, I'm making Paris Hilton look like a recluse.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Barack Obama a &quot;celebrity&quot; along with being the Democratic nominee-presumptive? Count on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is his Republican counterpart John McCain taking advantage of his opponent's more-than-a-politician paparazzi appeal? You bet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sub-layer of attack ads will, alas, be with us until the votes are counted in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Paris Hilton -- she of fame-for-whatever -- joining the YouTube-driven campaign fray that more resembles a People magazine promotion than a political campaign, all bets are off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns, desperate to find an escape route from attack ads (both had, if memory serves, promised a high-minded, non-personal campaign), now seem to have settled on a common issue of contention: energy -- more specific, oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama claims, wrongly, that McCain is in the pocket of &quot;Big Oil.&quot; McCain claims, wrongly, that Obama plans an increased tax on electric power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both are barking up the right tree, but backwards. Before anyone takes on &quot;Big Oil&quot; for &quot;obscene&quot; profits, consider: 98.5 percent of shares in publicly traded oil industry companies are held in asset management groups such as pension and mutual funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means money in the bank -- or at least in their retirement fund for millions upset at the price of gasoline and diesel fuel. A quick check of one's retirement plan can be eye-opening, even as you're filling your gas tank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What to do about fuel prices? The to-drill or not-to-drill question seems to have worn out its welcome for both campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain wants offshore drilling to resume, but not drilling in the ANWR wildlife reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, at first recoiling from the more-drilling concept, this week says it might be part of an overall plan to ease dependence on foreign oil. But he wants the main drive to be on renewable energy resources and dramatically hiking research funding to that end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Olympic fever in the air, both campaigns are tip-toeing around serious foreign policy disputes, even as host country China continues to muzzle dissidents and restrict global reporting on the games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead it's regroup time on both sides with the Democratic National Convention set to convene in Denver Aug. 25 and the Republicans' gathering set for the following week in Minneapolis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time now for the &quot;softer&quot; political murmurings about who will be the nominees' choices for No. 2 spots on the ticket and the spot-feeding of speculations from both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a welcome calm just before the post-convention storm, sure to hit with a vengeance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">657 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign of Sen. Barack Obama released a TV spot claiming Arizona Sen. John McCain's campaign got $2 million from &quot;Big Oil&quot; while McCain proposed &quot;another $4 billion in tax breaks&quot; for the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth is that McCain's campaign has received $1.33 million from individuals employed in the oil and gas industry, not $2 million. Obama himself has received nearly $400,000, according to the most authoritative figures available. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FactCheck.Org finds the $2 million figure based on a mistaken calculation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, McCain is not proposing new tax breaks specifically targeted to the oil industry. He's proposing a general reduction in the corporate income tax rate, which Democrats figure would benefit the five largest oil and gas companies by $3.8 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The core claim of the Obama&nbsp;ad is that McCain accepted $2 million in campaign contributions from &quot;Big Oil&quot; and is &quot;in the pocket&quot; of the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's certainly true that McCain gets far more money from donors in the oil and gas industry than Obama does. And there's no question that McCain's recent support for expanding offshore drilling is a position that the industry favors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the $2 million figure is inflated. According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics which both campaigns cite as authoritative from time to time McCain had received $1,332,033 from persons in the oil and gas industry (both directly and through company-sponsored political action committees), not $2.1 million as the Obama campaign claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are the most recent and authoritative figures available and are based on reports on file at the Federal Election Commission as of July 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign said it cobbled together its $2.1 million figure by adding one total from a report in The Washington Post, which said oil and gas donors gave $1.1 million to McCain in June, and an older total from CRP, which put the McCain campaign's total at just over $1 million through May 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that turns out to be adding apples to oranges, and it does not give an accurate figure for money that went directly to &quot;John McCain's campaign,&quot; as the ad puts it. Much of the money given in June went to a joint fundraising venture of the McCain campaign, the Republican National Committee and several state GOP committees, an unknown portion of which was passed through to the McCain campaign itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We judge the $1.3 million figure from the Center for Responsive Politics, which includes any money transferred to McCain's campaign, to be the most authoritative tally of oil and gas donations to the campaign. And we conclude that the $2 million figure in Obama's&nbsp;ad is the result of counting some donations raised during June that actually went elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It bears repeating, as we've reminded readers before, that oil companies themselves don't make donations. It's illegal under federal law for corporations to donate directly to candidates and has been since 1918.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad refers to donations from executives and employees of oil companies, given either directly or through company-sponsored political action committees, or PACs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates accept donations from individual employees of oil companies. In fact, when Obama claimed in an ad last March that &quot;I don't take money from oil companies,&quot; we criticized him for being a little too slick. The CRP puts Obama's total from oil and gas donors at $394,465.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on CRP's figures, McCain's oil and gas donations account for just 0.9 cents out of every $100 he's raised. Obama's oil and gas total comes to 0.1 cents per $100. That's a significant difference between the two candidates, and it's clear that the industry is favoring McCain with its donations. Whether that puts him &quot;in the pocket&quot; of the industry is a judgment we'll leave to our readers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Near the end of a virtual town-hall meeting last night with suburban Philadelphia voters, conducted by telephone, Republican presidential candidate John McCain got a question that went right to the heart of the matter.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman who identified herself as Sally from Mortonville, Chester County, said she had once favored Democrat Barack Obama but was now confused about whom to vote for. Make your case, she told McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator replied that the distinctions between himself and Obama basically came down to &quot;how we view the role of government.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He mentioned their differences on the Iraq war. Then he noted the likely vacancies to come on the U.S. Supreme Court and talked about appointing justices &quot;who are qualified but also strictly interpret the Constitution.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All that was good enough to close the deal, Sally said, and McCain thanked her once, then again as he signed off. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every vote counts,&quot; said the candidate, who was calling in from West Virginia, &quot;and I'm glad I got one tonight, in Sally.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For 45 minutes last night, McCain talked via conference call with a number of Southeastern Pennsylvania voters, all of them chosen, according to his campaign, because they are registered as independents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his opening remarks, he talked about energy, Iraq, and the importance of Pennsylvania in electoral calculus. In responding to questions from eight of the voters on the call, he talked about education, partisanship, Social Security and Medicare, and the danger sometimes posed by products imported from other countries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When a toy with arsenic in it comes in from China,&quot; McCain said, referring to a controversy that erupted last year, &quot;I think that should be the last toy.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while calling for tougher enforcement of trade agreements, he reiterated his support for expanded international commerce, noting that exports were one of the few bright spots in the current U.S. economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In answer to a question on energy conservation, McCain toned down the ridicule he has heaped on Obama in the last week, ever since the Democrat said that properly inflated tires could save as much gas as would be produced by expanded off-shore drilling - which McCain advocates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't disagree with that; the American Automobile Association strongly recommends it,&quot; McCain said of proper tire inflation. &quot;But I also don't think that's a way to become energy-independent.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference call was part of the concerted effort McCain has made this summer to make inroads in Pennsylvania. The state voted Democratic in the last four presidential elections, but Obama lost the April primary to Hillary Rodham Clinton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who was in Montgomery County on Monday, has made numerous visits to the state over the last two months, with more expected, and has spent heavily on television commercials.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an effort to cast himself as independent of the influence of money on politics, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama often highlights the campaign contributions of $200 or less that have amounted to fully half of the $340 million the Democratic presidential contender has collected so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But records show that one-third of his record-breaking haul has come from donations of $1,000 or more -- a total of $112 million, more than Arizona Sen. John McCain, Mr. Obama's Republican opponent, or New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, his chief rival in their party's primaries, raised in contributions of that size. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind those larger donations is a phalanx of more than 500 Obama &quot;bundlers,&quot; fundraisers who have each collected contributions totaling $50,000 or more. Many of the bundlers come from industries with critical interests in Washington. Nearly three dozen of the bundlers have raised more than $500,000 each, including more than a half-dozen who have passed the $1 million mark and one or two who have exceeded $2 million, according to interviews with fundraisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While his campaign has cited its volume of small donations as a rationale for his decision to opt out of public financing for the general election, Mr. Obama has worked to build a network of big-dollar supporters from the time he began contemplating a run for the U.S. Senate. He tapped into well-connected Chicagoans prior to the 2004 Senate race, and, once elected, set out nationwide to cultivate some of his party's most influential money collectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He courted them with the savvy of a veteran politician, through phone calls, meals and one-on-one meetings; he wrote thank-you cards and remembered birthdays; he sent them autographed copies of his book and doted on their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His efforts have put Mr. Obama's major donors on a pace that almost rivals the $147 million raised by President Bush's network of Pioneers and Rangers in contributions of $1,000 or larger during the 2004 primary season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given his decision not to accept public financing, Mr. Obama is counting on his bundlers to help him raise $300 million for his general-election campaign and another $180 million for the Democratic National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis of campaign finance records shows that about two-thirds of his bundlers are concentrated in four major industries: law, securities and investments, real estate and entertainment. Lawyers make up the largest group, numbering roughly 130, with many of them working for firms that also have lobbying arms. At least 100 Obama bundlers are top executives or brokers for investment businesses: Nearly two dozen work for financial titans like Lehman Bros., Goldman Sachs or Citigroup. About 40 others are in real estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest fundraisers include people like technology executive Julius Genachowski, a former Federal Communications Commission senior official; Robert Wolf, president and chief operating officer of UBS Investment Bank; James A. Torrey, a New York hedge fund investor; and Charles H. Rivkin, chief executive of an animation studio in Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The care and feeding that top Obama fundraisers have received underscores their significance to his campaign. Members of his National Finance Committee who raise at least $250,000 are being rewarded with trips to the party's national convention in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many fundraisers sit on the campaign's policy working groups, getting a chance to weigh in on policy positions and speeches. Mr. Genachowski, a Harvard Law School classmate of Mr. Obama, leads the technology working group. Fundraisers from private equity and hedge funds sit on Mr. Obama's economic policy group.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to Michelle Malkin's Aug. 4 column (&quot;Obama's pop-star presence&quot; and PghTrib.com): Her opinion was sour grapes and, quite frankly, stupid (using Malkin's favorite word).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama is brilliant. What he doesn't know he will learn or find out. He has the brains and the means to be the most outstanding president this nation has ever had. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as magazines and cheap tabloids flashing the Obama family's pearly white smiles and Barack's bare chest, who cares! Do you honestly think the majority of the American people are eating that stuff up? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't credit the attention of media material regarding Obama and his family solely to the Obama campaign and the senator himself. Any candidate for the presidency is food for a media feeding frenzy and money for sales and ratings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it fair to discredit Obama for the poor quality of print media today? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American media have changed drastically. They have fallen into the trap of believing that Americans want gossip and juicy personal details about the lives of the rich and famous. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most recent McCain&nbsp;ad pairing Obama with Paris Hilton and the likes is pitiful. It portrays Obama as a celebrity. Yes, to those who support Obama he is indeed a &quot;celebrated person.&quot; It's unfortunate Sen. McCain and his advisers don't know the definition of &quot;celebrity.&quot; It makes the McCain people look a little less than smart. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is my candidate because of who he is, what he stands for and what he has to offer -- not because I like his pearly white smile and the way he looks in his swim trunks.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are a mixed society that knows how to filter out the fluff and examine the real stuff. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's 23-year-old Bill Coder of Lancaster, who's taking over a position left vacant since May, when Andrew Heath left to work with Anne Beiler of Auntie Anne's Pretzels. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill has a very high level of enthusiasm for the job, Lancaster GOP Chairman Dave Dumeyer said. He's worked in areas having to deal with financial services, and I think that will have a payoff to help us continue to find ways to raise money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with a presidential election less than 100 days away, Coder said one of his first jobs will be firing up core Republican voters for GOP nominee John McCain, even the younger ones who may be leaning toward Democrat Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my current role as chairman of the (Lancaster) Young Republicans, I know for a fact firsthand the youth is excited about Senator McCain, also, Coder said, pointing to McCain's platform on higher education as an example of the Arizona senator's appeal to younger voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has proposed an unspecified expansion of federal and state lender-of-last-resort education programs as he expects the credit crunch will make private loans harder to obtain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need a president and a party that's going to be proactive in finding positive solutions, Coder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coder previously worked for Union National Community Bank as a personal financial specialist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His involvement with the local GOP is extensive, having served as chairman of the Lancaster County Young Republicans, co-chair of the GOP Voter Registration Committee, an at-large executive board member of the Pennsylvania Federation of Young Republicans and a Lancaster city committeeman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if Coder's schedule wasn't full enough, he's married and a senior at Lancaster Bible College with a dual major in Bible and pastoral studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I thought he's always been upbeat, and I like that about him, Dumeyer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coder's duties as executive director will be to assist Dumeyer in fundraising activities, running day-to-day operations at GOP headquarters along Columbia Avenue and providing support for the area Republican committees. Coder would not say if he planned to remain as chairman of the Lancaster Young Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No doubt about it, it's a hard job, Coder said. It's a job that's going to require 150 percent of your time and effort. But working as a financial specialist with Union National, it's given me insight in the business end of things.</SPAN></P>

He complained of copyright infringement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His cease-and-desist letters, addressed to the candidate, were obtained by this column's investigative unit. Obviously, his identity could not be fully verified by deadline yesterday: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To the Honorable Sen. John McCain, hapless tool of the Republican corporatist machine and inadvertent blasphemer of all that Christian fundamentalists hold sacred:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please allow me to introduce myself. For security reasons, I can only give you the titles I'm known by in sacred literature. I'm the Beast, the Angel of the Bottomless Pit, the Adversary, Damien, the Man of Sin, the Son of the Morning, the Ultimate Scofflaw and the Antichrist(TM) 666.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has come to our attention as we prepare your world for the Great Tribulation that will follow the eight years of plagues and locusts of the Bush Tribulation Cycle that one of our innovative political spots -- specifically the Internet ad campaign 'The One' -- has been appropriated by your admirably nefarious political operation and remixed for domestic consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While we admire your impeccable taste for what fools most Americans all of the time, we can't allow you to continue satirizing a perfectly fine messiah-in-waiting campaign designed to eventually spotlight my own virtues when the Beast shall be revealed. You cheapen the dignity of the Real Antichrist(TM) 666 by ascribing my infernal presumption to this earnest babbler, Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the American public is to respect and fear me when I finally appear on the scene, they mustn't be confused with this blasphemy that I'm a black guy with a funny name. You're ruining my 4,000-year-old brand with this nonsense. Stop at once, or suffer the consequences</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very truly yours,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Real Antichrist(TM) 666&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dear John McCain, dupe of forces he can't begin to understand:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Salutations from the Son of Perdition, the Wicked Man, the Mighty One and Gregory Peck's vile spawn (but much handsomer).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hear that two of my former demoniacs now work for your campaign. That explains a lot. Alex Castellanos, who did such great work for the late Sen. Jesse Helms on his racist 'white hands' ad and Steve Schmidt, the most promising of Karl Rove's evil disciples, are crafting the kind of campaign you once swore you'd never run. Schmidt is credited with creating 'The One' spot that has done so much to hold the office of Antichrist up to ridicule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Judging by your pithy and sarcastic response to my last letter ('Get off of my lawn, Antichrist'), you are under the delusion that you are some sort of Straight Talker and not a despicable mountebank who lost his way a long time ago. How interesting that you're now in league with people who once humiliated you and nearly broke your spirit eight years ago with dark rumors and slanders in the South Carolina primary. You've forgiven them because you want to be president more than you want to retain any semblance of dignity. That's a quality the Real Antichrist(TM) 666 can respect in an ambitious politician. You'll all bend a knee to me when the time comes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that I know that Schmidt smuggled the plans for 'The One' campaign from under our noses here at Antichrist Central Command, we shall enact stricter inventory controls to curtail future thefts of ideas. For the record, the commercial your campaign has created makes me want to vomit, though I can see why its crude humor appeals to America's jaded political class. The masses are way too dumb to 'get' that you're mocking them as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Still, I'm dying to know: How do you expect to get the majority of Americans to vote against the Antichrist if they believe that Obama is 'The One' and that his election will usher in Christ's Second Coming? Isn't it in their religious interest to vote for Barack in much the same way that they uncritically support Israel -- to force a confrontation with Arabs and spark Armageddon and Christ's return?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Am I talking over your head, Sir?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sincerely,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Little Horn and the Prince Who Shall Come&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dear John:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How I love a cynic. Your response indicates you don't believe any of this business and that this is all about playing the Antichrist Card for the credulous. If it didn't involve slandering me, I could almost respect it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One day soon, we'll both look back on this gambit of yours and laugh. I suspect I shall laugh louder, though.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cheers,</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gee, I wonder why, if you have a black man running for high public office -- say, Barack Obama or Harold Ford -- the opposition feels compelled to run low-life political ads featuring tacky, sexually provocative white women who have no connection whatsoever to the black male candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spare me any more drivel about the high-mindedness of John McCain. You knew something was up back in March when, in his first ad of the general campaign, Mr. McCain had himself touted as &quot;the American president Americans have been waiting for.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was nothing subtle about that attempt to position Mr. Obama as the Other, a candidate who might technically be American but who remained in some sense foreign, not sufficiently patriotic and certainly not one of us -- the &quot;us&quot; being the genuine red-white-and-blue Americans who the ad was aimed at.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, Mr. McCain has only upped the ante, smearing Mr. Obama every which way from sundown. Last Wednesday, The Washington Post ran an extraordinary front-page article that began:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For four days, Sen. John McCain and his allies have accused Sen. Barack Obama of snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him, despite no evidence that the charge is true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence? Mr. McCain needs no evidence. His campaign is about trashing the opposition, Karl Rove-style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not satisfied with calling his opponent's patriotism into question, Mr. McCain added what amounted to a charge of treason, insisting that Mr. Obama would prefer that the United States lose a war if that would mean that he -- Mr. Obama -- would not have to lose an election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, from the hapless but increasingly venomous McCain campaign came the slimy Britney Spears and Paris Hilton ad. The two highly sexualized women (both notorious for displaying themselves to the paparazzi while not wearing underwear) are shown briefly and incongruously at the beginning of a commercial critical of Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee targeted Harold Ford with a similarly disgusting ad in 2006 when Mr. Ford, then a congressman, was running a strong race for a U.S. Senate seat in Tennessee. The ad, which the committee described as a parody, showed a scantily clad woman whispering, &quot;Harold, call me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both ads were foul, poisonous and emanated from the upper reaches of the Republican Party. (What a surprise.) Both were designed to exploit the hostility, anxiety and resentment of the many white Americans who are still freakishly hung up on the idea of black men rising above their station and becoming sexually involved with white women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racial fantasy factor in this presidential campaign is out of control. It was at work in that New Yorker cover that caused such a stir. (Mr. Obama in Muslim garb with the American flag burning in the fireplace.) It's driving the idea that Mr. Obama is somehow presumptuous, too arrogant, too big for his britches -- a man who obviously does not know his place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has to endure these grotesque insults with a smile and heroic levels of equanimity. The reason he has to do this -- the sole reason -- is that he is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So there he was last week speaking evenly, and with a touch of humor, to a nearly all-white audience in Missouri. His goal was to reassure his listeners, to let them know he's not some kind of unpatriotic ogre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama told them: &quot;What they're going to try to do is make you scared of me. You know, he's not patriotic enough. He's got a funny name. You know, he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills, you know. He's risky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The audience seemed to appreciate his comments. Mr. Obama was well-received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. McCain didn't appreciate them. RACE CARD! RACE CARD! The McCain camp started bellowing, and it hasn't stopped since. With great glee bursting through their feigned outrage, the campaign's operatives and the candidate himself accused Mr. Obama of introducing race into the campaign -- playing the race card, as they put it, from the very bottom of the deck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever you think about Mr. Obama, he does not want the race issue to be front and center in this campaign. Every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for Mr. McCain. So I guess we understand Mr. McCain's motivation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, it's frustrating to watch Mr. McCain calling out Mr. Obama on race. Mr. Obama has spoken more honestly and thoughtfully about race than any other politician in many years. Mr. McCain is the head of a party that has viciously exploited race for political gain for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's obviously more than willing to continue that nauseating tradition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the politics of energy shifting as rapidly as gasoline prices, Democrats -- led by their presidential candidate, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama -- are retreating from long-held positions and scrambling to offer distressed voters more immediate relief from spiraling costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change has been most striking on the campaign trail, where Mr. Obama said in a speech yesterday that he would abandon his past position and support tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to cut prices quickly at the gasoline pump. His campaign later released a statement warning that the &quot;doubling of oil prices in the past year is a crisis for millions of Americans.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's reversal on tapping the national stockpile of crude oil comes just days after he said, for the first time, that he would agree to some offshore drilling as part of a broader energy-policy compromise with Republicans -- including the GOP presidential candidate, Arizona Sen. John McCain, who has supported additional drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those shifts by Mr. Obama are indicative of the pressure that politicians of both parties -- but especially Democrats -- are under to develop specific, short-term energy proposals in the face of rising costs. Against that backdrop, politicians risk looking insensitive if they tout only solutions that could take years to hit the pump, such as Mr. Obama's plan for developing hybrid cars that can travel 150 miles on a gallon of gasoline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans, too, have responded to such pressures. Mr. McCain only recently endorsed expanding offshore oil drilling, embracing a pro-production GOP principle that he had previously opposed. And in Florida, where offshore drilling has been anathema, Gov. Charlie Crist has dropped his stalwart opposition to such exploration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That jockeying reflects a shift in public opinion that has upended policy debates as gas prices have soared and the economy has soured. In California, a hotbed of opposition to offshore drilling, a poll last month by the Public Policy Institute of California showed that 51 percent of respondents favoring more drilling -- up 10 percentage points since July 2007, and the first time since the question was first posed in 2003 that more Californians favor offshore drilling than oppose it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is just a frank reality: We have to do something,&quot; said University of South Florida political scientist Susan MacManus. &quot;People have had to make some drastic changes in their own life, so they are ready to see the government make some choices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political scramble over energy policy has also been evident on Capitol Hill. Even though Congress is in recess for a month, Republicans have been staging a protest on the House floor to spotlight a decision by Democratic leaders to put off a vote on energy legislation until lawmakers return in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain chimed in yesterday, calling for Democrats to suspend the vacation until Congress addresses the energy crisis. &quot;Congress should come back into session,&quot; he said during a campaign stop in Lafayette Hill, Pa., a Philadelphia suburb. &quot;I am willing to come back off the campaign trail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just a few days ago, a bipartisan coalition of senators responded to public pressure to produce results, not just rhetoric, on rising gas prices: They endorsed a compromise that would expand availability of alternative fuels and preserve the oil-drilling ban off the West Coast, while easing restrictions off the East Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show that alarm over rising fuel costs and the economic downturn are voters' top concerns, and aides to Mr. McCain believe that he is whittling into Mr. Obama's support by highlighting their differences on how best to cut prices, conserve resources and cut dependence on foreign oil sources. Mr. McCain today will visit the Enrico Fermi nuclear plant in Newport, Mich., to demonstrate his support for greater reliance on nuclear-generated electrical power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As recently as last month, Mr. Obama said the Strategic Petroleum Reserve should not be touched, except in an emergency. Now, his campaign is saying a tipping point has been reached, and he is calling for releasing light crude oil, which is easier to refine into gasoline, and replacing it later with heavier crude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's new position is politically advantageous, with its explicit promise of short-term help at the pump. In his speech, he noted that, in the past, tapping the reserve has driven down gas prices in as little as two weeks. In 2000, then-President Bill Clinton used a similar tactic to make oil available at a time of rising prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign quickly pounced yesterday, calling Mr. Obama's shift another example of his willingness to sacrifice principle for political gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tapping the strategic oil reserve is not a substitute for a real plan to increase supply through additional drilling and nuclear power,&quot; McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said in a statement. &quot;The strategic oil reserve exists for America's national security strategy -- not Barack Obama's election strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's new position also aligns him with the House Democratic leadership. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., sent President Bush a letter last month asking him to expand oil supplies by drawing down the reserve, and Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has tried to reach agreement on legislation requiring the release of 70 million barrels of oil from the government stockpile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as Mr. Obama adjusts his position to account for fast-moving economic and political realities, he is taking the offensive. He released a campaign ad yesterday criticizing Mr. McCain for accepting contributions from oil executives while supporting policies favorable to the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign accused Mr. Obama of hypocrisy. &quot;Not mentioned&quot; in the ad, a McCain spokesman said in reply, is the &quot;$400,000 from big oil contributors that Barack Obama has already pocketed in this election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan government watchdog group, said the Obama campaign has received about $400,000 donations from oil and gas company executives and employees and their family members.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">681 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anew ad by Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, calls Sen. Barack Obama, his presumed Democratic opponent, a celebrity (true) who says he'll raise taxes on electricity (false).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's new ad claims that Obama &quot;says he'll raise taxes on electricity.&quot; That's false. Obama says no such thing. McCain relies on a single quote from Obama who once -- and only once so far as we can find -- suggested taxing &quot;dirty energy,&quot; including coal and natural gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was in response to a reporter's suggestion that a tax on wind power could fund education. Obama isn't proposing any new tax on electricity or &quot;dirty energy&quot; as part of his platform, and he never has. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true that a coal/gas tax would raise electric rates, but so would a cap-and-trade program to restrict carbon emissions. Cap-and-trade is an idea that both McCain and Obama support, in different forms. Neither candidate characterizes cap-and-trade as a &quot;tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain once again goes after Barack Obama in a new television ad titled &quot;Celeb,&quot; airing on a few national networks and in 11 &quot;key states,&quot; according to the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad opens with shots of massive crowds shouting Obama's name. As the female announcer informs us that &quot;he's the biggest celebrity in the world,&quot; the camera cuts to quick images of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcer then asks whether Obama is ready to lead before informing us that Obama opposes offshore drilling and &quot;says he'll raise taxes on electricity.&quot; The cheering crowds are replaced by ominous music as the suddenly serious announcer intones, &quot;Higher taxes. Foreign Oil. That's the real Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was Obama talking about with his &quot;dirty energy&quot; remark? We asked campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor and got this response: &quot;It was a reference to cap and trade. A position John McCain supports.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it's true that both McCain and Obama support cap-and-trade, which would indeed raise the price of electricity, whether one calls it a &quot;tax&quot; or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cap-and-trade programs are designed to decrease the use of fossil fuels by requiring that industries (including power companies) cap their total carbon dioxide emissions. Companies would receive credits for CO2 emissions; any company that managed to stay under its quota would be permitted to sell its additional credits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has proposed auctioning the initial credits, a policy that he says will generate revenue that can be invested into alternative energy research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Roston, of the nonpartisan Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions, says that any cap-and-trade program will raise the cost of electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he told FactCheck.org, &quot;The goal of cap-and-trade is to make fossil fuels more expensive, which will make new technologies competitive with them.&quot; And since Obama would be auctioning credits, Roston says that it's &quot;not unreasonable&quot; to label Obama's program a tax politically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, by that standard, John McCain also favors raising taxes on electricity. McCain's Web site prominently proclaims his support for a cap-and-trade program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We usually try to avoid writing articles about Hollywood's latest gossip, but in this case, we felt that the McCain campaign's choice of celebrities is worth a brief mention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a conference call with reporters, McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said the ad features Ms. Hilton and Ms. Spears because, on the listing of &quot;three biggest international celebrities in the world,&quot; they rank second and third.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll leave it to you to judge how up-to-date the McCain campaign's celebrity meter is. But we will note that, in a lucky coincidence, Spears and Hilton also topped an AP poll for &quot;worst celebrity role model.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That connection appears to be deliberate. When asked whether the campaign intended to imply that Obama is as &quot;frivolous and irresponsible&quot; as Spears or Hilton, Rogers replied, &quot;I think that's exactly what we've been saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If McCain's aides believe that Barack Obama is like Britney Spears, that's their prerogative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are two fallacious arguments aimed at the same source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First is a John McCain television commercial about the high price of oil, and in it blame is squarely put on the shoulders of a single junior senator from Illinois who hasn't yet finished his first term and does not serve on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can probably figure out who the McCain camp wants us to blame for the pain at the pump. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second is a Web ad by the Republican National Committee targeting Democrat Barack Obama's much-discussed, much-covered speech in Berlin, where he talked about eliminating walls between cultures and races, a speech heard by an estimated 200,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's response? Equate Obama, a Harvard Law School-educated presidential nominee with a rare flair for rhetorical eloquence, with two bimbo starlets, Britney Spears and Paris Hilton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the midsummer timing may seem early in the election season to launch attack ads, they're indicative of McCain's predicament: being on the wrong side of popular opinion on just about every major issue in the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war in Iraq remains unpopular. A majority of registered voters have said they've experienced some form of financial hardship in the last year, and two-thirds said they believe the government can fix their problems. Those who believe health care is the most important issue favor Obama by an overwhelming majority - and so do those who are concerned about the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All McCain and the GOP have left in their arsenal are ad hominem attacks to tear down the pristine image of Obama as savior to the nation's ills. McCain already has name recognition, and according to Reid Wilson of RealClearPolitics.com, the only thing the Arizona senator needs to complete the formula for a successful presidential campaign is to convince people not to vote for his opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's hard to do when Obama's singing the song a majority of people want to hear. All McCain has left is to strike at Obama's image, and you can expect the attack ads to keep rolling out all summer long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has at least opened an advantage on Obama in one area: energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using the last Franklin &amp; Marshall College poll of voters nationwide, it's not difficult to see why McCain's up in this area, and Obama would be wise to curtail his message on gasoline prices and energy policy so as to effectively counter McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 40 percent of those polled said the economy is the No. 1 issue of the election, with energy policy garnering only 5 percent. The environment isn't even on the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A closer look, though, shows that three-fourths of the respondents said some sort of financial trouble, and high gasoline prices or health insurance costs or the economy in general, are the most important issues facing them personally. Again, the environment doesn't even make an appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a pocketbook election. So it's no wonder McCain's winning on this front when he has people convinced expanded domestic oil drilling will save them dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a false formula, because any savings wouldn't impact our bank accounts for years, even decades, and it's quite possible the growing worldwide demand for oil will swallow up potential savings. But those are the dirty details missing in McCain's message. For now, he's telling the American people that more domestic oil drilling equals savings at the pump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A look at Obama's energy platform illustrates why he's struggling to get traction on this issue. He's advocating a complex cap-and-trade formula to reduce carbon emissions; incentives to stop deforestation; funding development of biofuels; making old manufacturing sites green; encouraging geothermal, solar and wind electricity use; and much more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catch a theme there? Obama's message is about saving the environment - probably something he's trying to utilize as an appeal to his party's base - but while these pursuits may indeed protect the natural world, it's not clear how they will save the American people money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If gas prices continue to hover around $4 a gallon, it could be the issue propelling McCain to an upset. Obama would be wise to explain how his policies not only save air, land and water but money, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I feel great and am confident that the treatment and care I received will allow me to return to serving the people of the 36th Senatorial District in the manner they expect.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's response? Equate Obama, a Harvard Law School-educated presidential nominee with a rare flair for rhetorical eloquence, with two bimbo starlets, Britney Spears and Paris Hilton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the midsummer timing may seem early in the election season to launch attack ads, they're indicative of McCain's predicament: being on the wrong side of popular opinion on just about every major issue in the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war in Iraq remains unpopular. A majority of registered voters have said they've experienced some form of financial hardship in the last year, and two-thirds said they believe the government can fix their problems. Those who believe health care is the most important issue favor Obama by an overwhelming majority - and so do those who are concerned about the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All McCain and the GOP have left in their arsenal are ad hominem attacks to tear down the pristine image of Obama as savior to the nation's ills. McCain already has name recognition, and according to Reid Wilson of RealClearPolitics.com, the only thing the Arizona senator needs to complete the formula for a successful presidential campaign is to convince people not to vote for his opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's hard to do when Obama's singing the song a majority of people want to hear. All McCain has left is to strike at Obama's image, and you can expect the attack ads to keep rolling out all summer long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has at least opened an advantage on Obama in one area: energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using the last Franklin &amp; Marshall College poll of voters nationwide, it's not difficult to see why McCain's up in this area, and Obama would be wise to curtail his message on gasoline prices and energy policy so as to effectively counter McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 40 percent of those polled said the economy is the No. 1 issue of the election, with energy policy garnering only 5 percent. The environment isn't even on the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A closer look, though, shows that three-fourths of the respondents said some sort of financial trouble, and high gasoline prices or health insurance costs or the economy in general, are the most important issues facing them personally. Again, the environment doesn't even make an appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a pocketbook election. So it's no wonder McCain's winning on this front when he has people convinced expanded domestic oil drilling will save them dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a false formula, because any savings wouldn't impact our bank accounts for years, even decades, and it's quite possible the growing worldwide demand for oil will swallow up potential savings. But those are the dirty details missing in McCain's message. For now, he's telling the American people that more domestic oil drilling equals savings at the pump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A look at Obama's energy platform illustrates why he's struggling to get traction on this issue. He's advocating a complex cap-and-trade formula to reduce carbon emissions; incentives to stop deforestation; funding development of biofuels; making old manufacturing sites green; encouraging geothermal, solar and wind electricity use; and much more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catch a theme there? Obama's message is about saving the environment - probably something he's trying to utilize as an appeal to his party's base - but while these pursuits may indeed protect the natural world, it's not clear how they will save the American people money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If gas prices continue to hover around $4 a gallon, it could be the issue propelling McCain to an upset. Obama would be wise to explain how his policies not only save air, land and water but money, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I feel great and am confident that the treatment and care I received will allow me to return to serving the people of the 36th Senatorial District in the manner they expect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- State Sen. Mike Brubaker after undergoing surgery to combat prostate cancer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the start of July, her boyfriend, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Lee Grivas</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, was found dead in his apartment of an apparent drug overdose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, at the start of August, the star of &quot;Married with Children,&quot; Broadway's &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; and the hit sitcom &quot;Samantha Who?&quot; is being treated for breast cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, the disease was caught early and Christina is expected to fully recover. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christina's cancer was detected through an MRI ordered by her doctor and is not life-threatening, publicist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ame Van Iden</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christina is slated to appear on &quot;Stand Up To Cancer,&quot; to air on ABC, CBS and NBC on Sept. 5 to raise funds for cancer research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In other health news, comedian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bernie Mac</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remains in a Chicago hospital where his publicist said he is reportedly responding well to treatment for pneumonia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Chicago Sun-Times</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reported Saturday that Mac was in &quot;very, very critical&quot; condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mac's publicist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Danica Smith</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said via e-mail that that report was &quot;some bad info.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Directing 'American Teen'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">While </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Variety</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said that there's something &quot;artificially heightened&quot; and &quot;suspiciously rigged&quot; about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Nanette Burstein</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s documentary &quot;American Teen,&quot; the director told </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Daily News </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">film critic, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Gary Thompson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that there's nothing artificial or rigged about it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burstein said she came by the footage the hard way - spending months and months with the four teenagers she profiles in the film, slowly gaining their trust (and the trust of the parents who allowed them to be filmed).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you see them up at two in the morning, talking or crying or sharing gossip, we're right there with them,&quot; said Burstein, also co-director of the popular documentary &quot;The Kid Stays in the Picture.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burstein said that given how close she became with the teens, it was difficult to remain purely objective, or merely a fly on the wall. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd say I became like a big sister to some of them,&quot; she said. &quot;When they were having a problem, I was certainly willing to provide advice. I hope it was good advice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America Teen&quot; is playing at the Ritz Bourse and at the Showcase in Voorhees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LiLo to make it official?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lindsay has said very little about her relationship with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Samantha Ronson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">News of the World</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rav Singh</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says that LiLo and Sam will soon &quot;tie the knot.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rav says that Lindsay will come out and declare her love for Sam at a private ceremony later this year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rav says that Lindsay's mom </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Dina </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">wants to &quot;welcome Sam into the family&quot; with a big party, and that Lindsay has chosen a white Chanel mini-dress for the occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as 'just good friends,' &quot; said the requisite anonymous source, &quot;but they've decided it isn't a fling, it's for life - so they want to make their romance public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lindsay want a romance public? Go figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Following Lindsay's back-and-forth with L.A. police chief </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">William Bratton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this weekend over her alleged gay-ness, Bratton responded to Lindsay's comment to mind his own business by saying his sister is gay and he is a proponent of gay rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We sure hope his sister had come out before that remark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Tattbits</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A judge in the Turks and Caicos islands has released on bond &quot;Hairspray&quot; star </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Nikki Blonsky</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and &quot;America's Next Top Model&quot; contestant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bianca Golden</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in connection with a recent catfight fistfight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors say that Nikki and Bianca were aboard a flight in the Caribbean nation when they started fighting over an occupied seat. Nikki's dad was also charged in the fight, and will remain in jail until Aug. 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">John McCain</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said last week that his campaign ad mocking </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Barack </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with images of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Paris Hilton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Britney Spears</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was an attempt to inject humor into the presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not funny, said Paris's mom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Kathy Hilton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a complete waste of the country's time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs,&quot; Kathy said in a short article posted on the liberal Huffington Post Web site. &quot;And it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathy called the ad &quot;a complete waste of the money John McCain's contributors have donated to his campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She should know. She and hubby</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> Rick</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gave $4,600 to McCain's campaign earlier this year. *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Intensified attacks by Republican John McCain on the character of his Democratic opponent have coincided with Barack Obama losing a 9 percentage point advantage in a national poll, which showed the candidates running dead even over the weekend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who had vowed to avoid the kind of negative tactics that were used against him in the 2000 Republican primary contest with George W. Bush, began attacking Obama during the Illinois senator's trip to Iraq and Afghanistan late last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the course of the McCain offensive, Obama's lead in a Gallup Poll tracking survey slid from 9 percentage points on July 26, when he returned from overseas, to nothing by Saturday, when the poll showed the candidates tied at 44 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four-term Arizona senator, who backed the war and claims experience with security and foreign policy issues, charged that Obama's promise to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq within 16 months of taking office amounted to his having chosen to lose a war to promote his run for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has not relented even though he took criticism for the remark. It appeared at the time to be a defensive response to the massive attention paid to the Obama visit to the two U.S. war fronts as well as to the Middle East and Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He subsequently ran a television ad that accused Obama of deciding not to visit wounded U.S. troops because he could not take television cameras - a claim that appeared to be false. Next, he issued a commercial that interposed images of Obama with pop-culture figures Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, trying to paint Obama as a celebrity without the experience to lead the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was followed by accusations that Obama, who would be the first black U.S. president, had resorted to racial politics by asserting McCain and other Republicans would try to frighten Americans because Obama did not look like past U.S. presidents whose images are on the country's paper money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And most recently, in an Internet advertisement, the voiceover calls Obama &quot;The One&quot; and features Obama appearing to describe himself and his presidential quest in grandiose terms. It ends with the late actor Charlton Heston as Moses parting the Red Sea in &quot;The Ten Commandments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama may have given McCain more fodder in recent days by announcing a readiness to compromise with Republicans on offshore oil drilling - which he had opposed - and apparently rejecting McCain's challenge to join him in a series of town hall meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, Obama said McCain's campaign was cynical and trying to distract voters from real issues but that he did not believe his opponent and his campaign had engaged in racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In no way do I think John McCain's campaign was racist. I think they are cynical,&quot; Obama said. &quot;Their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks.&quot; * </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mr. Obama sent a letter yesterday to the Democratic Party's credentials committee, asking members to reinstate full voting rights for delegates from Florida and Michigan when the committee meets at the start of the party's national convention in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegates were originally stripped because the two states violated party rules by holding primaries before Feb. 5. The delegates from each state were given half-votes at a contentious party meeting in May, as part of a compromise designed to give two important states some role at the convention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's former Democratic rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton, had won both primaries, though Mr. Obama's name was not on the Michigan ballot and neither candidate campaigned in Florida.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Meg White at BuzzFlash.com:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to a Workplace Democracy Association/Zogby Interactive survey, 25 percent of Americans compare their workplace to a dictatorship. In the most comprehensive study of the phenomenon to date, the poll also found that adopting more egalitarian processes might be the solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; ... Interestingly, according to a study released earlier this year by the Bertelsmann Foundation, almost 40 percent of the world's population lives under a dictatorship.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON DRINKING AND DEMOCRATS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A couple of thoughts on local politics from 414 Grant Street (414grantstreet.blogspot.com):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1) &quot;We like the strategy employed by the [Allegheny] County Council Democrats to head off the referendum to repeal the drink tax. Putting up a second referendum linking the drink tax repeal to property tax increases is a very smart ploy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2) &quot;Looks like no one will challenge the mayor [Luke Ravenstahl] in the [Democratic] primary next year. Amazing. Even Richard Caliguiri had opposition, as did David Lawrence, who even almost lost a re-election after he made Pittsburghers stop using coal to heat their homes ... which leads us to wonder, was David Lawrence America's first great environmental politician?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON DRINKING AND KILLERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PGH IS A CITY blog (pghisacity.blogspot.com) is all for moving the Pittsburgh police substation from the bar-filled South Side to the sometimes-fatal hilltop:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's good to see the city putting their priorities straight. Murders are more important as a 'quality of life' issue than public urination on a Friday night after the bars close. Congratulations to Mayor Ravenstahl and his cronies for making the bold decision to move the police station away from where the new expensive condos are to a neighborhood that could really use some policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, I'm a bit biased because I live up close and personal with Allentown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE PRESIDENT'S PRIVATE ARMY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing at TomDispatch.com, Chalmers Johnson riffs on Tim Shorrock's new book, &quot;Spies for Hire,&quot; tracing the history of &quot;the wholesale transfer of military and intelligence functions to private, often anonymous operatives&quot; from Ronald Reagan's day to the present. Mr. Johnson sums up:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current situation represents the worst of all possible worlds. Successive administrations and Congresses have made no effort to alter the CIA's role as the president's private army, even as we have increased its incompetence by turning over many of its functions to the private sector. We have thereby heightened the risks of war by accident, or by presidential whim, as well as of surprise attack because our government is no longer capable of accurately assessing what is going on in the world and because its intelligence agencies are so open to pressure, penetration and manipulation of every kind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CELEBRITY CRAZY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chad Hermann at the local blog &quot;Teacher. Wordsmith. Madman.&quot; cuts loose at all sides over the latest McCain TV ad:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone seems to be talking about that sad and silly and embarrassingly desperate new John McCain celebrity attack ad. ... Partisan bloggers on the left are willfully misreading, then hysterically misrepresenting, the piece. (It's not a failed attempt to suggest Obama is as lightweight and inexplicably adored for dubious accomplishments as Britney Spears or Paris Hilton; it's a coded, subtle bit of racism that suggests the scary, black Obama boasts a taste for young white women!) Partisan bloggers on the right are willfully misjudging, then wildly overpraising, it. (It's not a failed attempt to suggest Obama is as lightweight and inexplicably famous for being famous as Britney Spears or Paris Hilton; it's a shrewd and brilliant and surprisingly savvy way to play the media and get people buzzing about your message!)&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HAPPY PAP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce Levine at AlterNet.org mocks Harvard happiness researcher Tal Ben-Shahar, recounting Mr. Ben-Shahar's visit to &quot;The Daily Show With Jon Stewart&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, Stewart is no longer able to restrain his amazement that platitudes are considered profound at Harvard nowadays (the 'Six Happiness Tips' on Ben-Shahar's Web site are about acceptance of negative feelings, positive attitude, meaningful activities, being grateful, simplifying life and physical health). Stewart ends the interview in Groucho Marx fashion by saying, 'It's a fascinating subject and one that I can't believe you are getting away with.' &quot;</SPAN></P>

Obama decided to call his bluff and make the trip. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it would appear that McCain got more than what he bargained for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, all three major networks in tow, met with the prime minister of Afghanistan, then played basketball with U.S. troops. Afterward, he not only met with Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki at his residence, but Obama also got his blessing for his troop-withdrawal program!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then off to Jordan and Israel, looking quite presidential. But the clincher showed that Obama knows how to beat McCain at his own game. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent polls have suggested that Obama is much more popular with our European allies than is McCain, so he extended his trip to England, France and Germany, giving a Kennedyesque speech in Berlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now picture this scene on every evening news, along with literally thousands of well-wishers wildly cheering Obama on, well as you might imagine, McCain is beside himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had to run silly commercials claiming Obama is responsible for the price of gas, and went so far as to threaten to make a major announcement on the day Obama made his Berlin appearance. Then McCain complained that the monster he created, aided by Obama's smarts, is treating him unfairly and ignoring him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of an increasingly contentious week of campaigning, Sen. John McCain yesterday denied that he was going negative against Sen. Barack Obama, even as his camp released a new Web ad that mockingly contrasts Mr. Obama's soaring rhetoric with clips of actor Charlton Heston playing Moses in &quot;The Ten Commandments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week, the McCain campaign unveiled an ad that compared the Illinois senator with celebrities Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. On Thursday, Mr. McCain and his campaign manager accused Mr. Obama of playing &quot;the race card&quot; by warning voters against attacks that he looks different from other presidents on U.S. currency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it's negative,&quot; Mr. McCain said at a Panama City news conference. &quot;I think we're drawing the difference between us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign fired back quickly. &quot;It's downright sad that, on a day when we learned that 51,000 Americans lost their jobs, a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics,&quot; said spokesman Hari Sevugan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new McCain spot, entitled &quot;The One,&quot; opens in the manner of a Hollywood movie trailer, with a deep-voiced announcer declaring: &quot;In 2008, the world will be blessed. They will call him: The One.&quot; It then cuts to some of Mr. Obama's loftier moments -- his declaration that, &quot;We are the ones we have been waiting for,&quot; and his speech upon clinching the Democratic nomination promising, &quot;This was the moment when the rise of our oceans began to slow, and our planet began to heal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the spot, Mr. McCain said, &quot;We're going to display a sense of humor in this campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late in the day, Mr. Obama dismissed his opponents' tactics. &quot;They're calling folks names like they used to do in fifth grade. You remember fifth grade? Calling each other names, and petty fights. We don't have time for that. That doesn't lower gas prices and secure people's jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier yesterday, Mr. Obama unveiled a $50 billion emergency economic stimulus. At a campaign stop in St. Petersburg, he called for energy rebates of as much as $1,000, five years of a windfall profits tax on oil companies and $25 billion to replenish the highway trust fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the elements of the plan were from Mr. Obama's prior proposals, but on the day the government announced that the unemployment rate hit 5.7 percent, a four-year high, the likely Democratic presidential candidate stepped up the stakes with the energy rebate, more details on the profits tax and the extra funds for highways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This [energy] rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months,&quot; he said at a town hall meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting a headline in the morning's St. Petersburg Times that told of the first recessionary downturn in the state since 1991, Mr. Obama again linked Mr. McCain and President Bush, blaming both men for failing to aid Americans struggling with job loss and home foreclosures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview yesterday with The Palm Beach Post, Mr. Obama said he would be willing to support limited additional offshore oil drilling if that was what it took to enact a comprehensive policy to foster fuel-efficient autos and develop alternate energy sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shifting from his prior opposition to expanded offshore drilling, the Democrat said he could support a compromise with Republicans and oil companies to prevent gridlock over energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, who earlier dropped his opposition to offshore drilling, has been criticizing Mr. Obama on the stump and in broadcast ads for clinging to his opposition as gasoline prices topped $4 a gallon. Polls indicate that those attacks have helped Mr. McCain gain ground on Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My interest is in making sure we've got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;If, in order to get that passed, we have to compromise in terms of a careful, well thought-out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage -- I don't want to be so rigid that we can't get something done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about Mr. Obama's change of heart, Mr. McCain said: &quot;We need oil drilling, and we need it now offshore. He has consistently opposed it. He has opposed nuclear power. He has opposed reprocessing. He has opposed storage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican said his rival doesn't have a plan equal to the nation's energy challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Mr. Obama will address the Urban League's national convention in Orlando.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of race kept bubbling up in the presidential campaign yesterday, as African-American hecklers charged that Sen. Barack Obama has not been aggressive enough on matters concerning the black community, while the Illinois Democrat's own supporters complained that a new television ad from Sen. John McCain has racial overtones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until recently, overt discussions of race had been absent from the campaign between Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican. But they erupted this week when a McCain spokesman accused Mr. Obama of &quot;playing the race card.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, Mr. McCain said Mr. Obama's speeches are better than his proposals, as he spoke in Orlando before the National Urban League, a group that Mr. Obama is scheduled to address today. Mr. McCain suggested that Mr. Obama is hypocritical for sending his children to private schools and still opposing school vouchers, and his campaign released a new Web video called &quot;The One&quot; that mocks Mr. Obama as messianic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a more unusual spectacle played out elsewhere in Florida, where Mr. Obama was confronted by a group of young African-American protesters at an event in St. Petersburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group raised a sign saying &quot;What about the Black community, Obama?&quot; as they stood behind him on bleachers in a high school gym. The sign included the Web site for the International African Revolution, which has a mission of &quot;giving voice to the struggles of the African working class from around the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has dealt with hecklers before and coolly reminded the men that they could ask a question after he finished speaking, and told them to sit down. Then, much of the audience started to chant, &quot;Yes, we can,&quot; an Obama slogan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the question-answer portion started, Mr. Obama called on one of the protesters to ask the second question, as a staff member held onto the microphone the entire time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the African community, why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited African community, or black community, in this country?&quot; the man asked, mentioning predatory lending, police shootings of blacks and the so-called Jena 6 case in Louisiana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is democracy at work, and he asked a legitimate question, so I want to give him an answer,&quot; Mr. Obama said, as some in the audience booed the protester. &quot;On each of these issues that you mentioned, I have spoken out. I have spoken out, and I have spoken out forcefully. ... I passed the first racial profiling legislation in Illinois. I passed some of the toughest death penalty reform legislation in Illinois.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another reflection of the issue's complexity, some Obama supporters yesterday said they saw racism at play in new McCain ads featuring Britney Spears and Paris Hilton that seek to suggest that the presumptive Democratic nominee is just a well-spoken celebrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They note that the ads feature young white blond women, just as did much-criticized ads that ran in 2006 against Harold Ford Jr., a black U.S. Senate candidate from Tennessee who attended a Playboy party with white women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I note with interest today John McCain's new tactic of associating Barack Obama with oversexed and/or promiscuous young white women,&quot; blogger Josh Marshall wrote on his Talking Points Memo blog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hardly a surprise that race would become an issue in a presidential contest featuring the first African-American to clinch a presidential nomination from a major party. Mr. Obama has presented his candidacy as moving beyond divisions, yet he has referred to his own race on several occasions, usually in the context of warning his supporters that Republicans will launch race-based attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week, a McCain spokesman claimed that Mr. Obama was playing the &quot;race card&quot; when he warned supporters that Republicans would try to convince voters that the Democrat is a risk. Mr. Obama predicted that they would note how he &quot;doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After initially disagreeing with the McCain camp that that statement had racial overtones, a top Obama adviser conceded yesterday that it did, at least in part, refer to Mr. Obama's racial background. &quot;He's not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the United States,&quot; David Axelrod said on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; on ABC. &quot;He's new to Washington. Yes, he's African-American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That brought this response from McCain spokesman Brian Rogers: &quot;They clearly walked away from his statements, and we are moving on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout his campaign, Mr. Obama's race has had advantages and disadvantages. A Quinnipiac University Poll in July showed him with the support of 94 percent of blacks, a group he has aggressively courted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALICIA KEYS may be smokin'- hot, but she's not hot for smokin'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Performing in Jakarta, Indonesia, Keys objected to concert sponsorship by Philip Morris International's A Mild cigarettes and the tobacco giant pulled down its billboards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The D.C.-based Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids initially drew Keys' attention to PMI's association with her show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter released by Sony BMG, Keys said she asked the company to stop the branding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am an unyielding advocate for the well-being of children around the world and do not condone or endorse smoking,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whether tobacco sponsorship of music events leads to youth smoking is a matter of serious debate,&quot; PMI said in a statement. &quot;Having considered the facts in this specific instance, we have decided to withdraw all branding associated with this concert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Entertainment and politics</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">John Rich</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, half of the Nashville duo </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Big and Rich</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, has penned lyrics for the anthemic &quot;Raising McCain,&quot; focusing on the 5 1/2 years </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">John McCain</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spent as a POW in Vietnam and his refusal of an early release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;He stayed strong, stayed extra long 'til they let all the other boys out. Now we've got a real man with an American plan, we're going to put him in the big White House,&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the song says. Its refrain: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">&quot;We're all just raising McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rich said he hadn't been involved in politics before but got excited about the Arizona senator's campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He finished the song about a month ago and sent it to McCain's daughter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Meghan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who sent it to campaign officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rich said that while he admired </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Barack Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, &quot;The entire world is looking for a way to sucker-punch us,&quot; he said. &quot;National security is absolutely at the top of the list of issues. That's why I think John McCain is the guy to keep us safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Barack Obama supporter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Luda-cris</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wrote &quot;Politics as Usual&quot; for his guy, but it probably won't be showing up on Obama's iPod any time soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The song brags about an Obama presidency and uses an expletive to describe </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hillary Clinton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, calls </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">President Bush</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;mentally handicapped&quot; and says John McCain doesn't belong in &quot;any chair unless he's paralyzed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That doesn't even make any sense. But if Ludacris' goal was to inflame the opposition, mission accomplished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lyrics also don't spare the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rev. Jesse Jackson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who recently apologized for making crude comments about Obama. &quot;If you said it, then you meant it,&quot; he raps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As Barack Obama has said many, many times in the past, rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny, materialism, and degrading images that he doesn't want his daughters or any children exposed to,&quot; campaign spokesman </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bill Burton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in an e-mail. &quot;This song is not only outrageously offensive to Sen. Clinton, Rev. Jackson, Sen. McCain and President Bush, it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear. While Ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Lastly, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Britney Spears</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Paris Hilton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been thrust into the presidential race in a new commercial for John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women don't endorse McCain; they're merely all-style-no-substance celebs whom his campaign compares with Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a town-hall meeting in Wisconsin, McCain said the commercial was not at odds with the respectful campaign he'd promised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're proud of that commercial,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">In other Britney, Paris news . . . </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">L.A. Police Chief </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">William Bratton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said yesterday that a few changes have heped the city with its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">paparazzi</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> problem:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you notice, since Britney started wearing clothes and behaving, Paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore, thank God, and evidently, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Lindsay Lohan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has gone gay, we don't seem to have much of an issue,&quot; Bratton told KNBC-TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Tattbits</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">* </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">India.Arie</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s Broadway debut in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> revival of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ntozake Shange</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s &quot;For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf,&quot; has been postponed following the loss of one of the show's backers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The play, produced by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Whoopi Goldberg</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and DreamTeam Entertainment, was to open Sept. 8 at Circle in the Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Lucasfilm and British prop designer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Andrew Ainsworth</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> both claimed victory yesterday in a legal battle over the Stormtrooper uniforms from &quot;Star Wars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British High Court judge </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Anthony Mann</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ruled that Ainsworth violated Lucasfilm's U.S. copyright by selling replica Stormtrooper uniforms through his Web site to U.S. customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the judge refused to enforce a $20 million judgment Lucasfilm won against Ainsworth in California in 2006. The judge said Ainsworth's U.S. sales of less than $60,000 were not significant enough to make him susceptible to U.S. jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge also rejected a claim against Ainsworth under British law, saying English copyright over the suits had expired. Ainsworth's lawyer, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Seamus Andrew</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said the ruling meant that Ainsworth was now free to sell his replicas everywhere except the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* If you're free Aug. 9</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and like big organs, you might want to trek up to Radio City Music Hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retired Air Force Colonel/pipe-organ fan </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Jack Moelmann</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is renting out the giant hall at a cost of $120,000 to fulfill a lifelong dream - to perform on the largest theater pipe organ ever built by Wurlitzer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tickets to Moelmann's show are $50 and (thousands of) good seats are still available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* According to TMZ.com, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Verne Troyer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is taking his ex-girlfriend and sex-tape partner, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ranae Shrider</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems as if Ranae liked it rough, and Verne is suing her for physical and emotional distress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Verne's lawyer, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Ed McPherson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, told TMZ.com, &quot;When you pick up a 2-foot-8-inch human being and throw him to the floor, it hurts.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The year was 1974.  Rizzo was in office. Bobby Clarke was in the Inky.  Blazing Saddles was at the Sameric. And for the first time ever,  Philly Mag set out to find the city's softest pretzel,  hottest haircut, most reliable plumber,  canniest astrologer ... (Hey, it was the '70s.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot has changed since then. Our list of bests has grown (we now have almost 300 winners!)  and embraced a new era (see Going Green, page 139), but the mission remains the same: We eat everything,  shop everywhere, talk to everyone, so that you,  dear reader, can head straight to the best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year we celebrate 35 years of Best of Philly with all the hidden gems, can't-miss-meals and hot  new spots you want to hear about-and also pay tribute to the classics:  that burger we all love, the mascot we adore, the traditions  that explain and exalt our city.  Plus: an insider's guide to Philly's best-kept secrets (page 147),  our fifth annual pick for Best Philadelphian (page 151),  the tastiest Tastykake that ever was (page 125),  and much, much more. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eyewear</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't let their plaid shirts, skinny jeans and fast-talking ways fool you: The hip staffers at Modern Eye aren't too cool to be friendly, funny and honest - important qualities when you're looking for help choosing an accessory for your face. Their selection is thoughtful: Conservatives can go for square mahogany frames; statement-makers like the bright colors and chunkier specs from European designers like Minima and Markus T; and glam fans are able to stock up on Gucci shades. &gt;&gt;&gt; 3419 Walnut Street, 215-386-5953, and 145 South 13th Street, 215-922-3300; modern-eye.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luxe Massage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Try not to weep with pleasure as the therapists at Water Club's Immersion - a tranquil Asian-meets-the-Jersey-Shore spot - begin their choreographed Immersion Four-Hand Massage (which actually feels like eight), kneading out knots, applying your choice of oils where needed, and basically fixing anything and everything that's troublesome in your life. For that 80 minutes, at least ($340). &gt;&gt;&gt; The Water Club, 1 Renaissance Way, Atlantic City, 800-800-8817, thewaterclubattheborgata.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garden Center</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you have to ask, you haven't been paying attention to the buzz: Urban Outfitters' massive makeover of DelCo's stalwart J. Franklin Styer has, within a mere 11 acres, revolutionized - or, some might say, Anthropologie-ized - the garden-store concept. Terrain sells impatiens out of antique wooden carts. Terrain displays hard-cover garden books in lush greenhouses. Terrain stocks chic-ly packaged, eco-friendly seeds, fertilizers and pest control products, and displays its understatedly elegant - never precious - patio furniture outdoors. And its landscaping division is promising the same Styer's-esque attention to service. It might be the best in the country. &gt;&gt;&gt; 914 Baltimore Pike, Concordville, 610-459-2400, terrainathome.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maintenance Massage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Mellow, a new, no-frills massage therapy center in East Falls, you don't have to schedule your &quot;relax time&quot; weeks in advance. Masseurs and masseuses work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week (on Sundays, hours vary), so all it takes is a quick phone call and you're booked for a 30-, 60- or 90-minute great, straight-to-the-point Swedish, deep tissue or sports rubdown. And prices are so affordable, you can make it a weekly habit: An hour-long massage is $75, while a 30-minute pick-you-up is only $40. &gt;&gt;&gt; Sherman Mills of East Falls, 3502 Scotts Lane, building 19, 215-843-2234, mellowmassage.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bookstore</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walk into Queen Village's Head House Books on any given day and you may see something unusual: the store's owner handpicking inventory from a seller. That care isn't all that sets this independent bookseller apart. From the worn Persian rugs to the skylights that bathe the place in natural light, Head House has an earnest charm that chain stores seek to emulate but never seem to master. Don't miss the &quot;community&quot; section displays, filled with books recommended by locals as well as those popular with area book clubs. &gt;&gt;&gt; 619 South 2nd Street, 215-923-9525, headhousebooks.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Boutique, City</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an airier, more casual feel, the revamped Washington Square Pileggi Boutique has naysayers stopped in their tracks. New owner Andrea Chila has kept the standbys - Shin Choi, Diane von Furstenberg - but added funkier cult faves like Thread Social and DaftBird, making this one of the more diverse and exciting boutiques in an emerging hip zone. &gt;&gt;&gt; 715 Walnut Street, 215-922-3526. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Boutique, 'Burbs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were surprised, too, that a women's boutique inside Media's B. Gross, an age-old men's shop, would be worth a look. But nine-month-old Per Lei far surpasses expectations. Co-owner Candice Caprice has picked a few of the best options in an eclectic mix of lines: lighthearted dresses from Theory, off-the-catwalk looks from BCBG, flirty skirts from Pink Tartan, sexy sundresses from Trina Tark. Caprice makes monthly buying runs to NYC, so her stuff is fresh. &gt;&gt;&gt; 2 East State Street, Media, 610-566-1254, perleiboutique.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men's Day Spa </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because there's nothing super-girly about the Borgata's Spa Toccare, it's a respectable refuge for a guy between rounds of golf or poker; folks here even had men in mind when they designed the decadent microderm cream facial and a body-sloughing treatment and massage. You'll also find serious deep-tissue rubdowns, spoiling soaks in oversize modern rooms, and - best of all - an over-the-top locker room where cloud-like robes, massaging slippers, fresh fruit and iced teas are only the half of it. Because nap-perfect lounge chairs face plasmas playing SportsCenter, which spa-goers can also see from either of two hot whirlpools after sitting a spell in the steam room or sauna. &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 Borgata Way, Atlantic City, 609-317-7555, theborgata.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lingerie </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's fitting that the second location of Haddonfield's Georgie Girl is housed on the main floor of Marlton's posh Rizzieri Salon &amp; Spa, because the ultra-attentive staff here pampers us just as much as the beauticians upstairs - expertly fitting us for a Josie Natori, guiding us through deliciously soft P.J. Salvage nighties, and keeping records of our purchases - so that next time, when we call ahead, they'll pore over the racks and pull items before we show up. &gt;&gt;&gt; The Shoppes at Rizzieri, Route 73 and Greentree Road, Marlton, 856-596-3343, georgiegirlboutique.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men's Haircut </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What he won't admit liking at American Male, a nationwide chain that started here: the gratis paraffin hand dips, scalp massages and mini facials. What he will: the beer, and the post-cut shampoo to banish itchy clips. &gt;&gt;&gt; 512 Haddonfield Road, Cherry Hill, 856-665-6253, americanmale.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Linens</SPAN></P>

(He's styled Britney, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Beverly Johnson, to name a few). But he also has a method we like: Rather than drastically changing your look, he and his team concentrate on cuts, color and conditioning treatments that enhance your style. The result (delivered in record time - while you sip chardonnay) is an amped-up, still-recognizable, shiny new you. &gt;&gt;&gt; 815 Christian Street, 215-238-0764, laurentiussalon.com. </SPAN></P>

When Raya Yukhimov and Haig Khararjian parted ways last year, Gold stayed on at the newly named and newly polished Haig &amp; Co. - where he continues to carry off his note-perfect C&amp;C's, teaching his staff to do the same. Longtime fans delight in his updates to a faded decor - a gilding of the reception area, privatizing of the stations - and even the newest patrons are breathing easier, knowing they can look as glamorous and important as, say, the beauty editor of W, who recently asked Gold to execute her wedding-day hair. &gt;&gt;&gt; 401 East City Avenue, Bala Cynwyd, 610-668-5373. </SPAN></P>

She uses different tones to literally paint color on in skinny little sections, creating a much more natural, textured, sun-kissed look than the dreaded stripes that come from the foil technique. And while we love her balayage, it's her basic understanding of dyes and dedication to detail that make her a top choice for anything color, from going darker to correcting a botched job. &gt;&gt;&gt; 123 South 16th Street, 2nd floor, 215-569-1515, amssalon.com. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the idea of a customized spray tan from a spa sounds nice, the truth is that nothing about standing naked with a stranger spritzing you is particularly luxurious. That's why we love the minutes-long, non-streaking Mystic Spray Tan booth at Rittenhouse's Sun Myst Tanning Studios. While spray booths are no novelty, this is special: The spacious three-walled room doesn't have a door, so while you follow the easy rotating instructions (for even coverage), you can actually - and this is a big one - breathe. Seconds later, you emerge with a clear coat of soon-to-darken tan (or insta-bronze, if you wish) - all for as little as $25. &gt;&gt;&gt; 209 South 20th Street, 215-545-5010, sunmysttanningstudios.com. </SPAN></P>

And she'll roll her eyes. But just wait. In a few years, she'll be singing a similar tune to her daughter, who will roll her eyes as they browse the racks.

Studio is locally based but nationally lauded for her custom-designed letterpress notes, invites and stationery: Details like patterns pressed on envelope flaps, bold colors and arty icons (instead of checking entr&eacute;e choice, put an 'X' next to the picture of a fish, steer or carrot) are inspiration enough to throw that party or even - almost - marry that boy. &gt;&gt;&gt; 215-561-0896, ohjoystudio.com. </SPAN></P>

So why bother? Meticulous hand-craftsmanship, &uuml;ber-friendly service and really reasonable prices.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We admit we're not ready for composting toilets. (Scary!) So we appreciate third-generation interior designer Lili Wright's home-greening approach: Her firm, Wright Design, offers services - like one-day room makeovers - that don't require a total lifestyle overhaul. And best of all, she thinks that eco-friendly design principles fit every style, and brings her clean, classic European aesthetic to a Kennett Square farmhouse and Rittenhouse townhomes alike.  &gt;&gt;&gt; 20 East Sunset Avenue, 215-242-3149, 831-236-0846, wright-design.net. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Halloween Jewelry Design (and Re-Design)  &gt;&gt;&gt; If Halloween, that lavish treasure trove of a jewelry store, is eccentric (have you seen the pearl brooch in the shape of a cowboy?), then owner Henri David is downright flamboyant. He answers the phone with a singsongy &quot;Trick or treat!&quot; He throws a Halloween party - every year for 40 years now - and invites the entire city. He's designed jewelry for Elton John, and for crazy Stevie Nicks. The man is friends with John Waters, for Pete's sake. But he's also a true talent, and old-school when it comes to honest dealings and customer service. David and his staff have earned our trust - and their icon status - with quality, beautiful work. They'll duplicate any design, clean and refurbish your grandmother's hand-me-downs, and work with any budget to make your jewelry at least as memorable as the place it came from. &gt;&gt;&gt; 1329 Pine Street, 215-732-7711. </SPAN></P>

That's Wake Up Yoga. With locations in Fairmount and West Philly and almost four dozen classes a week, there's something for every schedule and style, from strenuous vinyasa to chill-out restorative yoga.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The upstairs toilet flooded, and now Nana's portrait (circa 1890) is ruined. Or maybe not. Philip Rosenfeld and his team at the Pennsylvania Art Conservatory have tackled the worst calamities (rips, rotting canvases) for more than 30 years for collectors and big-name museums (the Dali Institute, the Warhol Foundation). They can handle every period and style, and you don't need to worry that they'll change your masterpiece into their own. Says Rosenfeld, &quot;We do as little as possible, everything can be reversed, and it's guaranteed for a lifetime ... unless someone puts a foot through it.&quot;  &gt;&gt;&gt; 636 Lancaster Avenue, Berwyn, 610-644-4300, paconservatory.com.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boy, that Brie Adina Neff is a stickler. The queen of Romana's Pilates - a type of Pilates dedicated to the method as Joseph Pilates conceived it, with no twists and no newfangled updates - teaches intense 45-minute private sessions at Equilibrium Pilates, scrutinizing even practiced students, pushing, pushing, pushing for precision. The payoff: Clients feel energized (and taller!), and closer to the ballet body that Pilates promised.  &gt;&gt;&gt; 424 South 2nd Street, 215-923-3669, equilibrium-pilates.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pilates, Personalized  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aimee Baker is watching you. With Zen-like calm, the Colorado transplant is sizing up your body - posture, breathing, weight shifts, even foot strength - long before you ever step onto a mat. And while the environment at her Bodylogic Personal Training Studio is casually homey, the private, prescriptive sessions are serious business. After an initial consult, you'll get 55 minutes of undivided attention (there's a</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bartender </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A good bartender is more than just the drinks he serves - he's a guy you want to drink 'em with. Like Ron Johnson, on the second floor of Northern Liberties watershed Standard Tap. He's mixing cocktails for the ladies, cheerfully pouring local drafts for the friends who met over MySpace, regaling the nouveaux bohemians assembled at the mahogany. And sometimes, you'll find him there on off nights. On a totally dead one not long ago, Johnson - a Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts grad, and a sometimes professional painter by day - whipped out the ink wash and brushes he's known to keep behind the bar and painted tiny masterpieces on customers' coasters.  &gt;&gt;&gt; 901 North 2nd Street, 215-238-0630, standardtap.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Body Repair </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why everybody who's anybody (if that body is hurting) goes to physical therapist and trainer Joe Zarett: He fixes you. You can take the word of this magazine's editor, Bad-Back Larry Platt, who's gone to Zarett for that and for tendonitis and for general help pumping up (snicker) &quot;the guns.&quot; Or you could ask the Penn tennis team, or Advanta CEO Dennis Alter, or &uuml;ber-lawyer Paul Rosen, or just about any Rittenhouse or Main Line weekend athlete who's suffered the agony of injury or aches of aging. The pain gets a body in the door of Zarett Rehabilitation Associates, and then restorative therapy leads to a workout routine.The come-for-rehab-stay-for-health drill is so popular that Zarett nearly doubled his patient load last year; this month, he unveils an expanded space that fits four times the state-of-the-art equipment - and way more bodies. &gt;&gt;&gt; 520 South 19th Street, 215-731-1449, zarettrehab.com.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restaurateurs Audrey Claire Taichman and Kristina Burke are just two of the picky customers who swear by Fitler Square's Pure Design when it comes to blooms for their dining rooms.

And his flowers - which he carefully handpicks every Monday - are arranged in charming vessels that you'll reuse.  &gt;&gt;&gt; Pure Design, 500 South 22nd Street, 215-546-6666. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Barton &amp; Donaldson Ltd. Custom-Made Shirts  &gt;&gt;&gt; Sigh. Men these days. In better times, there were Bogie and Cary Grant and Dean Martin, in tuxes. Today, women get besneakered rappers as the kings of cool, and shirtless Texans as sex symbols. If it weren't for Clooney, we'd just give up. Well, Clooney and Don Donaldson, whose Center City shop still turns out beautiful custom-made dress shirts for men. That Donaldson has continued to find new devotees after 40 years in business gives us hope that men are realizing how far a little old-fashioned quality goes toward sexy. (See: Cary Grant.) And, guys, ask any of the shop's clients: Nothing beats the feeling of wearing something that was literally made to fit you - to say nothing of the way you look.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gem Cleaners Dry Cleaner &gt;&gt;&gt; Tom Vecchione, owner of Mount Airy's Gem Cleaners for 12 years (ever since his father passed, and he owned it for 58 years before that), is the man to whom you send the clothes you want to have forever. Prices run higher than at most cleaners, but most cleaners don't return that vintage Chanel suit looking - we swear! - better than ever, and can't take the white coat drenched in tomato sauce and make it gleaming-new. And not only is he a miracle-worker; he's a miracle-worker who does pickup and delivery.  &gt;&gt;&gt; 546 Carpenter Lane, 215-848-6190. </SPAN></P>

The third and newest outpost in Villanova is the best of the bunch, packed with state-of-the-art equipment (hockey treadmills!), but you'll still be most impressed by the change you'll see in your kid's skills - and in your kid. &gt;&gt;&gt; 789 East Lancaster Avenue, Villanova, 610-525-2300; 1490 Berlin Road, Cherry Hill, 856-216-9090; 700 Lawrence Road, West Chester, 610-436-1600; summitsportstc.com. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sports Radio Personality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or maybe that should be sports radio non-personality, since there are days when we wonder whether WIP's wonderfully apathetic Al Morganti is even registering a pulse. The morning show co-host-who years ago masterminded the jump that he and Inquirer buddy Angelo Cataldi made from print to radio-is the perfect low-key complement to the loudmouthed Cataldi. In fact, his refusal to get riled about nearly anything lends some much-need perspective to the ridiculous arguments that break out on the show. Whatever. It's just sports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Patient Woman in Radio</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Preston &amp; Steve Show's Kathy Romano puts up with all the wisecracks, hijinx, and generally ridiculous (and hilarious) behavior of her on-air buddies, and she does it with grace and charm (not to mention her own occasional zaniness). God bless you, Kathy-a lesser woman might have blown her brains out by now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TV Newscast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None. Are we the only ones who've basically stopped watching? (Judging by the slowly deflating ratings, apparently not.) The Web, wi-fi and the 24-hour news cycle have finally finished what two decades of it-bleeds-it-leads journalism started: making local TV news utterly irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

The highlight of Pennsylvania's star turn in the presidential primaries was Torsella giving the Colbert Report host a televised tour of the Constitution Center (where he's president and CEO). Torsella was not only the perfect straight man, but the two got into a hilarious mock wrestling match when Colbert repeatedly tried to sneak his book into various exhibits. Civics hasn't been this funny since Ricky Mariano was on City Council. See Phillymag.com/colbert.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took heart and balls for Fran Dunphy to trade his sweet gig coaching hoops at Penn for the far more challenging one at Temple, but in his second season Dunphy put his stamp on the program, winning the Atlantic 10 championship and returning the Owls to the NCAA tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pro Coach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He looks more like a rising young associate at a Center City law firm than like a hockey coach, but John Stevens got his team to play hard when it counted. Tough call between him and the Sixers' Mo Cheeks for best coach, but the Flyers' unexpected run to the conference finals tips the scales in favor of Stevens.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHYY president and CEO Bill Marrazzo was already one of the nation's highest-paid public broadcasting execs-despite leading a station that defines mediocrity (and that's being generous). Now it seems that Mr. Bill is going to receive a lump-sum payment next summer of at least $280,000-on top of his already lofty salary.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Philadelphia Gay News. When Barack Obama declined the paper's interview requests (as he did with local gay media around the country), Mark Segal and Co. ran blank space where Obama's words should have gone. Cheap? Silly?

But in an era of increasing newspaper irrelevance, it got attention, made a point, and achieved its purpose: At press time, Segal was in talks with the Obama camp, who wanted to set up an interview. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pat Burrell. If he continues to be as productive as he's been for the past 150 ball games, Burrell could end up as one of the most beloved players in Phillie history-a guy who stoically withstood several seasons' worth of boos before turning his game around. If there's anything Philly loves more than a winner, it's a loser who knows he's a loser but keeps fighting and turns into a winner, even though secretly he might still be kind of a loser.

From his debut in 1977 (the Phillies' answer to the San Diego Chicken) all the way up to today (he has his own MySpace page), the Phanatic has shown spirit, spunk, a sense of humor, and the ability to look good even while not wearing pants.

But $5 million in renovations later, the 1928 cinema has been transformed into a modern movie palace. Owners preserved much of its architectural glory (terra-cotta tiles, a dramatic proscenium arch, a 30-foot neon replica of the original sign), and overhauled the rest with plush new seats, state-of-the-art technology, and creative programming that includes not only art-house fare and the occasional first-run blockbuster, but also an impressive repertory lineup.

But Montgomery County's Pinball Parlour - about a half-hour north of King of Prussia - has dozens, including 1981's Hyperball, 1964's Zig Zag, and the 1990s favorite The Addams Family.

Consider: Each of the 800 rooms features a water view and 400-thread-count sheets; a staff of 800 caters to your every need (nightly bed turndowns, fresh newspapers brought to the pool, room service cuisine by chef Geoffrey Zakarian); five immaculately kept pools - indoor and out - are gorgeous and inviting; and the Immersion spa offers, among other services, a blissful four-handed massage (see page 130) and what may be the most gratifying facial you'll ever have (ask for Irina).

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sliders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blue Sage proves that expensive kobe beef isn't the key to Philly's new favorite sandwich, the slider. (Besides, who could top Barclay Prime at its own beefy game?) At this Bucks County veg spot, meaty hunks of grilled eggplant and zucchini are topped with crisp baby arugula leaves, sprinkled with a salty Maytag blue cheese, and sandwiched in a miniature sesame brioche roll generously coated with the house-made chipotle mayo. All that and the accompanying mound of cooked-to-order yucca fries will satisfy even the staunchest carnivore. &gt;&gt;&gt; Blue Sage Vegetarian Grille, 772 Second Street Pike, Southampton, 215-942-8888, bluesagegrille.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wine List </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1990, Ristorante Panorama's wine list has been one of the best in the country -  and one of Philadelphia's  best-kept secrets. How could Philly wine drinkers overlook the bar's astonishing wall of wine, a high-tech preservation system that allows Panorama to offer 120 wines by the full glass and in tasting portions? The bar is tucked discreetly into the Penn's View Hotel on a quiet Old City block, but that's no excuse for bypassing the immense Italian and international offerings, all at memorably modest prices. &gt;&gt;&gt; 14 North Front Street, 215-922-7600, pennsviewhotel.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Chef</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philly has a reputation for losing its brightest rising stars to cities with bigger opportunities. But hometown girl Jennifer Carroll, chef de cuisine at 10 Arts in the Ritz-Carlton, proves that sometimes they bring their talent back home. After a five-year run at Eric Ripert's Le Bernardin, Carroll jumped at the chance to helm his new outpost here. The chefs worked together to develop a Philly-flavored menu that Carroll executes with formidable skill. Dishes range from the unpretentious and craveable pretzel bites served with house-made dips to the sorts of elegant seafood preparations that have made Le Bernardin so famous. (Try the Pennsylvania trout in brown butter sauce.) Carroll could have landed a job almost anywhere. We're ecstatic she's back in Philly. &gt;&gt;&gt; 10 South Broad Street, 215-523-8273, 10arts.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brunch </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's bacon-and-eggs-and-pancakes brunch, and then there's brunch at Lacroix. Here, brunch means an expansive dining-room buffet of foie gras ganache, fennel ceviche, oysters mignonette, scallop sausage and pork belly fried rice. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, carving stations and chafing dishes fan out, offering roasted capon, lamb gyro, individual frittata, tomato and lobster bruschetta ... There are more dishes than anyone could sample in one visit to this gastronomic playground - but don't let that stop you from trying. &gt;&gt;&gt; 210 West Rittenhouse Square, 215-790-2533, lacroixrestaurant.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Restaurant, City</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before opening Zahav, restaurateur Steve Cook and chef Michael Solomonov took the kitchen crew on a tour of Israel to inspire the cooking. Their excitement is contagious. The pan-global cuisine of Israel, Solomonov's native country, is shockingly simple for fare so delicious, and while there's a laid-back vibe in Zahav's airy dining room, where meals are served family-style, the food is flawless. Passion is palpable in every bite of the crisp, bright salads, creamy hummus and earthy skewers that make up a meal at the city's best new restaurant. &gt;&gt;&gt; 237 St. James Place, 215-625-8800, zahavrestaurant.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Restaurant, 'Burbs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maia is easily the Main Line's most anticipated venue of the decade. (We have been expecting it to open since early '07.) Buzz surrounding the restaurant's ambitious organic-European-Nordic menu was exceeded only by the scope of its concept: It's a cafe, a market, a bistro, a meeting venue and a fine-dining restaurant. When chefs (and brothers) Patrick and Terence Feury finally opened the doors this summer, the restaurant delivered, from the cafe's lattes and pastries, to the beer and charcuterie at the informal bistro, to the all-out feast in the seafood-focused fine-dining restaurant. &gt;&gt;&gt;789 East Lancaster Avenue, Villanova, 610-527-4888, tastemaia.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Classic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marra's Everyday Pizza &gt;&gt;&gt; East Passyunk Avenue has seen a dramatic revitalization in recent years. But in the midst of welcome new shops, bars and restaurants, there's one place that should never change: Marra's has been serving the same recipes for thin-crust pizza since founder Salvatore Marra arrived in Philadelphia from Naples 80 years ago. Today, his grandchildren helm the brick oven (the restaurant's original, built from bricks imported from Mount Vesuvius), and the exterior was recently renovated, but the pies, with their slightly charred crusts and traditional toppings, still bring pure pizza nirvana. &gt;&gt;&gt; 1734 East Passyunk Avenue, 215-463-9249, marras1.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best beer around (and there are a lot of them) comes from a can. Sly Fox's brewers know that modern cans protect their pale German-style lager Pikeland Pils better than a bottle. We know that cans chill faster, the better for an afternoon spent relaxing with this seriously good brew. Its citrusy hops, malty barley core and bracing, bitter finish are sure to make you forget that other lager. &gt;&gt;&gt; Available at Sly Fox Brewing Company, 519 Kimberton Road, Phoenixville, 610-935-4540, slyfoxbeer.com, and other area beer distributors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New BYOB</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, a new BYOB with the polish to compete with the city's liquor-license holders. Husband/wife duo Gene and Amy Giuffi scrubbed up and remodeled the tiny Caf&eacute; Sud storefront before launching cash-only Cochon (translation: &quot;pig&quot;), with a menu of hearty French classics like a slow-braised pork shoulder topped with a runny poached egg, which has become the signature dish here. But even non-porcine preparations (like perfectly cooked scallops) show a deft hand at the stove reminiscent of the days when BYOBs were more famous for their food than the freedom from bar tabs.  &gt;&gt;&gt; 801 East Passyunk Avenue, 215-923-7675, cochonbyob.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fried Chicken</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fried chicken search was an exhausting one, but dozens of legs, breasts and thighs later, BYOB Ms. Tootsie's Soul Food Cafe is the where-have-you-been-all-my-meals winner. Skip the Southern-sweet sides and head straight for the meat of the matter: A shatteringly crisp and pleasingly salty crust coats tender and juicy chicken. &gt;&gt;&gt; 1314 South Street, 215-731-9045, kevenparker.net. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bar Trend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hate the pretentious pseudo-scientific word - mixologists - but love the drinks. This new class of talented and adventurous bartenders - Katie Loeb at Bella Vista's Chick's Caf&eacute;, Stephen Seibert at Old City's Amada, the crew at Midtown Village's Apothecary - is mixing up smart cocktails with the same careful attention to quality that we've long expected from the city's chefs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steakhouse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The imposing doors and dim entryway add to the exclusive vibe of Barclay Prime, the corner Rittenhouse steakhouse that feels novel no matter how many times you've been. But the food and service are what really send this steak place - in a chophouse-laden region - to the top of our list: attentive waiters, first-rate beef, and lick-the-plate sides, like creamed spinach and house-made tater tots. &gt;&gt;&gt; 237 South 18th Street, 215-732-7560, barclayprime.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our gratitude abounds for Bindi, Marcie Turney's sleek new Indian BYOB in Midtown Village. Her creative interpretations of traditional curries fill a gap in Philadelphia's international food scene with modernized, upscale Indian eats. Complex dried spice mixtures, ground daily, are an authentic - but not overheated - backdrop for inspired updates on vindaloos and masalas. &gt;&gt;&gt; 105 South 13th Street, 215-922-6061, bindibyob.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entr&eacute;e</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We loved Pif, David Ansill's now-defunct tiny French gem, but we might love &quot;Pif Night&quot; even more. Each Sunday (on hiatus until after Labor Day) at his current restaurant, Ansill, the chef resurrects Pif with a $45 three-course French prix-fixe menu that often includes the best dish we've tasted all year: Ansill's rack of lamb with potato galette. The perfectly cooked and tender lamb rests on a crisp-creamy potato pancake, and the whole dish is drizzled with lamb jus infused with rich bone marrow. It's homey, hearty comfort-food perfection. &gt;&gt;&gt; 627 South 3rd Street, 215-627-2485, ansill-foodandwine.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BYOB</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le Bec-Fin meets the BYOB at Gilmore's, and we couldn't be happier with the odd marriage. The food - both classic and contemporary dishes - shows all the careful refinement you'd expect from a Perrier prot&eacute;g&eacute;, but the atmosphere is Wednesday-night-dinner relaxed. And the prices: There are entr&eacute;es at Le Bec that cost more than Gilmore's weekday $35 four-course bistro menu. &gt;&gt;&gt; 133 East Gay Street, West Chester, 610-431-2800, gilmoresrestaurant.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small Plates</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The small-plates trend is here to stay, despite those who decry the meager portions, inflated prices and lack of imagination of some tapas-takeoff restaurants. But no place executes small plates better than Supper. Supper's genius lies in its inherently American dishes. Sure, irresistible nibbles like Moroccan-spiced boneless chicken wings flaunt international influences, but their core of deliciousness is completely familiar. Ditto the ham and butter tartine, sea scallops with uni butter, and pork belly with lentils and wine sauce. Unlike less successful variations on tapas, these dainty dishes deliver real satisfaction. We guarantee you won't want a slice of pizza after dinner's over. &gt;&gt;&gt; 926 South Street, 215-592-8180, supperphilly.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restaurant Trend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding more seats to an already busy restaurant can overtax a kitchen, but we applaud this year's smart and smooth restaurant expansions - Osteria glassed in its outdoor patio, Tinto broke through a wall, and La Viola rented more space across the street - all designed to make diners more comfortable and reservations easier to score. Now, if only Talula's Table, that 12-seater in Kennett Square, would get into the expansion act ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restaurant, City</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's left to say in praise of Osteria, Marc Vetri and Jeff Benjamin's Italian gem that has, improbably, brought Center City nightlife to North Broad Street? Nothing. But we'll happily repeat our usual dinner order: the exuberant but exactingly cooked vegetable antipasto plate, a thin-crust pizza from the fiery brick oven, a quirky ceramic bowl filled with tangles of house-made candele pasta, and the bundino, that brilliant, sweet hazelnut-and-cream take on, yes, polenta. &gt;&gt;&gt;  640 North Broad Street, 215-763-0920, osteriaphilly.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restaurant, 'Burbs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's be honest. When someone raves about a BYOB in Conshohocken, next to the Great American Pub, you think: Sure, it's good ... for Conshohocken. That reaction is the only reason we can still get reservations at miniature Blackfish. Charles Roman's simple dining room and confident cooking - bouillabaisse with crusty bread, house-smoked salmon over a deep-fried egg - would earn raves in any neighborhood. &gt;&gt;&gt; 119 Fayette Street, Conshohocken, 610-397-0888, blackfishrestaurant.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farmers' Market</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The farmers' market isn't a new phenomenon in Philadelphia - thank you, Food Trust and Farm to City, for years of neighborhood markets - but the Trust's year-old Headhouse Farmers' Market is the gold standard. Sunday morning finds the Headhouse Square shambles filled with local and delicious everything: Griggstown chicken potpie, sunflowers from Young's Garden, prosciutto-gruy&egrave;re croissants from Wild Flower Bakery, and all the perfectly ripe produce you can carry in your canvas bag. &gt;&gt;&gt; Sunday, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., 2nd and Lombard streets, thefoodtrust.org. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cupcakes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maki Evans and Heather Carter of Cupcakes Gourmet only have one location, in a nondescript Frazer strip mall, but the duo is whipping out cupcakes so sweet, they're worth the drive from anywhere: Sturdy cake in more than 20 flavors stands up to a heavenly, heavy buttercream icing made with real Madagascar bourbon vanilla and cream cheese. Just be sure to get enough to last you the ride home. &gt;&gt;&gt; 288 Lancaster Avenue, Frazer, 484-318-8057, cupcakesgourmet.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power Lunch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, you'll still see members of the Old Guard noshing at the Palm, but the new game in town is at the sleeker, more intimate Capital Grille, where, as one local player puts it, &quot;You don't have to have your caricature on the wall to belong.&quot; Look for the Mayor presiding over grilled salmon and diet Cokes (he saves the chardonnay for happy hour), Wachovia prez Hugh Long talking numbers as he downs a filet-topped Caesar, and indicted State Senator Vince Fumo, who of course has his own booth, where, we hear, he's laying off the red meat post-heart-attack in favor of the grilled chicken. &gt;&gt;&gt; 1338 Chestnut Street, 215-545-9588, thecapitalgrille.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dessert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someone forgot to tell the pastry chef at Nineteen that this city lives on cr&egrave;me br&Atilde;&raquo;l&eacute;e and molten chocolate cake. An excellent oversight. Instead of the usual, finales here include dramatically deconstructed carrot cake, a delicate steamed lemon genoise (the result is halfway between a pudding and a cupcake), and a trippy take on the banana split. The banana cr&egrave;me br&Atilde;&raquo;l&eacute;e at the bottom is as close to classic as the menu gets. &gt;&gt;&gt; Park Hyatt at the Bellevue, 200 South Broad Street, 19th floor, 215-790-1919, parkhyatt.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tomato Pie</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No disrespect to Sinatra - the name Tony Roni gives to its mozzarella-and-basil-topped version - but when it comes to tomato pie, basic is best, nowhere more so than here. The thin-crusted Originale is simply the tomato-iest tomato pie we've tasted. &gt;&gt;&gt; 4504  City Avenue, 215-877-7664, tonyroni.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gourmet Pizza</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not long ago, Osteria chef Jeff Michaud taught a pizza-making class. Ha! The only thing you need to know is this: If you want these thin, crisp, flavorful pizzas - ingredients include a special blend of Italian flours and a 650-degree wood-fired oven - you just have to go to Osteria. Topped with tender scallops and house-made sausage or bright tomatoes and creamy fresh mozz, these perfect pies will change the way you think about pizza. &gt;&gt;&gt; 640 North Broad Street, 215-763-0920, osteriaphilly.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Butcher Shop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Main Line Prime isn't your everyday butcher shop - unless you're lucky enough to be eating richly marbled Duroc pork and gamey, grass-fed Jamison lamb for a Tuesday-night meal - but there's no better place to find luxury dinner-party meats, well chosen, well cared for and well cut, than Derek Davis's surprisingly unpretentious Main Line shop. &gt;&gt;&gt; 18 Greenfield Avenue, Ardmore, 610-645-9500, mainlineprime.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inventive Cocktails</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How perfectly Philly: modern cocktails served up in an old-fashioned tin-ceiling taproom. At Chick's Caf&eacute;, you'll find mixologist Katie Loeb behind the bar - and behind the fresh and flavorful cocktail menu. Her house-made herb infusions and seasonal fruit syrups star in standout summer refreshers like the Proven&ccedil;al martini, a gin-based number laced with lavender syrup and grapefruit bitters, and the Front Stoop lemonade, spiked with gin and fragrant with Thai basil syrup. &gt;&gt;&gt; 614 South 7th Street, 215-625-3700, chickscafe.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steak</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This fall will see an invasion of steakhouses in Philadelphia, already a carnivore heaven. But it's hard to believe the cow has anything better to offer than the enormous, lush porterhouse/T-bone combo on the menu at Rae. At well over two pounds (for $180), this slab of steak, sourced from Pennsylvania's justly famed Four Story Hill Farm and served with mounds of smoked onion rings and fingerling fries, can feed a whole table - though chef Daniel Stern reports that most people refuse to share. &gt;&gt;&gt; Cira Centre, 2929 Arch Street, 215-922-3839, rae-restaurant.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beer Bar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teresa's Next Door is everything we want in a bar - great vibe, great beer, great food. The connoisseur's menu of little-known draft beers is as impressive and varied as the pages-long bottle list, so you'll find the perfect suds to wash down a dinner of crispy artichokes with a lemon vinaigrette, garlicky mussels, and cinnamon-rubbed oven-roasted wings. &gt;&gt;&gt; 126 North Wayne Avenue, Wayne, 610-293-0119. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wine Bar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a time when the words &quot;wine bar&quot; had negative, nose-in-the-air connotations. Then came Tria, with its casual approach to the grape. Fanciful, evocative descriptions make this wine list a pleasure to read, and careful editing ensures every wine on it - from the &quot;zippy whites&quot; to the &quot;sociable reds&quot; - is a pleasure to drink. Plus: Beer and cheese get the same loving treatment.  &gt;&gt;&gt; 123 South  18th Street, 215-972-8742, and 1137 Spruce Street, 215-629-9200; triacafe.com. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tapas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2005, Jose Garces brought the small-plates craze to Philadelphia with his flagship Spanish tapas outlet Amada. And three years later, his freshly sliced charcuterie and perfect tortilla Espa&Atilde;&plusmn;ola still rule the genre. Fans of this food have only multiplied over time; prime Saturday-night reservations are still booked six weeks out. &gt;&gt;&gt; 217 Chestnut Street, 215-625-2450, amadarestaurant.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appetizers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A multi-course meal at James is worth the splurge, but a low-key nosh in its classy lounge ranks as one of the city's top treats. The best taste of chef James Burke's talents: the seasonal canap&eacute;s, a treasure trove likely to include miniature portions of soup, candied vegetables, ceviche, p&Atilde;&cent;t&eacute; and house-cured charcuterie. Other must-have apps include handmade pastas and artisanal cheeses. &gt;&gt;&gt; 824 South 8th Street, 215-629-4980, jameson8th.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milkshake</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tiny lunch counter Snow White proves that a milkshake doesn't need to be fancy-or expensive-to be delicious. Jack and Jill vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup and Lehigh Valley Dairy milk are the only ingredients in the city's best black-and-white. The secret is the patient staff, who never rush things, mixing ingredients until they meld into a sweet and creamy shake. &gt;&gt;&gt; 901 Chestnut Street, 215-569-0909. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bagels </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Square residents reminisce about the bagels they used to get at Rittenhouse Market-small, chewy rounds a world away from the pillowy bagels popular these days-they're talking about Roling's. Thankfully, the hand-formed bagels can still be found in the bins at Roling's small basement bakery in Elkins Park-and early on Friday mornings at Maxx's Produce near Rittenhouse. &gt;&gt;&gt; Roling's, 7848 Montgomery Avenue, Elkins Park, 215-635-5524. Maxx's Produce, 225 South 20th Street, 215-735-3644. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yangming Chinese &gt;&gt;&gt; Michael Wei at Main Line mainstay Yangming has consistently delivered sweet-and-spicy gunpowder shrimp, saucy sesame chicken and elaborate Peking duck-with a fork or chopsticks, no judgment-in a comfortable, take-the-parents setting that's been host to birthday, anniversary and graduation celebrations for more than 15 years.  &gt;&gt;&gt; 1051 Conestoga Road, Bryn Mawr, 610-527-3200, yangmingrestaurant.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mexican</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xochitl is a delicious challenge to our notion of what Mexican food is, with dishes centered on lamb, duck and blood sausage, and innovative drinks with cilantro and ancho. But the charming Headhouse Square spot also gives diners the Mexican flavors they crave in killer margaritas, perfectly simple guac and crisp churros. &gt;&gt;&gt; 408 South 2nd Street, 215-238-7280, xochitl-philly.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheese Shop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The options at Downtown Cheese rival any in the city, but it's the knowledgeable and sample-generous staff, led by opinionated owner Jack Morgan, that makes this a must-stop in both the Reading Terminal and Ardmore Farmers markets.  &gt;&gt;&gt; Reading Terminal Market, 12th and Arch streets, 215-351-7412, and Ardmore Farmers Market, Suburban Square, 120 Coulter Avenue, Ardmore, 610-649-8449.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Le Bar Lyonnais French &gt;&gt;&gt; If you're a regular at Le Bec-Fin, this intimate space below the famed dining room has been your pre- (and post-) dinner cocktail destination for almost two decades.

Add us to the list. This West Chester-produced cheese is well-balanced and smooth, with a slightly tangy flavor.  &gt;&gt;&gt; Di Bruno Bros., 1730 Chestnut Street, 215-665-9220, and 930 South 9th Street, 215-922-2876; dibruno.com.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crabcake</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every morning at 4:30, Dan Redner, owner of Star of the Sea Seafood, drives from his West Berlin store to the seafood market on Packer to pick up the freshest domestic crabmeat for his superb, surprisingly healthy crabcakes. You probably already love this no-mayo cake-found at some Jersey Whole Foods and Shore faves like Sea Isle's Mike's Seafood-but we were thrilled to learn that the Redner recipe is available straight from the source, too.  &gt;&gt;&gt; 1004 Industrial Drive, West Berlin, 856-767-5474. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sushi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the simplicity of the sashimi and sushi that has kept us coming back to Sagami for 30 years. In the low-ceilinged, utilitarian dining rooms of this BYOB, carefully sliced sashimi is served without pretense, and maki rolls are-most unfashionably-more about the fish than overwhelming sweet and spicy sauces.  &gt;&gt;&gt; 37 Crescent Boulevard, Collingswood, 856-854-9773. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gourmet Store</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second outpost of Carlino's Specialty Foods, significantly larger and more ambitious than the original Ardmore location, can be overwhelming. But focus on the house-made stuff-fresh and frozen pastas and dozens of sauce options, plus soups, salad dressings, sausages, and an array of delicious antipasto-and you'll have the best-stocked pantry in the city.  &gt;&gt;&gt; 128 West Market Street, West Chester, 610-696-3788, carlinosmarket.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upscale Outdoor Scene</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a city where dining alfresco generally means a table perched on a sidewalk three feet from moving cars, the traffic-free tranquility of Fairmount Park's Water Works Restaurant is like a mini vacation: a place to see the sunset, a place where people-watching is second to bird-watching, a place where even the Schuylkill is romantic.  &gt;&gt;&gt; 640 Water Works Drive, 215-236-9000, thewaterworksrestaurant.com. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casual Outdoor Scene </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think about the best barbecue you ever hosted. Now pretend you made kick-ass jerk instead of burgers, and served fried beef patties instead of potato chips, and you've basically got the Jamaican Jerk Hut. The place is super-casual (a grassy lot on South Street with a deck and painted picnic tables), super-cheap (two people can sup for under $30) and super-fun (BYO coolers of beer; reggae on weekends). Plus: We're not kidding-kick-ass jerk. &gt;&gt;&gt; 1436 South Street, 215-545-8644, jamaicanjerkhutinc.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Event</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after the buzz wore off, it was clear that the 10-day-long debut of Philly Beer Week was a great success. If you weren't among the 15,000 who sipped their way through 300 brew-focused dinners, seminars and tastings, plan now for next year (March 6th-15th) and ensure that the city lives up to the festival's proud claim that Philly is, of course, &quot;The best beer-drinking city in America.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt; Phillybeerweek.org.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barbecue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long lines of Friday-night takeout customers at Pig Daddy's are testament to the rightfully devoted following this three-year-old meat haven has earned for its slaw-slathered Kansas City-style pulled pork sandwiches, brisket, St. Louis spare ribs, succulent sides-like collards and CJ's BBQ Baked Beans-and bargain prices. &gt;&gt;&gt; 693 Burmont Road, Drexel Hill, 610-622-6441, pigdaddysbarbecue.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salad </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Davio's Cheese-steak Spring Roll  &gt;&gt;&gt; It was way back in 2002 that Davio's David Boyle, on a whim, rolled up the heart of the Philly classic and dunked it into a deep fryer. His recipe-chopped steak, provolone, parm and Philadelphia cream cheese tucked inside a lightly fried, paper-thin crust-is so good, it's trademarked. &gt;&gt;&gt; 111 South 17th Street, 215-563-4810, davios.com. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The falooda at Palace at the Ben is, well, a noodle milkshake, an Indian dessert as obscure as it is tasty.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illinois Sen. Barack Obama held a slightly reduced lead over Arizona Sen. John McCain among likely Pennsylvania voters, as new poll results showed movement toward the Republican in three key states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Quinnipiac University Poll conducted from July 23 to July 29, after Mr. Obama's trip to the Middle East and Europe, depicted the Democrat with a lead of 49 percent to 42 percent in the Keystone State. The same organization had reported his Pennsylvania edge last month at 52 percent to 40 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difference between the two findings was not much more than the surveys' 2.7 percentage point error margin, but previous Obama leads also eroded somewhat in Ohio and Florida, resulting in a virtual tie between the presidential contenders in those closely watched states. The Quinnipiac researchers found Mr. Obama leading by 46 percent to 44 percent in each. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New national polls showed similar slippage in Mr. McCain's direction. The Gallup organization's latest daily tracking poll showed Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain in a virtual dead heat, with 45 percent favoring the Democrat and 44 percent for the Republican. A national survey average compiled by the Web site, Pollster.com, showed Mr. Obama leading, 47 percent to 42 percent. A similar aggregation by Realclearpolitics.com puts the average at 46.8 percent for Mr. Obama and 43.9 percent for Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Pennsylvania, Mr. Obama led among both men and women. Independent voters broke in his favor by a margin of 49 percent to 38 percent. The candidates were essentially tied among white voters, with 46 percent for Mr. McCain and 45 percent for Mr. Obama. White men in the Pennsylvania sample narrowly favored the Republican, 48 percent to 45 percent, while Mr. Obama was favored by white women, 45 percent to 44 percent. Black voters continued to support the Democrat by the overwhelming margin of 91 percent to 1 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain had substantial leads in the center of the state and in its northwest corner. Mr. Obama's strongest regions were Philadelphia and its suburbs. The Democrat was ahead in the state's largest city by 70 percent to 16 percent. In the suburbs, it was 54 percent to 38 percent in Mr. Obama's favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps surprisingly, Mr. Obama led in Allegheny County by the bare margin of 47 percent to 45 percent, the same result found in the generally more rural and socially conservative counties elsewhere in southwestern Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Obama still has a comfortable 7-point lead, but, as in the primary, he still is struggling among white, blue-collar workers,&quot; Clay Richards, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said in a statement released with the survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a week in which race flared in the charges and counter-charges of the campaigns, 9 out of 10 likely voters in all three states said the fact that Mr. Obama could be the first African-American president made no difference in their decision. And those who acknowledged race as an influence in their choice were about as likely to cite it as a positive as a negative factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's age, in fact, was significantly more likely to be cited as a negative factor than Mr. Obama's race. Twenty-five percent of Pennsylvania voters said the Republican's age made them less likely to choose him, a finding similar to the results in Florida and Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reflecting their close contest, the presidential rivals elicited similar favorable-unfavorable ratios in all three states. In Pennsylvania, 54 percent of those surveyed said they had a favorable impression of each candidate, while 27 percent said they had an unfavorable view of Mr. Obama, and 28 percent an unfavorable view of Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago, the Democratic challenger, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, carried Pennsylvania narrowly over President Bush. By a small margin, Mr. Obama was doing a better job of holding onto the Kerry voters than Mr. McCain was in retaining Bush supporters. The Bush voters now favor Mr. McCain, 77 percent to 16 percent, while Mr. Kerry's former backers broke 80 percent to 13 percent for Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Max Bernstein had a band, the Actual, with a catchy song called &quot;This Is the Worst Day of My Life,&quot; a slot on the Warped Tour, and a gig opening for heavy hitters Velvet Revolver on a national tour. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What he lacked was a sense of purpose.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Somebody once asked me, 'Why are you in a band?' &quot; says the Los Angeles singer and guitarist, who will bring his new Internet-distributed agit-rock outfit, Max &amp; the Marginalized, to the Trocadero tomorrow and the Reef in Wilmington on Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I really didn't have an answer. 'I don't know. We're another band that wants to make some good songs and have people like them'? When we were out on the Warped Tour with eight million other bands, trying to get something self-aggrandizing going, it just seemed a little vapid to me.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So when the Actual came off the road last October, Bernstein, 28, who's the son of former Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein and author-screenwriter Nora Ephron, sat down and wrote three bracing, politically agitated rock songs.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wrote the songs really fast and recorded them right away,&quot; he recalls. &quot;And I immediately knew that this is what I wanted to do.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus was born Max &amp; The Marginalized, which Bernstein describes as &quot;an op-ed in the form of a rock band&quot; and also includes bassist Dave Watrous and drummer Jon Ryggy. As its Web site explains, M &amp; M is &quot;a band and a blog&quot; that posts a newly written and recorded topical song on Thursday or Friday of every week.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tunes - which can be found at www.huffingtonpost.com/max-and-the-marginalized - make no bones about reflecting the political point of view of Bernstein, which he describes as &quot;pro-choice, anti-death penalty, for good immigration reform, low taxes for poor people, high taxes for rich people: the standard progressive platform.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those first three songs - of 43 posted so far - get Bernstein's drift. &quot;Standing in the Driveway Holding Cardboard in the Rain&quot; opposes the death penalty. &quot;No Kisses, No Cameras&quot; is about the military's not allowing photographs of coffins of American soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan as they arrive at Dover Air Force base in Delaware.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with &quot;Even When It Ends It Won't Be Over,&quot; Bernstein - who has a day job in L. A. as a new media consultant for a veterans' rights organization - details the hardships that veterans of the country's two current wars will face even after the conflicts end.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(A fourth early tune, &quot;Dana, Dana,&quot; showcased Bernstein's not-so-serious side: It's about the moral complexities inherent in a left-leaning wag having a crush on White House press secretary Dana Perino.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M &amp; M doesn't have a record deal, which is fine, Bernstein explained in an interview from a tour stop in Boston. &quot;It was nice having an agent and a manager and being on Scott Weiland's label&quot; - Weiland, then with Velvet Revolver, put out the Actual's 2007 album, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In Stitches</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - &quot;but it's also nice having songs that have a bigger purpose.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernstein, who grew up in New York, mostly with his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Sleepless in Seattle</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-scriptwriting mother (rather than his Watergate-scandal-exposing father), says he's even happy that &quot;Worst Day&quot; never became a hit. &quot;I heard Lemmy say how much he hates playing 'Ace of Spades,' and how if he had one wish it would be to never play it again.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He knew posting his often amusing songs on the Web was the way to go. &quot;If you're going to be a political band, you need to respond quickly to things. We don't have a huge audience [the band's blog hits typically number in the hundreds] but let's say that we did. How can you write a song that has a chance to make a difference, and then sit on it for six months and wait for the album to come out?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If M &amp; M approached it that way, songs like &quot;Consider the Source,&quot; which assails John McCain's credibility (as the candidate's nose grows, Pinocchio style, in a video), or &quot;Not the Thing That I Bought,&quot; which voices buyer's remorse over Barack Obama's shift to the political center, would have passed their sell-by date before they were loosed on the public. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his list of favorite political artists, Bernstein names Ted Leo, Nas, the Clash, Billy Bragg, Public Enemy and especially Australian rockers Midnight Oil, which he considers &quot;the best political band of all time. They wrote great songs about aboriginal rights in Australia and sold millions of records doing it, because they were awesome.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The band is called Max &amp; the Marginalized, he says, because &quot;normal voices of dissent - and I'm a normal voice, not a radical one - have been pushed to the margins.&quot; He also likes that &quot;it sounds like a '50s rock band or something that's really punk-rock.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And though M &amp; M's sound doesn't move far from mainstream, Bernstein says that, &quot;ideologically speaking,&quot; they're punks. &quot;We're about immediacy and message more than execution,&quot; he says. &quot;And we're off the cuff and spontaneous with no regard for commercial viability.&quot; The band sells T-shirts and CDs at shows and takes PayPal donations on the Web, but as expected, &quot;the economic model is not working out. Nobody gets into this business to make money.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are other protest bands about - Leftover Crack, for whom M &amp; M will open at the Troc, is one. But they are relatively uncommon, considering the United States has been at war since 2001. The reason is simple, Bernstein says: There's no draft.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In America, most rock-and-roll is made by upper-class white kids like myself,&quot; Bernstein says. &quot;There are exceptions, but for the most part, the people who are fighting the war are not coming from the same communities. The war is out of sight from the culture.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernstein is a fan of political cartoonists such as Tom Tomorrow, Pat Oliphant and Jeff Danziger. &quot;They're really my heroes. That's what I aspire to be doing. I'm not out to break a story,&quot; he says, adding with a laugh. &quot;I'm just another person who wants to voice his opinion and not do research.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the end of the primaries, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain have run more television commercials in Philadelphia than in any other media market in the country.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they have spent more money on ads in Pennsylvania than in any other state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those findings, which underline the area's importance in the election, come from the University of Wisconsin Advertising Project, which monitors political advertising in conjunction with TNS Media Intelligence/CMAG. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commercials for the two major-party presidential candidates appeared 3,311 times on Philadelphia television from June 3 to last Saturday. Next on the list was Detroit at 2,870, followed by Cleveland; Grand Rapids, Mich.; Cincinnati; and Harrisburg. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of money, the two candidates - along with the Republican National Committee - spent $10,319,000 in Pennsylvania, nearly $4 million more than in Ohio, which was second. Rounding out the top five were Michigan, Florida and Virginia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counting ads bought by his party, McCain has outspent Obama in Pennsylvania by about 3-2, a sign of the importance the GOP puts in trying to turn the state from blue to red. McCain has spent far more in Pennsylvania than in any other state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania ranks second for Obama in spending, trailing only Florida, which he hopes to turn from red to blue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all, Obama has spent about $27 million on television and McCain $21 million in the last eight weeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political scientist Ken Goldstein, who runs the project, said the results showed that the candidates were focusing on traditional battlegrounds - including Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio - despite all the talk about expanding the playing field this year. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Larry Eichel; Inquirer Senior Writer</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATIONAL; P-com News; Pg. A01</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though the price of oil has gone down slightly in recent days, the nation's energy crisis has become the top domestic issue in the presidential campaign, with both major candidates seeking to turn it to their advantage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, who talks about reducing the demand for energy and improving efficiency, sees the topic as a way to tie John McCain to the oil companies, which are very unpopular with many voters.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, a supporter of offshore drilling and other ways to increase domestic production, is using it to make the argument that Obama is arrogant and out of touch with the pressing concerns of average people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican hammered home that point yesterday with a new commercial that includes images of Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, and the thousands who turned out for Obama last week in Berlin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's the biggest celebrity in the world,&quot; the announcer says. &quot;But, is he ready to lead? With gas prices soaring, Barack Obama says no to offshore drilling, and says he'll raise taxes on electricity. Higher taxes, more foreign oil, that's the real Obama.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This ad is the fourth in a tit-for-tat exchange between the candidates that has played out this month in battleground-state media markets, Philadelphia included. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most recent Obama spot, now showing locally, shows a clip from an earlier McCain&nbsp;ad attacking the Democrat on energy. An announcer then asks in disbelief:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is blaming Barack Obama for gas prices? The same old politics. Barack Obama thinks high gas prices deserve serious answers, and a serious plan: Crack down on oil speculators, raise mileage standards and fast-track alternative fuels.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the campaign trail, the language is getting ever more pointed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few days ago, McCain described his rival as the &quot;Dr. No&quot; of America's energy future. &quot;Sen. Obama believes that every domestic energy source has a problem,&quot; McCain has said several times in his town-hall meetings. &quot;I believe every energy source needs to be part of the solution.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, in Springfield, Mo., Obama asked where McCain had been on energy policy for the last 25 years. The Illinois senator called expanded offshore drilling a &quot;scheme&quot; that would not bring down the price of gasoline for years but would have the oil companies &quot;making out like bandits again.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Obama: &quot;I know how bad people are hurting. If I thought by drilling offshore we could solve our problem, I'd do it. . . . The point is, this is not real. I know it's tempting . . . but it's not real.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the rhetoric suggests, the two candidates approach the energy problem in different ways - even though both offer multifaceted plans that acknowledge the complexity of the situation and the difficulty of doing much about it in the immediate future. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's emphasis is using technology to reduce energy consumption and to spur development of renewable fuel sources such as wind, solar, tide and biofuels.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He proposes investing $150 billion over 10 years on &quot;climate-friendly energy supplies.&quot; He would make energy efficiency and conservation a top priority. He estimates that those efforts could produce five million new jobs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To help consumers in the short run, Obama proposes a $1,000 tax cut for most families and an energy rebate of unspecified magnitude as part of an overall economic-stimulus package.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also talks about alternative energy sources. He has proposed a $300 million prize to the &quot;creator of a battery package [for motor vehicles] of a size, capacity, cost and power far surpassing existing technology.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his priority is on the supply side. He would allow a new round of offshore drilling - he opposed such drilling until last month - and would revive the nuclear-power industry with the aim of building 45 new plants by 2030. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States now has 104 nuclear reactors, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute. No new plants have come on line since 1996.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's position on nuclear power is not clear-cut. While not dismissing it as a possibility, his plan states that &quot;there is no future&quot; for nuclear power unless issues such as the storage of the waste and the security of the fuel are addressed first. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans say that the energy issue, as currently framed, is a winner for their candidate. As Obama acknowledged in Missouri yesterday, polls show that a majority of Americans favor offshore drilling. The ratio is nearly 2-1 in some surveys. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, polls show that voters accept expanded use of nuclear power as part of the energy solution, although it is not among their favorite options. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the political conversation about energy, both in Congress and in the campaign, has concerned how much allowing more offshore drilling would affect current prices - even though the drilling would take time to produce oil. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economist and McCain supporter, said Monday that in the marketplace, anything seen as affecting long-term oil supplies had &quot;an immediate impact on today's prices.&quot; McCain has not said how much he thought prices might fall. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said experts tell him that the offshore drilling wouldn't produce any oil for seven years and would then reduce prices by a few cents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a report last year by the Energy Department's Energy Information Administration, &quot;access to the Pacific, Atlantic and eastern Gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> RNC Head Vows Strong Pa. Push for McCain&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee chairman yesterday promised  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a strong effort to win Pennsylvania for John McCain and said he thought the Arizona  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">senator was a good match for the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Robert &quot;Mike&quot; Duncan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cited Gov. Rendell's recent assessment of McCain. Rendell, a Democrat, earlier this week called McCain &quot;as appealing a Republican candidate as they've run </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 20-odd years.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">&quot;The Philadelphia suburbs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are really important to us,&quot; Duncan said in a phone interview, &quot;and we've  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">got a candidate who appeals to independent voters. I think we match  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">up extremely well in Pennsylvania.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Today, Duncan plans</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to visit the McCain/ </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican headquarters for Southeastern Pennsylvania in Blue Bell. He will meet with party leaders from the state and county level, encouraging their use of new technology that allows for more effective targeting of voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">&quot;We'll be outspent,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> so we know we've got to be smarter,&quot; Duncan said. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Dixie Chicks and other haters, there's been a whole lot of Toby Keith not to like. The big, strappin' Oklahoman has cranked out six albums over the past six years -- five of which debuted at No. 1 or 2 on the Billboard Top 200 -- and another one is due in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only that, next week fans can see him on the big screen in &quot;Beer for My Horses,&quot; a film he co-wrote. That's all in addition to being one of country music's most consistent summer road warriors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where's he find the time? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've cut it down,&quot; he says of the touring. &quot;We only do 60 cities. That leaves me 300 days a year to do something else&quot; -- just to put a grin on the face of all the folks who like him and irritate all the folks who don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the forthcoming album, Keith is pretty low-key -- &quot;That's second nature to me. Whatever I wrote last year is what I recorded this year&quot; -- but he's particularly excited about one ballad that he says, &quot;is different than anything I've ever done, that kind of has a pop quality to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movie seems to be more his baby at the moment. In 2005, he played against type as a country star down on his luck in &quot;Broken Bridges.&quot; In &quot;Beer for My Horses,&quot; named for one of his songs with Willie Nelson, he plays a small-town deputy sheriff trying to break up a crystal meth ring and win the heart of an old flame. It's a mix of action, romance and wacky comedy, the last part courtesy of comedian Rodney Carrington and a dog with gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole thing's about the toast,&quot; Keith says. &quot;When I was a kid growing up in the Southwest I worked for a rodeo company. There was an old man who had an Old West original toast: whiskey for my men, beer for my horses. If you bring the spirit of that forward and say the police force or the sheriff would ride out and get the bad guy, bring him to justice and salute the ones who helped you, that's what the title is about. So, we wanted to do the comedy to tip our hats to the old Burt Reynolds movies, and we wanted our characters to be strong and have the toast be a thread that runs through the movie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson has small cameo. The wildly outspoken Ted Nugent, whom Keith met while performing for the troops in Iraq, has a bigger part as, of all things, a mute deputy with an array of weaponry. When you're in the presence of Nugent, you know he's around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, yeah. Ted's a whacko, man,&quot; Keith says. &quot;I was really concerned about Hollywood meets Ted Nugent, with their extreme difference in philosophies. Everyone came away finding him charming. Ted's a good friend of mine, and Ted's not a hater. Yeah, he's got a strong agenda and he carries a gun, but he's never pulled it on anyone. He can be dangerous if you try to tread on him. But he doesn't bring the hate to the table. He's so fun, he kept everybody in stitches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The piece of video we're not going to see from Keith is the much-anticipated global warming commercial with the Dixie Chicks, part of Al Gore's campaign to pair celebrities who don't see eye-to-eye on other issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith says he's a &quot;right-wrong guy&quot; not a &quot;right-left guy&quot; and doesn't see the reason for politics in issues such as gay marriage and global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the world needs savin' and the polar caps are melting, shouldn't we all check in and see if we're destroying this sucker? Al Gore heard me say that and said, 'We're going to get some people on opposite ends of confrontation, like Rosie and Donald Trump and put 'em on the TV.' I said 'I'm in, but good luck gettin' them to do it.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dixie Chicks agreed, but then the conflict arose over scheduling the shoot for the commercial, so it's not happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feud with the Chicks went back to Keith's post-9/11 song, &quot;Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue,&quot; with the infamous line, &quot;We'll put a boot in your ass/it's the American way.&quot; The Chicks' Natalie Maines had called the song &quot;ignorant,&quot; and the battle raged on from there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Keith has a regret about the song, it's that it stands out so much among his others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's amazing that I can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer, and one three-minute song carries more weight than all of that combined. You realize that? You know what 50 million spins as a writer compares to? Lennon, the Bee Gees and Billy Joel. I've got a 35 greatest hits in the store right now. There's one song called 'Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue.' Every other song is predominantly non-conservative stuff. It's drinking, womanizin', 'Weed With Willie,' partyin', it's 'Whiskey Girl,' 'Who's Your Daddy' -- and 'boot in your ass' carries all that weight. You can imagine how much it meant to people who needed that song. Whether people hated it or loved it, it left its mark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith still bristles at how the song painted him as a gung-ho right-winger when he's a lifelong Democrat. It also associated him with a war he never supported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First of all, you can't go make everyone understand what you do. Most people who talk about 'Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue' never even heard the song. If you read it word for word, you know what it means: Let's go out and get the people responsible for 9/11. They attacked New York, they attacked the Pentagon. They came and killed a bunch of innocent Americans. Now, two years after that song comes out, we go into Iraq. Now, all of a sudden, I'm responsible for the Iraq War. I can't go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them I have nothing to do with the Iraq War. ... My philosophy on that is I think we need to take care of Afghanistan and get Osama bin Laden. But I'm not going to apologize for being patriotic, and wherever the troops go, I'll go there and play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people can't get past 'boot in your ass.' They think it's a war cry for every war we might get in. Ten years from now, if there's a war in Korea, there will still be folks blaming people like me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though he didn't support the Iraq War, Keith did vote for George W. Bush for a second term and says, &quot;his presidency will be better judged 40 years from now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the upcoming election there might be a little interest, especially within the country community, in what Toby Keith has to say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His first reaction?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say. If someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote, then you're not taking advantage of your American right here. Everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having said that, Keith goes on to say, &quot;I think Obama stands the best chance for the Democratic Party since Clinton. McCain is a good solid choice, a smarter version of what we have. We probably need a change and the economy needs a change, and come Election Day, I'll have my mind made up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any chance he would go out and play a show for one of them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hell no,&quot; he says. &quot;I never did that for anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After spending much of the summer searching for an effective line of attack against Sen. Barack Obama, Sen. John McCain is beginning a newly aggressive campaign to define his Democratic rival as arrogant, out of touch and unprepared for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday alone, the McCain campaign released a new advertisement suggesting -- and not in a good way -- that the Illinois Democrat is a celebrity along the lines of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans tried to portray Mr. Obama as a candidate who believed that the race was all about him, relying on what Democrats said was a completely inaccurate quotation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee began a new anti-Obama Web site called Audacity Watch, a play on the title of Mr. Obama's book &quot;The Audacity of Hope.&quot; And, in a concerted volley of television interviews, news releases and e-mail messages, campaign representatives attacked him on a wide variety of issues, including his tax policies and energy proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moves represented the McCain campaign's most full-throttled effort to define Mr. Obama negatively, on its own terms, by creating a narrative intended to turn the public off to an opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mr. Obama has been under an intense public spotlight for the last year, he is still relatively new on the national scene, and polls indicate that -- for all the enthusiasm he has generated among his supporters -- many voters still have questions about him, providing Republicans an opening to shape his image in critical groups like white working-class voters between now and Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's campaign is now under the leadership of members of President Bush's re-election campaign, including Steve Schmidt, the czar of the Bush war room that relentlessly painted his 2004 re-election opponent, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, as effete, elite and equivocal through a daily blitz of sound bites and Web videos carefully coordinated with Mr. Bush's television ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The run of McCain campaign attacks against Mr. Obama over the last couple of weeks have been strikingly reminiscent of that drive, including the Bush team's tactics of seeking to make campaigns into referendums on its opponents -- not a choice between two candidates -- and of attacking opponents' perceived strengths head-on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Central to the latest McCain drive is an attempt to use against Mr. Obama the huge crowds and excitement he has drawn, including on his foreign trip last week, by promoting a view of him as more interested in attention and adulation than in solving the problems facing American families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would say that it is beyond dispute that he [Obama] has become the biggest celebrity in the world,&quot; Mr. Schmidt said in a conference call with reporters yesterday. &quot;The question that we are posing to the American people is this: 'Is he ready to lead yet?' And the answer to the question that we will offer to the American people is: 'No, he is not.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's more focused assault comes after one of his worst weeks of the general election campaign, when he seemed to fumble for a consistent, overarching critique of Mr. Obama, who winged around the Middle East and Europe. McCain advisers continue to look for ways to bring more discipline to the Arizona Republican senator's message, and are being urged by some supporters to cut back the frequency of his question-and-answer sessions with reporters -- a staple of his campaign, but one that occasionally yields unscripted moments, misstatements and off-the-cuff pronouncements that divert attention from themes he is trying to promote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intensity of the recent drive -- which has included some assertions from the McCain camp that have been widely dismissed as misleading -- has surprised even some allies of Mr. McCain, who has often spoken of the need for civility in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sentiment seeped onto television yesterday when Republican strategist Andrea Tantaros said on MSNBC that the use of Ms. Hilton in Mr. McCain's&nbsp;commercial was &quot;absurd and juvenile,&quot; and that he should spend more time promoting his own agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign seized on those concerns, trying to turn the tables by portraying Mr. McCain as cranky and negative. The Democratic National Committee called Mr. McCain &quot;McNasty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late yesterday, Mr. Obama released a counter ad citing editorials critical of Mr. McCain's latest volley of attacks and featuring an announcer who says, &quot;John McCain: Same old politics, same failed policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by reporters about Mr. McCain's new ad, Mr. Obama said, &quot;I do notice that he doesn't seem to have anything to say very positive about himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama chief strategist David Axelrod said Mr. McCain's strategy to define Mr. Obama negatively in voters' minds, while similar to one that successfully worked against Mr. Kerry, would not work this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When people are struggling, when they're trying to pay their bills, when they're concerned about their fundamental security, I don't think they have much tolerance for Britney Spears and Paris Hilton,&quot; Mr. Axelrod said. &quot;I think they understand times are more serious than that, and they thought John McCain was, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jul. 30--NEWS ITEM: In a current TV ad, Republican presidential candidate John McCain blames his Democratic opponent, Barack Obama, for high gas prices, citing Obama's opposition to expanding domestic drilling for oil. The ad, of course, doesn't mention that until recently, when political points were at stake, McCain also opposed such expansion. The ad also neglects to mention that any expanded drilling wouldn't produce any oil for about a decade and even then, the amount of oil produced would not be enough to affect prices or greatly reduce our dependence on foreign oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICE-OVER: Starbucks recently announced it was closing 600 outlets in the United States. Six hundred. That means a lot of baristas will be out of work. That means a lot of them will have to find work while waiting for their bands to get signed or their screenplays to be produced or their novels that combine the relationship gaffes of chick-lit with the hipster beat stylings of Charles Bukowski to be published. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a lot of baristas suddenly having to find work that doesn't entail talking in an animated fashion with a co-worker about the films of Charles Bronson while someone is waiting for a double espresso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact on our economy could be devastating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And think of our children. If these baristas get jobs in day care centers, think of the young minds that will be exposed to lengthy discussions of the meaning of David Lynch's &quot;Inland Empire&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and the scene in which some actors wearing bunny heads speak in non sequiturs while a laugh track plays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who will protect our children?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And who is to blame for this crisis?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who is to blame for this woefully under-caffeinated nation's lethargy? Who is to blame for making Americans settle for Dunkin' Donuts coffee as a substitute for a double latte grande? Who is to blame for denying Americans their God-given right to a cappuccino?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD (Chanting): O-BAM-A! O-BAM-A! O-BAM-A!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama did nothing when Starbucks announced it was closing 600 stores. He and his comrades in the Democratic Congress did nothing to protect the nation from the terror of hundreds of unemployed baristas wandering our streets handing out CDs of their bands or reading their screenplay aloud at the bus stop or writing novels that combine chick-lit with Bukowski.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They did nothing while these crimes against humanity could continue unabated, spreading like a virus across this great nation, destroying the very fiber of America, unleashing a horde of tattooed and pierced baristas upon unsuspecting citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And who's to blame for this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD (Chanting): O-BAM-A! O-BAM-A! O-BAM-A!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because he did nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain believes we shouldn't do nothing. He believes maybe someone should do something. He believes you can't hope things will turn out all right and that the barista who's been telling you about his screenplay based on a Japanese comic book featuring a superhero who's a carp will suddenly cease yammering about his work just because he's no longer serving espresso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hope won't do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hope is a word that never crosses John McCain's lips, unless he is saying it sarcastically to deride people who think hope is something associated with a certain presidential candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain does that because he's a maverick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he's never even heard of someone named George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never met the man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because he's a maverick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we're not talking about the craptacular car that Ford made in the 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're talking maverick like that guy in that Tom Cruise movie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That movie was awesome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And did Barack Obama have anything to do with it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama did nothing to produce that Tom Cruise movie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And who is to blame for Goose getting killed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD (Chanting): O-BAM-A! O-BAM-A! O-BAM-A!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And who's to blame for you being late for work this morning?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD (Chanting): O-BAM-A! O-BAM-A! O-BAM-A!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sure, it's easy to blame the old lady in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oldsmobile the size of the USS Theodore Roosevelt who was doing a constant 18 mph in front of you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But is it really her fault?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is to blame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You could have hoped that the old lady would speed up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can't hope that you'll be on time to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama uses the word hope a lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it's his fault that hoping you'll be on time for work won't make it happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't hope that someone will do something about baristas being free to do whatever it is they do when they're not making cafe con leches. Don't hope that Maverick will get the girl at the end of the movie. Don't hope that old lady will, at some point, crack 20 mph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vote for the candidate who has no hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vote McCain and not . . .</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Pennsylvania, Democrat Barack Obama has opened up a big, early lead over Republican John McCain - in the number of local offices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has 24, McCain has three, not counting an additional seven that serve all Republican candidates.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether this gap ultimately makes any difference as to who wins Pennsylvania's 21 electoral votes Nov. 4 remains to be seen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama's strategists say the offices are part of a highly structured, volunteer-heavy plan to help carry a state that is must-win for Obama and high on McCain's wish list. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a conference call with reporters yesterday, Craig Schirmer, who is running Obama's Pennsylvania campaign, laid out a plan to create more than 700 neighborhood teams to cover the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teams will engage in canvassing, house meetings, church visits, phone banks, and the recruitment of additional volunteers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schirmer said 247 of the teams are in place, with captains committed to spending 10 to 20 hours per week on campaign work for the duration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign also plans to go after the roughly one million Pennsylvanians of voting age who have not registered. Already this year, statewide voter registration is up a net of 215,000, with Democratic registration up 317,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schirmer called the overall blueprint a combination of &quot;new technology and old-style organizing principles.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign promises strong outreach efforts of its own; in 2004, the campaign to reelect President Bush made highly effective use of local supporters in their voter-contact efforts, taking care to see that targeted voters heard from neighbors with similar interests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And through his own campaign schedule, McCain has made clear that he places a premium on taking Pennsylvania out of the Democratic column. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has come to the state four times since the middle of June and has maintained a large and sustained presence through television commercials. His strategists see opportunities to make inroads in the socially conservative, older and nominally Democratic counties in northeastern and Western Pennsylvania. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're just starting to see the tip of the iceberg,&quot; McCain's state campaign manager, Ted Christian, said of visits by the candidate and surrogates. &quot;I think he'll open his own post office box here. This state is of the utmost importance to the senator.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show Obama ahead in Pennsylvania, with the most recent survey giving him a six-point lead. The Democrats have won the state in the last four presidential elections, although John Kerry's margin of victory four years ago was only 2.5 percentage points. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Rendell, who backed Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primaries, described himself as &quot;confident . . . but not overconfident&quot; that Obama would win the state, calling McCain &quot;as appealing a Republican candidate as they've run in the last 20-odd years.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has one area office, in Blue Bell, Montgomery County. More are expected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has eight: three in Montgomery County, two in Delaware County, and one each in Bucks County, Chester County and Center City. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">734 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama at least has one thing right: the author of &quot;The Audacity of Hope&quot; is certainly audacious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The junior Illinois senator has been telling us for months now: &quot;We are the hope of the future. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I believed that about myself, I'd be pretty audacious. Not to mention messianic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so the political savior went to Berlin to stand on the shoulders of giants, and didn't even have the courtesy to tip his hat to the president of the United States -- Ronald Reagan -- whose monumentally historic rhetoric he adapted ad nauseam, showing an audacious disregard for creativity and originality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Berlin speech wasn't anything too new -- save the self-reintroduction as a post-national &quot;Citizen of the World.&quot; You've heard most of it before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be less disturbing if it were merely empty rhetoric signifying everything and nothing, requiring projection on the part of the unformed masses Obama seeks to galvanize, to give it meaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his substance is audaciously insulting, on top of the language. Hillary Clinton, in retrospect, got a bad, perhaps unfair, rap for being presumptuous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite being a workhorse in the Senate and on the campaign trail, she was maligned by many, including this columnist, for her imperial arrogance, for thinking of her campaign as merely part of the inevitable return of the Clintons to their rightful White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was an august, foregone conclusion to which Team Clinton certainly did subscribe. But at least she was willing to do the work she needed to do to earn the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, by comparison, makes Hillary look positively meek, and does so without all the elbow grease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his mind and in the minds of many a callow Obamamaniac, he is the &quot;inevitable&quot; one. &quot;We are the ones we have been waiting for&quot;? Really?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If all of American history has been waiting for me to be able to pull a lever for Barack Obama, I might have to rethink the greatness of this fine country. Fortunately I won't have to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hate to tell Chris Matthews with his tingling leg and all, but Barack Obama is not the source and summit of U.S. history. Barack Obama represents an obnoxiously elitist attitude that reeks of paternalistic government, the kind that folks like Reagan and the late, great William F. Buckley Jr. devoted much of their lives to pushing back, here and abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's European trip, of course, provided a wide stage for his self-assured pomp and inconsequence. The speech at the Berlin Victory Column furnished the fireworks of the trip, but it -- with its Leni Riefenstahl-like rally posters translated into German -- did not stand alone in audacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After conducting some would-be freelance diplomacy with the leaders of the Israeli and Palestinian states, Barack Obama presented himself in Europe as president-elect, rather than as a frosh senator who lucked out with a few good choices on either side of the aisle, and who is now clearly in over his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And considering the depth and extent of grief George W. Bush gets for being stubborn, you'd think Obama would show some humility for being on the wrong side of the biggest war story of the last year, the troop surge in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surge worked, yet he and his fellow Democrats opposed the considered advice and airtight plan of the commander on the ground in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what did a seasoned warrior know compared to this young politico from Chicago? Community organizing in the Windy City must have made him a military expert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Audacity is nothing new to Barack Obama. The book title, &quot;The Audacity of Hope,&quot; of course, comes from a speech by Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama's former pastor, from whom Obama decided to distance himself when it became clear that he would forever be a political liability if the senator didn't &quot;throw him under the bus,&quot; in the parlance of urban wheeling and dealing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Audacity can be a beautiful thing. Hope, surely. But when both are rooted in nothing but the well-crafted words (thank you, Obama aide David Axelrod) of a supposed political savior, I, for one, am not signing up, thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Say what you will about John McCain, at least we know he's got deep roots in tried and true political virtues: duty, honor, country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are more stable principles than the audacity of whatever the Obama team comes up with next.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jul. 27--NEWS ITEM: In a current TV ad, Republican presidential candidate John McCain blames his Democratic opponent, Barack Obama, for high gas prices, citing Obama's opposition to expanding domestic drilling for oil. The ad, of course, doesn't mention that until recently, when political points were at stake, McCain also opposed such expansion. The ad also neglects to mention that any expanded drilling wouldn't produce any oil for about a decade and even then, the amount of oil produced would not be enough to affect prices or greatly reduce our dependence on foreign oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOICE-OVER: Starbucks recently announced it was closing 600 outlets in the United States. Six hundred. That means a lot of baristas will be out of work. That means a lot of them will have to find work while waiting for their bands to get signed or their screenplays to be produced or their novels that combine the relationship gaffes of chick-lit with the hipster beat stylings of Charles Bukowski to be published. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a lot of baristas suddenly having to find work that doesn't entail talking in an animated fashion with a co-worker about the films of Charles Bronson while someone is waiting for a double espresso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact on our economy could be devastating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And think of our children. If these baristas get jobs in day care centers, think of the young minds that will be exposed to lengthy discussions of the meaning of David Lynch's &quot;Inland Empire&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and the scene in which some actors wearing bunny heads speak in non sequiturs while a laugh track plays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who will protect our children?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And who is to blame for this crisis?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who is to blame for this woefully under-caffeinated nation's lethargy? Who is to blame for making Americans settle for Dunkin' Donuts coffee as a substitute for a double latte grande? Who is to blame for denying Americans their God-given right to a cappuccino?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD (Chanting): O-BAM-A! O-BAM-A! O-BAM-A!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama did nothing when Starbucks announced it was closing 600 stores. He and his comrades in the Democratic Congress did nothing to protect the nation from the terror of hundreds of unemployed baristas wandering our streets handing out CDs of their bands or reading their screenplay aloud at the bus stop or writing novels that combine chick-lit with Bukowski.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They did nothing while these crimes against humanity could continue unabated, spreading like a virus across this great nation, destroying the very fiber of America, unleashing a horde of tattooed and pierced baristas upon unsuspecting citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And who's to blame for this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD (Chanting): O-BAM-A! O-BAM-A! O-BAM-A!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because he did nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain believes we shouldn't do nothing. He believes maybe someone should do something. He believes you can't hope things will turn out all right and that the barista who's been telling you about his screenplay based on a Japanese comic book featuring a superhero who's a carp will suddenly cease yammering about his work just because he's no longer serving espresso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hope won't do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hope is a word that never crosses John McCain's lips, unless he is saying it sarcastically to deride people who think hope is something associated with a certain presidential candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain does that because he's a maverick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he's never even heard of someone named George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never met the man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because he's a maverick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we're not talking about the craptacular car that Ford made in the 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're talking maverick like that guy in that Tom Cruise movie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That movie was awesome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And did Barack Obama have anything to do with it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama did nothing to produce that Tom Cruise movie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And who is to blame for Goose getting killed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD (Chanting): O-BAM-A! O-BAM-A! O-BAM-A!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And who's to blame for you being late for work this morning?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD (Chanting): O-BAM-A! O-BAM-A! O-BAM-A!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sure, it's easy to blame the old lady in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oldsmobile the size of the USS Theodore Roosevelt who was doing a constant 18 mph in front of you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But is it really her fault?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is to blame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You could have hoped that the old lady would speed up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can't hope that you'll be on time to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama uses the word hope a lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it's his fault that hoping you'll be on time for work won't make it happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't hope that someone will do something about baristas being free to do whatever it is they do when they're not making cafe con leches. Don't hope that Maverick will get the girl at the end of the movie. Don't hope that old lady will, at some point, crack 20 mph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vote for the candidate who has no hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vote McCain and not . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROWD (Chanting): O-BAM-A! O-BAM-A! O-BAM-A!</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain's campaign on Saturday sharply criticized Democratic rival Barack Obama for canceling a visit to wounded troops in Germany, contending Obama chose foreign leaders and cheering Europeans over &quot;injured American heroes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign called the accusation &quot;wildly inappropriate.&quot; His spokesman has claimed that the visit to a military hospital in Germany was scrapped after the Pentagon raised concerns about political activity on a military base. Earlier, though, the campaign had said Obama decided the visit might be seen as inappropriate politicking. However, the Pentagon said the senator was never told not to visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new McCain&nbsp;ad that began airing Saturday in selected markets also chides Obama as disrespectful for making &quot;time to go to the gym&quot; during his European visit while at the same time canceling the visit with wounded troops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seems the Pentagon wouldn't allow him to bring cameras,&quot; according to the ad, which is being televised in Colorado, Pennsylvania and the Washington D.C. area. &quot;John McCain is always there for our troops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain himself joined in the rebuke, saying in an interview to be aired Sunday by ABC's &quot;This Week&quot; that &quot;if I had been told by the Pentagon that I couldn't visit those troops, and I was there and wanted to be there, I guarantee you, there would have been a seismic event.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign's criticism came as it grappled for another day with the intense media attention focused on Obama's tour of the Middle East and Europe. The Arizona Republican had goaded Obama into visiting Iraq and Afghanistan, then watched as Obama's meetings with the leaders of those countries and Jordan, Israel, the Palestinians, Germany, France and Great Britain dominated the political news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding, Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor said Obama and McCain both believed that troops should be honored and noted that the Illinois senator had visited troops in Iraq and Afghanistan last week and had made numerous trips to Washington's Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Obama still didn't want injured soldiers &quot;pulled into the back-and-forth of a political campaign,&quot; Vietor said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator McCain knows full well that Senator Obama strongly supports and honors our troops, which is what makes this attack so disingenuous. This politicization of our soldiers is exactly what Senator Obama sought to avoid,&quot; Vietor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was flying from London to Chicago on Saturday when the McCain campaign issued a statement from Joe Repya, a retired Army colonel who said Obama had broken a commitment to visit the wounded Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several explanations were offered, none was convincing and each was at odds with the statements of American military leaders,&quot; Repya said. &quot;For a young man so apt at playing president, Barack Obama badly misjudged the important demands of the office he seeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, the day Obama gave an evening address to an estimated 200,000 people in Berlin, his campaign issued two written statements about the canceled trip to Ramstein Air Base and the military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany. In the first, no mention was made of Pentagon misgivings, only that Obama &quot;decided out of respect for these servicemen and women that it would be inappropriate to make a stop to visit troops at a U.S. military facility as part of a trip funded by the campaign.&quot; A second statement, by retired general and Obama adviser Scott Gration, mentioned the Pentagon's involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters Friday that a trip from Berlin to Ramstein had been planned for weeks, with Obama expecting to leave most staff and reporters at the airport while he went to the hospital to avoid appearances of a campaign event. After the Pentagon raised concerns within two days of the visit, it was scrapped, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said Obama would have been required to conform to the Defense Department prohibition of political activity, but that the senator was never told he couldn't visit the hospital.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Shenk also makes the assertion that a strong government that Obama supports would demand you give up a portion of your wealth for equitable distribution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I, unlike Ms. Shenk, see a strong government as being one that's effective and has a tax system that is equitable. (Truth be known, I actually prefer Mike Huckabee's idea of doing away with the IRS.)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, she fails to see the value in America's youth learning to speak a second language, as Obama does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Learning to speak a second language is a practice that is the norm in other countries. This is especially valuable when traveling across the globe or entering the corporate world.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allegheny County Republican Chairman Jim Roddey and a dozen fellow veterans gathered in Green Tree yesterday to showcase their support for Arizona Sen. John S. McCain's presidential campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their low-key news conference, featuring a testimonial from a former prisoner of war who had who had been one of the Republican candidate's prison mates in Hanoi during the Vietnam War, was part of the campaign's overall effort to counter-program against the media spectacle of McCain's Democratic rival, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, on his visit to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain himself was seeking a share of the political headlines yesterday in an appearance in Portland, Maine, with the current Republican president's father, former President George H.W. Bush, who is another former Navy pilot who was forced to parachute from a plane crippled in combat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, commenting on his opponent's Iraq war stance, said: &quot;He's been completely wrong on the issue. I have been steadfast in my position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of the GOP senator who hopes to be one of his successors, the former president said, &quot;My respect for him knows no bounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the local McCain headquarters in Green Tree, James Warner, a retired lawyer and former Marine aviator who was imprisoned in Vietnam for 5 1/2 years, said he had witnessed repeated displays of character and leadership from Mr. McCain during that time that, he said, attested to his ability to serve as commander-in-chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also joining the local display of support for Mr. McCain was state Sen. Bob Robbins, R-Greenville, a member of the steering committee of Pennsylvania Veterans for John McCain. Mr. Robbins, a West Point graduate and also a Vietnam veteran, lauded his candidate for speaking out in favor of the so-called &quot;surge&quot; strategy for Iraq at a time when it was politically risky. &quot;We have a candidate who's served in the trenches all his life,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's companion yesterday, the former President Bush, had imposed a 1992 moratorium on offshore oil drilling. On the same day as their joint appearance, the McCain campaign was releasing an advertisement contending that Mr. Obama's opposition to offshore drilling was to blame for soaring gasoline prices. The ad is airing in 11 states, including Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is the latest tit-for-tat commercial about energy in the presidential campaign. Earlier this month, an Obama&nbsp;ad accused Mr. McCain of being &quot;part of the problem&quot; of high gas prices.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">THE NRA DOESN'T GET IT; <BR>IT'S TIME TO MOVE PAST THE ALL-OR-NOTHING POLITICS OF THE PAST</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; RAY SCHOENKE; Pg. G-1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">772 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Rifle Association wants to relive the past and plans to spend $40 million to campaign against Sen. Barack Obama. For the NRA, it is a desperate attempt to remain relevant in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in the Washington, D.C., gun law case, District of Columbia v. Heller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gun lobby wanted Justice Antonin Scalia to author the long-awaited decision in Heller, but when he did, he confirmed what I and most gun owners have long believed: Citizens have an individual right to keep and bear arms, not only as members of organized militias, but that right is not unlimited. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Justice Scalia, &quot;Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.&quot; He went on to say, &quot;Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those aren't the words of a gun-control advocate; they were written by one of the most conservative justices on the bench. They undermine the NRA's all-or-nothing approach which has been so damaging to the gun debate for so long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My organization, the American Hunters and Shooters Association, filed an amicus brief in support of Heller and against the District of Columbia's outright ban on the possession of handguns. We applauded the Supreme Court ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Heller decision signals that the gun debate in this country no longer includes the NRA's extreme right-wing position of allowing unlimited access to any gun by anyone. The court also made it clear that most guns are now safe from government confiscation. Policy makers can craft responsible and appropriate measures to ensure guns do not fall into the wrong hands or get carried into the wrong places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This thoughtful approach by Justice Scalia is shared by the vast majority of the nation's 80 million gun owners and by Mr. Obama, who supports an individual right to own a gun but says, &quot;The notion that somehow local jurisdictions can't initiate gun safety laws to deal with gang bangers and random shootings on the street isn't born out by our Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, this is a time to move forward. The leaders of the NRA can't hold America's gun owners hostage anymore. Sure, they will refight the old battles with the old tactics of bullying, intimidation, distortion and lies. But the rest of us finally are ready to address the critical issues affecting gun owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, where is the NRA on protecting our environment and public lands, on making sure there is a healthy, sustainable population of wild game in the Rockies and elsewhere? They won't fight these issues. The American Hunters and Shooters Association will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NRA has plenty of excuses for not protecting the needs of hunters and shooters. One is that the leaders of the NRA were busy fighting John McCain on campaign finance reform, which could threaten their ability to intimidate lawmakers. Another is that they were busy fighting John McCain on gun-show background checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wait. This is the guy for whom they now plan to spend more than $40 million of their members' money to get him elected president. This sort of hypocrisy and political opportunism is what's wrong with the leadership of the NRA. They've lost touch with what really matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, 670 hunting and fishing organizations, including the hunters and shooters association, became actively engaged in the fight against global warming. We see the effects firsthand. Hunters like me can tell you that the ducks are coming later and later every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NRA was absent. In fact, NRA leaders actively undermine the efforts of hunting and fishing groups. NRA board member Grover Norquist, through his group, Americans for Taxpayer Reform, co-sponsored a conference for self-proclaimed global warming &quot;skeptics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hunters and shooters association, we aren't going to spend $40 million on tired partisan politics. What we spend goes to actually protecting your right to have a gun, to be safe in your home and to have a place that isn't polluted to hunt and fish. The voices of ordinary hunters and shooters are finally being heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama isn't perfect, but he believes the Second Amendment confers an individual right to own a gun, although he doesn't think it protects &quot;gang bangers.&quot; This position, plus his commitment to protecting our natural resources and our hunting and shooting heritage, makes sense to me and millions of other responsible gun owners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">James O'Toole Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">STATE; THE ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE; Pg. A-1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1430 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win Pennsylvania, Sen. John McCain aims to reverse one historic trend while reinforcing another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The soon-to-be GOP nominee needs to emphasize the crossover appeal that comes with his maverick image to stem Republican erosion in the southeastern corner of the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time he needs to burnish his conservative credentials to capitalize on increased GOP strength in western and rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a complicated chess game,&quot; said Terry Ma-donna, director of Franklin and Marshall College's polling operations. &quot;It's pretty clear where you have to move the pieces.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic candidates won the state's electoral votes in each of the last four presidential elections, although President Bush twice managed to make it close. Former Vice President Al Gore won the state's popular vote, 51 percent to 46 percent, in 2000. Four years later, Sen. John F. Kerry won, 51 percent to 48 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, Republican partisans argue, Mr. McCain has a chance to better Mr. Bush's record and even win the state because of what they see as his greater appeal to independents. He'll need all of that appeal in a state that is, by registration, more Democratic than in either of the last two elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The registration [change] has been dramatic,'' said Mark Holman, chief of staff to former Republican Gov. Tom Ridge. &quot;I suspect our base vote is below 40 [percent], and it used to be in the mid-40s. That's a structural challenge for Republicans. Republicans are going to have to win more Democratic votes in Pennsylvania, but that's the beauty of the McCain candidacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is a different kind of Republican,&quot; said Jon Seaton, the McCain campaign's regional director for Ohio and Pennsylvania. &quot;He draws votes from Republicans, Democrats and Independents.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shifting tides</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the most significant state voting shift over the last 15 years is the change in the performance of the four suburban counties surrounding Philadelphia. Once a GOP stronghold, these areas, which have enjoyed relatively high economic and population growth, have proved increasingly hospitable toward Democratic candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Republicans' favor is a countervailing trend in areas of slower population growth. In balancing those dynamics, Republican strategists said, Mr. McCain will have to run a very different race than the man he hopes to succeed. Mr. Bush's reelection campaign in Pennsylvania concentrated on maximizing turnout among his party's conservative base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lost the Philadelphia region, including the city and its suburbs, by the landslide margin of 59 percent to 41 percent. But, buoyed by a huge turnout of Republicans in the balance of the state, the president still came within about 150,000 votes of overtaking Mr. Kerry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain has a different challenge, and a different roadmap to success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The one thing we see is that more of the state will be in play than in past statewide elections,&quot; said Ted Christian, Mr. McCain's Pennsylvania director. &quot;He has a great chance in the Philadelphia suburbs. He can also play well in places like Beaver, Lawrence, even Cambria County.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Christian is familiar with the challenges of suburbs becoming friendlier to Democrats from his past role as executive director of the New Jersey state Republican party. His colleague Mr. Seaton is a veteran of the near-demise and Phoenix-like revival of the McCain fortunes. He was the campaign's national field director until a shake-up and down-sizing last summer. He soldiered on as Iowa field director at a time when the campaign had turned most of its energies to New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clinton lesson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Seaton sees another template for McCain votes in the results of the state's Democratic primary, where Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, though badly outspent, defeated Mr. Obama by just over 9 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You look a the places where Obama struggled in the primary. ... I would expect to see Sen. McCain do well there too,'' Mr. Seaton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's no surprise that the McCain campaign will use some of the same issues that brought victory to Mrs. Clinton. At his last Pittsburgh appearance, earlier this month in the Strip District, Mr. McCain said he would remind Pennsylvania voters that he did not agree with Mr. Obama's well-publicized observation that some small-town residents in Pennsylvania &quot;cling to&quot; such cultural traditions because they are &quot;bitter'' over their economic circumstances. Mrs. Clinton used the controversy surrounding those remarks to her advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only congressional district outside the Philadelphia area that Mr. Obama won in the primary was the 14th, which includes Pittsburgh and parts of the Mon Valley. Mr. Obama piled up a big margin in Philadelphia, but Mrs. Clinton bested him, albeit narrowly, in the city's suburbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She managed a narrow victory in the 7th Congressional District, which includes Delaware County, and won easily in the 13th and 8th districts, which include Montgomery and Bucks counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While polls suggest that most of the Clinton votes will go to Mr. Obama, the McCain advisers are heartened by the fact that Mr. Obama didn't win them in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Brabender, the prominent Republican media strategist, said Mr. McCain has &quot;to play up his independent image and independent voting record. He's got to make sure that people understand he is in no way an extension of the George Bush presidency, which, I think, Obama wants to make this a referendum on.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underscoring that danger to the Republican, Mr. Madonna, the Franklin and Marshall pollster, said that his recent surveys had shown that &quot;this thing with Bush is lethal in the Philly suburbs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush is more unpopular in those suburbs than in the rest of the state and the Iraq war is more unpopular there than in the rest of the state,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain has emphasized his distance from the president on a variety of issues, including the earlier, pre-Surge conduct of the war. But he has been adamant in his overall support of the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;&quot;If you look at Philadelphia and the four surrounding counties, Bush lost very big. ... We have a candidate in John McCain who can improve on that,'' said Mr. Seaton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be difficult, however, for Mr. McCain to improve on the Bush margins in some of the rural, central and western counties that nearly allowed the president to overtake Mr. Kerry four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Holman, an architect of Tom Ridge's two statewide victories, sees three corners of the state -- the northeast, northwest and southwest -- as fertile territory for Mr. McCain. He cited that all three areas' relatively's older electorate and significant veterans' population as likely sources of strength for the Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The wild card is turnout in Central Pennsylvania,'' he said. &quot;President Bush ran extraordinarily well out of Lancaster County and Central Pennsylvania. I don't know if there's the same excitement for McCain in the evangelical community. It's a surmountable challenge but it's a challenge.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about Ridge?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing that could help the Arizonan in Pennsylvania hurdles would be the choice of Mr. Ridge as his running-mate. Neither Mr. Holman nor the McCain strategists would comment on that possibility, but it seems clear that a Ridge pick would aid the ticket in areas such as the socially liberal Philadelphia suburbs. But the selection of the pro-choice Ridge would be certain to provoke an outcry in the party's socially conservative base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brabender, who worked on Mr. Ridge's first congressional campaign, contends that the Ridge plusses outweigh his liabilities. And while he emphasized that he was not predicting that choice, he said it was not beyond the realm of political possibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, if Tom Ridge were picked, it would be a huge boost,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, looking at the national picture, he suggested that the lesson of Mr. McCain's primary journey from seeming disaster to unlikely triumph showed the virtue of the unorthodox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When they tried to go the traditional route, things didn't work out too well. When he tried to be a little bit of a renegade, breaking the rules, things worked out better.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain has buttressed his chances in Pennsylvania with early television advertising. The campaign has so far opened 10 offices in the state and Mr. Seaton said more sites were planned. Mr. McCain's fourth television commercial began airing in Pennsylvania and ten other states this weekend. He has already made multiple post-primary appearances in the state and will return in mid-week for another visit to the vote-rich Philadelphia region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're going to see him again and again and again,'' Mr. Seaton predicted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Escalating food and energy prices, bank failures, a falling dollar, $3 trillion of total spending (including future medical liabilities) on a disastrous war in Iraq and the recent loss of half-a-million jobs went unexplained. </SPAN></P>

For a former senator of Texas to label these people as &quot;whiners&quot; is a classic example of a leader either being out of touch with the sufferings of his people or of a leader wishing to divert blame for a serious situation away from the leaders responsible and toward the led. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The realty of the situation is that we are complaining and we are whining but all with just cause.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For sure, serious stagflation, simultaneously encompassing high financial inflation and fearsome economic recession, are real worries. However, the seeds of inflation lie not with the people but with their leaders. It was the Fed, which, for political reasons, injected vast and imprudent amounts of dollar liquidity into the American economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This liquidity was leveraged up to a historic, massive level by the banking system, derivatives and highly leveraged financial institutions, such as hedge funds.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, in response to &quot;lucrative&quot; Wall Street lobbying, allowed commercial banks to become investment banks in all but name and to take greatly increased risks with their depositors' money. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The introduction of so-called &quot;sweep accounts&quot; allowed banks to include investment accounts together with deposit accounts and escalate the deposit base upon which their lending was based. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The securitization of bank lending obligations, such as mortgages, allowed much of this imprudent lending to be camouflaged as &quot;off balance sheet&quot; by the financial houses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These &quot;liberalizing&quot; congressional actions resulted in a world awash in paper dollars. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the Treasury, which while talking a &quot;strong&quot; dollar, has presided over an unprecedented fall in the dollar's value. The fall is stark when measured against other inflating currencies. Measured against the government-manipulated and downward-biased &quot;free market&quot; price of gold, the dollar's fall is even more dramatic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite lame government assurances that a dollar decline has minimal effect on those who do not travel abroad, the cost of food and energy, priced in dollars on international markets, has skyrocketed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any fall in the international price of the dollar, together with the inflation rate, is a hidden tax on all holders of U.S. dollars. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was our leaders, not us, who dumped the billions of paper dollars that provided the basic poison behind the &quot;toxic waste&quot; loans in the subprime mortgage market. This mortgage market and its resulting massive debt now threaten both the viability of the financial system and the continued faith in paper money itself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, it was the Treasury that retired much of its long-term debt. It now comprises mainly short-term debt, which is more easily &quot;influenced&quot; by the Fed-controlled short-term rates. This means that the Fed has been unduly hesitant to raise interest rates to combat the latent inflation resulting from the huge buildup in dollar liquidity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts are that the Fed is still pumping in massive amounts of liquidity while accepting relative junk as collateral. The federal deficit, at about $10 trillion, now equates to some 70 percent of the economy. With CPI inflation at 5 percent, interest rates are negative and the dollar continues to plunge. Despite the greatly weakened dollar, the trade deficit persists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken as a whole, these problems have resulted in the economic fiascoes we face today. Worse still is the ripple effect of widespread social unrest and the resulting potential turmoil and panic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If no one complains, the situation will worsen. If the public does not compel the Fed and Congress to account for the problems facing us, then there will be no need to find a solution. The situation may not be totally curable, but if it is ignored it will worsen. If we don't &quot;whine,&quot; no one will hear us and no one will come to our aid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be fair, it may be that Phil Gramm was guilty of nothing more than poor word usage. Had he called us &quot;courageous fighters&quot; and not &quot;whiners&quot; Gramm undoubtedly would have helped McCain's prospects, not hurt them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gramm needed to pick his words more carefully. It was Winston Churchill who said: &quot;From now on, ending a sentence with a preposition is something up with which I shall not put.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans will not put up with being called &quot;whiners.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WESLEY CLARK and the Democratic Party should be ashamed of themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain didn't just &quot;Ride in a fighter jet&quot; over Vietnam. He flew that fighter jet in a combat mission behind enemy lines over Hanoi. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That alone makes him an American hero. He was shot down, captured, was tortured until the North Vietnamese realized his father was an admiral in the U.S. Navy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, for propaganda reasons, the North Vietnamese wanted to set him free. He refused to leave his men, and his living hell, for principle - &quot;the first man in first man out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He showed integrity, courage and patriotism. I have to disagree with Obama's mouthpiece, the shameless Wesley Clark, that integrity, courage and patriotism are attributes that a president should have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don Gallagher</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c10">Philadephia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrary to the disinformation spewed by letter-writer Jerry Boris, Gen. Wesley Clark didn't &quot;do a hit on McCain's military credentials&quot; when he said, &quot;Well, I don't think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these conservative ranters the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Daily News</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prints, having no Cheney/Bush successes to laud and therefore nothing to justify keeping Republicans in power, will disingenuously try to distract us by manufacturing controversial noncontroversies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They attempt to divert our attention from the burdens inflicted via the last seven years' failed policies: a drained treasury, a failed economy, the erosion of civil liberties and the never-ending senseless bloodbath in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They accuse - like letter-writer Tom Bell, who says that if Obama has to give a speech saying he's a patriot, then he probably isn't - yet hypocritically won't extend their flogging to flagrant symbol misuse, as in: if Cheney and Bush have to wear flag pins to prove they're patriots, then they probably aren't - and if deep thinkers like Republican Reps. Walter Jones and Bob Ney felt it was necessary to change the House cafeteria's menus so the text read &quot;freedom fries&quot; instead of &quot;French fries&quot; in order to broadcast that they're patriots, then they probably aren't. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their cholesterol levels probably didn't change, either. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Paci</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c10">Philadelphia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philly flunks July 4</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was watching the broadcast of the Sunoco Fourth of July parade on 6ABC, and it made me think that the city doesn't give a rat's butt toward patriotism. It was so bad I had to change the channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I first came upon New York City's celebration. It was wonderful and patriotic and had more upbeat performances. I was actually tapping my toes. During the commercial, I landed on Washington's broadcast and it was also patriotic and awesome. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do we have in Philadelphia. Patti Labelle (surprise), the Stylistics and John Legend. Who books our acts? I saw more red, white and blue at Abu Ghraib. This city needs to buck up and hire some patriotic talent. Let freedom ring!</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">762 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big trouble roiling the financial markets and the impending federal bailout of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac offer voters the sort of incomprehensible mess they wish the next president will make more orderly and less costly to taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not a chance. The seeds of the meltdown were sown over decades, and there is no way to avoid reaping the harvest now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public may not trust John McCain to fix things -- he famously admitted once that he doesn't know much about the economy. But Barack Obama offers an economic resume at least as thin, having spent only short time in the Senate before running for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of all people, the person we should be paying attention to is Phil Gramm. The former Texas senator, a close friend of McCain's, made a fair mess of things politically last week when he declared that the state of the economy really isn't so bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's just that Americans are in a &quot;mental recession,&quot; and we've become a &quot;nation of whiners&quot; with unceasing complaints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why should we listen to this guy's poppycock? Because Gramm is the embodiment of the economic philosophies and misguided policies -- embraced by Republicans and far too often by Democrats -- that have gotten us precisely where we are today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has espoused, promoted and written into law economic policies based on the simplistic arguments that cutting taxes and deregulating huge industries (especially the financial industry) are the keys to making magical markets work. And if this turns out to be voodoo, the blame is to be shifted either to big-spending Democrats or to the great mass of American &quot;whiners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gramm's name is familiar to most Americans because he got first billing on the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, the Reagan-era budgetary device that was supposed to reduce the federal deficit by forcing automatic, across-the-board cuts in programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The beauty of Gramm-Rudman, if you were a conservative, was that it thoroughly ignored the role that tax cuts had played in creating the deficit, while simultaneously forcing cuts in spending that otherwise could not win approval from Congress or political support back home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Gramm has been much more than that. He was the congressional godfather of Reaganism, the man who -- initially as a Democrat -- wrote the first Reagan budget and persuaded conservative Democrats to provide the crucial bloc of votes necessary for its passage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case you've forgotten, that first effort cut just about everything, including Social Security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in his career, as a Republican, Gramm authored the legislation that is widely fingered as one of the culprits in creating both the Enron debacle and the broader financial crisis that plagues us now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His handiwork included the legislation that dismantled the Depression-era walls that separated the financial activities of commercial banks, investment banks and the insurance industry. He also slipped the infamous &quot;Enron loophole&quot; into law, allowing energy futures to be traded without federal oversight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various investigations of the Enron collapse have pointed to this loophole as crucial to Enron's manipulation of the California energy market, which provoked an energy crisis in the state in 2000 and 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What could Gramm do for an encore? For one thing, he continues to promote tax cuts as the economic idea that stands above all others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an April interview with U.S. News &amp; World Report, for example, he credited tax cuts exclusively with Ireland's recent economic success and said that &quot;nobody has ever&quot; achieved prosperity through government spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, Gramm conveniently ignored Ireland's cradle-to-grave social safety net, which includes a national health care system as well as a state-supported college education for those who qualify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For another, he is a vice chairman of international banking giant UBS. He has raised millions in political donations from the very financial companies he helped deregulate, and whose rapacious conduct helped bring on the crisis we confront, and will apparently pay for, today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So don't dwell too much on Gramm's silly gaffe about mentally distraught whiners. Campaign &quot;surrogates&quot; often talk out of turn or, rather, they say what's really on their minds and not in their talking points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama confronted a similar situation during the Democratic primaries, when he ousted a foreign policy adviser for calling Hillary Clinton &quot;a monster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trouble with Gramm isn't what he says. It's that he has had McCain's ear -- and has laid claim to ours -- for far too long.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">HAZLETON Pa.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Lou Barletta, whose bid to unseat a 12-term congressman is based largely on his reputation as an anti-illegal immigration crusader, is trying to keep his signature issue alive even as voters turn their attention to the troubled economy and sky-high gas prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-term Republican mayor on Tuesday announced the &quot;Lou Barletta I-9 Challenge&quot; his latest effort to rid Hazleton of illegal immigrants. Even so, he conceded that immigration may have been eclipsed as an issue in his campaign to oust Democratic Rep. Paul Kanjorski in a blue-collar, heavily Democratic district in northeastern Pennsylvania. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mainly gas and energy and the economy has been what's on the minds of most people,&quot; Barletta said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, Barletta is still trying to keep voters focused on illegal immigration. And Democrats indicated how seriously they are taking Barletta's challenge Tuesday by airing the first television commercial by either party in the general election battle for Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barletta has campaigned with Joey Vento, the owner of Philadelphia's famed Geno's Steaks who posted a sign in the window asking customers to speak English. He also invited presidential candidates Barack Obama, John McCain and Hillary Clinton to Hazleton to talk about illegal immigration. (All declined.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Barletta asked city businesses to work with a Florida company, Legal Employer Inc., to ensure that their employees are in the country legally. Legal Employer will use a federal database called E-Verify to check the employees' immigration status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will continue to make sure Hazleton remains one of the toughest places in the United States for illegal aliens,&quot; Barletta said at the news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even around Hazleton, a city of 30,000 where illegal immigrants have been blamed for overburdened police, schools and hospitals, some residents say their attention is elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lifelong resident Carol Cauley, 66, said she &quot;loves&quot; Barletta and hopes he wins the election, but that &quot;gas prices and food prices far override that (illegal immigration) issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think most people have come to the conclusion that our demographics have changed and that's a fact of life,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanjorski's campaign spokesman, Ed Mitchell, said voters are talking more about jobs and the plunging real estate market than about illegal immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Kanjorski has &quot;worked hard to secure our borders ... frankly there are other issues right now that are of equal importance, maybe of more importance,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barletta has sought to broaden his appeal. In his first ad of the fall campaign released on the Internet last month he presented himself as a candidate of change, mentioning illegal immigration only in passing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a lack of leadership in Washington right now and people appreciate the fact there's someone who's not afraid ... to do what I think is right for this country,&quot; Barletta said Tuesday. &quot;And that's what's attracting so much support. It's not just illegal immigration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barletta, who is viewed as one of the Republicans' best hopes to snag a Democratic seat, has been a staple of talk radio and cable TV news since he began a campaign to get illegal immigrants out of Hazleton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Barletta's urging, the Hazleton City Council approved the Illegal Immigration Relief Act in July 2006. The law sought to deny business permits to companies that employ illegal immigrants, fine landlords who rent to them and require tenants to register and pay for a rental permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Congress deadlocked over how address illegal immigration, many municipalities across the country have passed similar laws. A federal judge struck down Hazleton's ordinance as unconstitutional, but another judge upheld a similar measure in Valley Park, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilkes University political scientist Tom Baldino said he doubts Barletta can rely solely on illegal immigration to propel him to victory, given $4-per-gallon gas and fears of a recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As an issue that's going to resonate with voters come November, I have my doubts,&quot; Baldino said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Inquirer's Jonathan Storm is reporting this week from the television critics press tour in Beverly Hills. These items originally appeared in his blog, &quot;From the Source,&quot; at www.philly.com/philly/blogs/from_the_source. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox to try fewer commercials. Rejoice, rejoice, ye TV fans! Finally, there may be some medicine for the sickness you feel every few minutes when more ads roll around to destroy your shows. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox boss Kevin Reilly confirmed yesterday afternoon that two eagerly awaited new fall shows, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Fringe</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from J.J. Abrams (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Alias</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Lost</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Dollhouse</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from Joss Whedon (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), will run 50 minutes each week, about eight minutes longer than typical network dramas. Which means eight minutes fewer ads. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox will pay a little more for those extra minutes, and advertisers - many have shown interest - will pay a premium to be featured far from the usual clutter. Fox hopes to come out about even, but it's certainly a bonanza for viewers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's gotten to the point where you almost defy the audience to watch the commercials,&quot; Reilly told me. &quot;We can't keep whittling away until you wind up with the content filling just half the time.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to the TV critics en masse, Reilly also said: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fox is really excited about the two-hour </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">24</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;prequel&quot; in November. It's a stand-alone movie sending Jack Bauer to South Africa, but it will set the stage for the show's seventh season, in which our fierce terrorism foe goes on trial for torture. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Simpsons</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is all set for its 21st season, and he would love to see it go on forever, &quot;but it won't.&quot; When the end comes, Fox will be ready to send it off properly and bring in something new. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fox is &quot;not giving up&quot; on sitcoms, even though &quot;a lot of confidence has left the creative space.&quot; Writers are tentative and really don't know what to pitch, &quot;but we're going to really mix it up this year, and meet the writers on their own turf&quot; - whether that's in a restaurant, in their own house, wherever - rather than in &quot;the sterile space&quot; of Fox executive offices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some stuffy critic asked Reilly why the network stood behind the skeevy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Moment of Truth</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> show, in which people get money to reveal betrayals of family and friends. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hey, Reilly said. &quot;This is Fox.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Quiet time with Karl.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove spent a quiet 45 minutes with the TV critics yesterday afternoon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those expecting fireworks were disappointed as Rove acknowledged his Republican roots and John McCain contributions, said his refusal to acknowledge a congressional subpoena was between Congress and the White House, and told the critics they could read his book if they wanted to know whether he thought hiring Michael Brown as head of FEMA was a good idea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rove, as you may know, now works as a political analyst for Fox News, and he was joined onstage by the network's latest hire, former Clinton campaign adviser Howard Wolfson, who acknowledged he was biased, too. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both said they would try to inform viewers, rather than shill for their respective parties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rove got most of the questions. Nobody said, &quot;Awww,&quot; when he said his obsession with politics was &quot;a sad thing.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like somebody who can name the starting lineup of the 1954 Cleveland Indians, I can give you precinct results,&quot; Rove lamented. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rove compared himself to the monster Grendel in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Beowulf</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. No respect. &quot;A lot of people beat up on me. Who cares? I know who I am. I'm not the myth I've been developed into.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was all very moderate, until anchor Chris Wallace accused the critics of having a double standard, asking Fox News mean questions they would never ask anybody else. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Baloney,&quot; and various other retorts, rumbled from the audience. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Fox News came more often to the Television Critics Association Press Tour, Wallace might have a better idea of what goes on.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Olbermann and O'Reilly: Good news at CNN.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN may not be knocking 'em dead, ratings-wise, weekdays at 8 p.m., but Phil Kent, chief executive officer at Turner Broadcasting, which owns the network, isn't shedding any tears. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm glad MSNBC hired Keith Olbermann,&quot; he said the other day. &quot;Now, people will have to stop screaming about how liberal we are.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Olbermann rants from the left, and Fox News' Bill O'Reilly rails from the right, CNN sees itself comfortably in the middle, as the credible cable news network. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN boss Jonathan Klein says his shop has embraced the &quot;post-partisan time where you've got lifelong Democrats who honestly don't know who they will, or should, vote for, and you've got diehard Republicans who see things in Barack Obama that they kind of like.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN, he said, wants to provide them &quot;with the tools they need to make up their minds . . . Our competitors do the opposite. They're entrenched in calcified points of view, highly partisan . . . leaving the vast, open middle for us simply to provide the information.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what about CNN's sister station, Headline News, with such crackpot, beyond biased characters as Nancy Grace and Glenn Beck? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What?&quot; Kent responded. &quot;You don't like Glenn and Nancy?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uh, no. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Jane Kaczmarek: Here comes the judge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From Mom in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Malcolm in the Middle</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to black robes and the bench, Jane Kaczmarek premieres on TNT on Labor Day in Steven Bochco's new legal drama, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Raising the Bar</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. She plays an arrogant, and slightly crazy, judge. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Malcolm</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> costar, Bryan Cranston, has turned heads, starring in the AMC drama </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Breaking Bad</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but it's a big change going from the 9-to-5 hours of toiling on a sitcom to the most demanding of the acting genres, TV drama, where the work can stretch to 16 hours, five days a week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bryan loves it,&quot; she said to me over cocktails. &quot;I love it every now and then.&quot; The veteran Bochco (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Hill Street Blues</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">L.A. Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">NYPD Blue</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) has worked things out, devising a schedule that calls her to work only two days a week, so she can spend time with her three young children. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Malcolm</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, she had enjoyed doing just that fulltime - &quot;breakfast, bedtime and everything in between&quot; - but her agent talked her back to work. &quot; 'If you don't take a job soon,' she told me, 'you're going to stop being offered such great opportunities.' &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is Kaczmarek's second legal drama. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Equal Justice</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lasted a whole season in 1990-91. She got the part for that just as her pal, fellow Yale Drama School grad Chris Noth, was signing on to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Law &amp; Order</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;I wished him a lot of luck, but I thought my show would last much longer than his,&quot; Jane said.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sound plans are being made for Mayview patients</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was distressed by a recent letter regarding anticipated problems connected to the Mayview State Hospital closure (&quot;The System for Those Displaced From Mayview Is Inherently Flawed,&quot; July 3). When my son was admitted to Mayview, I became very involved in mental health advocacy. Because of my intense involvement in this area, I can answer unequivocally that the plans being made to provide services for those being discharged from Mayview are many and detailed, and they are reviewed regularly for validity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true that the community cannot guarantee that no one ever will have problems. But none of us can guarantee that in any area of our lives. I now am friends with many people who, at one time, would have been considered unable to live in the community. Like my son, they live and work in the community and lead full and productive lives. A community atmosphere where people can succeed is as important as caring for those who find success difficult. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, the sale of Mayview State Hospital offers an opportunity to ensure that people with mental illness receive the supports needed to live healthy and safe lives in the community. HB 1448 guarantees the Mayview property will be sold at fair market value and the proceeds used to create a Mental Health Community Services Account. These dollars will help people in current need of mental health services, as well as people needing mental health care in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a county that celebrates many warm and inviting neighborhoods, I hope that we all can welcome community-based supports into our communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVA BEDNAR, Kennedy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer is a member of the Allegheny County Mental Health/Mental Retardation Advisory Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLICE, HELP US</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the recent rash of shootings and burglaries in the once-pleasant community of Mount Washington, the pressing question is, where are the police? Mount Washington is a prime destination for Independence Day festivities, yet the only police activity I saw was retired cops directing traffic. This certainly helped the criminals who burglarized the many vehicles in my neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when a friend called to report a crime in progress, the response time was more than four hours. This is unacceptable. What are these men and women paid to do? It is an embarrassment to our city to let the crime that is now abundant atop Pittsburgh's most visited neighborhood go unanswered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Get with the program, city police, before one more neighborhood becomes unlivable in America's &quot;Most Livable City.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JEFF HEISKELL JR., Mount Washington</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNNEIGHBORLY ACTION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a new miscarriage of justice taking place in Lawrenceville. This time it involves the confiscation of parking spots from local merchants to create a new access way for Children's Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The small shopkeepers in the area between Main Street and 42nd Street along Penn Avenue are marginal businesses and the loss of even a single parking space will have a negative impact on their operations. Somehow this brutal reality is lost on City Council, as well as the zoning and traffic commissions. At this point, the political establishment appears more concerned about the vested interests of UPMC than in supporting the rights of the small shopkeepers, who are an integral part of the Lawrenceville community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many years, St. Francis Medical Center operated one of the largest facilities in the state and was able to provide ambulance service for patients without confiscating parking spots from the local merchants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ask the people of the Penn Avenue business community and they will tell you that St. Francis was a good neighbor. Somehow, at this point, no one can say the same for Children's Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JAMES WUDARCZYK, Lawrenceville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IRAQ WAR SAYS IT ALL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been several stories recently concerning the respective qualifications of Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain to lead and be commander in chief. More specifically, a number of his supporters believe Sen. McCain is inherently qualified due to his military service and his ordeal as a prisoner of war. On the other hand, Sen. Obama has no military background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These arguments are a smokescreen. To determine which candidate better exhibits the leadership and judgment for military and national security matters as president, simply look at the record. John McCain has unerringly supported the totally mistaken, misguided, even immoral or illegal Iraq war of President Bush that has been so damaging on so many different levels. Sen. Obama, in contrast, has always been on record as opposing the war, though he was not a senator at the time it began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. McCain's military experience commands respect. His record as senator on this most important military issue shows complete lack of good judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAVID HAMMOND, Westover, W.Va.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VOTED FOR OBAMA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the Penn Hills woman who is a thoughtful voter, but with whom I disagree in regard to Hillary Clinton (&quot;Hillary Clinton Showed Us She Was Ready to Be President,&quot; July 8 letters): I, like many others I know, voted for Barack Obama, not against Hillary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer mentions Hillary's intelligence (yes), grace and humility (no -- she waited until June 7 to concede and humility can't even be put in the same sentence with Bill Clinton). Stamina? Don't all the politicians have that in one form or another? How many speeches did she write for herself? I don't carry any rose-colored glasses for any of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I remember just a short year ago, when it was all but assumed that Hillary Clinton was the nominee, until Barack Obama came along. No misogyny then from the press, but she saw opportunities from that name of his. Remember the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview, in which said said, &quot;As far as I know [he's not a Muslim]&quot;? Nice try. How about the &quot;3 a.m.&quot; ad, made famous because it plays exactly out of a Karl Rove handbook? Maybe bad advice from staff, but she still had to OK it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What also helped do it for me was that Hillary Clinton supported the Iraq war, but backstepped and tried to make it sound as if she was duped by President Bush, yet Barack Obama is supposed to be the inexperienced one. He showed more wisdom with his early opposition to the war and his reasons why, and that is someone who can sit with world leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We won't see the last of Hillary Clinton. I am hopeful that she is taking the high road of late and reasoning with some of her more angry voters to calm down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. HUTSON, West Mifflin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MARKET FORCES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In &quot;Energy Fantasies&quot; (June 29), Jack Kelly argues that &quot;no one thing&quot; can be a solution to the energy crisis. He is wrong. While it is true that no single form of energy can save us from rising prices and that the goal is to &quot;produce more oil at home, and use less of it,&quot; he has failed to recognize that there is, in fact, one solution to this problem: the free market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The universally unconsidered problem with these well-intentioned solutions is that good or bad, they are congressional policies subject to the arbitrary unpredictability of the political process, the death-knell of progress. It is anybody's guess whether the popular proposals of today will be passed or discarded, let alone the policies of the next administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How effective are tax incentives when the potential for profit overcoming risk is entirely dependent on the whims of Congress? In a free market, consumers and the law of supply and demand determine a company's fate, resulting in competition to provide us with what we want -- cheap, clean energy. In Mr. Kelly's system, individuals are expected to invest in ventures that could be banned tomorrow, and should success ensue, Congress could decide that the profits are not the earners' to keep or invest as they see fit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until Congress lets go and allows each of us to legislate with our wallets, our ability to produce more and consume less will remain a pipe dream indeed, and even the best-intentioned policies will prove fruitless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who would have thunk it -- a short Jewish mayor of a big city who mangles names and other facts in a way that prompts eye-rolling and embarrassed chuckles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another era in our own city, we'd be talking about Mayor Sophie Masloff, who turned Bruce Springsteen into &quot;Bruce Bedspring&quot; and The Who into &quot;The How.&quot; But today, The Morning File toasts New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who offers further proof that when you're rich and powerful, you can sound as ridiculous as you want.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Associated Press notes that Mr. Bloomberg has referred to that fabulous old Central Park concert by &quot;Simon and Garfinkle.&quot; He has called the former manager of the New York Yankees &quot;Joe Torres.&quot; The good-looking country music singer coming to New York was, by his pronunciation, &quot;Shanaga Twain.&quot; If he has to avoid involvement in city decisions that overlap with his business interests, he tells people he must &quot;recluse&quot; himself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bloomberg's aides usually just exchange knowing glances after one of their boss's public bungles,&quot; the AP wrote. &quot;If it's particularly embarrassing, they bend over their BlackBerries and pretend not to have noticed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor's spokesman -- who did not refer to his boss as Mayor Boombox -- says simply that &quot;New Yorkers judge him by what he does, not what he says.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IRANIANS MIGHT THINK MCCAIN BOMBED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President George W. Bush has been mocked repeatedly for mis-speaking, with authors compiling entire books based on statements of his such as: &quot;I know how hard it is to put food on your family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's dangerous for our public servants and candidates to speak without a script, but also more telling. For instance, we learn what kind of sense of humor they have -- or don't. The Morning File, of course, values the Kennedyesque off-the-cuff rejoinder much more than the scripted one-liner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain at least takes a stab at wry ad libs, though his success is debatable. At Primanti Brothers in the Strip District last week, he was asked by a reporter to comment on the increase in U.S. exports of cigarettes, among other products, to Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe that's a way of killing them,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comment drew some laughs, and Mr. McCain quickly sought to make clear that he was, in fact, joking. These things have a way of getting twisted around by the slimy media, after all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, that type of humor -- bound to just slay the Iranians -- reminded some of how he parodied the Beach Boys song &quot;Barbara Ann&quot; previously, in reference to our Middle East rival. He jokingly sang &quot;Bomb bomb bomb, bomb bomb Iran&quot; to the melody. Ha ha ha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OBAMA RELATED TO CHENEY? THAT'S FUNNY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's less evidence of Barack Obama trying to be funny in impromptu ways. He's apparently either more serious or careful. Though he had time to prepare it, he did get off a good one-liner on &quot;The Tonight Show With Jay Leno&quot; last year, when the host asked about genealogical assertions that he and Dick Cheney are eighth cousins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to be invited to the family hunting party,&quot; Mr. Obama said, smiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THAT CHURCHILL: WHAT A SCREAM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">College of Charleston communications professor Chris Lamb recently compiled a book, &quot;I'll Be Sober in the Morning,&quot; based on &quot;great political comebacks, putdowns and ripostes.&quot; It is heavy on the humor of Winston Churchill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, the British statesman's political rival, Nancy Astor, once snapped at him, &quot;Winston, if you were my husband, I'd put poison in your coffee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Churchill's response: &quot;If you were my wife, Nancy, I'd drink it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOW THERE'S A RINGING ENDORSEMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lamb's book has just one Pennsylvania reference, but it doesn't reflect any great wit by a Keystone state politician. Instead, former Gov. Robert Casey is the butt of the humor, and he told the joke on himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Scranton-bred Democrat was campaigning for re-election as governor in 1990 in Oil City, far from his power base. He approached a gas station attendant with the standard, &quot;Hi, I'm running for governor&quot; introduction, and asked for his vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man said sure, he'd vote for him. But when Mr. Casey asked why, the attendant explained, &quot;Anybody would be better than the guy that's in there now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's less entertaining is the complicity of the Washington media establishment in creating and sustaining these fictions for self-aggrandizing purposes of its own. All that hoo-hah from journalists about their relentless search for the truth?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe in Des Moines or Spokane. But among Washington courtier/pundits, most high-profile political coverage consists of make-believe narratives concocted to sway voters emotionally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In consequence, much of the electorate's flying blind, a dangerous way for a democracy to operate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One ludicrous recent example was an outburst of pretended outrage by the McCain campaign over some relatively innocuous remarks by Gen. Wesley Clark on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding McCain's captivity and torture in North Vietnam, Clark began by saying this: &quot;I certainly honor his service as a prisoner of war. He was a hero to me, and to hundreds of thousands and millions of others in the armed forces, as a prisoner of war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hero to millions. Got that? Clark added that McCain lacked the kind of command experience arguably useful to a president -- unlike the general himself, a highly decorated (and gravely wounded) Vietnam combat veteran and former NATO Supreme Commander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Host Bob Schieffer pushed the point: &quot;I have to say, Barack Obama has not had any of those experiences either, nor has he ridden in a fighter plane and gotten shot down ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I don't think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down,&quot; Clark responded, &quot;is a qualification to be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of his self-deprecating flyboy persona, McCain himself often jokes about how little skill it takes to intercept a heat-seeking missile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Clark can be faulted, it's for maybe polishing his own brass when he was supposed to be touting Obama, and for adopting Schieffer's language, easily taken out of context by the art of malicious paraphrase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is exactly what McCain's campaign did next, issuing out a press release whining that Clark had &quot;attacked John McCain's military service record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's plainly absurd. &quot;Clark had done nothing of the kind,&quot; wrote Zachary Roth in the Columbia Journalism Review. &quot;He had questioned the relevance of McCain's combat experience as a qualification to be president of the United States. This is a distinction that you'd expect any reasonably intelligent 9-year old to be able to grasp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ah, but that would leave out Washington's high-dollar press corps. Reports in the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, on CNN and MSNBC claimed, as the Los Angeles Times phrased it, that Clark &quot;didn't pay proper homage to McCain's greatest sacrifice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which, of course, he certainly had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Politico claimed that the retired general had &quot;invoked McCain's military service against him.&quot; An editor for The New Republic opined that it'd be naive not to recognize Clark's comments as part of a covert scheme by Obama not only to belittle McCain's Vietnam exploits but to suggest that they &quot;rendered him psychologically unfit for presidential office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheerest fiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking matters further, MSNBC correspondent Andrea Mitchell described a TV ad criticizing McCain's stance on Iraq as part of &quot;an organized campaign against John McCain's military service.&quot; Would it shock you to learn that the ad mentions McCain's service not at all?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Jamison Foser writes at mediamatters.com, Mitchell &quot;may as well have said a giant purple unicorn had called McCain a traitor, for all the truth there was to her statement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ah, but Mitchell (Mrs. Alan Greenspan in civilian life) is a bona fide Washington media celebrity, a courtier/pundit of high social standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As such, it's crucial to understand, she can appear on national television and say virtually anything she pleases about any politician, especially any Democrat -- even something so patently false and irresponsible it'd get her disciplined or fired from most provincial newspapers like the one you're reading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So-called &quot;mainstream&quot; Washington journalism, see, isn't a profession as most educated Americans understand the term. It's more like a social clique or a fraternal order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Driven by ambition and status anxiety, members and aspirants alike adopt group narratives for many reasons -- to secure invitations to the right dinner parties, rub elbows with the great, appear on TV chat shows, earn higher lecture fees, win book contracts, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mere accuracy, alas, gets lost in the shuffle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to politics, I'm consistent - consistently wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just a couple of months ago I would have bet my bottom dollar (and do in fact have a friendly $10 wager with an old buddy familiar with my dismal record) that Barack Obama would go down to the worst defeat in presidential election history since George McGovern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe the Democrats really were totally out of touch. There was the specter of the Rev. Wright and the dumb, dumb, dumb &quot;bitter&quot; comment about God and guns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forget the whole race issue, how could they think middle America was ready to vote for a guy whose middle name is Hussein? Sure, those e-mails are pure malarkey, but I meet people with disturbing regularity who honestly seem to believe Obama's flesh burns if he touches a Bible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even my trekkie friends were worried, recalling that were it not for actress Jeri Ryan - who played uber-hot cyborg Seven-of-Nine on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; - the guy might not be running for president today. Back in 2004, her husband, Republican Jack Ryan, was heavily favored to beat Obama in the race for the empty Illinois senate seat. But in embarrassing divorce-court filings made public during the campaign, the actress accused her husband of pressuring her to go to sex clubs. Ryan withdrew from the race and Obama got 70 percent of the vote against last-minute candidate Alan Keyes, who had to move to Illinois to even run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sure, we're told Obama is plenty popular with voters too young to remember Voyager, but people under 25 still seem to have a hard time getting to the polls here in the 21st century. And they've never been as uniformly left-wing as the media likes to make them out to be. Just ask George McGovern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, despite my confident naysaying, Obama is a comfortable eight points ahead in the polls right now. A new survey says 75 percent of Democrats are satisfied with their candidate, compared to just 49 percent of Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's looking, dare I say it, tan and fit, while McCain's had a feeble week of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, there were the comments of McCain economic advisor Phil Gramm, who dismissed the nation's economic woes as psychological.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have sort of become a nation of whiners,&quot; Gramm said in a Washington Times interview. &quot;You've heard of mental depression; this is a mental recession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain moved quickly to distance himself from what he called Gramm's own &quot;mental recession,&quot; but it allowed the Democrats to point to the candidate's own past comments on the psychological nature of the downturn. And it was Obama who got the big laughs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America already has one Dr. Phil,&quot; he said. &quot;We don't need another one when it comes to the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there was the confrontation with Maeve Reston of the Los Angeles Times, the pool reporter on McCain's campaign bus, the so-called Straight Talk Express.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another McCain advisor (and possible vice-presidential candidate), Carly Fiorina, had made the comment that it was unfair for insurance companies to cover Viagra but not birth control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reston wanted to know where the candidate, who voted twice against requiring insurers to cover prescription birth control, stood on his advisor's comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My abilities as a writer fail me when I try to describe McCain's response; I can only urge you to see the online video for yourself. All I can say is the poor guy looked like he was trying to climb out of his own skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I certainly do not want to discuss that issue,&quot; McCain said. &quot;I don't recall the vote right now. But I'll be glad to look at it and get back to you as to why.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Reston pressed on. Did he think it was fair, the reporter wanted to know, for some insurance companies to cover the erectile dysfunction medication but not birth control?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain squirmed for a full eight seconds, an eternity on the air. &quot;I don't know enough about it to give you an informed answer,&quot; he finally stammered, &quot;because I don't recall the vote. I've cast thousands of votes in the Senate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, he has cast thousands of votes, and he's been willing to go against his own party far more often than has Obama in the Illinois senator's short time in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've always respected John McCain as a good man, and a patriot, who was willing to confront as well as compromise to do what he thought best for his country. That's why it pains me to see him squirm so to avoid a straight answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heck, this guy stood up to Hanoi interrogators - surely he can do better with the L.A. Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I still think I'm right about at least one thing - both McCain and Obama, who's doing a much better job of selling his own white-bread American history in his commercials these days, are reasonable men who'll hear both sides and try to do what's best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either would be a whole lot better than the current president, and you call can me a lefty if you will, but I'm certain I'm right about that.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LANCASTER GENERAL HOSPITAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've always received excellent health care from Lancaster General Hospital. I have nothing but praise for its nurses, physicians and clerical personnel. But if I were to pick the most disappointing institution in our county, LGH would probably be it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health care costs are skyrocketing, and Lancaster General is obviously part of the problem. For a nonprofit institution to reap such huge bounty, and to do so largely off the backs of people who are sick and dying, is repugnant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LGH gets terrific press by giving Lancaster a million or two in lieu of taxes. Big whoopie. Let LGH give away $50 million from its annual profits and I'll be impressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What LGH really should do is lower its fees so that it does less harm to families while still clearing a reasonable surplus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unseemly&quot; is too weak a word for LGH's ongoing profiteering. &quot;Obscene&quot; hits closer to the mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Len Eiserer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millersville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to your article last Sunday, LGH charges the poor who are uninsured, as well as those who are conscientiously opposed to commercial insurance, more than - as much as double - it charges the government and insurance companies for the same services. Common practice (everybody does it) is irrelevant. It is nevertheless immoral and unjust.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENTIAL RACE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just a suggestion for the politicians running for office and the two dunderheads running for presidency: Instead of going door-to-door or visiting other countries, go to the local unemployment office and see all your constituents at once. I'm sure you're not brave enough to face those problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shirley A. Derme, Lancaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During Sen. McCain's visit to Mexico, I wish he had met with the people I met on my recent trip there with the human rights groups Unitarian Universalist Service Committee and Witness for Peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish he had talked with some of the more than 2 million small farmers who have been displaced since the North American Free Trade Agreement, or with the nearly 270,000 Mexicans whose NAFTA-created factory jobs have moved to Asia. I wish he had heard the stories of communities in southern Mexico where no working-age people remain. They all have made the dangerous journey to look for work in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he met those brave people and heard those tragic stories, he would realize that NAFTA has harmed the vast majority of Mexicans as well as working people in the U.S. He'd learn that our trade policy has led to more desperation, which has driven more immigration to the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next president of the United States needs to rethink U.S. trade policy, beginning with a renegotiation of NAFTA.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, we have seen pictures of Obama with his father and his Muslim family, but I never heard the rumor that Obama has a radical Islamic background [Perspective, July 6]. There is another rumor I have heard, and maybe the bright young scholar Danielle Allen could track it down. She has done such a great job disproving the &quot;radical&quot; slur, perhaps this would be easier to trace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have heard that Obama's voting record in the Senate is 15 percent. I find this hard to believe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lancaster Township</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor's note: Salon.com reported that as of June 25, Sen. Barack Obama missed 43.3 percent of the votes taken by the 110th Congress. Sen. John McCain missed 61.4 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOVERNMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STUDY COMMISSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tsunami of propaganda in favor of home rule has started, even without spending the $50,000 the Government Study Commission has in reserve to brainwash the public into believing this travesty will be good for us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's being glossed over or not mentioned at all is: Are we willing to throw away our right to choose for ourselves whom we want to handle the reins of county government?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the start of the GSC, John Smucker was asked if county government works. His answer: Yes, of course it works, absolutely. He was the first one to vote to change it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked again at the meeting at the Farm and Home Center, &quot;How is county government broken?&quot; his answer is that it isn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So let's eliminate three department heads, take away 95 percent of the commissioners' duties, elect two more commissioners, and appoint a county executive whom we can't fire [without the approval of four of five commissioners].</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent letters about the proposed changes [home rule] in county government, opinions by me and Bill Saylor have been made fairly clear. I'd like to stop talking and instead hear from someone who stands to gain from the changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John W. Dooley, Lancaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VINDICATION?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article stated that more than 550 tons of yellowcake was brought from Iraq to Canada to keep it from the hands of terrorists. This is really big news because this uranium yellowcake could have been refined into nuclear weapons by Saddam at any time and proves that he was in the process of developing a nuclear capability. It also shows again that Ambassador Wilson lied in his report about Niger's supply of such material to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The willingness of our mainstream media to ignore this significant revelation goes hand in hand with their consistent failure to report progress in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Marcks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lancaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the federal government has supplied information that should provide relief for those who claimed Saddam Hussein was developing weapons of mass destruction. The Sunday News [July 6] reported that the removal of 550 metric tons of &quot;yellowcake&quot; from Iraq to Canada, completing a secret U.S. operation, was closing the book on Saddam's nuclear legacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank goodness that senators such as Jay Rockefeller and Hillary Clinton and many others supported President George W. Bush when he proposed we take action to remove Hussein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do believe that Joseph Wilson (Valerie Plame's husband) must feel a bit embarrassed now, since he had ridiculed a CIA report that Niger had signed an agreement to sell 500 tons of uranium a year to Baghdad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Great news, eh, Gil [Smart, Sunday News columnist]?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel D. Jury</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mount Joy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nI couldn't believe the item in last week's Sunday News, under &quot;Around the World&quot; on Page A2. The story detailed Saddam Hussein's 550 metric tons of &quot;seed material for higher grade nuclear enrichment&quot; reaching a Canadian port.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With all of the charges from the left about the Bush administration lying about weapons of mass destruction, why wasn't this front-page news in The New York Times and the Sunday News? The majority of Americans are convinced by the media that Hussein didn't have a nuclear program. Why should I believe there is no media bias ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronald P. Harper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lancaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor's note: According to The New York Times, the &quot;yellowcake removed from Iraq - which was not the yellowcake that President Bush claimed, in a now discredited section of his 2003 State of the Union address, that Saddam was trying to purchase in Africa - is used in an early stage of the nuclear fuel cycle. Only after intensive processing does it become low-enriched uranium, which can fuel reactors producing power. Highly enriched uranium can be used in nuclear bombs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OTHER SUBJECTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read with interest Albert Siegfried's letter [June 29] regarding veterans' medications, in which he unfairly insinuated that our opposition was profit-driven. Repackaging drugs opens a dangerous door for diversion and adulteration, compromising patient safety. He also confuses us with the pharmaceutical industry. We represent individual pharmacists, the ones in your community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem that the bill tries, ineffectively, to address is caused by the Department of Veterans Affairs, which refuses to allow long-term-care pharmacies to bill the VA. Veterans need to demand a change in this policy. In Mr. Siegfried's example of one vet's increased drug cost, the difference in pricing was not pharmacy profit. It is due to special &quot;trade of class&quot; pricing for the VA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We fully support the right of veterans to the medications they need, but not at our expense. Supporting our veterans is an obligation of all Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this bill were to pass, pharmacies would be forced to repackage VA medications at a loss. What business can provide a service at a loss? Then, who will provide pharmacy services to patients in these facilities? Who will make a midnight run to deliver a needed medication? It won't be the VA.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With all due respect, are you people insane? What gives you the right to turn down state funds in these economic hard times?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You decide to refuse funds because you object to where the monies originated. State money can come from confiscated drug money, police auctions of goods and properties seized during an arrest, and now, thank God, gambling money. Whether you approve of gambling or not, it has been approved by the people of Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You've made your point, no matter how ridiculous, and you now stand out as the most moral school district in the state - also the stupidest.You put an unnecessary burden on your constituents, all to make a point. Do us all a favor and make this point with your own money and not ours. We need the help.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is addressed to the person who fled after hitting our car on East Market Street in Marietta at 12:10 a.m. June 29:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your decision is causing us a financial burden. We are dealing with our insurance company, the rental car company, the body shop and lost work and wages. Not only did you scrape, break and detach parts from the driver's side, you hit our car so hard the axle seals broke, leaving us unable to drive it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a response to Beth H. Bonner's letter [June 29], I would beg to differ with whom she considers a radical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funds for Animals and the Humane Society of the United States may not be radical enough for Ms. Bonner, but they are for the rest of us in rural Lancaster County, a serious provider of livestock and milk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lancaster County is also the home of the state's third-largest licensed hunting population. There is a lot of wild game and venison in freezers, much of which is an absolute necessity for living our rural life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We ,as livestock growers, and sport hunters cannot have a representative like Joe Pitts voting in favor of radical animal rights groups 1 percent of the time, let alone 67 percent of the time, as he demonstrated on Project Vote Smart in 2007. He has indeed supported animal rights radicals. You say he is not on your team, and he has proven he is not on ours. Then whose team is he on?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I probably fall into Mr. Adams' &quot;yes, but&quot; crowd, and I would like to inform him that we are also patriots, and far from the &quot;America haters&quot; some on the right would make us out to be. We don't hate America, but the version conservatives are shoving down our throats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as love for one's child does not mean never scolding bad behavior, love of one's country requires speaking up when those in power misbehave.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The median has narrowed this portion of state highway to one lane in each direction, resulting in increased congestion. Ambulances and police cars that formerly used the center lane can no longer do so. I have seen ambulances come to a standstill.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've always received excellent health care from Lancaster General Hospital. I have nothing but praise for its nurses, physicians and clerical personnel. But if I were to pick the most disappointing institution in our county, LGH would probably be it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health care costs are skyrocketing, and Lancaster General is obviously part of the problem. For a nonprofit institution to reap such huge bounty, and to do so largely off the backs of people who are sick and dying, is repugnant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LGH gets terrific press by giving Lancaster a million or two in lieu of taxes. Big whoopie. Let LGH give away $50 million from its annual profits and I'll be impressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What LGH really should do is lower its fees so that it does less harm to families while still clearing a reasonable surplus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unseemly&quot; is too weak a word for LGH's ongoing profiteering. &quot;Obscene&quot; hits closer to the mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Len Eiserer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millersville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to your article last Sunday, LGH charges the poor who are uninsured, as well as those who are conscientiously opposed to commercial insurance, more than - as much as double - it charges the government and insurance companies for the same services. Common practice (everybody does it) is irrelevant. It is nevertheless immoral and unjust.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENTIAL RACE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just a suggestion for the politicians running for office and the two dunderheads running for presidency: Instead of going door-to-door or visiting other countries, go to the local unemployment office and see all your constituents at once. I'm sure you're not brave enough to face those problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shirley A. Derme, Lancaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During Sen. McCain's visit to Mexico, I wish he had met with the people I met on my recent trip there with the human rights groups Unitarian Universalist Service Committee and Witness for Peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish he had talked with some of the more than 2 million small farmers who have been displaced since the North American Free Trade Agreement, or with the nearly 270,000 Mexicans whose NAFTA-created factory jobs have moved to Asia. I wish he had heard the stories of communities in southern Mexico where no working-age people remain. They all have made the dangerous journey to look for work in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he met those brave people and heard those tragic stories, he would realize that NAFTA has harmed the vast majority of Mexicans as well as working people in the U.S. He'd learn that our trade policy has led to more desperation, which has driven more immigration to the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next president of the United States needs to rethink U.S. trade policy, beginning with a renegotiation of NAFTA.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, we have seen pictures of Obama with his father and his Muslim family, but I never heard the rumor that Obama has a radical Islamic background [Perspective, July 6]. There is another rumor I have heard, and maybe the bright young scholar Danielle Allen could track it down. She has done such a great job disproving the &quot;radical&quot; slur, perhaps this would be easier to trace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have heard that Obama's voting record in the Senate is 15 percent. I find this hard to believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joan Reid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lancaster Township</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor's note: Salon.com reported that as of June 25, Sen. Barack Obama missed 43.3 percent of the votes taken by the 110th Congress. Sen. John McCain missed 61.4 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOVERNMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STUDY COMMISSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tsunami of propaganda in favor of home rule has started, even without spending the $50,000 the Government Study Commission has in reserve to brainwash the public into believing this travesty will be good for us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's being glossed over or not mentioned at all is: Are we willing to throw away our right to choose for ourselves whom we want to handle the reins of county government?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the start of the GSC, John Smucker was asked if county government works. His answer: Yes, of course it works, absolutely. He was the first one to vote to change it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked again at the meeting at the Farm and Home Center, &quot;How is county government broken?&quot; his answer is that it isn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So let's eliminate three department heads, take away 95 percent of the commissioners' duties, elect two more commissioners, and appoint a county executive whom we can't fire [without the approval of four of five commissioners].</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent letters about the proposed changes [home rule] in county government, opinions by me and Bill Saylor have been made fairly clear. I'd like to stop talking and instead hear from someone who stands to gain from the changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John W. Dooley, Lancaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VINDICATION?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article stated that more than 550 tons of yellowcake was brought from Iraq to Canada to keep it from the hands of terrorists. This is really big news because this uranium yellowcake could have been refined into nuclear weapons by Saddam at any time and proves that he was in the process of developing a nuclear capability. It also shows again that Ambassador Wilson lied in his report about Niger's supply of such material to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The willingness of our mainstream media to ignore this significant revelation goes hand in hand with their consistent failure to report progress in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Marcks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lancaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the federal government has supplied information that should provide relief for those who claimed Saddam Hussein was developing weapons of mass destruction. The Sunday News [July 6] reported that the removal of 550 metric tons of &quot;yellowcake&quot; from Iraq to Canada, completing a secret U.S. operation, was closing the book on Saddam's nuclear legacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank goodness that senators such as Jay Rockefeller and Hillary Clinton and many others supported President George W. Bush when he proposed we take action to remove Hussein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do believe that Joseph Wilson (Valerie Plame's husband) must feel a bit embarrassed now, since he had ridiculed a CIA report that Niger had signed an agreement to sell 500 tons of uranium a year to Baghdad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Great news, eh, Gil [Smart, Sunday News columnist]?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel D. Jury</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mount Joy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nI couldn't believe the item in last week's Sunday News, under &quot;Around the World&quot; on Page A2. The story detailed Saddam Hussein's 550 metric tons of &quot;seed material for higher grade nuclear enrichment&quot; reaching a Canadian port.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With all of the charges from the left about the Bush administration lying about weapons of mass destruction, why wasn't this front-page news in The New York Times and the Sunday News? The majority of Americans are convinced by the media that Hussein didn't have a nuclear program. Why should I believe there is no media bias ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronald P. Harper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lancaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor's note: According to The New York Times, the &quot;yellowcake removed from Iraq - which was not the yellowcake that President Bush claimed, in a now discredited section of his 2003 State of the Union address, that Saddam was trying to purchase in Africa - is used in an early stage of the nuclear fuel cycle. Only after intensive processing does it become low-enriched uranium, which can fuel reactors producing power. Highly enriched uranium can be used in nuclear bombs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OTHER SUBJECTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read with interest Albert Siegfried's letter [June 29] regarding veterans' medications, in which he unfairly insinuated that our opposition was profit-driven. Repackaging drugs opens a dangerous door for diversion and adulteration, compromising patient safety. He also confuses us with the pharmaceutical industry. We represent individual pharmacists, the ones in your community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem that the bill tries, ineffectively, to address is caused by the Department of Veterans Affairs, which refuses to allow long-term-care pharmacies to bill the VA. Veterans need to demand a change in this policy. In Mr. Siegfried's example of one vet's increased drug cost, the difference in pricing was not pharmacy profit. It is due to special &quot;trade of class&quot; pricing for the VA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We fully support the right of veterans to the medications they need, but not at our expense. Supporting our veterans is an obligation of all Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this bill were to pass, pharmacies would be forced to repackage VA medications at a loss. What business can provide a service at a loss? Then, who will provide pharmacy services to patients in these facilities? Who will make a midnight run to deliver a needed medication? It won't be the VA.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With all due respect, are you people insane? What gives you the right to turn down state funds in these economic hard times?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You decide to refuse funds because you object to where the monies originated. State money can come from confiscated drug money, police auctions of goods and properties seized during an arrest, and now, thank God, gambling money. Whether you approve of gambling or not, it has been approved by the people of Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You've made your point, no matter how ridiculous, and you now stand out as the most moral school district in the state - also the stupidest.You put an unnecessary burden on your constituents, all to make a point. Do us all a favor and make this point with your own money and not ours. We need the help.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is addressed to the person who fled after hitting our car on East Market Street in Marietta at 12:10 a.m. June 29:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your decision is causing us a financial burden. We are dealing with our insurance company, the rental car company, the body shop and lost work and wages. Not only did you scrape, break and detach parts from the driver's side, you hit our car so hard the axle seals broke, leaving us unable to drive it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who saw you told us that you drove a small white sports car with a black top and a fin on the trunk. Your car will have damage to the passenger's side, and you will also need a new tire and rim. The police have pieces of your rim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After insurance, we are still out $1,500. If the person who hit our car has any remorse, please contact Susquehanna Regional Police Department. In bad economic times, not many of us have an extra $1,500 to waste on someone else's mistake.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In last Saturday's column, Charles Krauthammer bemoaned Barack Obama's morphing of positions (including that oh-so-important lapel pin dust-up), and it struck me as an incredible example of chutzpah for a McCain supporter to make such complaints (&quot;A Morphing Obama Keeps Us Guessing About His True Beliefs,&quot; July 5). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recently read a list itemizing more than 40 documented changes of position by Sen. John McCain since he began his run for the presidency. Some switched in the course of a day and one position reversed over the course of a television commercial break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All candidates &quot;adjust&quot; their positions somewhat when they transform from primaries to general elections, but it is Sen. McCain who is setting new records for pandering and hypocrisy this election cycle. It seems the &quot;Straight Talk Express&quot; is something of a misnomer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night I suffered the same dilemma so many women do. Gentlemen, do not put the paper down or flip over to the sports section. I read the sports section first. I do not rush to the paper to find out how to make a perfect corn muffin. If the powers that be wanted you to make the perfect corn muffin, they wouldn't have invented the perfect corn muffin mix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week we had the Olympic trials for swimming and track and field. We had Wimbledon, which gave us the most incredible Gentlemen's Final in the history of tennis. Once all of those important events were over, we had the beginning of the Tour de France. I had little time to think of anything about home and lifestyle and it will be unlikely that I will tune into the 6,000 speeches from our presidential candidates until the Olympics have doused that inspirational torch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a woman working at home, I am quite busy and have little time to ponder the all-too-feminine burning question of &quot;What should I wear tonight?&quot; The Olympic trialists don't care. Tiger Woods doesn't care. The incredible athletes in their Wimbledon whites don't care and I am sure the cyclists don't even have time to look at the adoring crowds on the byways of Brittany and beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are times that one must put away the important events of the day and greet people who have no idea what the peloton is to bike racing. Then you're forced to ask the question, &quot;What should I wear tonight?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You may be too young to remember a nickel or dime back defense, but you certainly have asked your spouse, &quot;What should I wear tonight?&quot; Men's choices are limited. They have the narrow range of long pants, shorts, collared shirt and long- sleeved shirt, blazer, suit, sweater or tuxedo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, men ask and we, obviously being the weaker sex, reply, &quot;Honey, does this look right?&quot; And he answers, &quot;You look fine.&quot; I could be dressed as the Travelocity gnome and he would still say, &quot;You look fine.&quot; I never ask, &quot;Do I look fat in this dress?&quot; My eyes may be growing dim, but I still know the answer to that loaded question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet there I was staring into my closet and asking the question that Eve probably asked Adam after the biting of the apple: &quot;Honey, what fig leaf should I wear tonight?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I expected no answer, but I did stare into the deep, dark recesses of my closet only to discover that I am totally out of fashion. I am not with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am not a fashionista. I wasn't even sure what a fashionista was and so I looked it up. According to Miriam Webster, a fashionista is a designer, promoter or follower of the latest fashions. The word was coined in 1993. I make it a point not to use language that was coined after the birth of my daughter and that was far before 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A political ad was on the screen as I looked up the word. It was for Barack Obama. He is not a fashionista. His fashion is a bit on the boring side, as is that of John McCain. The American people lost a true fashionista when Hillary Clinton shed her pantsuits. I wonder what she's wearing tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why am I not a fashionista? I know that Madonna is one. I don't own any of her CDs. I did see her in the movie &quot;Evita&quot; and she wasn't bad, although I saw Patti LuPone on Broadway, and Madonna wasn't even a close fourth, but she has her style. I could never emulate it. I couldn't figure out how to make a bra out of funnels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I didn't look all that bad the other night in a crisp skirt and tasteful blouse, but I was hardly a fashionista.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reclusive polygamous sect raided in Texas is now trying to put its own marketing spin on their way of life. They made the news for weeks and now they must feel that some payback is in order. They are marketing a clothing line complete with long johns, long-sleeved, high-collared dresses, proper blouses and lose-fitting pants. These folks aren't as tied to the 19th century as their attire may make you think they are. They have their own Website. While they are promoting a &quot;Princess Line&quot; straight out of &quot;Little House on the Prairie,&quot; they are hip enough to offer it in eight colors. The Website reportedly says that the clothing offered is for children and teenagers and meets all the qualifications for modesty and neatness. Each piece is said to be made with care. Just try and get your teenagers to wear this style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe I will log on to their Website. Who knows, I may be the next fashionista.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was sitting in my doctor's office recently and flipping through a Newsweek magazine that was older than my physician. (The lead story was that the president and his cabinet were fearful that Adolf Hitler might invade Poland.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, while I was reading about President Roosevelt's worries, my mind turned to my write-in presidential campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More specifically, I thought about our economy, which can best be described by using a technical term coined by the great economist John Maynard Keynes: lousy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's face it. Our electronics industry is in the toilet. About the only electronic thing we still make in the United States is The Clapper. Everything else is made in Japan, China or India. We don't even make the best cars anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About the only thing we still hand-manufacture in this country is the Auntie Anne's soft pretzel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During my administration all this will change, for I vow to make America the world's greatest producer of adjustable baseball caps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a great idea. It will work. And I'll explain it to you just as soon as you stop laughing and get up off the floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You finished now? Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look around. Adjustable baseball caps are everywhere. Everybody is wearing them, except actual baseball players, so I'm surprised nobody thought of it before now, especially our recent presidents, most of whom have been seen wearing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every year, millions and millions of adjustable baseball caps are sold in this country, and not one that I've seen was American-made. So my plan is quite simple: We close our ports to overseas shipments, mobilize American industry and start cranking out those suckers in record numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, we've met challenges before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During World War II, Hitler and his henchmen laughed when Roosevelt said America would produce 1,000 warplanes a week. (I read that in another issue of Newsweek in my doctor's office.) We exceeded that goal, and where is Hitler today? Unemployed, to say the least.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if we gear up as a nation and energize those many thousands of workers whose high-tech jobs were outsourced to Mexico, we can produce enough adjustable baseball caps to blow both Taiwan and Hong Kong, our major competitors, out of the water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let Japan keep making its electronics; our recovery will stun the world, and every Japanese employee at Sony will be wearing an adjustable baseball cap made in the USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll erase the national debt by the end of my first term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, this all needs to be done tactfully. Besides producing caps with logos such as Let me tell you about my grandkids, we'll customize. But we will not demean ourselves by making silly caps with protruding things like moose antlers, or with battery-powered clocks embedded in them. That's stupid. Every time the wearer wants to know what time it is, he'd have to remove his hat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My recovery plan is flawless, with one major exception - marketing it to women. They don't seem to have the same infatuation with adjustable baseball caps that we men do. It probably has something to do with their natural instincts for fashion and good taste. So we'll have to find some way to overcome that, possibly through surgery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Implementing this idea will be tough, but I'm sure my commerce secretary can handle it. That's why I will select Billy Mays - the guy on TV who advertises things such as the Hercules Hook. He could sell space heaters in hell, and he's just the one to help spur our economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So vote for me, for while Barack Obama promises change and John McCain promises the same-old same-old, with me, I promise endless surprises.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A banner slogan on the Pemberton Republican Club's Web site that said, &quot;Obama loves America like O.J. loved Nicole,&quot; disappeared yesterday after local Democrats alleged racist campaign tactics.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Web master, Ed Kuck, a recently elected Republican County committeeman, said he had seen the slogan on an Internet site and copied it onto the club's Web page about a month ago as &quot;a joke.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He removed it yesterday from the site, http://homewebs.net/pem, after a community person told him it would offend people, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I found out it was inappropriate, and I took it down,&quot; Kuck said, adding: &quot;I just want to apologize to anybody who was offended, because that wasn't our intention at all.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pemberton Councilwoman Diane Stinney said a Republican friend had called to tell her about the ad, saying: &quot;I just want you to know I'm very disappointed with our Republican page.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stinney then reported it to fellow Democrats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the slogan had offended her, adding that Pemberton is a very diverse community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've come a very long way, and we people of different colors still have a lot of growing up to do, but there are other issues that the two [presidential] candidates have to and should be addressing,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Perr, chairman of the Burlington County Democratic Committee, said that, although the phrase was taken down, he preserved a copy of it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comparing U.S. Sen. Barack Obama, the presumed Democratic nominee for president, &quot;to O.J. Simpson, an accused murderer who was found civilly liable for his ex-wife's death, is reprehensible,&quot; Perr said in a statement. &quot;Moreover, it is a veiled attempt at inserting race into the political arena, for which the Republicans should be ashamed.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Layton, who heads the Burlington County GOP, immediately denounced the slogan as &quot;despicable&quot; and &quot;the worst kind of tactics.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Layton said, &quot;There's no place in Burlington County Republican politics for this.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his organization has successfully backed African Americans and women for county and state legislative offices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The slogan referenced NFL Hall of Famer O.J. Simpson's acquittal in the 1994 murders of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The phrase has been making the rounds on Web sites, posters and campaign buttons. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kuck said he had put it up when he went to add pictures of a rally at Burlington County College for U.S. Sen. John McCain, the presumptive GOP presidential candidate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kuck said the Pemberton Republican Club mostly concerned itself with local issues and candidates and probably wouldn't get too involved with the presidential race. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drawing the sharpest distinctions yet between himself and the man he hopes to replace, Sen. John McCain said Tuesday his presidency would focus on climate change issues, reducing federal spending, closing the Guantanamo Bay detention center and eliminating torture by the U.S. government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a meeting with the Tribune-Review's editorial board, McCain, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, said &quot;spending got out of control&quot; under the Bush administration. He blamed Congress for pushing spending and the administration for failing to halt it.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Spending has increased by some 40 percent -- the greatest increase in the size of government since the 'Great Society' &quot; of the 1960s, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said he &quot;urgently recommended&quot; that Bush veto such spending, to no avail.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's a very heavy price we're paying for letting spending get totally out of control,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain provided no timetable for pulling out of Iraq, where the war costs about $100 billion a year.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will withdraw with honor and victory,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain pledged to shut down the controversial detention center in Cuba, which has been criticized for its conditions by human rights activists. The Bush administration has been criticized for allowing terror suspects to be subjected to harsh interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding. McCain, a former prisoner of war, opposes the use of torture. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator brushed aside a comment by Iraq's national security adviser that his country will not accept any security deal with the United States unless it contains specific dates for the withdrawal of U.S.-led forces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I met recently with their foreign minister and president. Both of them share my views completely. Americans will withdraw. It will be dictated by events on the ground, by the success we have made, and that success has been significant but it's still fragile,&quot; McCain said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They still agree that if you set an artificial date for withdrawal, the way that Senator Obama wanted to do, then we will have a resurgence of the fighting and the various factions within Iraq, Iranian influence will increase and we still risk a wider war. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The benefits of success are reduced Iranian influence, a functioning -- not great, but functioning -- Iraqi government and military, and a stable U.S. ally in the region.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad challenging McCain and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to debate, McCain said such an event would only serve to give Ahmadinejad legitimacy. He said he &quot;would sit down with him tomorrow&quot; if Ahmadinejad promised to respect the right of Israel to exist. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On immigration and border security, McCain noted that a bill he and Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., attempted to get through the Senate &quot;failed because Americans did not have confidence that we would secure the borders.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our borders have to be secured not only because of illegal immigration, but because of drugs. The influence and inflow of drugs into our country is a devastating one,&quot; McCain said. &quot;So we need to secure the borders first, but we need a comprehensive approach to the problem.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain supports a &quot;temporary worker program&quot; enforced through &quot;tamper-proof&quot; identification documents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 12 million people illegally in the country, approximately 2 million are suspected criminals &quot;who've got to be rounded up ... and deported.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the others, we've got to have a compassionate approach to this issue,&quot; McCain said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reducing America's reliance on foreign oil is key to making the economy stronger, and it must be a national mission, McCain said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is in a &quot;spiral&quot; -- sending hundreds of millions of dollars overseas to oil-producing countries as the dollar weakens and the price of oil goes up, McCain said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we're watching is the greatest transfer of wealth&quot; from the United States to oil-producing nations, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, 71, continued his focus on the economy and jobs as key issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't have to tell anybody in Pennsylvania about how hard things are for families today, keeping their jobs and staying in their homes,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economy dominates voters' concerns four months before the election as gas prices hover around $4 a gallon and job layoffs are on the rise. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain acknowledged the nation is in a recession, though Americans struggling to make ends meet are more concerned with immediate problems than how economists define a recession. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's visit underscores the significance of Pennsylvania's 23 electoral votes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a campaign stop later at Primanti Bros. in the Strip District, he reiterated his criticism of Obama's comment that some people &quot;cling&quot; to guns and religion because of bitterness. The comment threw a harsh light on Obama in the days leading up to the state's Democratic primary, which he lost.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talking to small groups of people, like the ones in the famed sandwich shop, is &quot;the best way to campaign,&quot; McCain said, in part because it provides &quot;local flavor.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then McCain was introduced to a mother and her four teenage children -- who were from Tempe, Ariz. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama started a 30-second television spot yesterday in Pennsylvania and three other states that attacked McCain as &quot;part of the problem&quot; on gas prices. The ad claims McCain &quot;will give more tax breaks to big oil&quot; and favors &quot;a drilling plan that won't produce a drop of oil for seven years.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign fired back that Obama &quot;actually voted for the Bush-Cheney energy bill and its big oil breaks that he is attacking.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff writers Mike Wereschagin and Salena Zito and The Associated Press contributed to this report. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bad-home-loans mess that has slowed the U.S. economy can be traced to a strange 1990s alliance of Democratic social engineers and Republican finance-industry allies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They agreed on one point: All who wanted a home should be able to buy one. Even if they couldn't quite afford it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these people, and their acolytes, have gone on to advise John McCain or Barack Obama. So it matters what they think went wrong when Wall Street financed so many risky mortgage loans to people who couldn't pay.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Throughout the Clinton administration and ever since, immense pressure has existed on commercial banks to make low-interest, high-risk loans with negligible down payment,&quot; former Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas), now a top McCain adviser, told me from his office at UBS Securities in Washington.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gramm says he wanted more loans, too - but while Democrats wanted to force banks to serve low-wage-earners, Gramm felt lenders would make more loans - to the poor, speculators, and other worthy borrowers - if they were freed from onerous federal reporting requirements. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gramm led the fight for the 1999 law that allowed consumer and investment banks to link up. That law was written so Citigroup could finance subprime mortgage loans through its finance-company branch network, and sell the loans to investors through its investment bank. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under President Bush, these loan-backed securities became Wall Street's growth business. The people who made the loans grew more and more remote from the people who owned the loans, until rising defaults last year wrecked the market. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gramm said there was &quot;no evidence&quot; his law caused the bubble or burst it. But there is one thing he'd do differently. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of the bad loans,&quot; he said, &quot;were made by mortgage brokers that were not federally regulated. If we had known then how important they were going to be as lenders, I think we might have been able to reach a bipartisan agreement concerning loan standards that mortgage brokers would have to meet.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Fed chief Alan Greenspan won't go that far. In a Financial Times column, he blamed &quot;the misjudgments of the investment community&quot; and &quot;investors of all stripes&quot; who gobbled mortgage-backed bonds without caring that the loans were risky. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not credible that regulators would have been able to prevent the subprime debacle,&quot; he added. Regulators, in Greenspan's view, can't be smarter than the private sector. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats blame Greenspan and Gramm. While the Clinton White House backed Gramm's bank-deregulation law, the administration sought more supervision, says a key member of the Clinton cabinet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We put forth quite an ambitious agenda of calling for more transparency and more regulation with respect to predatory-lending practices,&quot; Lawrence Summers told me. He was Clinton's treasury secretary before becoming president of Harvard University, and he is now an Obama adviser. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, the idea of any legislative changes was blocked by the Republican Congress, and there was much less appetite than we would have liked at the Fed,&quot; Summers added. Clinton's other treasury secretary, Citigroup executive Robert Rubin, said he wouldn't comment for the record. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Alan Greenspan and Phil Gramm, they had these ideological blinders on. That was the real problem,&quot; said Michael Barr, a former Summers aide, who is now a law professor at the University of Michigan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Clinton administration caved too easily, said Dan Hoffman, </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a Philadelphia housing-program developer, who joined New York and Chicago activists in White House meetings to demand that banks publish data on whom they lent to and how much they charged, as a condition for Gramm's bill. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton aides said that was politically impossible. &quot;The Clinton administration had no intention of fighting for this issue,&quot; Hoffman said. &quot;They had greater interest in giving lenders vast new powers.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's blame to go around, said Jeremy Nowak, chief executive officer of the Reinvestment Fund, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit lender. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free-market Republicans, including President Bush, and poverty-fighting Democrats, including President Clinton, said the nation would be a stronger place when more people owned their homes. Their administrations allowed - at times urged - more permissive underwriting by Fannie Mae and other government-affiliated agencies to boost sales. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a bipartisan myth that more home ownership is better,&quot; Nowak said. &quot;The ideology had been so widely accepted, it led all of us to say: 'How can we lower the barriers of home ownership?' And, 'Don't prices always go up?' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem is that, sometimes, home values don't go up. And then, for poor people, and in some places like California, even for middle-class people, you can't afford to keep up the home. It loses value, and it locks you into the neighborhood.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top minds in both parties failed to read the signs that led to the credit crisis. They still have influence at the highest levels, so let's hope they've learned something. Too bad no one forecloses on bad ideas. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Thomas Fitzgerald and Larry Eichel; Inquirer Staff Writers</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With four months left until Election Day, the electoral map is tilted in Barack Obama's favor, giving him more paths to win the presidency than John McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential contest is being fought largely on what has been Republican turf, with Obama leading or running even in such states as Ohio, Virginia and Colorado. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that continues, it should work to Obama's advantage, although McCain hopes to thwart his rival by removing Michigan and Pennsylvania from the Democratic column. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tilt of the race is evident in looking at the toss-up states. According to the nonpartisan Web site RealClearPolitics.com, there are 11. And just two - Michigan and New Hampshire - went for John Kerry in 2004.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest were Bush states, including such longtime GOP strongholds as Indiana and North Carolina. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager, looks at the map and sees &quot;a huge range of possibilities to get to 270,&quot; the winning number of electoral votes. He has told reporters that he was &quot;simply not going to wake up on [Election Day] worried about one state.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A confident Obama spent last week in states that President Bush took twice: Missouri, Ohio, Colorado, North Dakota and Montana. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Obama wins everywhere the Democrats won four years ago, he'll have 252 electoral votes and could go over the top by taking Ohio or Florida or a combination of smaller states in the West, South and Midwest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for McCain, unless he can make inroads into Democratic turf, he'll spend the autumn playing defense, trying to hold off Obama in the red states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the view of Republican strategists, McCain's distinctive political profile and Obama's relative weakness with working-class whites give the Arizona senator a shot at Michigan and Pennsylvania, both of which have gone Democratic four times in a row. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No doubt the environment is very challenging for Republicans by just about every measure,&quot; said Michael DuHaime, senior adviser for political operations at the Republican National Committee. &quot;Given that, it's encouraging that we have a candidate with the ability to bring in independents, moderate Republicans and swing Democrats.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot can change between now and Nov. 4. Still to come are the vice presidential selections, the conventions, the debates, and changes in the price of oil, the economy, and the war in Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the national race is mid- to high single digits for Obama, as it seems right now, it'll be an Electoral College blowout or close to it,&quot; said Peter Brown, analyst for the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, which surveys swing states. &quot;But if it narrows, the electoral geography gets much more interesting.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the current Electoral College outlook. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Midwest. For both campaigns, no region looms larger. Two states, Ohio and Michigan, figure to be key. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Republican has won the presidency without Ohio. Ever. If Obama can take it this year - and he did not do well in the Ohio primary - it's hard to see how McCain can win the White House. Some polls have the Illinois senator ahead there now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's Michigan, home to the original &quot;Reagan Democrats.&quot; Of all the big states Kerry captured in 2004, it looks to be the most promising for McCain now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was hurt there by the dispute over party rules that led him to skip the Michigan primary. It's a must-win; he has a slim lead in the polls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In pursuit of his hopes of expanding the playing field, Obama has designs on two unlikely Midwestern targets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One is Indiana, which has voted Democratic only once since 1936; the polls are even there. Another is North Dakota, which Obama won big in the caucuses. He's running television commercials in both states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama seems comfortably ahead in Wisconsin and Minnesota; both were battlegrounds in recent elections, going narrowly Democratic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also has strong prospects in Iowa, the state that propelled him to his party's nomination. It is the 2004 Republican state most likely to turn Democratic in 2008. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">West.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both campaigns have targeted Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado, mountain-state battlegrounds in the last two presidential elections. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These three states have just 19 electoral votes among them, but they figure to be crucial in a tight race. Kerry would be president if he had carried them four years ago; he lost all three by a total of 127,011 votes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said analyst Brown: &quot;To me, these states, plus Iowa, provide the most plausible path to victory for Obama.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush drew 40 percent of the Hispanic vote nationally four years ago. That and his success among rural white voters allowed him to carry the three states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's strategists believe that his years of dealing with Western issues, plus his familiarity with Latino concerns and his support for legalizing many undocumented immigrants, should help in the states, all of them adjacent to Arizona. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is favored in California, Oregon and Washington. McCain should win Idaho, Utah and Wyoming. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign, though, believes it has an opening in Montana, where he spent the Fourth. The state has a moderate Democratic governor and elected its second Democratic senator, Jon Tester, two years ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Northeast.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Every state in the region voted Democratic in 2004, and a repeat is not out of the question. At this point, only two states seem in play. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One is New Hampshire. Even though it has only four electoral votes, Obama thought enough of its importance to let it host his big unity appearance with Hillary Rodham Clinton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Hampshire has become more Democratic since voting for Kerry four years ago. But it also happens to be McCain's second political home; this year, he staked his candidacy on winning its Republican primary. He won the 2000 primary as well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other battleground is Pennsylvania, which has seen both McCain and Obama twice in the last few weeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Pennsylvania, McCain can take heart from the closeness of the Kerry-Bush race in 2004 and the thumping Obama received in the primary this spring. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama ran poorly in the culturally conservative western counties - where a Democrat needs to hold his own in the fall - and not as well as he had hoped in the Philadelphia suburbs. McCain will target both areas; he knows that it's hard for a Democrat to get to 270 without Pennsylvania. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statewide polls give Obama the lead despite the damage he inflicted on himself by describing small-town Pennsylvanians as &quot;bitter.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also is promising an effort in New Jersey. Analysts wonder how much time and money he'll invest on a state that has been solidly Democratic in recent years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">South.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question here has to do with demographics. Can Obama, an African American, break the Republicans' lock on a region that is home to half the nation's black residents? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last two elections, Democrats have failed to carry a single Southern state. But Obama is within range of McCain in at least three: Florida, North Carolina and Virginia. Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager, has expressed high hopes for Georgia, too. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama aims to boost black voter registration and turnout throughout the region. By some estimates, Georgia alone has 600,000 eligible but unregistered black voters. And he has some appeal to younger, better-educated Southern whites. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it will take more than that for him to win in the South. Thomas Schaller, a scholar of Southern politics, argues that the region's white vote will act as a &quot;formidable counterbalance&quot; to an energized black vote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The more blacks there are in a Southern state, the more likely the white voters are to vote Republican,&quot; Schaller, a professor at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, wrote in a New York Times op-ed piece last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, he wrote, helps explain why Mississippi, with the nation's largest black population in percentage terms, is one of the most solidly Republican states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia, with its growing and affluent Washington suburbs, is where McCain might be most vulnerable. The state has elected two straight Democratic governors and is expected to send a second Democrat to the Senate this year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looking at the rest of the South, it would take a pretty seismic shift for any of those states to flip,&quot; said DuHaime, the Republican strategist. &quot;They were double-digit wins for President Bush [in 2004] and are all trending Republican at the state level.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">FINDLAY, Ohio </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his corner of College Street, Jim Peterman stares at the four American flags planted in his front lawn and rubs his forehead. Mr. Peterman, 74, is a retired worker at Cooper Tire, a father of two, an Air Force veteran and a self-described patriot. He took one trip to Washington in 1989 -- best vacation of his life -- and bought a statue of the Washington Monument that he still displays in a glass case in his living room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes a smart vote is an American's greatest responsibility. Which is why his confusion about Barack Obama continues to eat at him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the television in his living room, Mr. Peterman has watched enough news and campaign advertisements to hear the truth: Sen. Barack Obama, born in Hawaii, is a Christian family man with a track record of public service. But on the Internet, in his grocery store, at his neighbor's house, at his son's auto shop, Mr. Peterman has also absorbed another version of the Democratic candidate's background, one that is entirely false: Barack Obama, born in Africa, is a possibly gay Muslim racist who refuses to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like you're hearing about two different men with nothing in common,&quot; Mr. Peterman said. &quot;It makes it impossible to figure out what's true, or what you can believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here in Findlay, a Rust Belt town of 40,000, false rumors about Mr. Obama have built enough word-of-mouth credibility to harden into an alternative biography. Born on the Internet, the rumors now meander freely across the flatlands of northwest Ohio -- through bars and baseball fields, retirement homes and restaurants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with polling that shows about one in 10 Americans thinks Mr. Obama is Muslim, the candidate's campaign has launched an aggressive effort to discredit rumors and clarify Mr. Obama's past. It created a &quot;Fight the Smears&quot; Web site and a new television ad that reiterates Mr. Obama's Christian faith, patriotism and family background. Dozens of volunteers have been sent to Ohio five months in advance of the election so they can spend extra time educating voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Mr. Peterman's block in Findlay, the campaign's efforts may already be too late. A swing voter who entered this election leaning Democratic, Mr. Peterman faces a decision that is no longer so simple as a choice between Mr. Obama and Republican Sen. John McCain, he said. First, he must pick the version of Mr. Obama on which he will stake his vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does he choose to trust a TV commercial in which Mr. Obama talks about his &quot;love of country&quot;? Or his neighbor of 40 years, Don LeMaster, a Navy veteran who heard from a friend in Toledo that Mr. Obama refuses to wear an American-flag pin?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does he trust a local newspaper article that details Mr. Obama's Christian faith? Or his friend Leroy Pollard, a devoted family man so convinced Mr. Obama is a radical Muslim that he threatened to stop talking to his daughter when he heard she might vote for him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll admit that I probably don't follow all of the election news like maybe I should,&quot; Mr. Peterman said. &quot;I haven't read his books or studied up more than a little bit. But it's hard to ignore what you hear when everybody you know is saying it. These are good people, smart people, so can they really all be wrong?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flag City, USA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Peterman bought his single-story house here in 1959, a few months after he left the Air Force and married. His wife, Mildred, had grown up in Findlay, and they never considered moving anywhere else. On College Street, the couple found all the hallmarks of America's heartland: a house for $9,000; a neighborhood where their two boys, one handicapped, could play outside after dark; a steady &quot;pencil-pushing&quot; job up the road for Jim at Cooper Tire headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighborhood built up around them. Leroy and Wanda Pollard came in 1962, drawn from southern Ohio by a booming auto industry that offered Leroy plenty of work as a mechanic. Mary Dunson bought the place next door in 1963. Don LeMaster, a police officer, moved in up the street with his wife, Margaret, in 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every newcomer to the block was white, working-class and Midwestern, and the neighborhood jelled easily. They babysat for one another. They complained to one another about their teenagers. They helped raise one another's grandkids. In all, seven different families have lived on the same block of College Street for at least 35 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all just found a great place at a great time,&quot; Leroy Pollard said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Peterman hung the American flag on his porch first, in 1960, and the rest of College Street followed his example. By 1980, patriotic displays had grown into an unspoken contest of one-upmanship. Sixty flags planted in one yard on Memorial Day; a living-room window painted red, white and blue; a Buckeye tree decorated with Christmas ornaments celebrating Americana; a gigantic plastic unicorn perched on a front porch and draped in an American flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entire block -- and, soon, the entire town -- shared in unabashed pride and gratefulness for the country that had given them this place. In 1968, a local congressman persuaded the House of Representatives to officially declare Findlay as Flag City, USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resistance to change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with their pride came a nasty undercurrent, one that Mr. Obama's candidacy has exacerbated: On College Street, nobody wanted anything to change. As the years passed, Mr. Peterman and his neighbors approached one another to share in their skepticism about the unknown. What was the story behind the handful of African Americans who had moved into a town that is 93 percent white? Why were Japanese businessmen coming in to run the local manufacturing plants? Who in the world was this Mr. Obama character, running for president with that funny-sounding last name?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People in Findlay are kind of funny about change,&quot; said Republican Mayor Pete Sehnert, a retired police officer who ran for the office on a whim last year. &quot;They always want things the way they were, and any kind of development is always viewed as making things worse, a bad thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When people on College Street started hearing rumors about Mr. Obama -- who looked different from other politicians and often talked about change -- they easily believed the nasty stories about an outsider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Obama would be a disaster, and there's a lot of reasons,&quot; said Mr. Pollard, explaining the rumors he had heard about the candidate from friends he goes camping with. &quot;I understand he's from Africa, and that the first thing he's going to do if he gets into office is bring his family over here, illegally. He's got that racist [pastor] who practically raised him, and then there's the Muslim thing. He's just not presidential material, if you ask me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Don LeMaster: &quot;He's a good speaker, but you've got to dig deeper than that for the truth. Politicians tell you anything. You have look beyond the surface, and then there are some real lies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Jeanette Collins, a 77-year-old who lives across the street: &quot;All I know for sure about Obama is that we're not ready for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only one man on College Street remains open-minded, and recently even Mr. Peterman has started to sway. Like most of his neighbors, he dislikes Mr. McCain for his stance on the Iraq war and would like to cast his vote for a president who will bring the troops home. But on a recent visit to his son's auto shop, Mr. Peterman overheard misinformed customers talking again about a Muslim in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know. The whole thing just scares me,&quot; Mr. Peterman said. &quot;I'm almost starting to feel like the best choice is not voting at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, those who have pushed the truth in Findlay have been rewarded with little that resembles progress. Gerri Kish, 66, read both of Mr. Obama's autobiographies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has close friends, she said, who still refuse to believe her when she swears Mr. Obama is Christian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new advertisement running in Findlay, in which Mr. Obama is pictured with his white mother and white grandparents as he talks about developing a &quot;deep and abiding faith in the country I love&quot; while growing up in the Kansas heartland, is dismissed by residents of College Street as the desperate lies of another dishonest Washington politician.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arizona Sen. John McCain will be in Pittsburgh next week for one stop on a cross-country tour designed to portray the presumptive Republican presidential nominee as a champion of job growth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain is expected to arrive in Pittsburgh late Tuesday and appear at a Consol Energy facility Wednesday morning. The senator, who yesterday was just completing a trip to Colombia and Mexico, had been in Harrisburg and Bucks County last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Pennsylvania, his jobs tour will reportedly take him to the battleground states of Colorado, Ohio, Michigan, Virginia and Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the McCain visit details were still being finalized, he is expected to stop Wednesday at Consol's soon-to-be-completed headquarters at Southpointe II in Cecil Township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his trip to South and Central America, the senator was to spend the Fourth of July with his family at their Arizona home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain spent the final day of his Latin American trip in Mexico City, where he praised Mexican drug-fighting efforts and hailed a $400 million U.S. aid package for the country's security forces as a key step forward in bilateral relations and in the fight against drug cartels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain spoke after touring the high-tech command center of a gleaming new federal police facility along with his wife, Cindy, and close political allies Sens. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier yesterday, he met with Mexican President Felipe Calderon and said the two had discussed immigration and trade. He also toured a Roman Catholic shrine in the Mexican capital with Republican former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the president's brother, who was in Mexico on a private business trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mr. McCain and his Democratic opponent, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, have already aired television commercials in Pennsylvania markets. Paving the way for Mr. McCain's latest visit to the state, a quasi-independent arm of the Republican National Committee was poised to weigh in on his behalf with a new round of advertisements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under federal law, the group airing the ads is not permitted to coordinate its activities with either the RNC or the McCain campaign. Brad Todd, of OnMessage Inc., is directing the ad campaign, first reported on the Politico.com Web site. In an interview, Mr. Todd said the ads will focus on energy issues, with an initial budget of about $3 million for television time in Pennsylvania and three other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush fell just short of capturing Pennsylvania's electoral votes in his two campaigns for the White House. Recent surveys have shown an advantage for Mr. Obama, but both campaigns have said they anticipate a competitive race in the state again this year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IF YOU HAD a few minutes with Republican presidential candidate John McCain, what would you ask him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I confronted this dilemma when his campaign offered me half an hour with him yesterday on his campaign bus, &quot;The Straight Talk Express,&quot; along with four other print reporters - &quot;just the four of you and him having a conversation,&quot; campaign spokesman Paul Lindsay said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the candidate's off-the-cuff charm is seen as perhaps his greatest asset, serving a dollop to local reporters is worth a bit of his time. And I mean just a bit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simple arithmetic told me that my share of the conversation would be about six minutes, so I decided to bore in on one issue. It had to do with the subprime mortgage disaster, and whether a key member of the McCain team had in fact paved the way for this mess. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So as we settled into our seats around a table with McCain, I asked about the fact that his campaign co-chair and economic adviser, former Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, was co-sponsor of the 1999 law that allowed commercial banks to get into investment banking. And the fact that Gramm was a prime architect of a 2000 bill that kept regulators' hands off of &quot;credit default swaps,&quot; an exotic financial tool which helped enable the bundling and selling of crappy subprime mortgages to investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Greenberger, who headed the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's division of trading and markets in the late '90s, said that the unregulated swaps &quot;have been at the heart of the subprime meltdown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal writers raised this issue a month ago, along with the fact that Gramm had lobbied the federal government for the Swiss bank UBS - a key player in the uproar over these mortgage schemes - as recently as early this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I opened the subject with McCain by noting that on the issue of campaign finance, he'd seen a need for stronger government rules to regulate private conduct. I asked if the kind of aggressive deregulation that Gramm has championed had laid the foundation for a financial nightmare that's affected the entire economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain listened while munching on a chocolate doughnut and sipping a tall cappuccino, and then came back hard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted accurately that the bills that Gramm had favored were supported by a lot of people, including Democrats and financial guru Alan Greenspan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited Gramm's crusades against excessive government spending, and said that he was &quot;one of the smartest people in the world on economics.&quot; And he said that Gramm and others thought that they were doing the right thing in the 2000 legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's just the point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody thought that they were setting up a cataclysmic collapse in the nation's financial sector, but when you're restricting public oversight of private markets, you'd better give some serious thought to the downside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since McCain has admitted that the economy isn't his strong suit, I'd like to know that he's thinking these issues through, and not adopting a laissez-faire, supply-side approach uncritically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I noted that the housing crisis plan on McCain's Web site proposes help for struggling homeowners and a task force to investigate criminal wrongdoing in the mortgage industry, but had nothing to say about regulatory reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said that he supports &quot;a lot more transparency and oversight&quot; in financial markets. When I pressed for specifics, he referred me to plans advanced by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't an entirely satisfying exchange, but I could see why McCain likes the unscripted give-and-take. Even when he was thin on specifics, he spoke with clarity and conviction, and graciously acknowledged the viewpoints of others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain called opponent Barack Obama a patriot and &quot;a great American success story,&quot; and said that he accepted Obama's rejection of controversial comments about McCain's military record by retired Gen. Wesley Clark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he also took measured but effective shots at Obama when the conversation lent an opening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At an afternoon town meeting at a Bucks County sheet-metal fabricating plant, McCain took a wide range of questions and spoke effectively about pork-barrel spending, energy independence and winning in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that he's the underdog in Pennsylvania, but that he plans to ride his bus all over the state - and win it in November. * </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a bruised forehead, Stephen Colbert has found a new cause celebre: fighting the glamorization of &quot;face violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he did after breaking his wrist last year, Colbert has transformed a real-life injury into a mock crusade. Colbert was injured June 21, and while he's been cagey about the cause, he has made no attempt to hide the scarring between his eyebrows this week on &quot;The Colbert Report.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In extreme close-up Monday, he detailed the wreckage: &quot;What the hell is going on right here? ... I've got stitches up there and it looks like I'm growing a little map of Norway down the side of my face.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colbert has declined to say how the injury happened. (His publicist and Comedy Central also declined to comment.) Instead, he has said what's important is his new responsibility to fight &quot;face violence&quot; in Hollywood films. This week, Colbert has joked that after the wrist injury, he pledged he would never break a fall with his hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's guest, Will Smith, had a theory: &quot;I think I know what happened to your face, 'cause I can tell. Somebody kicked your ass, didn't they?&quot;(Associated Press)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MTV woos political ads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MTV has been active in trying to get its young viewers interested in politics. Now the network is looking to profit from it. MTV is selling time for political spots this election season, meaning pictures of Barack Obama and John McCain may turn up among the women of &quot;The Hills&quot; and souped-up vans on &quot;Pimp My Ride.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The network hasn't taken political advertising since its &quot;Choose or Lose&quot; political activism campaign in 1992, said spokeswoman Jeannie Kedas last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given where we are and how the young voters have become increasingly engaged, we decided political advertising would be a good fit for our audience,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MTV's corporate parent Viacom recently reported that its second quarter domestic advertising revenue growth would be 3 to 4 percent, after earlier forecasting a growth of 7 percent. Its shares have fallen 20 percent since then, said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at Pali Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strong ad sales for the fall and strong ratings, along with the political ad money, should help revenue growth, Greenfield said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From a financial perspective, now is the best time ever because young people are going to have more of an impact on this election than ever before,&quot; said Kyle Roberts, president of Smart Media, a Washington-based firm that buys advertising time for GOP candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision is most likely to benefit Democrat Obama, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's representatives wouldn't comment on their advertising strategy on Thursday. Last weekend, The New York Times identified MTV as a potential target for Obama advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The median age of an MTV viewer is 22. Typically, two-thirds of the MTV audience is eligible to vote, Kedas said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MTV will decide whether to run spots by political groups not aligned with a specific campaign on a case-by-case basis, Kedas said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several polls have suggested that Obama has an advantage over McCain among young voters. But they haven't been conclusive, and some pollsters suggest it's hard to get a true read on youthful preferences because many can't be reached by land telephone lines, and young voters tend to be fickle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For MTV, the decision was likely much easier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look around -- who is not accepting political dollars these days?&quot; Roberts said. &quot;It's a growing category. It's a no-brainer for them.&quot; (AP) </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unity was spared the banality of unanimity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carmella Lewis, with her Hillary T-shirt and Hillary placard, came all the way from Denver to make sure there would be plenty of ambiguity, duality and ferocity in Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as Hillary was testing out the unfamiliar familiarity &quot;Barack and me&quot; Friday and talking about &quot;his grace and his grit,&quot; Carmella began loudly booing and waving her sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want Hillary!&quot; screamed the 57-year-old retired ad saleswoman and Clinton delegate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's over, lady!&quot; yelled some Obama supporters a few yards away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing between the Sharks and the Jets, David Axelrod took pity on a friend of Carmella's who was suffering from aridity in the Unity humidity. The chief Obama strategist fetched a glass of water and brought it to the woman, who was wearing five Hillary buttons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This amenity did not stop the disunity. Carmella and her friends continued to cry, &quot;Nobama!&quot; &quot;We love you, Hillary!&quot; and &quot;We need Hillary!&quot; as Barack Obama sat onstage on a stool behind his former rival, his finger studiously at his lips.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carmella was not impressed with all the kissing, laughing and whispering that Hill and Bam were doing for the cameras, so that the moment could produce, as Obama press aide Robert Gibbs put it on &quot;Larry King Live,&quot; &quot;a great picture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it was Obama's turn to speak, Carmella announced loudly, &quot;I wish I had earplugs.&quot; Then, as Obama tried to ingratiate himself with the Hillary partisans by saying that because of the New York senator, his daughters &quot;can take for granted that women can do anything that the boys can do and do it better and do it in heels,&quot; Carmella put her fingers in her ears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Obama tried to curry favor with Hillary, looking over at her sensible, sturdy shoes and marveling, &quot;I still don't know how she does it in heels,&quot; Carmella tore up a tissue and stuffed it in her ears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Obama pandered with a line about how he wouldn't &quot;perpetuate a system in which women are paid less for the same work as men,&quot; she put her hands over her tissue-stuffed ears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe she'd like what she heard if she listened,&quot; sighed Axelrod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterward, Carmella got her idol to autograph her sign, telling the smiling Hillary, &quot;You're going to be the next president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told The New York Times that she and her friends were all voting for John McCain and that Hillary was just doing what she had to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I have a gut feeling,&quot; she said with macabre faith, &quot;that something's going to happen so that she becomes the nominee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people were mingling well on unity day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary's chic aide Huma Abedin got along great with Obama's charming aide Reggie Love; the two, with their dates, shared a dinner the night before at a Georgetown hot spot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bamary press corps meshed effortlessly. Reporters and photographers crept toward the front of the plane where the victor and the vanquished sat side by side, trying to analyze every smidgen of body language for amity and jollity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new political allies engaged in what one Obama aide sanguinely described as &quot;comfortable, jovial small talk.&quot; Obama told Hillary about using his Mac to keep in touch with his daughters, and she regaled him with tales of completely unidentifiable dishes you get served on overseas trips. They commiserated about the loss of privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They did not, however, commiserate about Bill Clinton, who is in a self-pitying meltdown about not being Elvis anymore, trying to shake down Obama for more -- more apologies for perceived snubs and more help paying off the $22 million Clinton debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to fathom why Obama should be mau-maued into paying off the debt that Hillary and Bill accrued attacking and undermining him, while mismanaging the campaign and their nearly quarter-billion-dollar war chest so horribly that one Hillaryland insider told The New Republic that it bordered on fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the former president can't stand being a loser, so he's taking it out on the winner. When it comes to Bill, there's a lot of vanity but little humility in Unity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be clear: Barack will support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Obama spokesman Bill Burton, Oct. 24, 2007</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was then: Democratic primaries to be won, netroot lefties to be seduced. With all that (and Hillary Clinton) out of the way, Barack Obama now says he'll vote in favor of the new FISA bill that gives the telecom companies blanket immunity for post-9/11 eavesdropping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back then, in the yesteryear of primary season, he thoroughly trashed the North American Free Trade Agreement, pledging to force a renegotiation, take &quot;the hammer&quot; to Canada and Mexico and threaten unilateral abrogation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the hammer is holstered. Mr. Obama calls his previous NAFTA rhetoric &quot;overheated&quot; and essentially endorses what one of his senior economic advisers privately told the Canadians: The anti-trade stuff was nothing more than populist posturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor is there much left of his primary season pledge to meet &quot;without preconditions&quot; with Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. There will be &quot;preparations,&quot; you see, which are being spun by his aides into the functional equivalent of preconditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's long march to the center has begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And why not? What's the downside? He won't lose the left, or even mainstream Democrats. They won't stay home on Nov. 4. The anti-Bush, anti-Republican sentiment is simply too strong. Election Day is their day of revenge -- for the Florida recount, for Swift-boating, for all the injuries, real and imagined, dealt out by Republicans over the last eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Normally, flip-flopping presidential candidates have to worry about the press. Not Mr. Obama. After all, this is a press corps that heard his grandiloquent Philadelphia speech -- designed to rationalize why &quot;I can no more disown [Jeremiah Wright] than I can disown my white grandmother&quot; -- then wiped away a tear and hailed him as the second coming of Abraham Lincoln.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three months later, with Mr. Wright disowned, grandma embraced and the great &quot;race speech&quot; now inoperative, not a word of reconsideration is heard from his media acolytes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worry about the press? His FISA flip-flop elicited a few grumbles from lefty bloggers, but hardly a murmur from the mainstream press. Remember his pledge to stick to public financing? Now flush with cash, he is the first general-election candidate since Watergate to opt out. Some goo-goo clean-government types chided him, but the mainstream editorialists who for years had been railing against private financing as hopelessly corrupt and corrupting, evinced only the mildest of disappointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, The New York Times expressed a sympathetic understanding of Mr. Obama's about-face by buying his preposterous claim that it was a pre-emptive attack on Mr. McCain's 527 independent expenditure groups -- notwithstanding the fact that (a) as Politico's Jonathan Martin notes, &quot;there are no serious anti-Obama 527s in existence nor are there any immediate plans to create such a group&quot; and (b) the only independent ad of any consequence now running in the entire country is an AFSCME-MoveOn.org co-production savaging McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, Mr. Obama's U-turn on public financing was not done for ideological reasons, it was done for Willie Sutton reasons: That's where the money is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It nonetheless betrayed a principle that so many in the press claimed to hold dear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As public financing is not a principle dear to me, I am hardly dismayed by Mr. Obama's abandonment of it. Nor am I disappointed in the least by his other calculated and cynical repositionings. I have never had any illusions about Mr. Obama. I merely note with amazement that his media swooners seem to accept his every policy reversal with an equanimity unseen since the Daily Worker would change the party line overnight -- switching sides in World War II, for example -- whenever the wind from Moscow changed direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth about Mr. Obama is uncomplicated. He is just a politician (though of unusual skill and ambition). The man who dared say it plainly is the man who knows Mr. Obama all too well. &quot;He does what politicians do,&quot; explained Jeremiah Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it's time to throw campaign finance reform, telecom accountability, NAFTA renegotiation or Jeremiah Wright overboard, Mr. Obama is not sentimental. He does not hesitate. He tosses lustily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why, the man even tossed his own grandmother overboard back in Philadelphia -- only to haul her back on deck now that her services are needed. Yesterday, granny was the moral equivalent of the raving Rev. Wright. Today, she is a featured prop in Mr. Obama's fuzzy-wuzzy get-to-know-me national TV ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not a flinch. Not a flicker. Not a hint of shame. By the time he's finished, Mr. Obama will have made the Clintons look scrupulous.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization will distribute the donation, made through the couple's Jolie-Pitt Foundation, to four organizations working on behalf of children who have lost parents, homes and schools in Iraq.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These educational support programs for children of conflict are the best way to help them heal,&quot; said Jolie in a written statement from Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which she co-chairs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The matter has been amicably resolved to the satisfaction of both parties,&quot; said a statement released by both sides. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC was working with the activist group Perverted Justice on the sting, in which people impersonating children established online chats with men and tried to lure them to a house, where they were met by TV cameras and police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, a federal judge issued a scathing ruling in the case, saying a jury might conclude the network &quot;crossed the line from responsible journalism to irresponsible and reckless intrusion into law enforcement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New episodes of &quot;To Catch A Predator&quot; ended in December. The future of the series is uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now we are working on other investigative stories focusing on national security and the economy,&quot; NBC spokeswoman </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Jenny Tartikoff</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Wednesday. &quot;If we do more, we want to make sure we are complementing past investigations not just repeating them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TMZ.com reported that documents filed in Charleston County, S.C., show that a judge approved a divorce agreement on June 13, barely a month after Jennifer filed papers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the agreement, the couple's four children will live with their mother. Bill will have visitation rights and pay child support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jennifer also will get the couple's home on Sullivans Island, S.C., and their second house in Hemet, Calif.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pope &quot;does not wear Prada, but Christ,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">L'Osservatore</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documents say post-production editing of &quot;Gallowwalker&quot; is set to begin July 14th, and filming of &quot;Chasing the Dragon&quot; will start in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snipes was sentenced in April to three years in prison on three misdemeanor counts of willful failure to file income tax returns.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In politics, framing is everything. For years the Republicans framed the issues so that they were always the good guys, and the Democrats were the bad guys. Now it is going to be the other way around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is in the process of framing his campaign, and he's doing it in the context of his values and the organizational skills of Chicago politics. We see reflected in Obama's campaign the efficiency of a well-oiled political machine that serves its constituents. We also see the grass-roots democracy that makes Chicago an idea that works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1990, my brother, for 35 years a Chicago Tribune writer, wrote a book, &quot;The Chicagoization of America.&quot; In that book he claimed that, at the turn of the 20th century, Chicago was America's &quot;biggest idea,&quot; that Chicago's &quot;freshness and its sense of democracy became the country's&quot; and its vigorous ideas &quot;smothered for a time the East Coast's penchant for a more imitative and elitist culture.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Obama, Chicago is once more, at the turn of another century, stepping front and center, ready to put its imprint on American culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past eight years, the Karl Rove team framed all the issues and boasted that it created the reality that others had to react to. In a sense, it did. It was very good at framing the issues to serve its purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 9/11, the Republicans framed everything in terms of national security and the corporate-conservative agenda. But even before that, the war on poverty was framed in terms of welfare queens in Cadillacs. Affirmative action was framed as minority privilege. The privatization attack on Social Security was framed as the ownership society. The attempt to starve the public schools for funds was framed as school choice or chartered schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberals were and still are being framed as soft -- soft on crime, soft on welfare, soft on family values and, most loathsome of all, soft on national defense. So, along comes Obama, whom the Clinton campaign accused of being the soft one; an inexperienced and na&iuml;ve beginner. The John McCain supporters make the same mistake, accusing him of being the most liberal member of the United States Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accusation by Clinton did not stick, and it is not sticking for McCain. Chicago is anything but soft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama very carefully chose Chicago and its value system rather than the &quot;imitative and elitist&quot; culture of the East Coast. The Chicago persona with which Obama has clothed himself plants him solidly in the heartland. As in the TV ad that is now showing around the country, he carefully grounds his values in Kansas and the Midwest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign is being framed so that you have to be against Midwest values to be against Obama, even as his own life is rooted in Hawaii and Harvard/Columbia. The redeeming feature is that he chose that Chicago culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mainstream media have now tried to shift gears and instead of being too soft they accuse him of being too hard-nosed. The Washington Post is trying to frame Obama as &quot;ambitious&quot; and &quot;ruthless,&quot; and David Brooks of the New York Times framed him as &quot;Machiavellian&quot; and a &quot;ruthless opportunist,&quot; accusing him of throwing all of his principles under the truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama team has, in turn, shown its own real talent at framing. Obama moves quickly when the political twists and turns that afflict any presidential campaign demand it. He hews closely to the instructions he has given his team concerning style: no shock Barack; Obama, no drama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Change we can believe in is moving the campaign and the Democratic National Committee staff to Chicago and outside the Washington Beltway and its stagnant politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is actually a joy to watch framing when it is being done so well. Obama has taken the title of &quot;framer-in-chief&quot; from Rove. The Obama team does not, however, suffer from Rove's hubris. It takes the political reality thrust upon it and frames it to enhance the candidate. The McCain team can, like the Hillary team, only watch the poll numbers shift against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we are seeing is that first-class political machine that is Chicago. It is constituent-centered Cook County politics and North Shore liberalism combined with Chicago's freshness and its sense of democracy. This is the package that originally elected Obama to the U.S. Senate. It is the American spirit at its best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe it is just my Midwest origins, but it is going to be deeply satisfying to see my brother's proposition come true so that Midwest values will be running the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a footnote, the book &quot;The Chicagoization of America&quot; by Kenan Heise is available at Amazon.com. I recommended it for those who want to know better the Windy City. The idea of Chicago is going to be a big deal in our politics.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late winter of 2007, Sen. Barack Obama proposed a novel approach to the 2008 presidential election. The offer? Each party's candidate would rely solely on public financing in the presidential election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain agreed to abide by the proposal, which was approved by the Federal Election Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's pledge received a good deal of media coverage - McCain and Obama in deal on public financing,'' read The New York Times headline on March 2, 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alas, while McCain is standing by that promise, Obama is not. Last Thursday, Obama announced he was rejecting public financing and would instead solicit money from donors to finance his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is worth noting the promises were made in the beginning of the campaign when McCain's campaign was beginning to sputter and when Obama trailed Sen. Hillary Clinton by a margin of nearly 2-to-1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also is worth noting that Obama has raised a huge warchest - nearly half of which has come from small donors whose contributions are $200 or less. And his prowess at raising funds is seen as a way to offset whatever attacks may be aimed at him by groups such as the Swiftboat Veterans for Truth that torpedoed Sen. John Kerry's presidential run in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public financing system limits the amount of money campaigns can spend in return for the public money. It was established as a way to reduce the influence of private donations in the political process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's important. Since Watergate, every party nominee has used some portion of public funds. Until now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's decision is disappointing. He has run for office as the agent of change. He has vowed to operate differently from past politicians, and to change Washington. Yet, last week, he reneged on his own public-funding proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has flip-flopped on a host of issues as well, from drilling off U.S. coasts to making permanent federal tax cuts. But as for accepting public funds for the campaign ahead, he has agreed to stay within the system and has won plaudits for doing so. And when it comes to combatting negative ads, he, too, faces challenges such as the ads now being run by MoveOn.org, as noted in Nicholas Kristof's column on this page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Obama's reasons for eschewing public funding are understandable given his fund-raising prowess and the fight ahead, flip-flopping on a measure he proposed is bound to be used against him in the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's worse, Obama's catch-phrase Change we can believe in,'' doesn't carry the same magic it did before he opted out of the public funding system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain pledged yesterday that he would make the federal government more environmentally friendly, while Sen. Barack Obama mocked the senator from Arizona as crafting energy policies that merely pander to voters in the latest skirmish over who is best prepared to tackle the nation's energy and environmental problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech in Santa Barbara, Calif., Mr. McCain vowed to &quot;put the purchasing power of the United States government on the side of green technology&quot; by buying fuel-efficient vehicles for its civilian fleet of cars and trucks and by retrofitting federal office space. The pledge comes months after Obama outlined a more detailed and ambitious proposal on the subject, virtually ensuring that the next administration will take significant steps to lower the government's output of energy and pollution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every year, the federal government buys upwards of 60,000 cars and other vehicles, not including military or law-enforcement vehicles,&quot; Mr. McCain said as he campaigned with California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a prominent GOP environmentalist. &quot;From now on, we're going to make those civilian vehicles flex-fuel capable, plug-in hybrid, or cars fueled by clean natural gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying that the U.S. government ranks as &quot;the single largest consumer of electricity in the world&quot; because it holds sway over &quot;3.3 billion square feet of federal office space&quot; worldwide, Mr. McCain said he planned to reduce the government's carbon footprint by updating its buildings and demanding better standards in new ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By retrofitting where possible, and by applying a higher efficiency standard to new buildings leased or purchased, we can save taxpayers billions of dollars in energy costs and move the market in the direction of green technology,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain did not provide details about his plan, causing some public watchdog and environmental groups to question how much energy would be saved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, who first set his targets last October, has promised that he would make all new federal buildings 40 percent more efficient than current ones within five years, and carbon-neutral by 2025. He has also pledged to increase efficiency of existing federal buildings by 25 percent within five years and to ensure that the government derives 30 percent of its electricity from renewable energy by 2020 -- none of which Mr. McCain has promised to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush has already instituted energy-efficiency measures for the White House and the government. The changes are not as dramatic as the proposals Obama has outlined, though they are more specific than McCain's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 2007, the president issued an executive order calling on the government to &quot;increase purchase of alternative fuel, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles when commercially available&quot; and to &quot;reduce petroleum consumption in fleet vehicles by 2 percent annually through 2015,&quot; among other measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and Laura Bush have also made changes in the White House, replacing all incandescent bulbs in hallways with compact fluorescent lights, installing low-consumption toilets in many places and putting in energy-efficient cooling units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a town-hall meeting yesterday in a nature preserve near the Las Vegas Strip, Mr. Obama criticized his rival's energy plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referencing a McCain quote from Monday in which the senator from Arizona acknowledged that new offshore U.S. drilling would not impact oil prices for years, Mr. Obama said that the presumptive GOP nominee is focused on extolling the &quot;psychological&quot; benefits of drilling and that he has offered a $300 million prize for a new electric car battery that ranks merely as a &quot;bounty&quot; for &quot;some rocket scientist to win.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a not-surprising move, the Democrats' presumptive nominee for president, Sen. Barack Obama, last week opted out of the federal financing system for the 2008 general election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also not surprisingly, his Republican counterpart, Sen. John McCain, lit into the Illinois senator for the decision, citing previous statements by Mr. Obama that he would accept public funding and the associated spending limits as long as his fall opponent did, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true that Mr. Obama's change of position was something of a flip-flop. Mr. McCain said he will stay within the federal funding system. Leaving the public finance route for the sky's-the-limit approach is also fundamentally at odds with the ethical high road that Mr. Obama's campaign has espoused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also true, however, that Mr. McCain has flip-flopped himself on a series of issues, as he tries to find compatibility between his previous positions and the exigencies this year of campaigning and raising money from his party's conservative base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media, especially television, make big money from heavy campaign spending. So do the communications companies, which provide the equipment that the candidates and their staffs use to solicit money from the public. Campaigns are a honey pot for consultants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most deplorable part is the access to the candidates, and ultimately those who are elected to office, that is obtained by those who pony up money. Let us not imagine for a minute that there isn't a pecking order between those who send in $25 by the Internet and those who work to bundle hundreds of thousands of dollars from their friends and associates for a candidate. President Bush's heavy-hitters were called Pioneers or Rangers; from the voters' point of view, perhaps such donors should be known as &quot;rustlers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's attempt to justify his smooth and strategic move (from the point of view of winning in November) by citing the need to fight &quot;527s&quot; -- political advocacy groups, like the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth in 2004, that spend a lot on campaigns but face little regulation -- was disingenuous. The Democrats do as well with 527s as the Republicans. See, for example, the current anti-McCain commercial, &quot;You Can't Have Baby Alex,&quot; financed by MoveOn.org.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was a money move by Mr. Obama. It may have made good sense for his run for the White House, but it also sadly pointed up the continued failure to limit money and its influence in America's political campaigns.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soaring fuel prices and concerns about global warming have merged to make U.S. energy policy one of the hottest issues of the presidential campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain suggests investing $2 billion annually in &quot;clean coal&quot; technology, building 45 nuclear power plants by 2030 and lifting bans on offshore oil drilling. Democrat Barack Obama proposes investing $150 billion during 10 years in &quot;clean energy,&quot; including low-carbon coal technologies and wind, solar and geothermal energy resources. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain on Monday offered a $300 million prize for the person who develops a battery that &quot;has the size, capacity and power to leapfrog&quot; existing technology for plug-in hybrid and electric cars. Obama on Sunday announced a plan to &quot;crack down on excessive energy speculation ... to ease the impact of skyrocketing gas prices.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retired steelworker Don Jacoby, 70, of Franklin in Venengo County grumbles that much of it sounds like political blather. He has his own energy plan in place.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We stay home more. We don't make any extra trips unless we have to,&quot; said Jacoby, who supports McCain. &quot;My wife would like to go on vacation this summer, but I don't know we're going to do it, being what gas prices are.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy policy could dominate the campaign, said Morton Coleman, director emeritus of the University of Pittsburgh's Institute of Politics. &quot;Two things around energy that are going to have an important impact on this region, obviously, are nuclear power and clean coal,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Westinghouse Electric Co. in April landed the first contract for a nuclear power plant in the United States in 30 years. The Monroeville company, which employs 4,000 workers in the region and about 10,000 worldwide, will supply Georgia Power with two nuclear power plants for a site near Waynesboro, Ga.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2007, Westinghouse signed a $5.3 billion contract to build four nuclear reactors in China. To accommodate its growth, Westinghouse plans to move to a larger facility in Cranberry. Curtiss-Wright EMD is building a manufacturing center in Harmar to supply coolant pumps for Westinghouse nuclear reactors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Obama are on safe footing calling for technology aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from burning coal. Scientists say restricting carbon emissions into the atmosphere is needed to help reduce global warming. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abundant coal </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coal is such an abundant and reliable energy resource, however, there's no question the nation will rely on it for decades -- possibly two more centuries, if reserves last -- to produce much of America's electricity, says Jan Lauer, director of 3 Rivers Energy, a regional coalition of businesses and organizations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coal-fired power plants generated about 49 percent of the country's electricity in 2007, according to the Energy Information Administration. Coal fueled 2 billion megawatt-hours of the 4.2 billion megawatt-hours generated last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania coal producers mine more than 73 million tons of bituminous coal a year, most of it in Western Pennsylvania, and employ more than 6,400, according to the Pennsylvania Coal Association.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is 25 percent anticipated growth by 2030 in the United States in terms of electricity demand. It will take all energy sources to meet the projected demand,&quot; Lauer said. &quot;Nuclear is an alternative ... but the cost and time frame associated with nuclear will be such that that's a partial solution.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plants with 104 nuclear reactors provide about 20 percent of electricity in the United States. Thirty-one states have commercial nuclear power plants, but nearly one-third of the nation's total capacity is located in just four states, including Pennsylvania, which ranks second among states with nuclear power capacity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's proposal for 45 nuclear plants by 2030 is possible, considering 30 American plants are in various stages of planning by a number of companies, analysts say.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly, the new construction is going to be a reality, because of concern over global warming,&quot; said Westinghouse spokesman Vaughn Gilbert. &quot;We're hiring people here in Western Pennsylvania and other areas in anticipation for the renaissance. ... There are only two ways to get base-load electricity, coal or nuclear. Nuclear does not have greenhouse gases associated with it as fossil fuels do, so nuclear is often being selected.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Westinghouse favors a &quot;multifaceted approach&quot; that increases nuclear power along with increased conservation, use of renewable resources such as wind and solar, and development of clean coal technology, Gilbert said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inevitable acknowledged </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental groups acknowledge the use of nuclear power and coal plants with reduced carbon emissions is inevitable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Coal is simply going to be around for a long time. It's going to be part of the energy mix. The challenge then becomes finding a way to use coal that is climate friendly,&quot; said Tony Kreindler, spokesman for the Environmental Defense Fund. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nuclear power will be part of the mix, he said, but noted: &quot;It doesn't mean that we don't have concerns. Like a lot of folks out there, we still have concerns about safety and security, about proliferation and nuclear waste.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy as an issue in the presidential campaign is filtering down to local campaigns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's push to expand nuclear power and advance coal technology promises to be such a welcome issue in Pennsylvania -- a key battleground state in November -- that Rep. Jason Altmire of McCandless, a freshman Democrat facing re-election, quickly embraced the Republican's position.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview Altmire said his praise of McCain &quot;is not a partisan thing.&quot; Altmire notes that Obama backs investing in clean coal technology and has said nuclear power should be part of the energy mix, though he hasn't proposed expansion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would hope as the campaign moves on he'll come out more strongly in support of nuclear technology,&quot; Altmire said. He thinks energy, and how it affects the climate and voters' finances, is &quot;likely to be the number one issue that people will vote on this year.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Rep. Melissa Hart, a Bradford Woods Republican trying to win back the seat she lost to Altmire, said his endorsement of McCain's position on coal and nuclear power shows &quot;he's feeling pressure&quot; on hot energy issues with big local impacts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She criticizes Altmire for not getting behind the &quot;No More Excuses Energy Act&quot; that would encourage American refinery construction, invest in wind, nuclear and captured carbon dioxide energy sources, and allow &quot;responsible exploration&quot; for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and offshore drilling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poll released last week by Rasmussen Reports showed 67 percent of Americans favor offshore drilling and 64 percent believe it would lower gasoline prices at least somewhat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has vowed to keep in place the federal moratorium against offshore drilling, saying it would not affect gasoline prices for at least a decade and then only minimally. Obama instead proposes taxing profits of oil companies and using the money to pay for a $1,000 middle-class tax cut. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It began when they questioned Michelle Obama's patriotism after she said her husband's success was making her really proud of her country for the first time in her adult lifetime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bill O'Reilly of Fox News made a hideous comment about not wanting to join the &quot;lynching party&quot; for her yet after one caller described her as a &quot;militant.&quot; E.D. Hill of Fox News lost her job and had to apologize for suggesting that an affectionate knuckle bump between the Obamas could have been a &quot;terrorist fist jab.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If a fist pound is a terrorist gesture, then we all should be afraid, very afraid. Millions of Americans and other people around the world have given one another knuckle bumps for decades as a way of saying hello or &quot;that was a good one.&quot; Budweiser even made fun of it as being passe in a 2007 Super Bowl commercial.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hill is being replaced by Laura Ingraham, who once said about Al Sharpton visiting the White House: &quot;I hope they nailed down all the valuables.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then there was the headline on Fox News referring to Obama's wife as &quot;Obama's baby mama.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Baby mama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">baby daddy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is slang for the person with whom an unmarried person has one or more children. The expression was popularized by young black people and reflects hard facts of life for them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It does not apply to the Obamas. They have a strong, vital marriage. That is something to be commended, not disparaged in a stupid headline that violates every basic rule of journalism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attacks on Michelle Obama are reminiscent of the assaults that a lot of black women face at some point in their lives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This case is worse than usual because it is a direct statement that no matter what we do - graduate from good colleges, give of ourselves to the community, work hard for professional accomplishment, raise our children to be good people, support our husbands in running for high office - it doesn't matter to some people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The message these attacks send is this: You are not fit to be a lady, much less the first lady; we will not acknowledge your marriage, your family or your culture. We can &quot;joke&quot; about lynching you and then turn around and accuse you of being racist against us. We will condemn you for everything - and nothing at all. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain have told people to lay off. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The candidates' wives &quot;should be treated with respect, and if there's any disrespectful conduct on the part of anyone, those people should be rejected,&quot; McCain said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It should not be too much to ask. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echoes from the bruising fight for the Democratic presidential nomination have barely faded in Pennsylvania as John McCain and Barack Obama square off for the final phase of the campaign in this battleground state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, the Arizona senator and all-but-certain Republican nominee, opened his state campaign headquarters two blocks from the state Capitol in Harrisburg on Friday. He also began airing a new TV ad his second in the state in the past week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're raising money at a very good rate. More people are joining the campaign every day,&quot; Jon Seaton, McCain's regional campaign manager for Pennsylvania and Ohio, said as supporters munched on pizza at a reception in the campaign's new digs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Friday, Obama put up his first TV commercial of the general-election campaign in Pennsylvania and 17 other states. The Illinois senator lost Pennsylvania's Democratic primary two months ago, but clinched the nomination earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amy Brundage, an Obama campaign spokeswoman in Chicago, said the campaign plans to open a Pennsylvania headquarters and announce key staffers within the next few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Handicapping the Pennsylvania race is tricky business especially more than four months out from Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new Quinnipiac University poll shows Obama leading McCain by 12 percentage points in Pennsylvania and there is evidence that the state is increasingly &quot;blue&quot; that is, Democratic in its voting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some political observers say McCain has a shot at winning the state's 21 electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's going to be a horse race,&quot; predicted Michael Young, who runs a Harrisburg-based opinion research firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is a political moderate a &quot;Tom Ridge Republican&quot; in the mold of the former Pennsylvania governor who could cobble together a winning coalition of Republicans and disaffected Democrats, Young said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Democratic primary, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York won all but seven of the state's 67 counties and the results showed support for Obama was weak among white blue-collar workers, older people and women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, Clinton and her surrogates, including Gov. Ed Rendell, have urged her loyalists to set aside old grudges and unite behind Obama in the Nov. 4 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are reasons for Obama to be optimistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent history is on his side: The last Republican candidate to carry the state was the first President Bush in 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter registration also works to his advantage. Largely because of intensive recruitment drives by Obama and Clinton during the six-week primary campaign, the number of registered Democrats soared past 4 million a record for either party while GOP enrollment slumped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Baldino, a political science professor at Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre, says the state is Obama's to lose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama will have an easier time carrying Pennsylvania if Hillary Clinton works in the state for him,&quot; Baldino said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terry Madonna, a professor and pollster at Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster, believes Obama has a leg up, but that McCain &quot;can make it competitive&quot; if he runs strong in the Philadelphia suburbs and picks up votes from Democrats who backed Clinton in the primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues of age and race are wild cards, although Madonna said polls show voters are more concerned about candidates' age than their race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 71, McCain would be the oldest elected first-term president. Obama, 46, would be the first black president.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not easy trying to be a major-party presidential nominee and a political maverick at the same time. So John McCain is finding out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His prospects for defeating Democrat Barack Obama in November rely in large part on how well he handles the two roles and the inevitable tensions between them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the presumptive Republican nominee, McCain needs to hold onto the party's base voters, most of whom admire President Bush. As a maverick, he must reach out to independents and Democrats, many of whom consider the incumbent a failure.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events of the last week show the difficulty involved in performing both parts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, he unveiled a new ad that portrayed himself as maverick: &quot;John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming . . . five years ago.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the day was over, though, he declared his support for lifting the federal moratorium on offshore oil drilling. This new position, which was more in keeping with his party's mainstream, was embraced within hours by George W. Bush. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Frank Luntz, a pollster with Republican roots: &quot;McCain's independence is the only hope he has of winning the presidency, and it helps whenever he can draw contrasts with the president. . . . </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain isn't George Bush,&quot; Luntz said. &quot;They're very different people with a different ideology, a different approach to governing, different experiences. But McCain cannot win if he's seen as more of the same.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator prevailed in the primaries largely because his party's voters decided that his reputation for independence made him their best option - against a political landscape colored by a sagging economy, an unpopular war, and a more unpopular president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts say that the strength of McCain's persona is the reason he's within range of Obama, trailing in most polls by 4 or 5 percentage points. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if McCain is too much the maverick or opens too much distance between himself and the president (even with Bush's low approval rating), he risks alienating Republican loyalists.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum (R., Pa.), who supports McCain after initially opposing him, wrote earlier this year that conservatives have reason to &quot;worry about where McCain's passions lie.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Stephen Hess, who has advised three Republican administrations: &quot;McCain has been a maverick; they can't take that away from him. But going forward, he's at the head of a long army, and the army's called the GOP.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The polls indicate the independent image that defined McCain during his run for the Republican nomination eight years ago - an image that has broad appeal - is not as strong as it once was. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the ABC News/Washington Post poll asked voters whether they thought a President McCain would chart a new course or offer the same leadership as Bush. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 3-2, they picked the Bush option. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters value McCain's experience and his national-security credentials, according to the polls, particularly when they compare him with Obama. But the majority no longer sees McCain as his own man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the polls, he seems to get no credit whatsoever for the bipartisan work that he has done,&quot; said Bill Carrick, a Democratic strategist based in California. &quot;And the Republican base is still a little suspicious of him because he has been seen as a maverick.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a conversation earlier this month aboard his campaign bus, McCain said he was confident the electorate eventually would come to see him as he sees himself: as a conservative Republican with an independent streak. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most observers say that this is probably a campaign that has more engaged the attention of the American people than any campaign in recent history, given our economic difficulties and our national-security challenges, etc.,&quot; the senator said. &quot;So that gives me confidence that the voters will examine my candidacy . . . &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that conversation, McCain pointed to his differences with President Bush on climate change, domestic spending, and the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also recalled his high-profile dispute with the White House over his early and outspoken support for sending more troops to Iraq - a policy the administration ultimately adopted. That doesn't help him with voters who oppose the war and want to see it ended quickly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a subsequent town hall meeting in Pemberton, Burlington County, McCain talked a lot about cutting taxes and appointing strict constructionists to the Supreme Court, traditional Republican positions. He also declared: &quot;I know how to work with the Democrats, preserving my conservative principles.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other side is repeatedly making the argument that McCain is running for &quot;George Bush's third term.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Obama said that &quot;it's my impression that John McCain has adopted not only George Bush's policies but George Bush's playbook.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.) said that &quot;John McCain has fully embraced the failed, tragic [foreign] policy of the Bush administration over the last 71/2 years.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's aides and allies counter that Obama has done far less than their man in terms of bucking party orthodoxy and seeking consensus in the Senate. The McCain bipartisan resume includes work on such subjects as campaign-finance and immigration reform. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reclaiming the banner of reform, which he owned during his 2000 presidential run, is critical for him. Witness his campaign slogan: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Reform. Prosperity. Peace.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In that regard, being the one candidate to agree to federal spending limits for the general election may help. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to be seen as a maverick, analysts say, he'll have to act the part more than he has to date. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's trying to turn the page from where Bush is, and it's a very heavy page,&quot; said James Thurber, a political scientist at American University in Washington. &quot;With everything working against him, it's incredible that he's even competitive. But he is.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drill. There will be oil. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the dominant message from President Bush in an aggressive Rose Garden speech Wednesday on energy policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he should know it is wrongheaded to stress supply over demand as the solution to high energy prices. It allows people to pretend oil is the only issue, when a truly wise energy strategy requires a mix of solutions.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speech's emphasis on looking for more oil was especially disappointing in that Bush only this year seemed to finally come around to the belief that Americans need to consume less energy and to have more energy choices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush has even acknowledged the need to address global climate change through U.S. energy policy. But with gasoline prices having pushed past $4 a gallon, the president now has dusted off his old rhetoric. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both he and Republican presidential candidate John McCain called on Congress to lift 27-year-old bans on oil drilling in the oceanic continental shelf. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush also seeks to speed processing of oil shale in Colorado and elsewhere, and to expand and improve U.S. refineries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a tale of two coasts, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist likes these ideas while fellow Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger of California doesn't. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain/Bush argument boils down to this: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Why should we drill? Because oil is expensive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Put that way, it's a lame argument. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, consumers are ticked; oil prices bulk large in the present economic sludge. This is not, however, a survival issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When voters are cranky, it's easy enough to cry crisis. Bullying rhetoric, seeking to exploit a commercial opportunity, is both inaccurate and misleading. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drilling on a Bush/McCain scale is hardly an &quot;inevitable&quot; measure. Opening up offshore drilling won't affect world oil prices much. The United States produces only 3 percent of the world's oil. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, exploration and construction will take three to 10 years at best, and an additional 10 years for full ramp-up, leading to a savings per gallon of . . . pennies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (another Bush/McCain mantra) may not bother polar bears much, but it would supply only a little oil for a little while. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy companies can and should continue exploring for oil where they're allowed; judicious measures encouraging that are in order. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush rightly calls for expanded refining capacity and streamlined permit processes. U.S. refining capacity reached a raging 89.3 percent the week of June 9-13, and yet supply lines are stressed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But notice: Expanding refineries and speeding new construction simply make the beast hungrier. It ignores demand, which must be reduced. Such studied ignorance can't hope to address the country's energy woes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coming decades will bring an increase in energy choices that include wind, geothermal, hydro, alternative fuels, new storage tech, and nuclear - to accompany petro and coal, which won't soon go away. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama has consistently supported an energy policy that promoted myriad alternatives. McCain once did, but he needs to be more vocal if he still has that belief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Bush spoke on March 5 to the Washington International Renewable Energy Conference, he cheered new energy technologies, alternative fuels and energy efficiency. But he's not talking as loud about that now. He should. Because the more you feed the beast, the hungrier it gets.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton will campaign together next Friday, the first joint public event for the former rivals, as the senator from New York returns to the political scene following her defeat in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton has shunned most public appearances since her departure from the race June 7. She resurfaced Wednesday to attend services for &quot;Meet The Press&quot; host Tim Russert, and she is expected to appear at a pair of events with Mr. Obama late next week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday night, Clinton will introduce the Illinois senator to a group of her top donors at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, a bid to smooth relations between her supporters and the presumptive Democratic nominee. She is also scheduled to speak to the National Association of Latino Elected Officials earlier in the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton is expected to return to Capitol Hill early in the week, according to a senior Democratic aide, and could appear on the Senate floor as early as Tuesday morning to vote on a housing crisis bailout package. Votes are expected later in the week on a sweeping new surveillance bill that would effectively shield telecommunications companies from privacy lawsuits, and a war funding bill that also includes new education benefits for veterans. Mrs. Clinton, and possibly Mr. Obama, could be present for both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A week from today, you will have seen [Mrs. Clinton] at the Capitol,&quot; spokesman Philippe Reines said by e-mail yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokesman Bill Burton said next Friday's joint appearance may be limited to one event, but that the campaign is not ready to announce details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters yesterday in Jacksonville, Fla., Mr. Obama defended his decision a day earlier to opt out of the federal financing system for the general election after pledging to seek a deal with Arizona Sen. John McCain, his presumptive GOP rival, to use public as opposed to private money. Mr. McCain continued to bash Mr. Obama on the issue yesterday, accusing him of breaking his word and saying the decision compromised his claim to credentials as a reformer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the decision is almost certain to give Mr. Obama an enormous financial advantage in the final eight weeks of the race. While Mr. McCain will be restricted to spending the $84.1 million that public financing will provide, Mr. Obama can raise and spend as much as he can. The Obama campaign reports that he has already attracted at least 1.5 million donors, and some political observers believe that he could amass $300 million or more to spend on the general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign announced last night that it had raised $22 million in May, a relatively small sum compared with his previous totals -- he raised $55 million in February -- but still $1 million more than Mr. McCain's May total of $21 million, the best showing so far for the Republican. Mr. McCain finished May with just less than $32 million in the bank, compared with Mr. Obama's $43 million, although about $10 million of Mr. Obama's total can be spent only after the party's nominating convention in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At his news conference, Mr. Obama said he had opted out to preserve his ability to compete with independent conservative groups he expected to go all-out against his candidacy, although no such well-funded national organizations have materialized. He also asserted that his fund-raising rules, which bar contributions from federal lobbyists and political action committees, represent meaningful campaign finance reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ninety percent of our contributions are from small donors,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;And what we have done is to create a system that allows us to free ourselves from dependence on special interests and from lobbyists. That stands in contrast to Senator McCain's operations right now, where he says he's in the [public funding] system, and yet a huge proportion of his money is raised from special interests, from lobbyists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a reporter pointed to the dearth of well-heeled, GOP-aligned independent groups emerging, Mr. Obama responded by asserting that they could &quot;pop up pretty quickly and have enormous influence,&quot; adding: &quot;And we've already seen them -- and there was an ad run in South Dakota ... where it took a speech that I had made, extolling faith, and made it seem as if I had said that America was a Muslim nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He continued: &quot;We've already seen attacks on my wife from, you know, the Tennessee Republican Party. I don't think I'm off the wall here to see that, you know, there are a lot of outside groups that are potentially going to be going after us hard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, speaking to supporters at a Jacksonville fund-raiser, Mr. Obama said of Republicans: &quot;We know what kind of campaign they're going to run. They're going to try to make you afraid. They're going to try to make you afraid of me: 'He's young and inexperienced, and he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black? He's got a feisty wife.' &quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echoes from the bruising fight for the Democratic presidential nomination have barely faded in Pennsylvania as John McCain and Barack Obama square off for the final phase of the campaign in this battleground state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, the Arizona senator and all-but-certain Republican nominee, opened his state campaign headquarters two blocks from the state Capitol in Harrisburg on Friday. He also began airing a new TV ad his second in the state in the past week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're raising money at a very good rate. More people are joining the campaign every day,&quot; Jon Seaton, McCain's regional campaign manager for Pennsylvania and Ohio, said as supporters munched on pizza at a reception in the campaign's new digs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Friday, Obama put up his first TV commercial of the general-election campaign in Pennsylvania and 17 other states. The Illinois senator lost Pennsylvania's Democratic primary two months ago, but clinched the nomination earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amy Brundage, an Obama campaign spokeswoman in Chicago, said the campaign plans to open a Pennsylvania headquarters and announce key staffers within the next few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Handicapping the Pennsylvania race is tricky business especially more than four months out from Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new Quinnipiac University poll shows Obama leading McCain by 12 percentage points in Pennsylvania and there is evidence that the state is increasingly &quot;blue&quot; that is, Democratic in its voting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some political observers say McCain has a shot at winning the state's 21 electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's going to be a horse race,&quot; predicted Michael Young, who runs a Harrisburg-based opinion research firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is a political moderate a &quot;Tom Ridge Republican&quot; in the mold of the former Pennsylvania governor who could cobble together a winning coalition of Republicans and disaffected Democrats, Young said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Democratic primary, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York won all but seven of the state's 67 counties and the results showed support for Obama was weak among white blue-collar workers, older people and women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, Clinton and her surrogates, including Gov. Ed Rendell, have urged her loyalists to set aside old grudges and unite behind Obama in the Nov. 4 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are reasons for Obama to be optimistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent history is on his side: The last Republican candidate to carry the state was the first President Bush in 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter registration also works to his advantage. Largely because of intensive recruitment drives by Obama and Clinton during the six-week primary campaign, the number of registered Democrats soared past 4 million a record for either party while GOP enrollment slumped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Baldino, a political science professor at Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre, says the state is Obama's to lose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama will have an easier time carrying Pennsylvania if Hillary Clinton works in the state for him,&quot; Baldino said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terry Madonna, a professor and pollster at Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster, believes Obama has a leg up, but that McCain &quot;can make it competitive&quot; if he runs strong in the Philadelphia suburbs and picks up votes from Democrats who backed Clinton in the primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues of age and race are wild cards, although Madonna said polls show voters are more concerned about candidates' age than their race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 71, McCain would be the oldest elected first-term president. Obama, 46, would be the first black president.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By opting out of the public financing system, as he did yesterday, Democrat Barack Obama is hoping to give himself a distinct financial advantage over Republican John McCain in the fall. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he is betting he will suffer no lasting damage at voters' hands for making himself the first presidential candidate to reject public funds and the accompanying spending limits in a general election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who said last year that he would accept public financing if his Republican opponent agreed to do so, justified his widely expected move on the grounds that the system &quot;is broken, and we face opponents who've become masters at gaming this broken system.&quot; The decision, he said, was &quot;not an easy&quot; one.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presumptive Democratic nominee said he needed the extra money - beyond the $84 million from the federal treasury - to respond to &quot;the smears and attacks&quot; likely to come from independent groups able to collect and spend unlimited amounts of money. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, he will be able to spend as much as he can raise, which increases his strategic options. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, known for backing campaign-finance legislation, first said yesterday that he was unsure whether he, too, would opt out. By afternoon, though, he told reporters in Minnesota: &quot;We will take public financing.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with the Republican Party and other groups, McCain blasted Obama for opting out, saying that the Democrat &quot;has completely reversed himself and gone back, not on his word to me, but the commitment he made to the American people.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Republican National Committee chairman Mike Duncan: &quot;Obama's decision is what we've come to expect from a candidate whose rhetoric is nothing like his record, and it undermines his own claims to represent a new kind of politics.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has said that his fund-raising effort, which has relied heavily on small donors, is in keeping with &quot;the spirit&quot; of public financing. The system was established in 1976 in reaction to the Watergate scandal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Corrado, a campaign-finance expert at Colby College in Maine, said there was some substance to Obama's claim. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He offers the prospect of a campaign based on small donors, which was one of the goals of the Watergate reform,&quot; Corrado said. &quot;That diminishes some of the concern people might have.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said: &quot;Larger contributions and bundlers already have played an important role in financing the Obama presidential primary campaign and may well do so in the general election.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By any standard, Obama's fund-raising has been extraordinarily successful. As of the end of April, he had raised $265 million from more than 1.5 million donors, many of whom contributed over the Internet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the $265 million, about $10 million is general-election money. The Obama camp says it is confident it will be able to raise far more than the federal number. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign, which has devoted considerable time and effort to fund-raising in the last month, has generated $115 million on its own, none of it for the fall campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assuming he takes part in the federal system, McCain will receive $84 million upon being nominated in early September. The money comes from the $3 checkoff on the federal income-tax form.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once he takes the money, that will be all he can spend on his campaign in the roughly nine weeks between then and Election Day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous candidates, including Obama, McCain and Hillary Rodham Clinton, have rejected the federal matching funds available for the primaries, largely because of the state-by-state spending limits that come with the money. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But no one has refused the big government check for the general election.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Siegal, a New York lawyer and longtime advocate of public financing, said Obama would not pay a political price for opting out of a system that provides too little money for a state-of-the-art national campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I say sadly but realistically that the public really doesn't care about this as an issue that drives voting decisions,&quot; Siegal said, pointing to the success of self-financed candidates who did not participate in public finance systems: &quot;Look at [Gov.] Jon Corzine in New Jersey and [Mayor] Mike Bloomberg in New York.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Obama begins running his first television commercial of the general-election campaign in 18 states, a biographical ad in which he talks about his roots, his values, and &quot;a deep and abiding faith in the country I love.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will run in such obvious battlegrounds as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio and in several Republican states Obama hopes can become battlegrounds, such as Georgia, Indiana, North Carolina, North Dakota and Virginia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's current commercial emphasizes his differences with the Bush administration over climate change, saying he &quot;stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming . . . five years ago.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first ad, which is no longer on the air, highlighted McCain's military background and his 51/2 years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain yesterday denounced the U.S. Supreme Court decision granting broader legal rights to the detainees at Guantanamo Bay as &quot;one of the worst . . . in history&quot; and blasted Democrat Barack Obama for endorsing it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking with reporters after a town-hall meeting at Burlington County College in Pemberton, McCain predicted that the court's ruling would damage the nation's ability to wage the war on terrorism.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. Obama applauds this decision, and he supports it,&quot; McCain said. &quot;I argue against it and will do what I can to at least narrow down some of the wide-open aspects of the Supreme Court decision.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two candidates also sparred over Social Security taxes and how often they would appear together. McCain also pledged to make a serious effort in New Jersey, even though it has been a Democratic state in recent elections. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the presumptive GOP nominee said that the difference between his outlook and that of his Democratic counterpart underlined the differences in the kinds of Supreme Court justices each man would appoint if elected president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's likely that one or more seats on the court will turn over in the next four years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Obama hailed the ruling, which was issued that day and gave the detainees the right to challenge their detention in federal court, regardless of whether they are U.S. citizens. He called it &quot;an important step toward reestablishing our credibility as a nation committed to the rule of law.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the town-hall meeting and a subsequent news conference in Pemberton, McCain also discussed the impasse that has developed between the two presidential campaigns over his proposal for the candidates to stage 10 joint town-hall meetings - one per week until the Democratic convention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, the Obama campaign had responded with a proposal of its own, calling for one town-hall meeting on the economy in July and a foreign-policy debate in August, in addition to the three already-scheduled debates in September and October. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain rejected Obama's offer, calling it &quot;very disappointing.&quot; Said McCain: &quot;I'll let the American people decide which they think is the preferable proposal. . . . I believe strongly that the American people will support my position.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager, said he was disappointed at the McCain campaign's rejection of the Obama plan, which Plouffe said would provide the most face-to-face contact between major-party candidates in the modern era. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently they would rather contrive a political issue than foster a genuine discussion about the future of our country,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two candidates also became embroiled yesterday in a dispute over their plans for Social Security. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning in Ohio before his arrival in Philadelphia, Obama said he would expand the reach of the payroll tax as a way to put the system on a more sound financial footing moving forward. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax, 6.2 percent paid both by employee and employer, currently applies to only the first $102,000 of wages an individual earns. Under the Obama plan, it would apply also to all wages above $250,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said he would exempt people in between &quot;so that the change doesn't burden middle-class Americans.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, the Democrat has talked about expanding the payroll tax but has been vague on exactly who would pay it. With that in mind, McCain characterized the position Obama announced yesterday as &quot;a complete reversal&quot; of his previous stance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech on Social Security, the Democratic candidate said that McCain favors private accounts &quot;along the lines that President Bush proposed.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Pemberton, McCain replied: &quot;I . . . will not privatize Social Security. It is a government program.&quot; He said he would &quot;like for younger workers, younger workers only, to have an opportunity to take a few of their tax dollars, a few of theirs, and maybe put it into an account with their name on it. That's their money.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush also proposed that the accounts be voluntary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a purely political standpoint, McCain's appearance in New Jersey at this stage of the campaign season was somewhat surprising. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In most analyses of the geography of the November election, New Jersey, which has 15 electoral votes, is not listed as a battleground state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, the Democrats have carried it in the last four elections, sometimes by double-digit margins. The state has a Democratic governor, two Democratic senators, and Democratic majorities in both houses of the state legislature. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And campaigning in New Jersey requires a heavy investment in TV commercials in the New York City media market, the nation's most expensive, which often scares off Republican presidential candidates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in 2004, President Bush lost New Jersey by only 7 percentage points, down from 16 points four years earlier. Recent polls show Obama, whom Hillary Rodham Clinton defeated handily in the New Jersey primary, with leads in the mid- to high single-digit range. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We intend to compete in the great state of New Jersey,&quot; McCain told reporters traveling with him on his campaign bus. &quot;I won't say I'll win it. I'm saying it's winnable.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain was joined at Burlington County College by former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), and Sen. Joseph Lieberman (I., Conn.). </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of Illinois Democratic Sen. Barack Obama's vice-presidential selection committee resigned yesterday, saying he had done nothing improper in accepting special home loans from a company that is at the center of the subprime mortgage crisis, but didn't want the controversy to hurt Mr. Obama's election chances. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James A. Johnson &quot;did not want to distract in any way from the very important task of gathering information about my vice-presidential nominee, so he has made a decision to step aside that I accept,&quot; Mr. Obama said in a statement. The senator said he was grateful for Mr. Johnson's guidance, and he expressed confidence that the selection process Mr. Johnson set in motion would proceed without him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign had no immediate word on whether Mr. Johnson would be replaced with another unpaid adviser to head the vetting process for a running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two others also tapped to look at potential running mates were expected to stay on. They are Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of former President John F. Kennedy, and Eric Holder, a former deputy attorney general under former President Bill Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Johnson is a former chairman of Fannie Mae, the quasi-public mortgage guarantee organization, and a Washington insider, having served previously as chairman of the Kennedy Center and The Brookings Institution, a center-left policy organization. Known for his discretion, he also had vetted potential running mates for Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kerry in 2004 and assisted Walter Mondale's vice-presidential search two decades earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics had pointed to Mr. Johnson's insider reputation as a contradiction for Mr. Obama, who promises to change &quot;politics as usual&quot; and to look outside Washington for solutions. That argument had found little traction until a Wall Street Journal report Saturday that Mr. Johnson was among a group of friends of the Countrywide Financial Corp. chief executive officer who had received below-market-rate home mortgages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arizona Sen. John McCain, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, and the Republican National Committee seized on the story, saying Mr. Obama was a hypocrite for criticizing Countrywide's practices publicly, then tapping advisers who benefited from the company's practices. Democrats have criticized Mr. McCain for lobbyists' involvement in his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, when asked about the controversy Tuesday, stood by Mr. Johnson, saying, &quot;I am not vetting my VP search committee for their mortgages,&quot; and that to know everything about everyone tangentially connected to his campaign, &quot;I would have to hire a vetter to vet the vetters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama also had dismissed the criticism as a &quot;game&quot; by his opponents, and said it was an important distinction that Mr. Johnson was serving in an unpaid campaign position, as opposed to a government job that had an impact on policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans responded to news of Mr. Johnson's departure by turning up the heat on others connected to Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They noted that the vice-presidential panel's Mr. Holder had been involved in Mr. Clinton's controversial pardon of financier Marc Rich, who had been indicted for evading more than $48 million in taxes and charged with 51 counts of tax fraud as well as running illegal oil deals with Iran during the 1979-1980 hostage crisis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign deems irrelevant Johnson's association with Mozilo and Countrywide, even though it was at one time critical of Hillary Clinton for employing Mark Penn, whose firm, Burson Marsteller, once represented Countrywide.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama people think Johnson's connection to Countrywide's Mozelo is overblown. They are entitled to their opinion, but others feel differently. John McCain, for one.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">576 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's frustrating enough when gas prices soar due to the unseen forces of global supply and demand. But it's downright unfair when Wall Street speculators contribute to rising prices at the pump. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's growing evidence that investors looking to make a fast buck are causing oil prices to rise faster than can be explained by ordinary market forces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress, however, can do something about the situation. It can help to ease this problem, because it helped to create this monster.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 2000, Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which was signed into law by President Clinton shortly before he left office in January 2001. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few people realized at the time that a loophole had been tucked into this 262-page bill at the last minute by then-Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas). It came to be known as the &quot;Enron Loophole,&quot; and it allowed Enron and other large energy traders to be exempt from federal oversight of over-the-counter transactions in energy markets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enron is no more, but the loophole lives on. It has allowed massive growth of unregulated trading on energy futures markets, where investors essentially &quot;bet&quot; on the price of oil at a certain date in the future. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commodities markets ordinarily allow commercial buyers of goods that people need, such as corn, pork and energy products, to lock in a price for later delivery of those commodities. But in the unregulated environment spawned by the Enron Loophole, speculators increasingly treat commodities as if they were stocks. These investors don't want to take delivery of the oil after they &quot;buy&quot; it; they just want the price to rise so they can make a huge profit. As the dollar weakens, oil becomes an even more attractive investment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The details of these types of trades are largely hidden. Some contracts are negotiated between parties who don't need to disclose them. Some contracts are made overseas, beyond the limited oversight of U.S. regulators. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As speculators flock to oil, they are creating artificial demand for the commodity, which drives up the price. Nobody knows how much speculators are adding to the cost of gasoline, but some analysts believe it's as much as 50 percent of recent increases. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other factors are probably contributing to $4 gasoline. Global oil supply has not increased, and there is growing demand from nations such as China and India. But many experts believe that speculating is also adding considerably to the rapid price increase at the pump. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the federal authority responsible for regulating such trading, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is virtually powerless to step in. The CFTC needs the regulatory authority and the staffing to make sure these markets are transparent and monitored. Congress should give this weakened agency the tools it needs to do its oversight job effectively. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presumptive presidential nominees, Sens. Barack Obama (D., Ill.) and John McCain (R., Ariz.), haven't paid notice to this factor in rising gas prices. Both candidates have chosen to pander to voters with politically popular ploys - McCain with a gas-tax &quot;holiday&quot; and Obama with a windfall profits tax on oil companies. Neither idea will likely affect prices at the pump in a meaningful way. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, lawmakers should close the loophole that gave rise to heightened market speculation. Commodities are products that consumers need for their daily existence, and those markets shouldn't be so vulnerable to greedy manipulation.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While age will be a factor in the race, Frank Fryburg believes McCain's age - he turns 72 in August - will help him get elected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Fryburg said, some of us consider him a pretty young fellow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fryburg, a spry 82, has led the county Republicans' Senior Coalition since 2000. He was recently named coordinator for the county Republicans' fall campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fryburg has worked to establish a network of Republican volunteers in the county's retirement homes. They won't have a hard sell, he believes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's experience as a long-serving U.S. senator and former naval officer and prisoner of war will resonate with older people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And younger people will also support McCain once they understand and appreciate his credentials, Fryburg predicted. He compared the Arizona senator to his rival. Democrat Barack Obama is 46 and in his first term in the U.S. Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think we have to get the young people to understand that he is a great talker, but there is very little there of substance, Fryburg said of Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain will have his own campaign here, headed by County Commissioner Scott Martin. State Attorney General Tom Corbett also has a local campaign committee, led by county Treasurer Craig Ebersole. While those committees each will have a core group of volunteers, they will benefit from pooling resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fryburg said that's where he comes in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the GOP campaign coordinator, Fryburg said, he will work with the chairmen of the individual candidate campaigns to coordinate resources, such as staffing information booths at the various local fairs, running phone banks or distributing campaign literature door to door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think we'll be very effective, he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">799 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SO YOU MAY have noticed John McCain and Barack Obama hanging around Lifetime this weekend, pretending to know something about the estrogen-fueled network's No. 1 hit, &quot;Army Wives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ever-growing repertoire of Stupid Politician Tricks, where to rank this bipartisan show of support for the troops, both real and fictional, by the presumptive nominees of the two major parties?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While a commercial appearance for Lifetime just isn't as reflexively hip as being on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; - though, with 13 appearances so far to Obama's three, McCain might as well be considered a fixture - the plugs didn't strike me as being as cringe-worthy as the candidates' taped appearances, along with one by Hillary Clinton, on World Wrestling Entertainment's &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; a while back. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But setting aside my anti-wrestling bias for a moment, these out-of-context appearances make sense - and not just because Sunday's &quot;Wives&quot; premiere drew 4.5 million viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter how much interest this election appears to have stirred, there are doubtless millions who never watch &quot;The CBS Evening News&quot; or CNN or NBC's &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; to name just a few places a presidential candidate might be expected to pop up these days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone I know who watches &quot;The Daily Show&quot; tends to think everyone else watches it, too - but that could just mean we all know the same 1.9 million people, since that's how many Comedy Central says watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a big country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bigger certainly than it was in the days when John Adams was able to run for president without leaving his front porch, or wherever it was Paul Giamatti sat out the election season in the HBO miniseries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those early Americans didn't have TV, so newspapers had to pick up the slack on the mud-slinging, beating up politicians at least as badly - if a bit more slowly - than 24-hour cable news does today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we do have TVs, and according to Nielsen Media Research, they're on for 31 hours, 55 minutes a week in the average household.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if you're McCain or Obama, and want to make sure your message gets heard by people who weren't necessarily tuning in to listen to it, where should you go next?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I were scheduling them, I'd consider:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">CBS' &quot;Great American Dog.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pols have been exploiting man's best friend since Richard Nixon used a cocker spaniel named Checkers to defend himself against charges of taking illegal contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And where better to continue the tradition than on a show - premiering July 10 - that pits canines and their owners against one another in a series of challenges that will no doubt make the campaign trail look like a walk in the dog park?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Local note: One of the humans, a New York doctor identified only as &quot;David,&quot; is said to be from Camden originally, though it appears his 2-year-old Parson Russell Terrier, Elvis, is a New Yorker.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Animal Planet's &quot;Meerkat Manor.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Everything from the judicious use of power to national security is touched on in this disturbingly addictive series that tracks the day-to-day lives of a colony of meerkats in Africa's Kalahari desert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the candidates might want to offer a few well-chosen words about the colony's late matriarch, Flower, or about another of the show's stars, reportedly killed in a hit-and-run accident after Season 4 filming ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sci Fi Channel's &quot;Battlestar Galactica.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plugging a show with a dying woman president (played by Mary McDonnell) might be tricky for Obama right now, but &quot;Galactica's&quot; depiction of the inevitable struggle between security and liberty is too topical to ignore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The History Channel's &quot;Ice Road Truckers.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if a show about men driving long distances over what might be thinning ice didn't touch a nerve with the candidates, there's the opportunity to catch viewers who may have tuned in to one of cable's chilliest shows to take their minds off the heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">NBC's &quot;America's Got Talent.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With Fox's &quot;American Idol&quot; safely out of the way till after inauguration day, this show, which returns June 17, is probably the best place to come to wave the flag for all those talented Americans who somehow avoided being discovered by all the other summer talent shows, many of which inexplicably failed to include &quot;America&quot; in their titles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever they do, both candidates should avoid actually participating in any &quot;reality&quot; shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pet the dogs? Sure. Just don't try to teach them to roll over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Television, after all, offers endless opportunities for the kind of humiliation sleep-deprived candidates shouldn't court: failure to remember lyrics, pick the correct briefcase, pass a lie-detector test, to name a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that in mind, here's a few shows Obama and McCain might want to avoid:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABC's &quot;Wipeout,&quot; NBC's &quot;Celebrity Circus&quot; and, of course, Fox's &quot;Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?&quot; *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rising in the Senate on May 13, Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat, explained: &quot;I rise to discuss rising energy prices.&quot; The president was heading to Saudi Arabia to seek an increase in its oil production, and Sen. Schumer's gorge was rising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saudi Arabia, he said, &quot;holds the key to reducing gasoline prices at home in the short term.&quot; Therefore arms sales to that kingdom should be blocked unless it &quot;increases its oil production by one million barrels per day,&quot; which would cause the price of gasoline to fall &quot;50 cents a gallon almost immediately.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can a senator, with so many things on his mind, know so precisely how the price of gasoline would respond to that increase in the oil supply? Mr. Schumer does know that if you increase the supply of something, the price of it probably will fall. That is why he and 96 other senators recently voted to increase the supply of oil on the market by stopping the flow of oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects against major physical interruptions. Seventy-one of the 97 senators who voted to stop filling the SPR also oppose drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One million barrels is what might today be flowing from ANWR if in 1995 President Clinton had not vetoed legislation to permit drilling there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One million barrels produce 27 million gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventy-two of today's senators -- including Mr. Schumer, of course, and 38 other Democrats, including Barack Obama, and 33 Republicans, including John McCain -- have voted to keep ANWR's estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil off the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Mr. Schumer is complicit in taking $10 away from every American who buys 20 gallons of gasoline. &quot;Democracy,&quot; said H.L. Mencken, &quot;is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.&quot; The common people of New York want Mr. Schumer to be their senator, so they should pipe down about gasoline prices, which are a predictable consequence of their political choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also disqualified from complaining are all voters who sent to Washington senators and representatives who have voted to keep ANWR's oil in the ground, and who voted to put 85 percent of America's offshore territory off-limits to drilling. The U.S. Minerals Management Service says that restricted area contains perhaps 86 billion barrels of oil and 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas -- 10 times the oil and 20 times the natural gas Americans use in a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drilling is under way 60 miles off Florida. The drilling is being done by China, in cooperation with Cuba, which is drilling closer to South Florida than U.S. companies are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANWR is larger than the combined areas of five states (Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware) and drilling along its coastal plain would be confined to a space one-sixth the size of Washington's Dulles Airport. Offshore? Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed or damaged hundreds of drilling rigs without causing a large spill. There has not been a significant spill from an offshore U.S. well since 1969. Of the more than 7 billion barrels of oil pumped offshore in the past 25 years, 0.001 percent -- that is one-thousandth of 1 percent -- has been spilled. Louisiana has more than 3,200 rigs offshore -- and a thriving commercial fishing industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his &quot;Gusher of Lies: The Dangerous Delusions of 'Energy Independence,' &quot; Robert Bryce says Brazil's energy success has little to do with its much-discussed ethanol production and much to do with its increased oil production, the vast majority of which comes from off Brazil's shore. Investor's Business Daily reports that Brazil, &quot;which recently made a major oil discovery almost in sight of Rio's beaches,&quot; has leased most of the world's deep-sea drilling rigs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 2006, two U.S. companies announced that their &quot;Jack No. 2&quot; well, in the Gulf 270 miles southwest of New Orleans, had tapped a field with perhaps 15 billion barrels of oil, which would increase America's proven reserves by 50 percent. Just probing four miles below the Gulf's floor costs $100 million. Congress' response to such expenditures is to propose increasing the oil companies' tax burdens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America says to foreign producers: We prefer not to pump our oil, so please pump more of yours, thereby lowering its value, for our benefit. Let it not be said that America has no energy policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A soaring jobless rate, an unprecedented jump in oil prices and a sliding dollar sent tremors through financial markets yesterday and cast fresh doubt on how soon the U.S. economy would be able to break out of a pattern of feeble growth and financial instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's unemployment rate shot skyward last month to 5.5 percent, the biggest leap in more than two decades, and crude oil prices rocketed up $10.75 a barrel, sending U.S. stock markets tumbling and shaking the economic and political landscape just as the general election season begins. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was one of the worst days of economic news in a year already well-stocked with disappointment. The Dow Jones industrial average reacted by plunging 394.64 points, or 3.13 percent, its sharpest decline since Feb. 27, 2007. Other major indicators also dropped about 3 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's events are a combination of really nasty news for American consumers,&quot; said Andrew Tilton, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crude oil prices hit a new trading record of more than $139 a barrel before settling at $138.54. This more than erased a drop earlier in the week and promised further increases in motor fuel prices. The nationwide average is already just a penny shy of $4 a gallon for regular gasoline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one-day increase in crude prices was the biggest ever in dollar terms, the largest in percentage terms since June 1996 and more than the cost of an entire barrel a decade ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the jobless rate for May was up 0.5 percentage points from April, the Labor Department said, the largest swing in a single month since 1986. The number of jobs on employers' payrolls fell by 49,000, the fifth consecutive monthly decline for an economy that has shed 324,000 jobs this year. Joblessness rose across race and gender. Professional, commercial, construction, business service and manufacturing employers all cut jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you have an employment situation like that, and you see crude bounce ... that's shocking to anything that's going to touch the consumer,&quot; said Bart Barnett, head of equity trading at Morgan Keegan, an investment and brokerage firm. &quot;Outside of anything to do with oil, everything is down -- airlines, restaurants, furniture stores, retailers, transportation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the spike in unemployment was caused by an unusually large surge of teen-agers and people in their 20s into the labor force. And those young workers had little success finding work. The jobless rate among 16- to 19-year-olds rose to 18.7 percent from 15.4 percent in April. Retailers, who employ a large number of unskilled teen-agers during the summer, cut 27,000 positions in the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rising unemployment, however, spread well beyond young people. The jobless rate rose among almost every other group -- men, women, blacks and whites. The rate was unchanged among Latinos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, average weekly earnings for non-managerial workers appeared to lose ground to inflation, rising only 3.2 percent in the year that ended in May. Analysts expect this to be less than inflation over the same time span. That inflation figure has not yet been released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's crystal clear that the economy is not generating the job and income growth people need to maintain their living standards,&quot; said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Job losses continued in the construction industry, which has been hit hard by the housing downturn. That sector lost 34,000 positions in May and has now lost 475,000 jobs since its peak two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were worrisome signs in the professional and business service sector, which has been a stalwart of job creation in the past year. It lost 39,000 jobs, most of them temporary workers who are often shed to avoid layoffs of permanent employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a muddling economy that continues to muddle on,&quot; said John Silvia, chief economist at Wachovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with the grim economic news, President Bush is considering new measures to help stimulate the battered economy, the White House said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House counselor Ed Gillespie said Mr. Bush's advisers are constantly looking at options for new economic proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a short window for the president here when it comes to new policy. We understand that,&quot; Mr. Gillespie said. &quot;So I guess what I'm saying is, don't rule it out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gillespie spoke before a Bush speech on the economy, timed around the ceremonial swearing-in of the president's new housing secretary, Steven Preston. In his remarks, Mr. Bush stuck to promoting his existing economic policies, such as making some of his tax cuts permanent and allowing more oil exploration and drilling in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economy's latest woes didn't go unnoticed by the two men vying for Mr. Bush's job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama, the likely Democratic nominee, called the employment figures &quot;deeply troubling,&quot; while Republican rival John McCain said they were a &quot;stark reminder of the economic challenges facing American families.&quot; Both candidates pledged to turn around the economy. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEFORE a marriage, there must be courtship. Before a &quot;dream ticket,&quot; there must be joint campaigning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while the smart money says there's no way that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Barack Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will choose </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hillary Clinton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as his running mate - creating the dream ticket - you never know how a courtship will turn out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton will endorse Obama tomorrow. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters on both sides want to see a unity event - Obama and Clinton side-by-side - within a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Obama will make the first of many Pennsylvania stops right here in Philadelphia within 10 days, for a fundraiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But back to the dream ticket. Why is it so dreamy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You'd have a landslide,&quot; gushed Clinton's national finance co-chairman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> Mark Aronchick</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;[Democrats] would take over the Senate conclusively, add to the lead in the House and impact the [state legislatures] where they deal with redistricting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That might not happen if she's not on ticket,&quot; he said. &quot;The passion levels are huge [with them together]. I'm not sure you'd see the same level of intensity if they're not on there together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Mark Alderman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who's on Obama's national finance committee, said: &quot;I would love to see him with her and all of the leaders of the party. But the circumstances are Barack's to choose. This is his campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alderman wasn't about to set the odds of Obama picking Clinton for vice president, but said: &quot;The two of them will figure out a way to get along just fine. They are the only two people in the history of the world who have gone through what they just went through. It gives them a singular and unique bond to experience that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sort of like tornado survivors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Brady: Blue-collar issues</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bob Brady</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also wants to see Clinton and Obama campaign together across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one thing, it will help shore up Obama's weakness with white, blue-collar voters, a key voting bloc in crucial swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brady knows white, blue-collar voters because he grew up one. He thinks the solution for Obama lies in the issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the primaries, those voters had a choice between two candidates who were close on the issues, so it was a popularity contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now the choice is Obama or McCain, and they are far apart on the issues,&quot; Brady said. &quot;Obama has a lot more to offer than McCain does - he's Bush III. He supported Bush's economy and he supported the war. Those are the two big issues, and [blue-collar voters] will be with Obama on them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Peruto teams with Flavia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Lisa Peruto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the daughter of businessman </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">James Peruto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (of Keenan Motors), grandaughter of legendary lawyer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">A. Charles Peruto Sr.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and niece of defense attorney </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Chuck Peruto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is a graduate of Mount St. Joseph's Academy and Widener Law School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She could've landed a cushy job with one of the city's big-name law firms. Instead, she chose Hollywood. And Clout-created celebrity </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Flavia Colgan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people think I'm crazy, but others are like, 'OK, I get it,' &quot; she told us yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her family, including the lawyers, &quot;were very supportive. They were apprehensive to see me go across the country, but excited to see me explore my passion and my options.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peruto, 27, will help Colgan and agent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Kenny Lindner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> develop TV projects and juggle her many other duties (which include being a member of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Daily News</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> editorial board.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that there isn't fun, too. Colgan hosted a &quot;Sex and the City&quot; party last weekend in Hollywood that included actor </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rudolph Martin</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (whose movie credits include &quot;Swordfish&quot; and whose TV credits include the CSI shows &quot;24,&quot; &quot;Dexter&quot; and &quot;Moonlight&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CBS' &quot;The Early Show,&quot; meanwhile, either can't count or it has increased the number of Colgan's stories on ordinary people doing extraordinary things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her contract called for one segment a month, but she's been on weekly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We tried to get Colgan to clarify it for us, but she'd promised voice coach </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Priscilla Shanks</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to spend one day a week in total silence and yesterday was the day.</SPAN></P>

Balaban</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> one of its rising stars of 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Balaban, who works for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Neil Oxman </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">at The Campaign Group, wrote the words for the killer ad that featured </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Mayor Nutter's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> daughter, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Olivia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in last year's Democratic mayoral primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Balaban is not related to actor </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bob Balaban</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who recently starred in the HBO movie &quot;Recount,&quot; about the messed up 2000 presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the name did cause him distress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was no way I was going to watch that,&quot; Balaban said, noting that anger about the hijacked election would return &quot;and probably send me out into the streets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But whenever he'd click to Comcast's &quot;On Demand&quot; to check movie selections, he'd see &quot;Recount: Balaban.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like HBO is taunting me,&quot; he said. &quot;But I'm still not gonna watch it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Quotable</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they try to make something out of that, I'll kill them.&quot; - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Gov.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former &quot;Tonight Show&quot; second banana, &quot;Star Search&quot; host and American Family Publishers pitchman is fighting to avoid foreclosure on his Beverly Hills home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMahon, 85, was $644,000 behind on payments on $4.8 million in mortgage loans when a unit of Countrywide Financial Corp. filed a default notice Feb. 28 with the L.A. County Recorder's Office, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Wall Street Journal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reported Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Why does an 85-year-old man have a $4.8 million mortgage?)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMahon, unfortunately, has been unable to work much since he broke his neck 18 months ago, according to his spokesman, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Howard Bragman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Isn't it kind of ironic Ed McMahon having a spokesman? He is a spokesman.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are plenty of people affected by the weak economy, bad housing market or bad health,&quot; Bragman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMahon has been in &quot;very fruitful discussions&quot; with the lender to resolve the situation, Bragman said. But it's unclear whether McMahon and his wife, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Pamela</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, will remain in the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 6BR, 5BTH house is in a hilltop gated community overlooking Mulholland Drive called The Summit and is listed for sale at $6.25 million. It has been on the market two years, according to real-estate agent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Alex Davis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has the listing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reason the home has had a hard time selling, in addition to the bad market, is it's near the home of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Britney Spears</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we were trying to sell the house one time, there were about 100 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">paparazzi</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> there,&quot; Davis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noted Tattle: &quot;There are plenty of people affected by Britney Spears.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rising in the Senate on May 13, Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat, explained: &quot;I rise to discuss rising energy prices.&quot; The president was heading to Saudi Arabia to seek an increase in its oil production, and Schumer's gorge was rising.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saudi Arabia, he said, &quot;holds the key to reducing gasoline prices at home in the short term.&quot; Therefore, arms sales to that kingdom should be blocked unless it &quot;increases its oil production by 1 million barrels per day,&quot; which would cause the price of gasoline to fall &quot;50 cents a gallon almost immediately.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Can a senator, with so many things on his mind, know so precisely how the price of gasoline would respond to that increase in the oil supply? Schumer does know that if you increase the supply of something, the price of it probably will fall. That is why he and 96 other senators recently voted to increase the supply of oil on the market by stopping the flow of oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects against major physical interruptions. Seventy-one of the 97 senators who voted to stop filling the SPR also oppose drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One million barrels is what might today be flowing from ANWR if in 1995 President Clinton had not vetoed legislation to permit drilling there. One million barrels produce 27 million gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel. Seventy-two of today's senators -- including Schumer, of course, and 38 other Democrats, including Barack Obama, and 33 Republicans, including John McCain -- have voted to keep ANWR's estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil off the market.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So Schumer, according to Schumer, is complicit in taking $10 away from every American who buys 20 gallons of gasoline. &quot;Democracy,&quot; said H.L. Mencken, &quot;is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.&quot; The common people of New York want Schumer to be their senator, so they should pipe down about gasoline prices, which are a predictable consequence of their political choice.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also disqualified from complaining are all voters who sent to Washington senators and representatives who have voted to keep ANWR's oil in the ground, and who voted to put 85 percent of America's offshore territory off-limits to drilling. The U.S. Minerals Management Service says that restricted area contains perhaps 86 billion barrels of oil and 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas -- 10 times the oil and 20 times the natural gas Americans use in a year.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Drilling is under way 60 miles off Florida. The drilling is being done by China, in cooperation with Cuba, which is drilling closer to South Florida than U.S. companies are. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANWR is larger than the combined areas of five states (Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware) and drilling along its coastal plain would be confined to a space one-sixth the size of Washington's Dulles Airport. Offshore? Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed or damaged hundreds of drilling rigs without causing a large spill. There has not been a significant spill from an offshore U.S. well since 1969. Of the more than 7 billion barrels of oil pumped offshore in the past 25 years, 0.001 percent -- that is one-thousandth of 1 percent -- has been spilled. Louisiana has more than 3,200 rigs offshore -- and a thriving commercial fishing industry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his &quot;Gusher of Lies: The Dangerous Delusions of 'Energy Independence,'&quot; Robert Bryce says Brazil's energy success has little to do with its much-discussed ethanol production and much to do with its increased oil production, the vast majority of which comes from off Brazil's shore. Investor's Business Daily reports that Brazil, &quot;which recently made a major oil discovery almost in sight of Rio's beaches,&quot; has leased most of the world's deep-sea drilling rigs.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In September 2006, two U.S. companies announced that their &quot;Jack No. 2&quot; well, in the Gulf 270 miles southwest of New Orleans, had tapped a field with perhaps 15 billion barrels of oil, which would increase America's proven reserves by 50 percent. Just probing four miles below the Gulf's floor costs $100 million. Congress' response to such expenditures is to propose increasing the oil companies' tax burdens.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> America says to foreign producers: We prefer not to pump our oil, so please pump more of yours, thereby lowering its value, for our benefit. Let it not be said that America has no energy policy. </SPAN></P>
