</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the heavy hand of the state is imposed on the press, all of us lose,&quot; Barack Obama told a group of Kenyan journalists during an August 2006 trip to Africa. &quot;The media does not have a formal role in the government, but it serves a critical function in providing information to the public so that they can hold the government accountable,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's remarks implied he supports the First Amendment. His comment that &quot;Democracy can't function properly without a free press,&quot; suggested he understood the importance of robust scrutiny of elected officials. Yet, when given the opportunity, Mr. Obama's recent actions have contradicted his own statements. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign launched a multipronged assault on the First Amendment when it threatened television and radio stations airing content critical of Mr. Obama. The first targets were TV stations running an advertisement that has proven embarrassing to the presidential candidate. The ad focuses on Mr. Obama's 13-year relationship with Bill Ayers, a key member of the 1970s domestic terrorist group, the Weather Underground. The Weathermen bombed at least 12 locations, including the U.S. Capitol in 1971, the Pentagon in 1972 and the State Department in 1975. A 1970 San Francisco bombing killed one police officer and blinded another. The same year, three Weathermen perished in a Greenwich Village townhouse explosion. Unrepentant, Mr. Ayers told a New York Times reporter in remarks published on Sept. 11, 2001: &quot;I don't regret setting bombs. I feel we didn't do enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group called American Issues Project paid for the ad to run on several TV stations in key battleground states. Press accounts say some of the stations are owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, for whom I work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Obama target is Chicago radio station WGN. The source of Mr. Obama's ire is talk-show host Stanley Kurtz who is no Friend of Barry. The Obama campaign has urged supporters to attack WGN for permitting Mr. Kurtz to practice his profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign lawyer Robert Bauer warned TV stations against airing the ad he claimed of containing &quot;malicious falsity.&quot; Mr. Bauer's repeated demands that the Justice Department intervene is an example of an intrusion the First Amendment was crafted to guard against and the type of heavy-handed tactics Mr. Obama criticized in Kenya. But in 2006, Mr. Obama was the recipient of exclusively fawning media coverage. Reporters from CNN, AP, BBC, Reuters, a pair of Chicago TV stations and dozens of international and local media accompanied Mr. Obama on his Kenya visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bauer called those behind the ads &quot;lawbreakers&quot; and accused them of acting &quot;illegally.&quot; Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor labeled the ad &quot;false.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Television stations typically have procedures in place to guard against airing patently false or grossly misleading ads. Generally, stations err on the side of running the commercials. The onus of responsibility to pull an ad usually falls on the complaining party to make their case. That the Obama camp has not challenged the content of the ad using established mechanisms speaks volumes. (Of note, if media outlets did not publish or broadcast ads that may be dubious, questionable or open to interpretation, then very few political ads would ever see the light of day.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign's insistence on government intervention is reminiscent of a similar threat made by a John Kerry campaign official during the 2004 presidential race. At issue was &quot;Stolen Honor,&quot; a documentary film featuring 13 former Vietnam POWs, including two Medal of Honor recipients, who took issue with statements made by Mr. Kerry during their captivity and during the 2004 campaign. Mr. Kerry supporters branded the former POWs liars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appearing opposite me while on Fox News Channel, Kerry spokesman Chad Clanton threatened retaliation by a Kerry administration if Sinclair aired any portion of &quot;Stolen Honor.&quot; Mr. Clanton warned, &quot;They [Sinclair] better hope we don't get elected.&quot; Mr. Clanton's threat was a colossal blunder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, Mr. Kerry received considerable support from congressional Democrats. Eighteen senators sent a letter to the Federal Communications Commission imploring the agency to prevent any broadcast of &quot;Stolen Honor.&quot; Eighty-five House Democrats followed suit. The FCC correctly denied the requests from the Censorship Caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Threats by the Obama camp should alarm every media organization, and more importantly, the public. Sadly, the number of media outlets that criticized brazen attempts in 2004 by Kerry officials and supporters to undermine the First Amendment could be counted on only one hand. Countless newspapers encouraged the FCC to take pre-emptive action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times accused of the Medal of Honor recipients and their fellow POWs of making false claims and editorialized that the FCC should revoke Sinclair's broadcast licenses. (For the record, then-deputy editorial page editor Andrew Rosenthal admitted to me he never watched &quot;Stolen Honor&quot; despite labeling the documentary a &quot;propaganda film&quot; that &quot;makes no attempt at balance or fairness.&quot; )</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Time's exhortation of &quot;no attempt at balance or fairness&quot; came from the very same newspaper that earlier this year published a journalistically flawed Page One story alleging an affair between John McCain and a female lobbyist while relying on just two unnamed sources. That is an example of the kind of freedom of the press that Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry support: one that supports their version of the truth.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. PAUL, Minn. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush turned over the reins of the Republican Party to John McCain on Tuesday night and then stepped aside as Mr. McCain's friends touted him as a maverick and teamed up to blast his Democratic opponent, Barack Obama, as the least-qualified nominee ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the first day of regular politicking in a convention that had been sidetracked by Hurricane Gustav, and delegates filled only about three-fourths of the seats in the Xcel Energy Center in the hours before late-evening speeches by Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Democrat turned independent, and former Sen. Fred Thompson, a former rival of Mr. McCain's for the Republican nomination, who charged that Mr. Obama hasn't earned the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats present a history-making nominee for president - history-making in that he's the most liberal, most inexperienced nominee to ever run for president,&quot; Mr. Thompson said. &quot;Apparently they believe that he would match up well with the history-making, Democrat-controlled Congress - history-making because it's the least accomplished and most unpopular Congress in our nation's history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lieberman, the 2000 Democratic vice-presidential nominee who caucuses with Democrats in the Senate, was brutal in his evaluation, saying Mr. Obama has never reached across party lines to accomplish &quot;anything significant.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eloquence is no substitute for a record, not in these tough times for America,&quot; he said, adding that Mr. Obama hasn't taken on entrenched interests in the Democratic Party's base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lieberman, a staunch supporter of Mr. McCain's and Mr. Bush's position on Iraq, also defended Mr. McCain as the real maverick, saying he is not a reincarnation of Mr. Bush - the principal Democratic attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't be fooled by some of these political statements and advertisements. Trust me, God only made one John McCain, and he is his own man,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His appearance is part of a larger effort by the McCain campaign to attract Democrats and independents, and he addressed them specifically: &quot;Whether you are an independent, a Reagan Democrat, a Clinton Democrat or just a plain old Democrat, this year, when you vote for president, vote for the person you believe is best for the country, not for the party you happen to belong to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lieberman's speech is bound to anger Democrats, a fact that wasn't lost on delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It takes a great man to make a speech like that. He's bound to fact repercussions,&quot; said Ann Adams, a delegate from Mercer Island, Wash. &quot;You have to recognize what a brave person he is and how deeply he feels about John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates were impressed with Mr. Thompson's speech, which they said was more lively than his stumping as a candidate for the Republican ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was lackluster. But this was fantastic,&quot; said Don Brewster, a delegate from Bay City, Mich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those speeches dominated the evening, overshadowing Mr. Bush's nine-minute address via video from the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans reworked the convention schedule after canceling most of Monday's convention session in the face of Hurricane Gustav. But the decision to package Mr. Bush's farewell in a single program with forward-looking praise from Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Thompson threatened to send mixed messages of past and future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush was gracious crediting Mr. McCain with helping to &quot;change history&quot; by standing up for the troop surge in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain is trying to distance himself from Washington and the unpopular Mr. Bush, but the president portrayed his potential successor as someone in his own mold, particularly on national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush said that Mr. McCain learned the same lessons he did about national security from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and that Mr. McCain will embrace the Bush doctrine of pre-emptive attack: &quot;That to protect America, we must stay on the offense, stop attacks before they happen and not wait to be hit again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush praised Mr. McCain for supporting the troop surge in Iraq even when it was unpopular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's not afraid to tell you when he disagrees. Believe me, I know,&quot; he said to laughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In choosing to make a long-distance address via satellite, Mr. Bush further demonstrated that the party is now Mr. McCain's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, speaking by video made the exchange stilted, with Mr. Bush unable to hear the applause in the Xcel Center and at times restarting his remarks in the middle of cheers, having his words drowned out and making the crowd sit down prematurely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he won several giant rounds of applause for praising Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the Hanoi Hilton could not break John McCain's resolve to do what is best for his country, you can be sure the angry left never will,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men have had a rocky relationship in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2000, when Mr. McCain lost the Republican nomination to Mr. Bush, Mr. McCain was angered by some of the Bush team's tactics. But since then, the men have struck an arrangement of convenience, with Mr. McCain campaigning for Mr. Bush in 2004 and a number of Mr. Bush's political operatives going to work for Mr. McCain during this campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's speech was an odd last bow for Mr. Bush. His nine-minute allotment was far shorter than those of outgoing President Clinton in 2000 or outgoing President Reagan in 1988, the last times a retiring president had the chance to address his party's quadrennial gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in both of those cases, the vice president was seeking to succeed his president and was running on his legacy. With Mr. Bush's unpopularity a drag on Republicans, Mr. McCain is running away from the Bush legacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign has said it won't let Mr. McCain disentangle himself from Mr. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, George Bush enthusiastically passed the torch to the man who's earned it by voting with him 90 percent of the time and who will continue this president's legacy for the next four years: his disastrous economic policies, his foreign policy that hasn't made us safer, and his misguided war in Iraq that's costing us $10 billion a month,&quot; said Obama campaign manager David Plouffe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The man George Bush needs may be John McCain, but the change America needs is Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Absent from the proceedings was Vice President Dick Cheney, who had been scheduled to speak Monday along with Mr. Bush, but who left Tuesday for a trip to Georgia and other former Soviet republics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has run on a message of changing Washington, but Mr. Thompson said that if voters are looking for change, Mr. McCain has the proven record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While others were talking reform, John McCain led the effort to make reform happen - always pressing, always moving for what he believed was right and necessary to restore the people's faith in their government,&quot; he said. &quot;Confronting when necessary, reaching across the aisle when possible, John personified why we came to Washington in the first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest of the week's convention schedule is in flux as speakers are reshuffled, apart from a widely anticipated keynote address on Wednesday night by Mr. McCain's choice for running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her pick was aimed at attracting female voters, although that effort is under assault by Democrats who point to mounting questions about her record in Alaska. That, and the fact that the McCain campaign has kept her under wraps since Friday, has heightened the importance of her Wednesday speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a Monday devoid of political shots, the Obama-bashing began in earnest Tuesday, with Sen. Norm Coleman, the Minnesota Republican engaged in a tough re-election battle, quoting a former St. Paul mayor who said, &quot;I'm not indecisive, am I?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That could have been an Obama campaign slogan,&quot; Mr. Coleman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Thompson continued the attack, lampooning Mr. Obama for delivering &quot;a teleprompter speech designed to appeal to America's critics abroad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former senator from Tennessee heaped praise on Mrs. Palin, Mr. McCain's running mate, a hunter who, he said, is &quot;the only nominee in the history of either party who knows how to properly field-dress a moose - with the possible exception of Teddy Roosevelt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's pretty clear the selection of Governor Palin has got the other side and their friends in the media in a state of panic,&quot; he said. &quot;And no wonder - she's a courageous, successful reformer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The night also featured repeated praise for troops and veterans, including Medal of Honor winners and the widow of a serviceman killed in the war on terror. And the speakers repeatedly tied that back to Mr. McCain's own war service and experience as a prisoner of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Thompson delivered an eloquent account of Mr. McCain's painful years as a POW silencing the hall and bringing tears to the eyes of more than a few delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, being a POW certainly doesn't qualify anyone to be president, but it does reveal character,&quot; Mr. Thompson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans also went on the offensive against Mr. Obama on television, announcing an ad linking him to unpopular congressional Democrats. Congress' approval rating stands in the teens, even below that of Mr. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama responded with an ad linking Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush in voters' minds by comparing their stances on tax cuts and Iraq. The ad features a series of pictures of Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush hugging and mugging for cameras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic nominee scrapped his campaign schedule for Tuesday, spending time with his family in Chicago. He planned to return to the trail Wednesday with a town hall meeting and a family barbecue in Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's vice-presidential pick, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., campaigned among Jewish voters in Florida. The ticket is also enjoying some bipartisan support from former Republican Sen. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, who is planning six &quot;Republicans and independents for Obama&quot; events over two days across the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign continued to ask supporters to donate to charities that would help storm victims. The Florida events would also be used to collect donations of canned food and first aid supplies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By JAMES KIRCHICK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A FEW WEEKS ago, news emerged that the co-founder of the Web site Manhunt.net had contributed $2,300 to the presidential campaign of John McCain. Uproar ensued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haven't heard of Manhunt?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless you're a gay man, that's to be expected. It's one of the most popular gay Web sites in the world, with 1 million registered members in the United States alone and 400,000 unique visitors a month. As its name implies, it's a site where many gay men go to find casual sexual encounters. Manhunt and sites like it have revolutionized one formative aspect of gay culture, taking what was once a public activity to the privacy of one's home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except that the Internet, as Jonathan Crutchley recently discovered, isn't really private. A successful real-estate developer, he founded Manhunt with his life partner, Larry Basile, in 2001. He ran into trouble when Out, a gay magazine, published an article about the Web site in its current issue. The article, in passing, referred to Crutchley -- who until last week was chairman of the board at Manhunt -- as a &quot;liberal Republican.&quot; That tidbit apparently shocked gay blogger Andy Towle, who within seconds found Crutchley's donation to McCain on a contributor database and posted the news on his Web site. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shaming and condemnation of Crutchley was swift .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's show MANHUNT what we in the gay community think of members of our community who support politicians who vote against the interests of the community,&quot; read one anonymous comment. &quot;Delete your MANHUNT profile!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michelangelo Signorile, a gay liberal radio host, labeled Crutchley &quot;asinine&quot; simply for supporting McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rarely do you come across a candidate who shares each and every one of your views, and Crutchley's support for McCain wasn't any different from a donor willing to disagree with his politicians. &quot;I believe McCain will be a better commander in chief than Obama, who also opposes gay marriage,&quot; Crutchley wrote on a Web site that covers the online personal ad industry. &quot;If we have an experienced, seasoned person defending the country in this dangerous age, we will be able to argue about the gay agenda later.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That explanation might not please every gay activist, but it is a feeling shared by many gay people. According to exit polls, about 25 percent of gay voters chose George W. Bush in the last two presidential elections (the actual number is likely higher, seeing that many gays do not identify themselves as such to pollsters).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Crutchley is a Republican ought not to come as much of a surprise then, especially considering he's a self-made millionaire. And he's hardly a radical right-winger. &quot;I'm a Massachusetts Republican,&quot; he wrote, &quot;which is about the same as being an Alabama Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just how poisonous Crutchley's politics can be in a gay milieu can be deduced from the speed with which he stepped down as chairman -- at &quot;the request of the board,&quot; according to Basile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hue and cry over Crutchley's politics is all too familiar. Why can't gay activists countenance the idea of a &quot;Massachusetts Republican&quot;? Liberal intolerance. In the minds of too many on the left, gay people (like women and ethnic minorities) have to be liberal and support Democrat s. To do otherwise -- that is, to have opinions on issues (even issues utterly unrelated to gay rights) that don't follow the left-wing line -- is to be a traitor to the gay &quot;community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For too long, many gay-rights activists have acted as if throwing temper tantrums will magically bring about their political agenda. But labeling everyone with whom they don't agree a &quot;bigot&quot; does not help the worthy cause of gay equality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth is that civil rights for gays can't come about without the help of Republicans. And this means that gay people -- and straight supporters of gay equality -- need to stand with, not silence, people who are working to change the GOP from within.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gayness is a sexual orientation, not a political one. Aside from their sexuality, gay people are no different from heterosexuals. There are gay people of all races, income levels, occupations, body types and, yes, political beliefs. Gay liberals are always crowing about the importance of &quot;diversity&quot; and lauding its importance on matters of race and gender. Too bad diversity doesn't count when it comes to politics.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Virginian-Pilot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia Beach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doormat read &quot;beware of dog.&quot; Behind the storm door barked Shakespeare and Bella - two Chihuahuas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Piece of cake,&quot; Myra Jennings, an experienced Democratic canvasser, told her rookie partner, Carolyn Wood, on Monday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lisa Nietling appeared at the door holding a coffee mug as the dogs yapped and scratched at the glass. &quot;We're Republicans,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I usually wait until after the debates to make a decision,&quot; added her husband, Daniel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for keeping an open mind,&quot; Jennings said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor Day has long been considered the traditional start of the election season - a quaint idea now, when presidential campaigns can run two years. Perhaps also quaint, but still considered important despite Web sites and TV ad blitzes, are supporters knocking on doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only people on the campaign that most people meet are us,&quot; said Jennings, 62, a retired middle-school science teacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, Republicans Seamus Owens and John Woolard made a similar journey across the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were among 40 or so Republican supporters, many in their teens or 20s, who met at U.S. Rep. Thelma Drake's campaign office on South Independence Boulevard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats targeted all registered voters. The Republicans analyzed voting records to find high concentrations of &quot;swing voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they vote every year, they're hard-core. You don't have to worry about them,&quot; Owens explained, walking through the Pocahontas Village neighborhood. People who vote less frequently are less likely to vote strictly along party lines, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since March, Republican staffers and volunteers have knocked on 50,000 doors in Virginia Beach, Norfolk and Hampton, and organizers aim for another 20,000 before the Nov. 4 election, said Corry Bliss, Drake's campaign manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Owens knocked on a door hoping to talk to his first voter of the day, a man in a T-shirt opened, spotted a sticker promoting Republican U.S. Senate candidate Jim Gilmore and bellowed, &quot;Gilmore! All right!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man pledged his support for Drake and presumptive presidential nominee Sen. John McCain and, after accepting brochures, wished Owens and Woolard well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was a softball,&quot; Owens conceded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owens, 24, is a paid staffer for Drake's campaign. Woolard, 16, is a First Colonial High School junior who won't be able to vote Nov. 4, but he didn't let that stop him from taking part in his first door-to-door canvass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woolard rang one bell and someone inside shouted, &quot;Someone's at the door!&quot; Seconds passed with no answer. He left a brochure and went next door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, no answer. Another brochure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is par for the course,&quot; Owens said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Woolard said later, pounding the pavement for someone you believe in is worth the effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You actually feel like you're doing something,&quot; he said. &quot;This is how you win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Democrats Jennings and Wood hit the jackpot at their first stop in Lynnhaven Woods, just north of Lynnhaven Mall. Donna Ivins broke from spraying weeds to say her whole family was voting for Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Put your stuff down and come along with us,&quot; Jennings said. &quot;You've made my day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesse Nimmo, another Obama supporter, agreed to post a yard sign but hadn't decided on the Senate or House races - and hadn't heard of Drake's Democratic challenger, Glenn Nye. This got noted on a clipboard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with measuring support and registering voters, canvassers take the concerns and issues they hear on the street from voters on both political sides and pass them up the campaign chain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the street, Sean McLaren said he supported McCain but took time to discuss issues and voting rationales. Jennings told him she appreciated his research - he even had read Obama's book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a citizen, it's my duty,&quot; McLaren said. &quot;You should never vote randomly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the third time this election that his house had been canvassed by Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a good thing,&quot; he said later. &quot;It would influence someone who was on the fence and undecided. I think it's good for democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By now, it's nearly impossible to have missed the fact that Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (Del.), the Democratic vice presidential nominee, is such a homebody and regular guy that he rides Amtrak between Washington and Delaware every day when Congress is in session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Biden isn't just one of the passenger rail system's most famous commuters -- he is also one of its biggest supporters in the Senate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's right up there,&quot; said David Johnson, deputy director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers. &quot;I'd say in the top five [in the Senate] for sure. I can definitely say he's the biggest user.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amtrak is critical to Delaware's economy -- the state is the only one with no commercial air service -- so all three of its members of Congress are strong backers of government funding for rail. Fellow Delaware Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D) actually may play a bigger legislative role than Biden does, because Carper serves on the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Biden certainly has done enough to win the hearts of Amtrak's supporters, even earning a &quot;Champion of the Rails&quot; award from Amtrak's president in 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Biden's voting record is very clear in support of Amtrak,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;Both his votes and his words have backed that up over the years, and we are certainly pleased that he was selected to be the vice presidential candidate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden even has a family connection to Amtrak. His younger son, Hunter, is a lobbyist and the vice chairman of Amtrak's board of directors, having been nominated to a five-year term on the board by President Bush in 2006. (Biden's older son, Beau, is the Delaware attorney general and is viewed by some as a potential successor to his father, should the senator make it to the White House.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Biden is an original co-sponsor of the Amtrak reauthorization bill, known as the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007, versions of which have passed both chambers and are now awaiting a conference committee. He also is a regular signatory to letters calling for increased funding for the rail service, a perennial target for cuts by conservatives and other critics, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amtrak's federal subsidy, which topped $1.3 billion for fiscal 2008, has frequently drawn complaints from budget hawks who argue that the rail system is inefficient and should not continue to operate on little-used routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its fiscal 2009 budget request, the Bush administration proposed what it called &quot;a significant but necessary cut&quot; of more than $500 million from the system's budget. The White House said the suggested reduction &quot;reflects that Amtrak has taken few steps to align its business with the traveling public's demand for intercity rail service and that it consequently continues to hemorrhage taxpayer funds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said an Obama-Biden victory wouldn't necessarily translate into an avalanche of federal funds for Amtrak. He noted that Al Gore was a big booster of passenger rail when he was in Congress &quot;and yet some of the biggest cuts in service came during the Clinton-Gore administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As Jerry Maguire said,  'Show me the money,' &quot; Johnson said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain's campaign has credited enthusiasm about his selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as a running mate for its August fundraising total of more than $47 million -- a record for the senator from Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican presidential candidate has raised $10 million since choosing Palin, according to campaign spokesman Brian Rogers. Palin may have succeeded in reaching a large number of conservative donors who had been sitting out the 2008 campaign because they considered the candidate too soft on core issues, but that won't become clear until McCain releases his finance reports for August to the Federal Election Commission later this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fundraising haul is more than double what McCain had raised over the summer and puts him, for the first time, in the same league as Barack Obama. The Democratic nominee has collected more than $50 million in each of the past two months. An Obama spokesman said Monday that the campaign was not ready to release its August totals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is likely to finish this week with a considerable amount of money still in his primary campaign accounts. Because he will be accepting federal funds for the general election, he won't be able to spend primary funds once he formally accepts his party's nomination. But he is permitted under the law to transfer the remaining money to Republican Party accounts in key battleground states on a flexible timetable, his advisers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means he can, for instance, send that money to state party officials in October, once he knows which states will be most critical to his electoral success. Obama will not have to worry about those bookkeeping measures. He has decided not to take federal matching money, and so he can continue to spend any money he raised during the primary as the campaign pushes ahead.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. PAUL, Minn. -- At least 50 people were arrested at protests outside the Republican National Convention on Monday, police said. Police estimated that between 5,000 and 8,000 people joined a rally to the Xcel Energy Center, where the convention is being held. Police said the main antiwar demonstration was largely peaceful but a separate group of self-described anarchists smashed windows and set a trash bin on fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a splinter group that came here to cause trouble,&quot; said Tom Walsh, a spokesman for the St. Paul police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowds gathered at the Capitol grounds in the morning, as speakers and dancers performed. As the protesters made their way toward the conference center, they waved homemade signs that said such things as &quot;Bush/McCain = McSame&quot; and &quot;GOP -- Government, Oh Please.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of Iraq veterans pushed a coffin, covered in an American flag and Army fatigues, in memory of Lance Cpl. Alexander Arredondo, who was killed in Iraq in 2004. The father of Army Spec. Juan M. Torres carried a photograph of his son, who died in Afghanistan. Jose Rodriguez, a Vietnam War veteran from Houston, said he considered voting for John McCain but could not after eight years of the Bush administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iraq is an unjustified war. Kids are dying for nothing,&quot; he said. &quot;We've got too many old people running things already.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many families said they were enjoying the carnival atmosphere. Suzannah Ciernia said she had come from Northfield, Minn., with her friend Cindy Robinson and was having fun: &quot;We're a couple of moms for peace. My husband is over with the war veterans, and my son is over with the students group.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike and Sue Starr traveled from Anoka, Minn., to protest against Vice President Cheney's role in the war. &quot;He is a five-time deferment and he is sending our son to war. Our son leaves in two weeks for 11 or 12 months,&quot; Mike Starr said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war in Iraq was not the only issue being highlighted. Activists championed same-sex marriage, legalization of marijuana, an end to homelessness and better access to health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maria Morales of Racine, Wis., was coordinating Voces de la Frontera, a group that supports illegal immigrants. &quot;It's exciting -- I hope something comes out of this,&quot; she said. &quot;We need legalization of the 12 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many waved &quot;Obama '08&quot; signs, and &quot;I Back Barack&quot; T-shirts were on sale for $10 each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a strong police presence along the march, with many officers in full riot gear. Some demonstrators complained of strong-arm police tactics throughout the holiday weekend. Doante Davis, 31, traveled up with a group from Louisville and was staying at &quot;Bushville,&quot; a camp set up outside the Asia Supermarket on Western Avenue. He said that police had tried to intimidate the protesters overnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police had nothing better to do,&quot; Davis said. &quot;They made their dogs bark at us and flashed lights in our faces last night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democracy Now&quot; radio host Amy Goodman and two producers were arrested while covering the demonstrations. Goodman was released after being held for over three hours, but last night she was waiting to hear whether Sharif Abdel Kouddous and Nicole Salazar would be released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was down on the convention floor interviewing delegates when I heard that two of our producers had been arrested,&quot; said Goodman. &quot;I ran down to Jackson and Seventh Street, where the police had moved in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nicole told me that as they moved in on three sides, she asked them 'How do I get away from this?' and they jumped on her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goodman said that when she ran up to find out what was going on, she was also arrested: &quot;They seriously manhandled me and handcuffed my hands behind my back. The top ID [at the convention] is to get on the floor, and the Secret Service ripped that off me. I had my 'Democracy Now' ID, too. I was clearly a reporter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --  Holly Watt <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">'I AM HOME NOW' </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">Biden Campaigns In Scranton </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCRANTON, Pa. -- Describing his role in the Obama campaign, Joe Biden said on CBS's &quot;60 Minutes&quot; Sunday night: &quot;The thing I can do is, hopefully, go into Scranton and Wilmington and Sacramento and other places and say, 'I know the guy.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator from Delaware didn't wait long to make good on that promise and laud his running mate in his home town. Biden, who lived in Scranton until his family moved to Wilmington when he was 10, launched his first solo campaign swing by returning to his boyhood home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people say to me, 'What's Barack like -- what's he like, what's the deal, Joe?' &quot; Biden said. &quot;I promise you, my word as a Biden: If Barack grew up in our neighborhood like he did Kansas . . . he would have been our friend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden apparently forgetting that his running mate grew up in Hawaii, continued: &quot;He would cover your back, he would be the guy who meets the standard . . . That's Barack Obama. I promise you, his value set is the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign hopes Biden can help win over the older, non-college-educated white voters in places such as Scranton who overwhelmingly favored Hillary Clinton over Obama in the race for the Democratic nomination. During the long run-up to the Pennsylvania primary, Clinton constantly touted her Scranton roots, noting that her father grew up in the city and that her family often vacationed here when she was a child.  Biden echoed similar themes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an ad that Obama's campaign released on the eve of his visit, his running mate says: &quot;Scranton is a place that never leaves you. It becomes part of your heart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon arriving at 2446 N. Washington Ave., where his family lived during tough financial times in his childhood, Biden yelled &quot;This is my mom!&quot; and hugged 91-year-old Jean Finnegan Biden. Biden's mother lives with him in Wilmington but came to Scranton for the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am home now,&quot; Biden declared to a crowd of people standing in the street waving at him in this middle-class neighborhood, accompanied by his brother Jim, campaign aides, Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr., who also grew up in this neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then walked into the house, now inhabited by Anne Kearns, who has lived there since 1962. Kearns told the group that when she moved into the house, her family found the words &quot;Joe Biden was here&quot; written on the wall of the third-floor bedroom that had been occupied by Biden's great-aunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told the senator she had painted over his message but would be honored if he'd go up and sign his name again. An aide handed him a marker. With it, he wrote: &quot;I am home. Joe Biden. 9.1.08.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If my father were here, he'd smack me,&quot; the candidate said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We won't paint over it this time,&quot; Kearns said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For much of Sunday, Andrew Sullivan (http://andrewsullivan.the atlantic.com) was pumping up one of the most bizarre tinfoil-hat theories to hit the campaign, easily topping the &quot;Barack Obama is secretly a Muslim&quot; chain mails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sullivan picked up and amplified for his more mainstream audience rumors mongered at that journalistic paragon the Daily Kos (http://www.dailykos.com) that Sarah Palin's youngest son, Trig, the Down syndrome baby she didn't abort, really wasn't her son, but her grandson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the theory to which Mr. Sullivan has devoted more than a dozen posts as of Monday afternoon, the governor faked her own pregnancy to cover up the pregnancy of daughter Bristol Palin, and Trig is actually Bristol's son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photos from this spring in which Mrs. Palin is rather obviously in her seventh and eighth months quickly surfaced Sunday night and the rumors never had any serious basis beyond some semi-understood gynecology surrounding the word &quot;leakage&quot; and a picture of Bristol Palin wearing an engagement ring. (If &quot;they&quot; could cover up a pregnancy, could such a devious and powerful &quot;they&quot; have her wearing such a thing in public?) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sullivan quickly Monday tried to make the issue the vetting by John McCain's campaign, saying the Republican candidate had to offer rebuttal and saying that rumors need to be answered publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative blogger Ace of Spades (http://ace.mu.nu) - among many, many others - went absolutely ballistic, and sent an e-mail to &quot;a bunch of the heavy hitters in the right-leaning respectable blogosphere to suggest a full boycott of linking Sullivan, forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Large parts of his diatribe are unprintable, but make reference to an episode involving Mr. Sullivan's gay Internet cruising and how he &quot;screamed bloody murder when his own privacy was invaded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a limit, and ... now he's way beyond it He is not a serious commentator; he is a vicious bridge-troll of a propagandist, a nasty little rotten-hearted [epithet] who gets his jollies assailing a sixteen year old girl because her mom threatens&quot; the Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan II</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Sullivan considered Sarah Palin just plain weird, even before he began spreading groundless rumors about Trig Palin's parentage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less vile, but no less absurd, was his disseminating a false theory about the names of the Palin children, printing the following correspondence with the approving intro that &quot;a reader plumbs the weirdness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; 'Willow' was Buffy the Vampire Slayer's best friend and 'Piper' was the eldest sister on the series Charmed played by Shannen Doherty. The governor obviously has a penchant for television shows of paranormal female empowerment. (I know, it's too gay that I know this.)&quot; After six degrees of Internet repetition, this became, in an Alan Wolfe article in the New Republic (http://www.tnr.com), the claim became Mrs. Palin &quot;named two of her children after witches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groundless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Alas, one problem for this theory is the timing: Buffy the Vampire Slayer didn't start airing until 1997, whereas Sarah Palin's daughter Willow is described as being 14 years old. I don't know whether she turned 14 this year or will turn 15 later this year, but I'm pretty sure that 2008 minus 14 equals something before 1997. Otherwise, that's a great theory,&quot; dryly observed Stuart Buck of the Buck Stops Here (http://stuart buck.blogspot.com).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fact-checking being too much for Andrew Sullivan and the New Republic, we turn to the hard-bitten and hard-boiled cynics at People magazine (http://www.people.com).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sarah's parents were coaches and the whole family was involved in track and I was an athlete in high school, so with our first-born, I was, like, 'Track!' Bristol is named after Bristol Bay. That's where I grew up, that's where we commercial fish. Willow is a community there in Alaska. And then Piper, you know, there's just not too many Pipers out there and it's a cool name. And Trig is a Norse name for 'strength,' &quot; second-gentleman hopeful Todd Palin told the magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dead-enders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tinfoil-hate brigade in the fever swamps of the liberal blogosphere isn't giving up the &quot;Sarah Palin faked her pregnancy&quot; lie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours of the pictures of an obviously pregnant Mrs. Palin showing up, there was no backing down among the commenters and diarists at Daily Kos (http://www.dailykos.com) and Democratic Underground (http://www.democratic underground.com), even though Kos himself, Markos Moulitsas, and other site leaders said the rumors were unfounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a comment by prius04 at Daily Kos, which won 5 &quot;thumbs up&quot; and no &quot;thumbs down&quot; grades: &quot;I would suggest that maybe Karl Rove himself started this story. By getting everyone in a tizzy over the grandmother angle he gets us all to stew over it for a few days. Then proof that the Gov is the mother surfaces and we all have black eyes. This also damages DailyKos and other reality based sites.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others speculated that Daily Kos specifically was set up and wanted an investigation of the Kos Diary item that started the whole affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a post now apparently removed from Democratic Underground, but preserved for posterity at Atlas Shrugs (http://atlas shrugs2000.typepad.com) and Ace of Spades (http://ace.mu.nu) the morals of some in the netroots are made explicit. This is from NoodleyAppendage, who had posted more than 1,000 times there and frequently lapses into all-capital letters:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;122. What many here don't understand. It doesn't matter if it's true or not. Rumor is truth. The modern laws of media hype and political warfare have a useful tenet: Repeat anything or raise false concern over anything and it is likely to be planted in the conscious/subconscious of many voters. If people start to think that there might be something fishy with Palin's last kid (if hers), then that's fine. One more doubt (whether tied to reality or not) is another hesitation at the ballot box. Get with the program people. The 'rising above it' [expletive] has served us so well in the past, hasn't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congratulations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the American Scene blog (http://theamericanscene.com), contributor Reihan Salam tells liberals what a wonderful job they are doing handling the Sarah Palin pick as, in the title of his post, &quot;Beyond the Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attention all those who want to defeat McCain-Palin: please ridicule Sarah Palin. Five kids with silly white trash names! She was the mayor of a small town! Ha! I mean, look at her - she must be dumb! And where did she go to school? I mean, come on! I mean, is McCain serious? What a joke. Her mere existence is an insult to women. She eats moose, she rides a snowmobile, and she supports drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Serious people, incidentally, don't support drilling: serious people support clean-coal-powered automobiles built by un-outsourcable American workers, each of which will be available at subsidized prices to all Americans. I mean, everybody knows that. Come on.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 6.4 percent (4,980 workers) unemployment in the New River Valley, one would think that the Montgomery County Board of Supervisors would be willing to pay $1 million to have the inland port built in Elliston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, those short-sighted and narrow-minded elected officials are willing to pay the city of Salem $1 million to take it off their hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't those officials realize that this will bring jobs to their depressed area and commercial real estate tax money into the local treasury?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you want to see what the inland port will contribute drive up to Front Royal (Exit 6N off I-66) and view their facility. It is beautiful and adds lots to the area. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where are the citizens of Montgomery County who oppose this decision? Is Billy Joe Duncan the only taxpayer in Montgomery County willing to stand up and express his sentiments to the board of supervisors?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are opposed to the board's viewpoint you should contact the supervisors immediately and let them know how you feel. Could it be that a large landowner in the Shawsville/Elliston area is a silent force in the board's decision to oppose growth for our area?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Obama really going to be good for America or is he going to be good for his race?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's go back to 9/11, a tragic source of events for America. For once in my lifetime, it didn't happen to black or white people. It happened to all Americans and the whole America banded together. That's what we need for us to really coexist. That's a shame. Everything we work for is in vain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Warner represented Virginia well Tuesday night in his thoughtful and intelligent call for attention to the middle class and working people of this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last eight years have been a plunge into the abyss of runaway spending on an unpopular war, destruction of our economy and a widening gap between rich and poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is heartening that we finally have positive choices like Barack Obama, and Warner and a governor like Tim Kaine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locally, a creative Roanoke businessman, Sam Rasoul, is working hard to create jobs and a turn around in the energy crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope that Virginia voters take the time to check out the substantive plans of these candidates and refuse to be distracted by negative campaign ads and editorials that deluge us with hate speech and division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's time we got some intelligence, caring and hope back into Virginia. Your vote really counts this time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am a life member of the National Education Association, have been a local association president and have been on numerous education association committees over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I thought I was used to mailings that did not reflect my views, but recently the NEA has gone well over the edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I refer to several NEA flyers sent that support Senator Barack Obama for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I cannot and do not support Obama because of both his lack of foreign policy experience and his views on economic and social issues, especially on abortion. The flyers held highly distorted information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I once was proud of my NEA membership. It was a true professional organization. We held ourselves superior to the then teachers union, and it is ironic that some of those old leaders of the American Federation of Teachers are now unhappy with the NEA's political stance and are supporting Sen. John McCain for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I intend to work as hard for the election of McCain as I once did for NEA. I have also talked with many other teachers who are thoroughly in agreement that the NEA no longer speaks for us. Not when it comes to selecting a president.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Obama needs more than a 'D' by his name,&quot; Aug. 24 letter: Time in service is not the only criteria of leadership. Thought and work are the two most important factors as they accelerate experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time in service (experience) can mold after it ceases to be productive, like bread that sweetens before molding; thus we find Sen. John McCain, sweet and moldy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some maintain the importance of age and experience as the only criteria of presidential leadership. Although President Bush is currently the most experienced man for the office (eight years), thought and work are rarely evident. Here we see a president with a 28 percent approval rating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Check McCain's biography and compare it to Barack Obama's to find a vast difference between the two regarding concerns, thought and work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then compare McCain with Bush. You may be afraid to find so many similarities. Obama is the man with the right type of experience, energy, judgment and unflawed character. He is the candidate of our time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We salute McCain for his past services, but we need to elect Obama for his ability to serve us now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Roanoke Times reported Aug. 19, that several college presidents were calling for state lawmakers to lower the drinking age to 18 years old (&quot;Lower drinking age is on the table,&quot; front page). What are they thinking?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can speak from personal experience that most people that age drink for the most part for one reason: to get drunk. If they cannot get alcohol, they find anyone older who would be willing to buy it for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means you will have 18 year olds buying for those even younger. If they would listen to the psychology classes they teach in their own colleges, they have already proved that young adults even in their late teens have brains that have not matured to the point that they can make good decisions at critical times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I feel the colleges want to lower the age to pull the monkey off their backs of trying to police underage drinking on and around campuses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In congruence with the Aug. 24 commentary, &quot;Big oil drums up support,&quot; offshore drilling is not the solution to high gas prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Congress approaches its next session, energy costs are a high priority. We need congressmen like Rep. Rick Boucher to support real energy solutions from clean, homegrown energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America sends more than $700 billion overseas every year, allowing hostile nations to threaten our national security. These dirty fossil fuels contribute to global warming as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American innovation is the solution, in building cars that get 100 mpg or more, expanding public transportation, more efficient buildings and harnessing renewable energies like wind and solar power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Offshore drilling puts our beaches and our last wild places at risk. It will do nothing to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush administration's Energy Information Administration agrees that offshore drilling will have &quot;no significant&quot; impact on gasoline prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new energy future with clean renewable energy sources, plug-in hybrid cars, and more efficient buildings will cut energy bills and global warming pollution. We urge Boucher to support real energy independence solutions and to reject drilling proposals that would only increase our destructive dependence on oil.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one understands peace and appreciates democracy more than someone who has fought for them. Sen. John McCain did that, and he will do what must be done in the future to ensure everyone has the opportunity to enjoy them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he led the fight for the surge in Iraq -- a politically risky move at the time -- Sen. Barack Obama argued for withdrawal, actions that would have denied the Iraqi people a chance for a lasting peace and a democratic form of government. Indeed, the surge proved to be the correct strategy: The number of casualties is at its lowest since the war began. And yet Sen. Obama still refuses to concede that his call for retreat was wrong. Sen. McCain, meanwhile, has been vindicated. His leadership, judgment and foresight on this issue were prescient.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton has been an angel all through her defeat and now at the Democratic Convention. This shows her sportsmanship, right? No. She sees Obama as most of us do -- an inexperienced, unknown and radically liberal candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Obama at the helm, along with a Democrat Congress, this country will experience excruciating changes, socially and economically. Hillary knows this. She has written off this election, as she knows 2012 is hers for the taking; we will be so sick of Obama that she will be a shoo-in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain may not be the best choice for our country, but he sure beats the alternative. If America votes in Obama, I just hope there is enough left in 2012 to salvage.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently a local TV station is airing a political ad about Barack Obama's connection to Bill Ayers and the Weather Underground. This ad is sponsored by the American Issues Project, a nonprofit organization (read Swift Boat attack). Barack Obama was eight years old when Ayers and the Weathermen were active, and any attempt to connect him to events of almost 40 years ago is absurd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayers is now a professor at the University of Illinois in Chicago, where I am sure he was vetted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and Obama served on the board of a Chicago antipoverty charity. This &quot;guilt by association&quot; is McCarthyism at its worst, and one wonders why a TV station, which professes to having high standards, would run such trash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If people want to know what's what, go to FactCheck.org. Or call the local TV station and complain. Or do both. Maybe then we can get rid of this scurrilous type of political assassination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hurricane Gustav has spared Republicans one potential problem -- President Bush and Vice President Cheney are skipping tonight's first session of the Republican National Convention to remain on hurricane watch in Washington. Tying Bush, Cheney and their dreadful approval ratings around the neck of this year's Republican ticket has been the Democrats' dream all year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the president's decision to stay away from St. Paul this week won't solve John McCain's Bush problem. During their convention in Denver, the Democrats made perfectly clear their intention to run against &quot;McSame&quot; and &quot;George W. Bush's third term.&quot; Republicans in St. Paul can't hide the fact that they are picking the person they hope will be Bush's successor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wait -- isn't McCain different from Bush? Tim Russert, the late moderator of NBC's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; asked McCain precisely that question three years ago. &quot;No,&quot; McCain replied firmly, &quot;no.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He elaborated: &quot;The fact is that I have agreed with President Bush far more than I have disagreed. And on the transcendent issues, the most important issues of our day, I've been totally in agreement and support of President Bush. . . . My support for President Bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the American people. And I'm particularly talking about the war on terror, the war in Iraq, national security, national defense, support of men and women in the military, fiscal discipline, a number of other issues. So I strongly disagree with any assertion that I've been more at odds with the president of the United States than I have been in agreement with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In politics, timing is often telling. When McCain gave this account of his political intimacy with the president in June 2005, nearly half the electorate approved of the Bush presidency, and only a quarter disapproved.  Perhaps more relevant to McCain at the time, 84 percent of Republicans in a Washington Post-ABC News poll still held a favorable view of Bush.  McCain was thinking hard about running for president. In the months that followed, he decided to run and decided initially at least to run as the heir to Bush, hoping to win the support of the Republican establishment still loyal to the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was but one of many complicated moments in the McCain-Bush relationship since they ran against each other for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. Then, McCain told friendly colleagues in the Senate that he thought Bush was a &quot;lightweight,&quot; an opinion that did not improve during the campaign. McCain lost his famous temper in South Carolina, where the Bush campaign and its allies derailed his upstart challenge, using aggressive tactics, including the spreading of false rumors about McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peace of a kind was made in a Pittsburgh hotel room in May 2000. McCain and Bush held a 90-minute meeting to bury the hatchet, both reading from  scripts. Bush raised the subject of the vice presidency, but McCain said he wasn't interested. They had an awkward conversation. Afterward they gave a joint  news conference in which McCain endorsed Bush. But no affection developed -- quite the contrary. Connie Bruck of the New Yorker quoted the McCains' good friends and Arizona neighbors, Sharon and Oliver Harper, recounting an August visit by Laura and George Bush to the McCain ranch. The Harpers said the McCains pleaded with them to change their own vacation plans to be with the McCains when this visit occurred. &quot;John and Cindy said, '. . . We don't want to be left alone with them, this is going to be really difficult,' &quot; Sharon Harper told Bruck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But soon afterward (you may want to fasten your seat belt here), McCain was passing word to the Bush camp that he was willing to be the vice presidential candidate. Dick Cheney got the nod instead. McCain then spoke warmly of Bush from the podium of the 2000 GOP convention in Philadelphia: &quot;If you believe patriotism is more than a sound bite and public service should be more than a photo op, then vote for Governor Bush,&quot; McCain said. &quot;He wants to give you back a government that serves all the people no matter the circumstances of their birth. And he wants to lead a Republican Party that is as big as the country we serve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after the 2000 election, though, McCain told guests at a Los Angeles dinner party hosted by actress Candice Bergen that he had not voted for Bush  -- according to  Arianna Huffington, the liberal blogger and a guest at the party. McCain's aides sharply denied this. Then two other dinner guests, actors Bradley Whitford and Richard Schiff, said they heard McCain say the same thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in Washington after Bush took office, McCain flirted with crossing the aisle of the Senate to vote with the Democrats and give them a majority, an idea that died when Sen.  James Jeffords of Vermont did just that. McCain then established himself as an independent voice who opposed the new Bush administration on a series of high-profile issues, including stem cell research (which  McCain favored), tax cuts (McCain opposed them), a constitutional amendment banning  same-sex marriage (McCain against) and campaign finance reform (McCain favored it).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Democrats nominated his friend John Kerry as their 2004 standard bearer, McCain seriously considered Kerry's suggestion that he join the ticket as the candidate for a kind of super vice presidency. McCain decided against it. McCain did, however, defend Kerry repeatedly against  Swift boat charges that he had misrepresented his Vietnam War record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karl Rove, Bush's political operator, then put out peace feelers to McCain. A new understanding was reached. McCain again agreed to support Bush in a convention speech, in New York in August 2004. &quot;I salute his  determination to make this world a better, safer, freer place,&quot; McCain said. &quot;He has not wavered. He has not flinched from the hard choices. He will not yield. And neither will we.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the subsequent campaign, McCain traveled with Bush and spoke on his behalf repeatedly. &quot;His support was critical,&quot; Sen.  Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), McCain's close ally, said later to Bruck of the New Yorker. In March 2005, McCain joined Bush on one of his early trips around the country promoting the partial privatization of Social Security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after that, McCain was defending his closeness to Bush in that appearance on &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; The film clip of this McCain testimonial to our unpopular leader has not yet appeared in a commercial for Sen. Barack Obama, McCain's Democratic rival, although the segment has been available on YouTube for months. Perhaps the Obama campaign is saving it for later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain camp says tying their man to Bush is unfair. Despite the back-and-forth -- and back-and-forth and back-and-forth -- relationship between the two men over the past decade, McCain seems to be ready to distance himself from Bush yet again. Graham signaled as much in an interview last week, quipping that &quot;it would be news to Bush&quot; to be told that he and McCain were politically close. Be that as it may, John McCain does have a George W. Bush problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">History helps explain why. Robert G. Beckel, who managed Walter F. Mondale's thoroughly unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1984 and is now a Fox News commentator, summarized the record: Since 1960, candidates running on the ticket of the party that is completing two terms in the White House, hoping to win a third, usually lose. Richard M. Nixon in 1960, Hubert Humphrey in 1968, Gerald Ford in 1976 and Al Gore in 2000 are the cases in point. Only George H.W. Bush defied this rule in 1988, in the midst of an economic boom, &quot;but nobody has ever been elected to a third term for the same party in bad economic times,&quot; Beckel noted. &quot;No one's ever been elected to a third term when you have an unpopular war. And most importantly, no one has been elected to a third term with an unpopular incumbent president. . . . Yet McCain has all three of those problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political scientists who try to reduce election prognostication to mathematical formulas agree that thanks largely to Bush, McCain's situation is grim. One is Alan Abramowitz of Emory University, who uses a complex mathematical formula based on the sitting president's approval rating on July 1 of the election year, the economic growth rate in the second quarter of that year and a &quot;time for a change&quot; factor based on the number of terms the incumbent party has held the White House. This year, Abramowitz's formula -- which has predicted the winner of the popular vote correctly in every election since 1988 -- says Obama will win easily in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So is McCain fated to lose? &quot;As a nation we're due to break those precedents,&quot; Graham says. &quot;Yes, the dynamics of this race are very much tilted toward the Democratic Party,&quot; partly because the country is eager for change, Graham said in an interview last week, but McCain offers change, too. &quot;With John you can have the best of both worlds. You can have change -- John McCain has a long record of doing things that are nontraditional -- but you can have change that is safe and secure. . . . We have a good story to tell, that the next four years will be different and better than the last four. . . . The direction that we'll take the country in is going to be different than Bush and better than Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By sheer, dumb luck,&quot; observes Dan Schnur, director of communications in McCain's 2000 presidential campaign and now director of the Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California, &quot;we [Republicans] ended up nominating the only candidate in the entire field who actually has a chance of winning the general election.&quot; How good a chance? &quot;It's an uphill fight,&quot; Schnur replied, &quot;if only because he's carrying so much baggage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George W. Bush may have packed that baggage, but polls indicate that McCain really is carrying it. The latest Washington Post-ABC News Poll taken in mid-August asked voters if they thought a President McCain would &quot;mainly lead the country in a new direction, or mainly continue in George W. Bush's direction?&quot; Fifty-seven percent said they expect McCain to follow the Bush line, including 57 percent of independents. Within that group, more than 70 percent said they planned to vote for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush's approval rating -- 30 percent -- hasn't budged for months. And as speakers in Denver repeatedly noted, McCain  sided with Bush on 90 percent of the votes taken in the Senate since 2001. Yet he also defied the president on such high-profile issues  as stem cell research, treatment of prisoners and  same-sex marriage. That happened often enough, said Steve Bell, longtime political aide to Sen. Pete Domenici (N.M.), that many in the conservative base will never be entirely comfortable with McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is hardly the only Republican with a Bush-induced problem this year. The party's political gurus all fear their brand has been tarnished. The chairman of the  National Republican Congressional Committee, Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, has advised his candidates for election this fall to stay away from St. Paul -- better to stay home and campaign this week than be associated with the national party and its tribulations. Nine of the Republican senators  seeking reelection have announced their intention to stay home during  the convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush's scheduled moment in St. Paul tonight was canceled by Hurricane Gustav, and it's hard to find a Republican who thinks McCain will even mention him during the fall campaign. Optimists think, or hope, that because of his reputation as a maverick, McCain can ignore Bush while offering something new. &quot;There's a general belief that John McCain is his own man,&quot; Graham says. &quot;That's the only reason that we're 12 points ahead of the party in the polls.&quot; He was describing the gap between generic Republican support and McCain's higher numbers, measured in one recent Quinnipiac University poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Bush, says Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker, would probably encourage his on-again, off-again ally McCain to ignore the incumbent president during this campaign. &quot;Bush is a reasonably good politician. He understands that given his current situation, the best thing is for McCain to be a unique personality.&quot; The best outcome for McCain, Gingrich says, is for Obama to become &quot;so big&quot; that he, not Bush or McCain, becomes the biggest issue of the campaign.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you've traveled overseas in the past few years and watched CNN International in your hotel room or at an airport, you must have seen the commercial promoting travel to Croatia that runs several times a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, newly independent Montenegro, another part of former Yugoslavia, has been showing off its tourist attractions on the air. It's only natural for small countries to do that, but even Germany has promoted its tourism on National Public Radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When was the last time you saw or heard an ad campaign aimed at foreign visitors to the United States? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many years, both government and travel industry officials assumed that Brand USA was a sufficient incentive for millions of foreigners to flock to the new world and spend even more millions of dollars here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were right for the most part - until Sept. 11, 2001. Even though the number of overseas arrivals, as recorded by the Department of Commerce, has been growing since that deep plunge seven years ago, it has yet to reach pre-Sept. 11 levels. Last year, the number was lower by 2 million compared with that in 2000, which at about 26 million was the highest on record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difficulties of obtaining a U.S. entry visa abroad have been widely documented, and there have been many examples of travelers who don't need a visa being turned back by immigration officers at the airport for various reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the perception that the United States has become an unwelcoming place, the declining reputation of U.S. airlines is not helping American tourism, either. The most common reason among foreign passengers for ridiculing those carriers has long been their &quot;old&quot; flight attendants. They have a few more reasons now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest of the recent &quot;cost-cutting measures&quot; announced by the major U.S. carriers, such as baggage fees and the end of free soft drinks and pillows onboard, was United Airlines' decision to stop offering meals in economy class on flights between the East Coast and Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being the only airline in the world to keep passengers hungry for up to nine hours on intercontinental flights is hardly expected to attract more foreign customers. As the thousands of comments in online forums have shown, it has less to do with having to pay $9 for a salad or a chicken wrap and more with the perception of being cheap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One industry group, the Travel Industry Association (TIA), is so worried about the state of travel in the United States that it has called on the two main presidential candidates, Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain, &quot;to detail their plans for improving the domestic and international travel process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Travel is vital to the American economy,&quot; said Roger Dow, TIA's president and chief executive officer. &quot;Today's deteriorating air travel system, skyrocketing fuel prices and poorly communicated security policies are deterring domestic and international inbound travel and costing the U.S. economy billions of dollars. It is time for presidential leadership on these critical issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one can tell for sure when the U.S. travel experience will improve. But perhaps it's time for a major advertising and marketing campaign overseas, in which government and the industry can work together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Commerce's Office of Travel and Tourism Industries says on its Web site that its mission is &quot;expanding travel and tourism business opportunities for employment and economic growth&quot; and &quot;development and management of tourism policy, strategy and advocacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In practice, the office is occupied mostly with generating statistics. With the current state of the economy, there are probably more important problems for the federal government to fix, but tourism is a lifeline for states such as Florida and Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weak dollar has provided a good opportunity to attract more foreigners. Yet fewer than 24 million overseas visitors came to the United States last year. In the same period, more than 31 million Americans traveled overseas, despite their currency's weakness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political strategist Karl Rove, freed of his White House role, is encouraging major Republican donors to give their money to organizations that operate independently of the Republican Party and are poised to spend upwards of $100 million trying to elect conservatives this fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rove, the architect of President Bush's election victories, has been telling Republican benefactors across the country that giving to official Republican Party fundraising committees will not be enough this year, according to people familiar with his pitch over the past few months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said Mr. Rove has regularly expressed concern that Democrat-leaning organizations such as MoveOn.org and labor unions could swamp the Republican Party's money machine and overwhelm the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To counter that wave, Mr. Rove has been asking elite Republican fundraisers to pour their millions of dollars into nonparty groups like Freedom's Watch, which is gearing up to spend tens of millions of dollars to help elect conservatives - primarily Republicans - to Congress and the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom's Watch has purchased advertisements that help Republican candidates by emphasizing issues rather than the candidates and do so without coordinating with the Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent groups such as Freedom's Watch on the right and MoveOn.org Political Action on the left will fuel much of the on-air and on-the-ground skirmishing this fall between Democratic and Republican candidates. Well-heeled donors often prefer using these organizations as conduits for their contributions because they often can remain anonymous and because the groups' expenditures are not disclosed until after they are made, if at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rove declined to comment about his discussions with Republican fundraisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his spokesman, Mark Corallo, acknowledged that Mr. Rove, when asked, has encouraged people to fill the coffers of groups that in effect act as adjuncts to the Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message, Mr. Corallo said, was: &quot;Conservatives, when interested, ought to contribute generously to groups that advocate their goals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rove has pushed Freedom's Watch in particular, said several people who have heard him make the case. He has told donors that he trusts the two longtime Republican operatives running the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One is Executive Vice President Carl Forti, who is the former political director of the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney and the former communications director of the National Republican Congressional Committee. The other is Executive Vice President Tony Feather, who was political director for Mr. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign and is a founding partner in FLS-DCI, a consulting firm for corporations and political candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rove is not paid by Freedom's Watch, but nonetheless has spoken highly of its efforts when asked by Republican moneymen where they should put their contributions this fall, said people close to the former White House strategist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result has been an uptick in contributions to Freedom's Watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has raised our profile, and his confidence in the operation has helped legitimize it in the minds of potential donors,&quot; a Freedom's Watch official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group spent $17 million last year, according to its latest public disclosure, and has spent about $20 million in total, a spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom's Watch has begun to concern some Democrats, with its large bankroll and plan to play in multiple markets with hard-hitting attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, chairman of the House Democrats' fundraising committee, accused Republicans of having &quot;essentially contracted out to Freedom's Watch&quot; to do their fundraising and attack ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are these shadowy groups out there who can spend an unlimited amount of unaccountable money,&quot; Mr. Van Hollen said Thursday in an interview with The Washington Times. &quot;That is what 'Freedom's Watch' is geared up to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rove also has recommended that donors with strong pro-life positions on abortion give money to the National Right to Life Committee. The committee declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have been at a disadvantage on the money front through much of this election cycle. Democratic candidates for president, the House and the Senate have outraised their Republican counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic re-election committee in the House has raised $109 million, $29 million more than the Republican committee. In the Senate, the Democratic committee has collected $93 million compared with $59 million by its Republican counterpart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only at the national committee level do Republicans top Democrats. The Republican National Committee has raised $457 million compared with $417 million by the Democratic National Committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama is so confident that the trend will continue and that he will bring in large amounts of money that he has declined to take public funding for his general election bid. Mr. McCain, on the other hand, will accept and stick to the $84 million that the federal government is offering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's supporters expect that he will raise and spend much more than $84 million this fall. His own funds will be supplemented by several efforts that will total hundreds of millions of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the AFL-CIO has approved a political budget of $53 million and its affiliated unions are expected to spend an additional $200 million on political activities. The National Education Association probably will spend more than $40 million and the Service Employees International Union has designated $100 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MoveOn.org also will spend substantial sums, conservatively estimated at more than $30 million. Last week its political arm launched a $2.5 million fundraising effort to bankroll a drive to register 500,000 voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major corporations also will spend tens of millions of dollars to counter labor unions, especially over the question of secret ballots in union certification elections. Companies are worried that if secret ballots are eliminated, their workers will be unionized with greater ease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent groups often do not advocate the election of specific candidates, but buy commercials or send out fliers that support policy positions. The effect of the effort is often the same because candidates are named in the advertisements and are closely associated with the issues mentioned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Buckeye State voters are looking for evidence their state is the perennial battleground, all they need to do is turn on the TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the span of 10 minutes, voters will hear that Sen. Barack Obama is a &quot;celebrity&quot; who would raise taxes and that Sen. John McCain is so out of touch he doesn't know how many homes he owns, along with several more negative ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think we've had any downtime from ads since before the primary,&quot; said Kristina Schwarzkopf, a Toledo political coordinator for a teachers union. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic candidates flooded the airwaves with ads starting in February for the March 4 primary, and Mr. McCain has deployed TV resources here ever since, as both camps say Ohio is in play this fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush narrowly won the state in 2004, which secured his re-election, and both parties say it's a key indicator of how the Nov. 4 election turns out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So can Mr. Obama, who lost the state's primary by 9 percentage points to Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, turn things around and win here?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Posed the question, Toledo writer Doug Crill pulled out a quarter and flipped it: Tails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure if he can win. It all depends on how bad the housing crisis gets,&quot; Mr. Crill, an Obama supporter, said before the Democrat held a small town-hall forum in a roof garden above a public library.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the candidate that is most credible on how to lure businesses to the troubled region will succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mr. Obama and his running mate, Sen Joseph R. Biden Jr., focused on the economy when speaking with a few hundred voters here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's not listening to you, apparently,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;If he was, he wouldn't be saying that our economy has been making great progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continuing another common line of attack, the Illinois senator told the voters, &quot;John McCain says the economy is fundamentally strong. He hasn't been talking to the people here in Toledo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The audience, invited by the campaign for the small gathering, nodded along and some shouted, &quot;That's right!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. McCain did say the economy fundamentals are &quot;strong,&quot; Mr. Obama does not cite the full context of the quote from the April television interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona Republican said during the Bloomberg interview that the job-creation figures allow one to argue &quot;there's been great progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But that's ... no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges,&quot; he said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the McCain recognition of struggling Americans, Mr. Obama said his rival is &quot;out of touch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't understand what people are going through, day in and day out,&quot; Mr. Obama accused. &quot;We do get it, we know what you're going through, and we want to have a White House that is fighting for you every single day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's opponents, meanwhile, attack him as lacking specifics. He does offer specifics, such as ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and college funding for people who contribute national service, but often those don't make the evening news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local NBC affiliate broadcasting in Marysville, Ohio, covered the Obama rally from the evening before, but didn't outline any of the substance of the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the report showed the large crowd - at least 18,000 - and offered two clips of Mr. Obama speaking. In one, he was doing an Ohio chant and got laughs. In another, he was asking for a paramedic since one person had fainted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his town hall here, Mr. Obama warned voters not to believe &quot;these ads the Republicans are putting up,&quot; referring to a McCain&nbsp;ad citing a newspaper editorial that labeled his economic plan a &quot;disaster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it is a distortion, and that his plan would offer three times more relief for &quot;ordinary&quot; Americans than Mr. McCain's. The tax breaks would go to &quot;not the wealthiest Americans, not Fortune 500 companies, but to you,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Schwarzkopf, who served as an alternate delegate at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, said she thinks Mr. Obama can win Ohio if he lays out &quot;honest&quot; plans for the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, you have to raise taxes,&quot; she said. &quot;He should be real and honest, because people know it won't be easy, and when he makes it to the White House, he may not be able to do everything he's promised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Biden told voters that Mr. McCain's tax plan &quot;leaves out 100 million families without a single red cent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One voter asked the Democratic ticket if they can win Ohio, given Sen. John Kerry's loss to Mr. Bush in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People &quot;see the reality of what's happening to them,&quot; when it comes to the economy, Mr. Biden said. &quot;I think it's going to be a different year because we've got a different guy as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said it is a &quot;clear choice&quot; this time around and said of voters, &quot;If they're happy with the way things have been going, they can afford to stay home or go vote for John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Virginian-Pilot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's another sign that Virginia is a key battleground in the 2008 presidential campaign: The state's television viewers have front-row seats for what's shaping up to be this year's &quot;swift boat&quot; ad controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Swift-boating&quot; became a verb in the national political lexicon in 2004 when a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ran a disputed TV ad campaign attacking Sen. John Kerry's war record as a swift-boat commander during the Vietnam War. The ads were widely perceived to be a factor in the Democratic presidential nominee's defeat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now a new group called the American Issues Project is airing a TV ad linking this year's Democratic candidate, Sen. Barack Obama, to William Ayers, a member of the 1960s radical group Weather Underground that carried out bombings of public buildings, including the U.S. Capitol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group is running the Ayers ad in several states, including Virginia. It spent $160,000 airing it in the Hampton Roads market last week as the Democratic National Convention was being held in Denver, according to records kept by local television stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the campaign of Republican candidate Sen. John McCain placed orders late last week for TV spots to run during the GOP convention in Minnesota this week, pushing total spending on presidential campaign-related spots in the local market past $1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That volume of advertising before Labor Day, the traditional campaign kickoff time, is unprecedented, said Cindi Dove, general sales manager at local CBS affiliate WTKR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Normally we haven't seen this kind of activity in a presidential election this early,&quot; Dove said. &quot;In past years, we probably wouldn't have seen anything until late September or October.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sole funder of the $2.9 million American Issues Project ad campaign is Texas billionaire Harold Simmons, who was a principal backer of the swift-boat campaign in 2004. Simmons also is a fundraiser for McCain. One of the two board members of the American Issues Project, Ed Failor Jr., is a former paid consultant for the McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad opens with a reference to one of the planes involved in the 2001 terrorist attacks and, in the next sentence, segues into the Ayers case. &quot;United 93 never hit the Capitol on 9/11,&quot; the narrator says. &quot;But the Capitol was bombed 30 years before by an American terrorist group called Weather Underground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the spot, the narrator asks, &quot;Why would Barack Obama be friends with someone who bombed the Capitol?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one was hurt in the Capitol bombing. Ayers was never prosecuted for that or any of the other Weather Underground bombings. Charges against him were dropped because of prosecutorial misconduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now a college professor in Chicago, Ayers held a meet-the-candidate event for Obama at his home when Obama first ran for state office in the mid-1990s. He and Obama have served together on the boards of two Chicago nonprofit groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, some analysts said Kerry didn't respond forcefully enough to the swift-boat attack ad. The Obama campaign, in contrast, has come back swinging, producing an immediate response ad that also has been airing in Hampton Roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That ad opens with a picture of a foreclosure sign in front of a house. &quot;With all our problems,&quot; the narrator says, &quot;why is John McCain talking about the '60s, trying to link Barack Obama to radical Bill Ayers? McCain knows Obama denounced Ayers' crimes, committed when Obama was just 8 years old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's lawyers also have launched a legal challenge, alleging that the Ayers ad violates federal law. The American Issues Project is organized as a nonprofit &quot;social welfare&quot; group that is not allowed to engage in political activity as its primary purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's spokesman did not return phone calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail Gitcho, a McCain spokeswoman, declined to comment on the Ayers ad except to say, &quot;We had nothing to do with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has spent $670,000 on TV ads in Hampton Roads since the end of the primary season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the Ayers response ad, the Obama camp is airing a spot lampooning McCain's failure in a recent interview to remember how many homes he owns. &quot;Call it country club economics,&quot; the announcer says over a video image of McCain riding in a golf cart with former President George H.W. Bush.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. B06</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">421 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE IS a serious debate to be had in this presidential campaign about the fundamentally different tax policies of Barack Obama and John McCain. Then there is the phony, misleading and at times outright dishonest debate that the McCain campaign has been waging -- most recently with a television ad.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two candidates have very different positions on taxes. Mr. Obama wants to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and cut them substantially for low- and middle-income taxpayers. He would cut taxes for more households, and by a larger amount, than Mr. McCain, who would give the greatest benefits to wealthy households and corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are disagreements rooted in divergent views about the role of tax policy: the importance of reducing inequality versus the importance of encouraging investment. Mr. Obama has the wiser and more fiscally responsible of the plans, on balance, but this is by no means a one-sided debate between evil, tycoon-hugging Republicans and good-hearted Democrats. Higher taxes do have consequences for the behavior of both individuals and corporations. Listening to the candidates debate and defend their actual plans would be a useful exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the McCain campaign insists on completely misrepresenting Mr. Obama's plan. The ad opens with the Obama-as-celebrity theme -- &quot;Celebrities don't have to worry about family budgets, but we sure do,&quot; says the female announcer. &quot;We're paying more for food and gas, making it harder to save for college, retirement.&quot; Then she sticks it to him: &quot;Obama's solution? Higher taxes, called 'a recipe for economic disaster.' He's ready to raise your taxes but not ready to lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts? The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that the Obama plan would give households in the bottom fifth of the income distribution an average tax cut of 5.5 percent of income ($567) in 2009, while those in the middle fifth would get an average cut of 2.6 percent of income ($1,118). &quot;Your taxes&quot; would go up, yes -- but not if you're someone who is sweating higher gas prices.  By contrast, Mr. McCain's tax plan would give those in the bottom fifth of income an average tax cut of $21 in 2009. The middle fifth would get $325 -- less than a third of the Obama cut. The wealthiest taxpayers make out terrifically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country can't afford the tax cuts either man is promising, although Mr. McCain's approach is by far the more costly. We don't expect either side to admit that. But neither side should get to outright lie about its opponent's positions, either.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain himself has written several autobiographical works with Mark Salter over the years, which explains why we don't see that many other McCain biographies. But they do exist. Some are even worth reading. For juicy anecdotes about young McCain, see Robert Timberg's &quot;The Nightingale's Song,&quot; published in 1995 but since chopped and repackaged as &quot;John McCain: An American Odyssey.&quot; (Read the original; it's got Jim Webb.) Demerits, Brazilian model girlfriends, run-ins with the cops -- McCain was not, as Rudy Giuliani might say, an altar boy. At the Naval Academy, he dressed sloppily. &quot;What do you think your grandfather would say?&quot; an officer once asked him. &quot;Frankly, Commander, I don't think he'd give a rat's ass,&quot; came the reply. Timberg, a vet himself, clearly adores the man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he's not the only one, according to &quot;Free Ride: John McCain and the Media,&quot; by David Brock and Paul Waldman. The Media Matters duo set out to indict the MSM for its too-friendly coverage of McCain, but their work often reads like an unintentional ode to the senator's media savvy. They're not wrong, though. Squarely in Camp McCain is Elizabeth Drew's well-intentioned snorer &quot;Citizen McCain,&quot; chronicling the senator's campaign-finance crusade. Paul Alexander's &quot;Man of the People: The Maverick Life and Career of John McCain&quot; should likewise be sold with pom-poms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain skepticism is alive and well. Take Matt Welch's &quot;McCain: The Myth of a Maverick,&quot; a meticulous upending of the candidate's public identity. Oddly enough, it mirrors McCain's latest line of attack against Obama, only painting McCain as the lightweight celebrity snob. Welch argues that McCain &quot;elevates his own self-interest over what's good for the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authenticity conundrum also gets heavy treatment in a slim volume by David Foster Wallace, &quot;McCain's Promise: Aboard the Straight Talk Express With John McCain and a Whole Bunch of Actual Reporters, Thinking About Hope.&quot; Elements of McCain's campaign, Wallace writes, &quot;indicate that some very shrewd, clever marketers are trying to market this candidate's rejection of shrewd, clever marketing.&quot; Wallace would know: The article first appeared in Rolling Stone in 2000, then as a download-only e-book, then in a collection of Wallace's work and finally as its own paperback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wallace also has the best account of the most famous episode of McCain's life -- his capture by the North Vietnamese, his torture, his refusal of release &quot;with all his basic primal human self-interest howling at him.&quot; Wallace retells the story with the pathos of someone relating it for the first time, unlike McCain himself, whose personal accounts, starting with a 1973 article in U.S. News &amp; World Report, have tended toward the laconic. Wallace reminds the reader just how selfless -- not to mention plain freaking crazy, by any pragmatic measure -- McCain's actions were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you like your campaign propaganda undistilled, check out Michael Goldfarb's on-message blog, the McCain Report (www.johnmccain.com/McCainReport/). McCain's YouTube channel (www.youtube.com/user/JohnMcCaindotcom) has all the speeches and ads you'll ever need. And if you want to see how much (or how little) has changed, watch this ad from McCain's 1982 congressional campaign (http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_stump/archive/2008/08/22/mccain-campaign-video-exhumed.aspx). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In &quot;Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream,&quot; Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam predict that the GOP's future depends on its ability to win &quot;Sam's Club voters&quot; -- working-class, non-college-educated Americans. Their unorthodox prescription: government investment (yikes!) that fosters independence and upward mobility (phew!).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, meanwhile, has proposed nine steps of &quot;real change&quot; that the party must implement in order to avoid &quot;real disaster.&quot; An anti-Obama campaign isn't enough; the GOP must repeal the gas tax, open the national petroleum reserve, declare a year-long earmark moratorium and make English the official national language, among other policy tweaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither plan has much to do with McCain, who is too anomalous to represent the party's past and too old to represent its future. But with the GOP struggling nationwide, that might actually help him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I won't have floor seats this time. But that's not the only thing that will have changed when my former boss, Sen. Joe Lieberman, addresses the nominating convention of a major political party this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He'll be at a different party entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some of his Democratic colleagues have expressed anger at this switch, my vantage is a little different. I keep remembering another time when he took a convention stage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For 10 years, I had the privilege of serving as Lieberman's chief of staff, until I left his office in 2003. Thinking about what the senator will do this week when he speaks in support of his friend Sen. John McCain, I've been running through some of the senator's greatest hits during that decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm remembering that hot day in August 2000 when a small group of Lieberman staffers joined a cheering crowd of thousands in Nashville to watch Vice President Gore and Sen. Lieberman appear together for the first time as a ticket. Rather than recycle the usual political attacks and rhetoric, my boss used his speech that day to talk about his faith and give thanks for the opportunity to serve his country. He expressed his gratitude toward Al Gore for making history by choosing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a whirlwind week, we found ourselves at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Sitting in the Staples Center that Wednesday night, I was surrounded by a sea of signs reading only, &quot;Hadassah.&quot; The look on the senator's wife's face and the emotion in the auditorium that night brought me to tears. Imagine: the daughter of Holocaust survivors addressing the entire world. &quot;Only in America,&quot; as Joe Lieberman often says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the senator will be addressing Republicans this week, I've also been thinking about another time he squared off against a Republican: His vice presidential debate with Dick Cheney. Conventional wisdom now sees that debate as somehow a victory for Cheney, but no one much other than Cheney staffers expressed that view that night. Rather than engage in pointless and ad hominem attacks on each other or their respective presidential candidates, the two candidates had done what most Americans hope their leaders will do when they sit down to debate -- they'd conducted themselves like adults and had a respectful, wide-ranging conversation about the challenges facing our nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We lost that election, of course, but after the final Supreme Court decision in December, Sen. Lieberman was one of the most popular elected officials in the United States. He couldn't walk through an airport without being mobbed. Once, as we were walking from our gate in the San Francisco airport, autograph seekers surrounded him. Just a few feet away, football star Joe Montana passed by alone, unrecognized by the throng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since that trip, I've left Capitol Hill, and Sen. Lieberman has run two difficult campaigns. His 2004 presidential bid didn't get far. And in 2006, under the unrelenting attacks of left-wing bloggers and a liberal, novice opponent with essentially unlimited personal money to spend attacking him, the Democratic voters of Connecticut narrowly denied the senator renomination to the Senate from the state that he had served essentially his entire adult life. This blow to such a decent man and capable senator was deeply disappointing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Internet has had many positive effects on the political process -- most notably this election season, when Sen. Barack Obama has used it to raise millions of dollars from small donors -- the anger and vitriol that too often characterize the politics of the online community have had much to do with the decline in civil political rhetoric. Because elected officials feel compelled to cater to one side, and its online echo chamber, they all too often say only what their online world wants to hear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a difficult thing to do when you're Joe Lieberman, a man who doesn't fit into anyone's neat categories. As a result, in recent weeks, he has found himself attacked by both the liberal blog DailyKos and the conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh. Not only is this brand of politics shrill, it's also ineffective. As is almost always the case, the bloggers' candidate lost the general election in 2006, and Sen. Lieberman was reelected by a substantial majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which brings us to this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator who just eight years ago had played a critical role in helping Al Gore close a double-digit gap in the polls, in a campaign that won the popular vote, will be speaking at the Republican convention on behalf of John McCain. This same senator who couldn't walk though an airport without being mobbed by Democratic supporters is now less popular in my party than a former Democratic senator who had a high-profile affair. When a reporter asked Democratic convention-goers who would be less welcome in Denver, Joe Lieberman or John Edwards, the unanimous conclusion was my former boss. The notion that his transgressions were somehow more egregious than Edwards's speaks volumes about today's political culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people who are angrier at Lieberman see his sins as policy- and party-related. They're outraged that he's working so hard for the candidate of the opposing political party. In a deeply divided, red-vs.-blue town such as today's Washington, his transformation is tough to take. It isn't seen as a sign of a postpartisan, cooperative future that's good for everyone. It's seen as a betrayal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's remember, though, that the Joe Lieberman who'll speak on Monday night is doing what he has always done in public office -- following the path he believes is in the best interests of the United States, regardless of the political cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I won't be in the audience on Monday night, and I regret that. I haven't made the same political journey as my former boss. I will be voting for Obama in November. But I still hope that Sen. Lieberman gives a good speech on behalf of Obama's opponent. I just hope it's not a home run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Andresen served as Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman's chief of staff from 1993 to 2003.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama's campaign went on a &quot;rant&quot; when it harshly reacted Friday to news that Sen. John McCain had selected Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, a senior McCain aide said Saturday. Just 36 hours after word leaked out that Mr. McCain would add Mrs. Palin to the Republican ticket, his campaign rekindled the controversy during the Democratic primary that Mr. Obama was condescending to middle America, exemplified by his remark that people in rural areas were bitterly clinging to guns and religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama campaign was caught flat-footed by McCain's choice and typically lashed out in a rant that once again insulted small-town Americans,&quot; McCain adviser Charlie Black said after the Obama campaign dismissed Mrs. Palin as a former small-town mayor with no foreign policy experience. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unsure how to respond to the 44-year-old self-described &quot;hockey mom,&quot; the Obama camp on Saturday changed tack for the third time, issuing a new ad that seeks to refocus attacks on Mr. McCain. But the new strategy is far different from how the campaign initially responded, and illustrates just how much Mr. McCain has recast the election with his choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less than an hour after word leaked out Friday that the first-term governor was Mr. McCain's choice, an Obama spokesman put out an acerbic statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain put the former mayor of a town of 9,000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency,&quot; Bill Burton said. &quot;Governor Palin shares John McCain's commitment to overturning Roe v. Wade, the agenda of Big Oil and continuing George Bush's failed economic policies - that's not the change we need, it's just more of the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours later, Mr. Obama and his running mate, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, put out a statement with a very different tone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We send our congratulations to Governor Sarah Palin and her family on her designation as the Republican nominee for vice president,&quot; they wrote. &quot;It is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics. While we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward, Governor Palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Mr. Black: &quot;Their candidate had to repudiate his staff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, asked about the differing statements, said with several halting pauses: &quot;I think that, you know, campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that Joe and I put out reflects our sentiments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After attacking and then praising Mrs. Palin, the Obama campaign has now embarked on a third tack - largely ignoring her. In the campaign's new ad, titled &quot;No Change,&quot; there is no direct criticism of Mrs. Palin, a former PTA member and mother of five, including a 5-month-old with Down syndrome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, he's made his choice,&quot; says the ad, running nationally on cable television. &quot;But for the rest of us there's still no change. McCain doesn't get it, calling this broken economy 'strong.' Wants to keep spending $10 billion a month in Iraq. And votes with George Bush 90 percent of the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad concludes: &quot;So, while this may be his running mate&quot; - an image of Mr. McCain and Mrs. Palin morphs into a shot of Mr. McCain with Mr. Bush - &quot;America knows this is John McCain's agenda. And we can't afford four more years of the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Obama campaign is not directly attacking Mrs. Palin, its surrogates are publicly ridiculing her experience and calling her merely a small-town mayor. Sen. Sherrod Brown, warming up the crowd for Mr. Obama in Dublin, Ohio, told a crowd that on his 72nd birthday Friday, Mr. McCain chose Mrs. Palin, and the crowd booed the mention of her name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown quieted the boos quickly, but added: &quot;Two years ago Sarah Palin was mayor of a town half the size of Bexley. Nothing against Bexley, but I don't know that the mayor of Bexley is really quite ready to be in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it revealed much about the candidates that in the first major test of executive judgment - picking a vice president - Mr. McCain chose someone &quot;who was a mayor of a town of 7,000 people, then was elected governor, has been governor of a state for 18 months that's half the population of Franklin County, and yet she's going to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. No way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Franklin County includes Ohio's capital, Columbus, and suburb Bexley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican strategist Scott Reed said: &quot;The Obama small-town comments show a pattern of behavior and animosity toward small-town America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama should remember that Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan have hundreds of small towns,&quot; he added, listing three of the top battleground states in November's election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Christina Bellantoni, traveling with the Obama campaign, contributed to this report.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANCHORAGE, Alaska </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sarah Palin was a hockey mom, small-town mayor and rising Republican star in Alaska in 2003 when she ran afoul of her party's establishment over ethics reform and was cast into the political wilderness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But she came charging back as an ethics crusader to win the governor's office in 2006, including a landslide primary victory over the incumbent GOP governor. She has remained popular even as she continued to take on such powerful figures as the oil companies and the leaders of her own state party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Palin, 44, has been the Joan of Arc of Alaska politics, charging into battle against long odds on such big local issues as oil taxes and construction of a natural-gas pipeline - only to see her opposition crumble. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just days after her 2006 primary victory, an FBI investigation into political corruption involving the oil industry and Republican legislators burst into view with surprise raids of legislative offices. As criminal indictments and convictions followed, Palin's outsider status helped her maintain high approval ratings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In one-on-one settings, her relaxed, no-bull manner has contributed to her popularity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She was born in Idaho and came to Alaska when she was 3 months old. She grew up in the town of Wasilla, an hour north of Anchorage, where her father, Chuck Heath, was a teacher and coach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of her most formative experiences, she has said, was leading her high school basketball team to the 1982 state championship. Palin played point guard, and got the nickname from her teammates of &quot;Sarah the Barracuda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Palin went on to study journalism and political science, graduating from the University of Idaho in 1987. Along the way, she competed in the Miss Alaska contest after being chosen Miss Wasilla 1984. In the Wasilla contest, she played the flute and also won the title of Miss Congeniality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She grew up hunting with her father. Her favorite meal, she said during her gubernatorial race, is moose-meat stew after a day of snowmachining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She eloped in 1988 with her high school sweetheart, Todd Palin. He is a commercial fisherman, an oil-field worker, a member of the United Steelworkers, and an Alaska Native. His grandmother grew up in a traditional Yup'ik Eskimo house in Bristol Bay and accompanied Sarah in her race for governor as she sought support from Native voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Todd Palin has worked 18 years on Alaska's North Slope for BP, though he backed away from the job after his wife was elected governor. He also is a repeat winner of the Iron Dog snowmachine race from Anchorage to Nome and back along the Iditarod Trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Palin's clean image lately has taken a shot, however, over charges that she tried to use her office to get rid of an Alaska state trooper who had gone through a messy divorce with one of her sisters. Palin denied any involvement but has conceded a staff member made inappropriate calls. The legislature has hired a special investigator, with the strongest criticism coming from Republicans antagonized by Palin during the oil and gas battles of the past two years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But at a time when state coffers are spilling over with new oil revenues, Palin has remained popular with voters. She recently pushed through a $1,200 per-person &quot;rebate&quot; to help with high fuel costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Heath Palin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Feb. 11, 1964 - Born in Sandpoint, Idaho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1982 - Graduated from Wasilla High School in Wasilla, Alaska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1987 - Graduated with a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Idaho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aug. 29, 1988 - Married Todd Palin, with whom she would have five children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1992-96 - Entered public life, serving two terms on the Wasilla City Council.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Certainly the choice of Palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the Democratic team, and while Palin is a fine person, her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vandals prove that they aren't very good at coexisting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday morning, I received a phone call that our church had been vandalized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The large white rock, the emblem of our church, had been repainted. The motto &quot;Jesus Saves&quot; had been whited out, and the &quot;coexist&quot; symbol had been spray painted over it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I spent a morning that was already full painting over this mess, I wondered what the perpetrators' motivation was. If they really believed in the necessity for peaceful coexistence, they betrayed their own principles by trespassing and damaging private property. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It isn't the Christians who will not coexist. We don't damage property, intrude into other people's space or force our message where it is not welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christians recognize each person has a God-given right to live their life as they choose, understanding they will be held responsible to God for their choices. Not only is it not desirable, but it is not possible to force our beliefs on others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom of conscience is a Christian concept not found in any other major religion. The message on our rock, &quot;Jesus Saves,&quot; is God does not reject sinners -- he lovingly paid for our redemption while we were in the midst of rebellion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I agree with Joshua Bernick's letter regarding those glossy inserts in the newspaper, (&quot;Go from glossy to green on inserts,&quot; Aug. 25). I understand the need to advertise, but businesses such as Macy's, Sears, Best Buy and Circuit City, to name a few, should do so in an environmentally friendly way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another type of advertising I find objectionable is the flaps along the comic section in Sunday's paper. One must remove the flap in order to enjoy that section, and usually the comics end up getting torn off along with the advertisement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bible is clear on murder and homosexuality. To have an abortion is to stop a life from being born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the subject of homosexuality the Bible calls it shameful, unrighteousness and wicked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can anyone who calls themselves a Christian vote for a candidate who is for both of these issues? Someday we will all stand before God to give an account.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. should adopt national health care</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National health care for the U.S. is long overdue. All of Europe and virtually every other democratic nation have evolved to this higher ideal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opponents insist there will be new problems. But that is no argument at all, for there always are with change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point is, for 50 million Americans the improvement will be like night versus day. To use an analogy, other democracies understand its citizens comprise a family. As such, they extend guarantees to every member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the youngest children, who contribute nothing to the upkeep of the home, are extended basic minimums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Americans earn millions of dollars each year, and they do it with our help, directly or indirectly. In light of this, simple fairness dictates that the wealthy should pay a higher percentage of taxes so that regular citizen can live without fear of poverty caused by the cost of a serious illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. is the only democracy on Earth whose top leaders have voted themselves free health care but not those they govern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our politicians, elected the parents of our national family, so to speak, have betrayed our trust, having cared for themselves while abandoning their guardianship of the children.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the media has its sensationalized, never-ending love affair with the DNC, and the McCain vs. Madonna, Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, the world is closer to the brink of WW III, and no one seems to notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Middle East is ready to implode, and Russia and U.S. tensions are at an all-time high since the Cold War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The threatening military rhetoric has reached the heightened level that deserves more attention from the media and the presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the media are more concerned with Michelle Obama's &quot;body language&quot; and whether or not Clinton and Obama have truly mended their relationship, and Madonna's unflattering use of McCain in a video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please, for the sake of our nation, and our world, stop this &quot;glam-fest&quot; and get back to business. I don't care about who is more &quot;Hollywood,&quot; or who has the best oratorical talent, or who is too old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. has been on way too long of a holidday as we've enjoyed the theatrics of the presidential race. Wake up, America, and demand more from our media and politicians before the world, as we know it, explodes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terry McAuliffe for gov?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe reportedly is thinking about running for governor of Virginia next year. So far, Del. Brian Moran of Alexandria and Sen. Creigh Deeds of Bath County also are looking for the Democratic nomination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political blog Wonkette looks forward to the McAuliffe campaign and has a pointed response (http://tinyurl.com.ezproxy.wesleyan.edu/63czv8) to the mocking from likely Republican candidate Bob McDonnell's spokesman: &quot;Terry McAuliffe doesn't know Norton from Norfolk. If he runs, remind me to send him a Virginia state map.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do you think? Does McAuliffe have what Virginia needs? Did you even know he lives in McLean?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- C. Trejbal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make up your mind</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign can't get its talking points on the Biden pick straight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an e-mail sent shortly after the Biden announcement, McCain's campaign manager said Biden said, &quot;There has been no harsher critic of Sen. Obama's lack of readiness to serve than his new running-mate, Sen. Joe Biden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in an ad released later the same day, the McCain campaign says that Obama didn't pick Hillary because she was such a harsh critic. &quot;The truth hurt,&quot; the ad says, &quot;and Obama didn't like it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yeah, he didn't like it so much, he picked his harshest critic to run with him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any two people interested in whether Amanda Beard is dating fellow Olympian Michael Phelps, and who clicked on the Boston Herald tidbit that raced around the Web last week, got the same piece of gossip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rumored galpal Amanda Beard on Phelps: No Thanks!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was different was the political ads that appeared -- or didn't -- beside the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Readers who had visited Barack Obama's Web site received as many as three Obama ads alongside the gossip. &quot;Help Elect Barack Obama President of the United States&quot; and &quot;Visit the Barack Obama Website,&quot; the ads said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Readers who hadn't visited his site didn't see a single Obama pitch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How did the campaign know which readers to send ads to? Although both the Obama and John McCain campaigns are reluctant to discuss details, the ability to identify sympathetic voters based on their Internet habits, and then to target them with ads as they move across the Web, is one of the defining aspects of the 2008 presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Digital advertising networks and large Web companies such as Yahoo and Microsoft are using Web behavior -- which news articles people read, which blogs they visit or what search terms they enter -- to target voters who may be sympathetic to a certain cause. Using a method known as &quot;sentiment detection,&quot; some companies even boast that they can tell whether the blog you go to is for or against the Iraq war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a get-out-the-vote drive, you don't want to get out the wrong vote,&quot;  said Diane Rinaldo, political advertising director at Yahoo, which has worked with both campaigns. With these techniques, the candidates &quot;can reach who they want to reach without wasting their incredibly valuable media dollars, and reach them with the right message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advertising techniques, known as &quot;behavioral targeting&quot; and &quot;retargeting,&quot; have raised alarms from some privacy advocates, who say no one should unwittingly have their political leanings analyzed as they use the Web, or be tracked for the delivery of political ads. Congress has begun looking into the use of such techniques for commercial advertisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Web has been hailed for creating new opportunities for political expression, but there is this dark underside to it,&quot; said Jeffrey Chester with the Center for Digital Democracy. &quot;Yes, you can reach everyone -- but you can track, target and profile them as well, and none of this is disclosed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocates of the practice, which is common in commercial marketing, say its use in the political world is comparable to traditional direct-mail campaign practices. Direct mail efforts, they note, combine voter registration and other records to identify targets. They then send tailored pitches to their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, most of the online targeting is directed to a Web browser, and the name and home address of the target is unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both campaigns are embracing online targeting ad technologies,&quot; said Michael Bassik, vice president of interactive marketing at MSHC Partners, a leading Democratic communications firm. &quot;It sounds scarier, but it's less intrusive than direct mail ever was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guessing how a person might vote -- and whether they might be receptive to a pitch -- has long been part of the science of political marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Internet creates many new ways for campaigns to gather data about potential voters, and then to reach out to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both presidential campaigns are using &quot;retargeting&quot; to send ads to people who visited their Web sites but who didn't leave their name or e-mail address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To track those visitors even after they've left, the  site places a small file, known as a cookie, on the visitor's Web browser. When that person visits another site, an advertising system can send a tailored ad after detecting the cookie, which indicates that the person is a potential voter for the given candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's how the Obama campaign can send an ad to a person long after they've visited the Obama site, even when their mind is on something far afield from politics -- like Phelps and Beard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cookie might even indicate a user's interests, allowing the campaign to further tailor an ad. For example, looking at the cookies from McCain's site reveals that a person who visits looking for information about gas prices is tagged that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using that information, the campaign could send the user an ad about McCain's energy policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you responded to a certain kind of ad, we could hit you with a similarly themed ad at another time,&quot; said Michael Palmer, the eCampaign director for McCain. &quot;Without violating any privacy concerns, we try to know as much about our users  as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Identifying potential supporters is also increasingly easier with the Internet, because what a person reads or browses on the Internet can reveal their political leanings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specific Media, a company that has worked with both sides in the presidential race, combines data about users -- some of which it buys and some of which it receives from partners -- to create profiles on about 175 million people, according to the company's senior vice president David Jakubowski.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data it collects includes information about what articles the person has read on some newspaper sites, what blogs and forums the person attends and what other sites are visited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using sentiment detection, Specific Media can judge whether a blog about the Iraq War or tax cuts is generally in favor or opposed to those policies. That helps them determine the political leanings of a visitor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gathering data on all the Web visits people make, the company can then present a political campaign with &quot;buckets&quot; of voters described as Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, and by what specific issues the person -- identified by a cookie on their browser -- may be interested in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You look at the patterns -- you take known Democrats and say, 'How do they behave on the Web?' &quot; Jakubowski said. &quot;One data point doesn't put you in a data bucket. If you read a lot of U.S. politics, whether it's blogs or news or opinion, and you tend to read more of the stuff about conservative policies, you will then end up in a more conservative bucket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that when the company identifies someone's party affiliation, the information proves to be nearly 100 percent accurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, Yahoo collects information about the 140 million unique monthly visitors to its sites. The company records what kinds of stories a user has read at Yahoo News -- one of the most popular news sites, as well as what search terms a person has entered in the company's search engine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yahoo began a year and a half ago, creating sets of Web behaviors that matched any of the potential candidates -- even former vice president Al Gore, who never entered the race but was a long-rumored possibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;buckets&quot; that Yahoo offers to candidates indicate a voter's interests. There are categories for the Iraq war, energy and the economy and also whether they are &quot;Obama-interested&quot; or &quot;McCain-interested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To see the two presidential campaigns using behavioral targeting is very telling of how powerful a marketing tool it is,&quot; said Mike Zaneis, vice president of policy at the Interactive Advertising Bureau. &quot;There is a growing level of awareness that there is a certain level of tracking going on online. But they may be surprised how prevalent its use is in political campaigns.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surrounded by an enormous, adoring crowd, Sen. Barack Obama promised a clean break from the &quot;broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush&quot; on Thursday night as he embarked on the final lap of his bid to become president of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America, now is not the time for small plans,&quot; the 47-year-old Illinois senator told an estimated 84,000 people packed into Invesco Field at Mile High, a stadium backdropped by the Rocky Mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He vowed to cut taxes for nearly all working-class families, end the war in Iraq and break America's dependence on Mideast oil. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the sake of our economy, our security and the future of our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">planet,&quot; he said, &quot;I will set a clear goal as president: In 10 years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, he said, &quot;John McCain has voted with President Bush 90 percent of the time,&quot; an indictment of his Republican rival - on health care, education, the economy and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America, we are better than these last eight years,&quot; he said. &quot;We are a better country than this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's speech came on a night that offered a reminder of the historic nature of his candidacy: 45 years to the day after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is the first African American to be nominated for the White House by a major party, a fact that, for all its significance, has been barely mentioned over the course of this four-day gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in invoking the anniversary of the King speech, Obama only alluded to race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things,&quot; he said. &quot;They could've heard words of anger and discord. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked. That together, our dreams can be one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning as an advocate of a new kind of politics, he suggested at least some common ground was possible on abortion, gun control, immigration and gay marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama delivered his 44-minute nomination acceptance speech in an unrivaled convention setting before a crowd of unrivaled size - the filled stadium, the camera flashes in the night, the made-for-television backdrop that suggested the White House, and the thousands of convention delegates seated around the podium in an enormous semicircle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and his running mate, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, leave their convention city today for Pennsylvania, the first stop on an eight-week sprint to Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain countered with a move of his own, hoping to steal some of the political spotlight by spreading word that he had settled on a vice presidential running mate. Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty canceled all scheduled appearances for the next two days, stoking speculation that he was the one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Rep. John Lewis of Georgia spoke first of the anniversary of King's memorable speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in Denver because we still have a dream,&quot; said the lawmaker, who marched with King, supported Obama's primary rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton, then switched under pressure from younger black leaders in his home state and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's aides were interested in a different historical parallel from King - Obama was the first to deliver an outdoor convention acceptance speech since John F. Kennedy did so at the Los Angeles Coliseum in 1960.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech, Obama pledged to jettison Bush's economic policy and replace it with his own, designed to help hard-pressed families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speech didn't mention it, but Obama has called for raising taxes on upper-income Americans to help pay for expanded health care and other domestic programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not say precisely what he meant by breaking the country's dependence on Mideast oil, only that Washington has been talking about doing it for 30 years &quot;and John McCain has been there for 26 of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His pledge to end the war in Iraq responsibly was straight from his daily campaign speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts. But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he does often while campaigning, Obama also paid tribute to McCain's heroism - the 72-year-old Arizona senator was a prisoner of war in Vietnam - then assailed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush was right more than 90 percent of the time?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking earlier in the night, former Vice President Al Gore picked up on the same theme. &quot;If you like the Bush-Cheney approach, John McCain's your man. If you want change, then vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The much-discussed stage built for the program was evocative of the West Wing at the White House, with 24 American flags serving as a backdrop. A blue-carpeted runway jutted out toward the infield, and convention delegates ringed the podium. Thousands more sat in stands around the rim of the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wrap-up to the party convention blended old-fashioned speechmaking, Hollywood-quality stagecraft and innovative, Internet-age politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list of entertainers included Sheryl Crow, Stevie Wonder and Will.i.am, whose Web video built around Obama's &quot;Yes, we can&quot; rallying cry quickly went viral during last winter's primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a bid to extend the convention's reach, Obama's campaign decided to turn tens of thousands of partisans in the stands into instant political organizers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were encouraged to use their cell phones to send text messages to friends as well as to call thousands of unregistered voters from lists developed by the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all, Obama's high command said it had identified 55 million unregistered voters across the country, about 8.1 million of them black, about 8 million Hispanic and 7.5 million between the ages of 18 and 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are key target groups for Obama as he bids to break into the all-white line of U.S. presidents and at the same time restore Democrats to the White House for the first time in eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic man of the hour paid a brief visit to members of his home-state Illinois delegation before the curtain went up on his show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; I had this speech tonight. I wanted to practice it out on you guys, see if it worked on a friendly audience,&quot; he joked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no joking about the stakes in the speech, a once-in-a-campaign opportunity to speak to millions of voters who have yet to make up their minds between McCain and him. The polls show a close race nationally, with more than enough battleground states tight enough to tip the election either way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's hopes of victory rely on holding on to the large Democratic base states such as California, New York, Michigan and his own Illinois, while eating into territory that voted for George W. Bush. Ohio tops that list, and Democrats have also targeted Montana, North Dakota, Virginia and New Mexico, among others, as they try to expand their Electoral College map.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden, was frank about the Democrats' chances in an appearance before one state's delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not hyperbole: We cannot win without Pennsylvania,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polling shows the race for that state's 21 electoral votes close. Both the two previous Democratic candidates, Al Gore and John Kerry carried Pennsylvania over Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden, who was born in Scranton, Pa., and represents a state that shares a border with Pennsylvania, is expected to spend large amounts of time campaigning in the state over the next several weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain was in Ohio as Obama spoke, and after a series of sharply negative convention-week television commercials, his campaign aired a one-night advertisement that complimented Obama and noted that the speech occurred on the anniversary of King's famous address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. Obama, this is truly a good day for America. Too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed. So I wanted to stop and say, 'Congratulations,'\&quot; McCain says in the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day. Tomorrow, we'll be back at it. But tonight, senator, job well done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This story was compiled from reports by The Associated Press, The New York Times and McClatchy News Service.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">foreign oil</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will set a clear goal as president: In 10 years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.&quot; the war in Iraq</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will end this war in Iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan.&quot; health care</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves.&quot; jobs in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.&quot; Kaine's time in the spotlight</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Score another one for Boeing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense and aerospace giant has been clawing its way back into the competition to build a new generation of aerial refueling planes for the Air Force in an unusually public way. After losing the recent Air Force decision to award the $40 billion program to rival Northrop Grumman and its partner, European Aeronautic Defence &amp; Space, Boeing managed to get the contract overturned and re-bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Boeing has said it might drop out of the competition if it doesn't get more time, a move analysts are calling shrewd in a very Washingtonian game of chess, as major corporations and their political allies jockey for a program that could be worth as much as $100 billion in the coming decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boeing and Northrop leaders have each had three meetings in the past three weeks behind closed doors with Pentagon officials at Wright Patterson Air Force base in Dayton, Ohio, to air their concerns and grievances about the latest request for offers to build 179 tankers. Few will discuss details, but observers say the Pentagon is trying to avoid another round of protests from the two teams. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Boeing threatened to pull out of the competition last week, Northrop and its foreign partner fired back with e-mail blasts and newspaper and radio ads to try to get the Pentagon to pick its plane as the winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bickering has left the Air Force in a bind. If Boeing were to drop out, having only one bidder would be a major blow for the Pentagon's top weapons buyer John J. Young Jr., whose mantra is to have more competition in multibillion-dollar programs to ensure U.S. taxpayers get the best deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is becoming more bizarre than even a classic Washington story,&quot; said Robbin F. Laird, a defense industry consultant. &quot;It's like a soap opera. We're looking at 'As Washington Turns' here. You've got politics, big money and a much needed aircraft and possibly even more delays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tanker deal has a long, checkered past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Air Force initially tried to lease tankers from Boeing in 2003 but canceled the deal after  a procurement scandal sent a Boeing executive and a Pentagon official to prison. Last year, the Air Force set out again to find a contractor to replace its aging fleet of tankers, which Boeing started building nearly 50 years ago. The Air Force selected Northrop and EADS in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chicago-based Boeing protested and in June won a major decision from the Government Accountability Office, which said Boeing was indeed treated unfairly. The Pentagon agreed to rebid the deal. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates -- in an unusual move -- put Young, the undersecretary for acquisition, technology and logistics, in charge of running the new tanker competition, taking the power from the Air Force to select what its leaders have called its &quot;number one acquisition&quot; program in decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pentagon leaders have said they want to pick a winner  by year's end but are already behind schedule, having missed a mid-August  deadline to put out the final request for proposals. Analysts say the decision is likely to be punted to the next administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pentagon has said bidders would likely have 45 to 60 days to place their bids from the date of the request for proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But  Aug. 21 two of Boeing's top executives -- Jim McNerney, the company's chairman, president and chief executive, and Jim Albaugh, president and chief executive of Boeing's Integrated Defense Systems, its $32.1 billion division that includes the tanker and other weapons programs -- appealed to Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England in a meeting at the Pentagon to give them another four months to put together a new proposal for a bigger plane that will carry more fuel. One of Boeing's lobbyists is former Congressman Bill Paxon (R-N.Y.) of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld, and the company has gotten support from its labor unions in Washington state, where it has major operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We certainly don't want to walk away,&quot;  said Daniel Beck, a Boeing spokesman, &quot;but we need to make sure we  have enough time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some experts say Boeing is bluffing. The company is threatening to pull out to &quot;see if the Defense Department blinks&quot; and gives it more time, said David J. Berteau, a senior defense analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Boeing pullout would open the door for its biggest rival -- Airbus, which is owned by EADS -- to set up shop in the United States at a plant proposed for Mobile, Ala. &quot;It isn't just tankers that will be built in Alabama. It will be Airbus commercial planes,&quot; said Loren Thompson, a defense consultant for several major firms. Jacques Gansler, who served as the Pentagon's top  weapons buyer under Bill Clinton, said &quot;Congress would raise a stink if Boeing pulls out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've been defending their districts over the jobs involved in this and are trying to influence the decision,&quot; Gansler, who said he participated in a paid study two years ago for Northrop on its proposed tanker. &quot;The companies now have tremendous lobbying power, but politics should not be the basis for deciding on national security needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts and executives at competing defense firms say the outcome of the presidential election could be critical for Boeing. The handicapping goes like this: Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, helped kill the previous leasing deal,  and some of his advisers once worked as lobbyists for Airbus. Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama, on the other hand, is from Boeing's home state of Illinois.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northrop is trying to hold its position as the winner. The Los Angeles-based company spent  about  $8 million this year on its own internal lobbyists and hired such big names as the lobbying firm of former  Sen.  John Breaux (D-La.) and Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), according to recent lobbying reports. Northrop  lists about 20  lobbyists and executives who have recently meet with Congressional leaders on the tanker and other issues, and it has gotten support from groups like Citizens Against Government Waste,  a nonprofit group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northrop sends out daily e-mails that usually slam its competitor, and a recent full-page ad in The Washington Post castigated Boeing for trying to stall for time. &quot;And should Boeing not prevail after its latest delay,&quot; the ad said, &quot;what is to stop the company from demanding yet another and another until it is guaranteed a win?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing both sides agree on is that the deal puts the spotlight on Young, the Pentagon's decision-maker, who will face political fallout from the losers no matter which side wins. Spokesman Chris Isleib said Young was in Italy this week and unavailable for comment, but  said his office expected to have a final request for proposals out next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both companies are playing hardball, and their political backers are providing virtually unlimited support,&quot; said Richard Aboulafia, an aeronautics analyst at Teal Group in Fairfax. &quot;If you're Young, you're in a weak position. Ideally, you want to make neutral decisions purely for best value for your money without fear of being second-guessed and overruled by politicians. But he is very definitely not in that position.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the way  to Election Day 2008, the following has happened:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best way to distract attention from your opponent's big day? Leak your own really, really big news sloooowly. Reporters covering the final days of Barack Obama's nominating convention kept getting diverted by -- Hey, what's that smell? Is that fresh meat? It was reminiscent of July, when sources &quot;close to Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign&quot; told columnist Robert Novak that the Arizona senator might choose his running mate -- just as Obama was drawing oodles of press attention for that big trip abroad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&Acirc;&middot; Thursday morning, on the day Obama was to accept his party's nomination, the Drudge Report posted this about McCain's veep pick: SOURCE: NAME MAY LEAK AT 6 PM ET . . . WITH SOME SORT OF CONFIRMATION AT 8 PM.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&Acirc;&middot; During a radio interview that aired in the morning, McCain was pressed on his decision. He joked that he was considering that guy from the Quaker Oatmeal ads, Wilford Brimley. &quot;He's older than I am, so that might work,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&Acirc;&middot; Meanwhile, a McCain spokeswoman told MSNBC that the campaign would be airing &quot;a historic ad&quot; on Thursday evening. Whoa! What would it say? &quot;It's going to be very exciting,&quot; spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker said. &quot;I think that a lot of people are going to focus on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&Acirc;&middot; And then the campaign released the ad, which involves McCain looking into the camera while soft, uplifting music plays. &quot;Senator Obama, this is truly a good day for America,&quot; McCain says. &quot;I wanted to stop and say, 'Congratulations.' &quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain will hold a noontime rally with his running mate today in Dayton, Ohio, kicking off his &quot;Road to the Convention&quot; tour in front of thousands of supporters at Wright State University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The identity of McCain's partner remained secret last night even as McCain's campaign arrived in the crucial battleground state in advance of the rally, which will be followed by appearances at minor league baseball stadiums in Pennsylvania and Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain aides have said they hope to use the announcement of the GOP vice presidential candidate to help slow the political momentum from the Democratic convention, which ended last night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the secret held, furious speculation about McCain's choice for a running mate centered yesterday on two conservative Republicans: Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pawlenty abruptly canceled his schedule yesterday afternoon, while reports of Secret Service sweeps of a Romney family member's home in Michigan suggested it was him instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior Republican operative said there was no evidence of an effort to reach out and soothe conservatives, a move that would probably be vital if McCain picked a candidate who favored abortion rights, such as former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge or Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no battle plan to talk to conservatives,&quot; the operative said. &quot;That's pretty dispositive in my mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top advisers said late Wednesday night that McCain had made his decision and planned to tell the lucky partner the next day. But in a Pittsburgh radio interview taped Wednesday and made public yesterday, McCain said he had not yet made up his mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I haven't decided yet, so I can't tell you,&quot; he told KDKA NewsRadio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the day progressed, the top handful of McCain aides who are privy to the decision went &quot;radio silent,&quot; in the words of one top Republican. That left reporters and most Republicans speculating and reading tea leaves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One national reporter mused on his newspaper's blog that a 6 p.m. McCain rally tomorrow -- the Jewish Sabbath -- might portend good news for Lieberman, since observant Jews do not work before sundown on Saturdays. But a senior GOP official later warned: &quot;There are two sides to every leaf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early yesterday, McCain advisers teased that they would air an &quot;exciting&quot; and &quot;historic&quot; ad just at the moment that Sen. Barack Obama takes to the stage for his speech. Speculation swirled that McCain might use the airwaves to announce his running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But hours later, the campaign revealed the campaign ad to be a congratulatory statement from McCain to Obama, offering kudos for becoming the first African American to win the nomination of a major party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In front of a simple black background, McCain declares to the camera, &quot;Senator Obama, this is truly a good day for America. Too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed. So I wanted to stop and say congratulations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alluding to the fact that yesterday was the 45th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, the presumptive GOP nominee continues: &quot;How perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day. Tomorrow, we'll be back at it. But tonight, Senator, job well done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without real news on a running mate, Internet sites were left to offer screaming headlines with the latest rumors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Drudge Report blasted the headline: NAME MAY LEAK AT 6 PM ET . . . WITH SOME SORT OF CONFIRMATION AT 8 PM . . . DEVELOPING . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time magazine's &quot;The Page&quot; offered a lead headline about a TV report that Pawlenty had canceled all appearances, only to follow it moments later with another headline that said he planned to be at the Minnesota state fair today, not with McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain flew to Dayton yesterday evening, landing just a couple of hours before Obama's speech. He arrived to news reports that free tickets are still available to his rally today at Wright State's 12,000-seat basketball arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, McCain huddled with advisers in his compound outside of Sedona, Ariz. Last week, he spent several days there, leaving only for a cup of coffee in the morning and to do what his campaign merely labeled as &quot;filming&quot; amid the majestic red rocks of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain will celebrate his 72nd birthday today, a milestone that his campaign aims to play down. But the Democratic party promised to throw him birthday parties at every stop along his pre-convention tour of battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some lobbyists, consultants and Republicans on Capitol Hill said they think Romney is the most likely pick for McCain, in part because he would be a do-no-harm candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mitt by far and away is the most logical pick,&quot; one GOP consultant said. &quot;Look at the polling nationwide. The only guy that helps at all is Romney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karl Rove, President Bush's former top political adviser, was queried on Fox News about reports that he had gone to Lieberman to urge him to withdraw from consideration for the good of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rove declined to answer the direct question but also did not deny it, saying only that the report was &quot;inaccurate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm gonna leave it where I left it,&quot; Rove said after being asked the question several times. In an interview with The Washington Post later, Rove again declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by Fox's Chris Wallace whether Lieberman would be a good running mate, Rove said that &quot;he would be great for the country&quot; but added that Lieberman would create political problems for McCain at the convention and in the campaign to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One senior Republican who had talked personally with Romney, Ridge and Pawlenty during the past two days said, &quot;All of them believe that it's not them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff writers Robert Barnes in Dayton and Juliet Eilperin in Washington contributed to this report.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER, Aug. 28</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a ceremony fit for the gods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fireworks exploded overhead. A skycam soared through the air the way it does during &quot;Monday Night Football.&quot; Strobe lights flashed, spotlights circled. Eighty-four thousand adoring fans, after waiting hours to enter Invesco Field at Mile High, waved flags, tossed beach balls and undulated in a massive human wave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, in the middle of it all, stood Barack Obama, accepting the Democratic presidential nomination with &quot;great humility.&quot; On a stage with an ancient Greek colonnade. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, maybe not so ancient: On closer inspection, the columns turned out to be made of drywall and laminated plywood, giving an overall effect that was more Cheesecake Factory than Parthenon. The 14 pillars, connected by a classical frieze, towered over the delegates, lending the impression that Obama was speaking in front of another classical structure -- like, say, the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the columns, garnished with two dozen American flags, a royal-blue peninsula led to the podium, tiered like a wedding cake. All that was missing were the laurel crown, the eunuchs and the sacrifice of the white oxen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans gleefully called it the &quot;Barackopolis.&quot; (Technically, the columns were Doric, so a better name might have been the &quot;Barackenon.&quot;) The McCain campaign sent out a memo advising people about &quot;proper attire for the Temple of Obama,&quot; complete with pictures of togas and robes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling it a temple was a bit over the top. But, then again, it was a night of excess all around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fireworks -- literally -- began when smoke and fire shot above the Jumbotron the moment Jennifer Hudson belted out the &quot;rockets' red glare&quot; line of the national anthem. Oprah Winfrey, Susan Sarandon and Anne Hathaway worked the crowd. Stevie Wonder and Sheryl Crow performed. High rollers sipped Stolichnaya in skyboxes. And many of the concession stands ran out of food and drink. Said the cashier at Mile High Pizza on the first level: &quot;These Democrats are hungry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They certainly are. Ravenous in their desire to reclaim the White House, they took a gamble by moving the last night of the convention to the massive stadium -- and a further gamble by creating the Olympian backdrop for Obama's acceptance speech. John McCain had already drawn blood with his ad likening Obama to a Britney Spears-style celebrity. Obama had invited the problem with a showy overseas trip and such displays of hubris as a faux presidential seal on his lectern. Since then, the Democrat has been laboring to prove that he is a common man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine,&quot; he said last night as he described his family and his modest upbringing. The conventioneers jumped to their feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama's everyman efforts are unlikely to be aided by accepting the nomination in front of Greek-style columns in the middle of a football stadium. Privately, Democrats cringed. They had no John Ashcroft to cover the offending pillars with his famous blue curtains. Luckily, Democrats had the foresight to remove the Air Force One model, the presidential limousine, the full-size replica of the Oval Office and the inauguration gowns that had been on exhibit earlier in the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, the stadium and the setting were probably unnecessary, as Obama's acceptance speech, coming on the 45th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, would have been an epic moment even if it had been held in a trailer. On this, even McCain agreed. He put out a magnanimous ad saying to Obama: &quot;How perfect that your nomination [acceptance] would come on this historic day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But instead of savoring the history-making, Obama aides found themselves answering questions about the columns and the stadium from anxious Democrats and from journalists -- as when Obama campaign manager David Plouffe was asked Thursday in an interview with Washington Post reporters and editors whether he was concerned about the &quot;Grecian columns&quot; and a &quot;carnival atmosphere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not one bit,&quot; he replied. &quot;The backdrop is about exactly what President Bush used in 2004.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, yes, there were images of pillars behind Bush four years ago. But Bush is also the guy who landed in a flight suit on an aircraft carrier to declare victory in Iraq beneath a &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot; banner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The football-stadium option also meant that the Democrats had to contend with the daunting logistics of putting more than 84,000 people through security, and the effort teetered on disaster. Attendees waited upward of three hours in lines estimated to extend for miles; empty seats near the top of the stadium suggested that some gave up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After nightfall, the nominee emerged between the columns, walked out to the wedding cake and waved skyward. He delivered a speech that soared to the heights of Mount Olympus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and independents across this great land: Enough!&quot; he thundered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before he finished, Obama served up some Greek mythology. &quot;They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values,&quot; he said. &quot;If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from. You make a big election about small things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He didn't say whether he had the Barackopolis in mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speech ended, the nominee gazed heavenward, and red, white and blue fireworks poured from the tops of the columns. Streamers hung over the Doric frieze. Triumphant orchestral music played, and Obama, his running mate, and his family departed through the still-smoking Pillars of Hercules.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Puerto Rican reggaeton rapper Daddy Yankee's endorsement of Sen. John McCain sent a tingle up the spine of the popular culture: Sen. Barack Obama is supposed to have a lock on celebrities - especially those who are nonwhite and under 65. Then again, maybe Daddy Yankee was the exception that proves the rule. Singer John Legend actually premiered new material at the Democratic National Convention this week. What's an old Republican to do? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wear it like a badge of honor - The McCain campaign got much mileage out of an ad comparing Mr. Obama to substance-free celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. The allegiance of celebrities is, if anything, a liability. Therefore, the Arizona Republican shouldn't be shy about Republicans' lack of cachet among the glitterati; he should boast about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bon Jovi factor - Reasonable people of good will differ about a lot of things, but not this: Singer (and die-hard Democrat) Jon Bon Jovi is an unlistenable lightweight, a perpetual drag on the reputation of his august home state of New Jersey. By linking Mr. Bon Jovi to Mr. Obama, the McCain campaign will win hearts and minds the country over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Duvall factor - Because of immigration and lots of liberal interlopers, Virginia has become, as pundits love to say, a key battleground state. Actor Robert Duvall is one of the few national celebrities who call the commonwealth home, and Republicans can claim him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Change the subject - The McCain camp has made it a point to stoke discontent with the Obama candidacy among supporters of his former rival, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. Taking a page out of the New York senator's playbook, Mr. McCain should talk up &quot;invisible Americans&quot; and leave the all-too-visible ones to Sen. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mention &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; - Who needs famous hangers-on when, in Mr. McCain's case, the candidate himself has appeared in $285 million-grossing hits like &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; ??</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain and other Republicans have been masterful this week at inserting themselves into Barack Obama's Democratic National Convention, repeatedly stealing part of the limelight with hard-hitting ads, an aggressive effort to court disaffected Clinton supporters and tantalizing visits by possible Republican vice-presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain had narrowed his list to a handful of possibilities: Former rival Mitt Romney, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, as well as wildcard Sen. Joe Lieberman, the Democrats' 2000 vice-presidential nominee who is now an independent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nominee was to be called late Thursday and an announcement was set for Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mere suggestion that the name of the nominee might leak before or during Mr. Obama's acceptance speech last night had top strategists playing defense during the day, firing off charges at any number of the possible selections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The guessing game also kept the cable television networks busy, taking away from time that otherwise would have been devoted to covering Mr. Obama's speech before 75,000 spectators in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain also released a commercial congratulating Mr. Obama, stealing yet more attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day. Tomorrow, we'll be back at it. But tonight, Senator, job well done,&quot; Mr. McCain said in the spot, referring to the anniversary Thursday of Martin Luther King's &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was just the latest in a masterful manipulation of the press demonstrated by Mr. McCain and Republicans, who released daily Web videos and television commercials playing up a split between Mr. Obama and rival Hillary Rodham Clinton. Those were replayed repeatedly on cable news, earning television time that otherwise would have gone to Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Note to Cable Networks: The only time McCain's Clinton-themed ads are running is when they're included in your programming,&quot; Tommy Vietor, an Obama campaign spokesman, said in an e-mail fired off to reporters, citing a report that the McCain campaign has been giving the ads limited airtime, relying instead on news programs to give them play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his vice-presidential pick still to come, Mr. McCain has a chance to instantly suck the oxygen away from Mr. Obama and his convention speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He settled on his nominee Thursday and was scheduled to campaign with the pick Friday in Dayton, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator from Arizona also plans to have several of those on his shortlist, such as Mr. Romney and Mr. Ridge, campaign with him in Pennsylvania on Saturday - part of a unity tour leading up to next week's Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some delegations at the Republican convention signaled they would either vote against Mr. Lieberman's nomination or walk out of the convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, Texas Republican, told Fox News that she is not in the running and said she expects the pick to be Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Playing defense Thursday morning, Obama campaign manager David Plouffe and chief strategist David Axelrod previewed their lines of attack for some of Mr. McCain's choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whoever he picks doesn't change the fact that it's John McCain's agenda on the ballot,&quot; Mr. Plouffe said. &quot;If you liked the last eight years ... he's going to give you more of the same Bush economic policies&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he chooses Mr. Romney, &quot;all he's done is sort of double down on out of touch, and being on the side of the big corporate special interests,&quot; Mr. Plouffe said. &quot;Romney's an expert on things like Cayman Islands tax shelters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Axelrod suggested that Mr. McCain has sold out to conservatives in his party by appearing to back away from naming a pro-choice running mate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1089 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Always the bridesmaid, finally the bride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain is no stranger to presidential nominating conventions - or to convention speeches - having walked down the aisle, so to speak, to address the last five Republican gatherings and urge support for President George H.W. Bush in 1988 and 1992; for fellow Sen. Bob Dole, Kansas Republican, in 1996; and, the last two times, for the current president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, however, it's Mr. McCain himself who, accepting his party's nomination, will be calling on others to stand up for him as he faces Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama. It's a completely different challenge than he has had in the past, when he was soliciting support for someone else. This time, he HAS to make the case for himself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has to make a central argument. That's what every nominee does - it's no different for him - that he's the better choice,&quot; said Mark Salter, Mr. McCain's longtime aide. &quot;He'll hit all the themes that have been consistent with his career for years: putting his country first, service,... [that] everyone should serve a cause greater than themselves&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Benoit, a professor at the University of Missouri at Columbia who studies political communication, said a nominee's challenge is to rally his own supporters and try to sway undecided voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His research has found that most acceptance speeches focus on the positive - from 1952 to 2004, the speeches consisted of an average of 77 percent positive statements. That sets them aside from other major set-piece campaign affairs, such as debates and television commercials, which are 57 percent and 59 percent positive, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, the Republican undoubtedly will be compared with Mr. Obama, a master orator whose presidential campaign essentially began with a speech to the Democratic convention in 2004. Given that, Mr. McCain will start at a disadvantage - he has never been comfortable reading from a TelePrompter, while Mr. Obama can look lost without one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr. McCain also has a longer legislative record, a dramatic personal story and a history with voters who have been able to evaluate him on more than just his speaking skills. That essentially means the bar is set lower when he takes the stage Thursday in St. Paul's Xcel Energy Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for specifics, Mr. Salter said Mr. McCain will confront Mr. Obama's &quot;change&quot; argument head-on and argue that he has the record that proves he's a better agent of change than the Democrat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thorny issue will be how Mr. McCain handles President Bush, who is unpopular with most voters but remains strong among some core Republicans. Mr. Salter said to expect &quot;an acknowledgement&quot; of Mr. Bush during the speech, though the president already will have spoken and departed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain has seen plenty of examples of such speeches firsthand, having been at every Republican convention since he was first elected to Congress, starting with the 1984 nomination of President Reagan for a second term in Dallas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He didn't have a speaking slot at the first convention, but he did get special recognition when he and then-Vice President George H.W. Bush spoke to the California delegation, according to the Arizona Republic's account of the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to be in trouble, because I know other members of Congress are here, but John McCain - we all know the inspiration that he gave our country,&quot; the senior Mr. Bush said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During that Dallas convention, Mr. McCain, then a congressman, seemed already to be laying the groundwork for something bigger. He made the rounds of about a half-dozen state delegations to offer his thoughts and rally voters for what would become a landslide re-election for Mr. Reagan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 1988, Mr. McCain was a senator and was a big enough star to be allowed to give a lengthy convention speech of his own, repaying the favor to Mr. Bush by praising the then-vice president and the outgoing president, Mr. Reagan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also deployed what has become a familiar story for him - that of Mike Christian, a fellow prisoner of war in a North Vietnamese camp who sewed an American flag into his shirts, which the men used daily to say the Pledge of Allegiance. The day the flag was discovered, Mr. Christian was severely beaten, but that night, &quot;with his eyes almost shut from his beating, &quot; he was back sewing another flag into a shirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years later, Mr. McCain spoke of then-President Bush having served during World War II as a Navy aviator and having &quot;a near brush with death&quot; facing enemy fire over the Pacific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996, he again found a military theme in his speech officially placing Sen. Bob Dole's nomination before the convention: &quot;Bob went to war for his country's sake and returned to rebuild himself from his near-fatal wounds. The courage and determination he brought to his recovery are the stuff that legends are made of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2000, when then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush's record deprived Mr. McCain of the chance to endorse someone with war service, he spoke instead of family service, hearkening back to the senior Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many years ago, the governor's father served in the Pacific, with distinction, under the command of my grandfather. Now it is my turn to serve under the son of my grandfather's brave subordinate,&quot; he said to a convention that included many delegates Mr. McCain himself had won in the bruising 2000 primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, with the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks a dominant issue and the war in Iraq raging, Mr. McCain again found a war theme, praising the Democratic candidate, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry but saying his own faith in Mr. Bush from four years earlier had been well-placed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has been tested and has risen to the most important challenge of our time, and I salute him,&quot; Mr. McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush's own acceptance speech in 2004, which was highly praised, showed the power of such a set piece. Even with declining television ratings for modern conventions, convention addresses provide a rare chance for unadulterated access to American voters, free from the distractions of debates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early August, the Arizona Republic suggested Mr. McCain should forgo the traditional podium speech and mix it up with the crowd, similar to Elizabeth Dole's performance during the 1996 convention when her husband was nominated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain does perform well in those situations, but usually when he's taking questions and having a back-and-forth exchange with the audience. A convention speech just doesn't lend itself to audience participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Salter said he doubted Mr. McCain would deliver his speech walking through the audience.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama on Thursday night completed his historic journey from a freshman lawmaker with soaring oratory to America's first black major-party presidential candidate, accepting the Democratic nomination and promising a stadium full of supporters bold change that would fix &quot;the broken politics of Washington&quot; after years of Republican rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the grandeur of the Rocky Mountains as a backdrop, Mr. Obama seized his chance to tell the entire nation in detail how he would change course from President Bush on issues as diverse as energy independence, national security and economic growth and to separate himself from the ideas of the more seasoned Republican nominee, Sen. John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this,&quot; Mr. Obama told an estimated 80,000 cheering, flag-waving fans who streamed into the cavernous Invesco Field at Mile High to witness history. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alternating between the evocative and the pragmatic, the Illinois Democrat laid clear blame for the country's current wartime predicaments of high gas prices, soaring deficits and failing mortgages on President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed presidency of George W. Bush,&quot; Mr. Obama charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and independents across this great land - enough! This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: 'Eight is enough,'[TFI]&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his acceptance, Barack Hussein Obama, 47, shattered a once-unthinkable barrier in becoming the first black American to win a major-party presidential nomination and doing so just a half-century since some states would have treated him as a second-class citizen in terms of voting and public accommodations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The date of his speech only heightened the sense of history, 45 years to the day since Martin Luther King made his famous &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. A handful of Democrats who witnessed that historic address in 1963 were in the stadium to see the man who fulfilled that dream, and King's son Martin Luther King III was also to appear on stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, an icon of the civil rights movement, introduced Mr. King by telling the massive crowd: &quot;I was there that day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight we gathered here in this magnificent stadium in Denver because we still have a dream. As a participant in the civil rights movement I can tell you that the road to victory will not be easy,&quot; he said. &quot;We are making a down payment on the fulfillment of that dream. We prove that a dream still burns in the hearts of every American, that this dream was too right, too necessary, too noble to ever die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the weeklong gathering, many black Americans could be seen weeping with joy at what they were witnessing. Shortly after 10 p.m. EDT Thursday, Mr. Obama uttered the words they longed to hear: &quot;With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator from Illinois became the first person since John F. Kennedy in 1960 to accept a presidential nomination in an open-air stadium. With prime-time television watching, Mr. Obama delivered his address beneath a Greek revival portico, reminiscent of the national monuments in Washington, erected at the 50-yard line of the stadium where pro football's Denver Broncos play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time he spoke, few seats in the stands were empty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The portico opened at the end of his speech and shot fireworks into the air before tons of colorful confetti showered on the delegates whooping it up on the football field serving as the convention floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain was in Ohio on Friday, getting ready to announce his own vice-presidential pick, and he recorded an ad offering his congratulations to Mr. Obama to be broadcast after the speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day,&quot; the senator from Arizona said, looking straight at the camera. &quot;Tomorrow, we'll be back at it. But tonight, Senator, job well done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama offered similar kind words for Mr. McCain while insisting that a McCain presidency would only persist the direction of the Bush era. He said his rival &quot;has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need,&quot; he said. &quot;But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush 90 percent of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush was right more than 90 percent of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama also attacked Mr. McCain as out of touch economically, saying among other things that Mr. McCain's top economic adviser said America is more in a &quot;mental recession&quot; and has become &quot;a nation of whiners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sound bytes came from a Phil Gramm interview with The Washington Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's speech outlined in detail his plans for fixing the economy, battling climate change and fulfilling his promise to &quot;end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will restore our moral standing so that America is once more the last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future,&quot; Mr. Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the nominee did not describe how he would pay for all he promised, warning instead about tough choices ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America, our work will not be easy. The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His running mate, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., formally accepted the vice-presidential nomination the previous evening and called Mr. Obama &quot;a leader who can deliver change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Biden on Thursday said he was tired of people beating up on Mr. Obama's youthfulness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I hear one more time that he was 11 years old when I went to the Senate, I'm going to smack somebody,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later made a surprise appearance at Invesco Field, telling the crowd this is what Democrats mean by promising &quot;an open convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the big screens in Times Square to the upper deck of Denver's stadium, Americans took stock of a nominee who has both inspired and intrigued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every aspect of the Rocky Mountain-draped stadium was tailored for TV, from the white columns that surrounded the speaking stage to the blue carpeted runway and two-dozen American flags that evoked images of the West Wing. An aerial shot of the stadium showed TV viewers the breathless spectacle of a nominee engulfed in a sea of humanity, exactly the image Obama handlers wanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowds did the wave and cheered loudly all afternoon, and their thunderous foot stomping shook the entire press box on the stadium's fourth level. Staffers passed voters thousands of hand-held American flags.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love America,&quot; said Sylvia Clausell of Chicago, waving a flag. &quot;The best part was when he said, 'I accept your nomination to be president.' From there we can now move forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giovanna Negretti, a delegate from Boston, said the speech was &quot;inspirational.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel honored to be here,&quot; the 37-year-old said. &quot;This is my JFK moment - I wasn't born when he was around. I just feel proud to be here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nominee, who burst onto the scene as a little-known Illinois lawmaker who wowed delegates as the keynote speaker at the 2004 convention, took on directly the criticisms Republicans have heaped upon him in recent weeks: too inexperienced, more celebrity than substance, weak on foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next commander in chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have,&quot; he declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are the party of [Franklin D.] Roosevelt. We are the party of [John F.] Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country,&quot; he said, with cadence of a Baptist preacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also addressed guns and abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country,&quot; he said in a clear appeal to Catholics in swing states and evangelicals who lean Republican. &quot;Don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Team Obama also turned the nomination speech into an opportunity, putting attendees to work for the campaign. They had people make phone calls and send campaign text messages and stationed volunteers with voter registration forms posted throughout the stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama state director for Colorado announced they had signed up 30,000 new text-message subscribers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The line to get in through heightened security stretched far beyond the parking lot, and buses taking people to the stadium filled up as early as lunchtime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign manager David Plouffe - a normally shy figure who avoids the spotlight - spoke to several thousand when the convention's final day began. He said the campaign intends to teach Republicans a lesson about community organizing, and said they will realize after the election that &quot;this night and this convention is one of the reasons we turned Colorado Obama blue on November 4th.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also pushed a &quot;massive&quot; voter registration drive that kicks off this weekend and encouraged volunteers to push early voting to free up supporters for Election Day work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This election is in your hands, not mine, not anyone on this campaign staff, not the pundits, not the party,&quot; he said. &quot;You need to own this campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Vice President Al Gore revved up the crowd, telling voters that Mr. McCain is offering a Bush repeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, I believe in recycling, but that's ridiculous,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gore laid out the case for Mr. Obama by referencing his 2000 bid, when he won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College tally after a prolonged Supreme Court battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two parties, and it didn't much matter who became president,&quot; Mr. Gore said. &quot;I doubt anyone would argue that now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gore also compared Mr. Obama to Abraham Lincoln, saying the 16th president was revered for being &quot;a clear thinker and great orator, with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign invited regular voters from Colorado and across the country to attend the speech, moving the convention from its original location in a smaller arena to the football stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The star-studded event included Jennifer Hudson singing &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner,&quot; and other performances by will.i.am, Sheryl Crow, John Legend and Stevie Wonder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama was introduced by a short biographical film produced by Academy Award-winning moviemaker Davis Guggenheim. Some of it was shot in South Dakota before the primary concluded June 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The son of a Kenyan father and American mother from Kansas - born in Hawaii just a few years after the island's official statehood - Mr. Obama ran a 19-month campaign with an unmistakable message of optimism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, we can,&quot; became his mantra across the country as he toppled the more established Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and batted away relentless attacks from Republicans about his middle name, persistent e-mail rumors that he is Muslim despite his insistence he is a committed Christian and a resume his critics in both parties claimed was light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along the way, he shattered fundraising records and drew in countless Americans who for years sat on the sidelines without donating or voting - particularly in minority communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of those voters were showcased during the convention as party elders from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy to Bill Clinton helped Mr. Obama usher in a new generation of Democrats. As attendees trickled into the stadium, hundreds of photos were displayed in a rotation as the &quot;Faces of America. The program also included six handpicked people who the campaign said provided &quot; American Voices&quot; and who each had a story further the Obama message of a struggling economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final speaker, Barney Smith of Marion, Ind., stole the show by saying Mr. Obama would care more about Main Street than Wall Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need a president who will put Barney Smith ahead of Smith Barney,&quot; he said, and the crowd erupted in laughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top members of the Obama campaign team insisted Thursday they think the race will remain close through the Nov. 4 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They downplayed expectations the Illinois Democrat will get the major poll &quot;bounce&quot; from the convention, especially since Mr. McCain's vice-presidential selection will come by Friday and the Republican National Convention begins Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had no illusions that this was going to be anything but close,&quot; said chief strategist David Axelrod. &quot;In terms of the popular vote, there's no such thing as a landslide in American politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is now braced for a fall campaign from Republicans aimed at portraying him as light on substance, heavy on style. He got a good taste of those attack lines this week as top-named Republicans crashed his convention party and filled the Denver airwaves with sharp attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain team was unimpressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tonight, Americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of Barack Obama. ... Senator Obama still has no record of bipartisanship, still opposes offshore drilling, still voted to raise taxes on those</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">making just $42,000 per year, and still voted against funds for American troops in harm's way,&quot; said spokesman Tucker Bounds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Karen Goldberg Goff and Sean Lengell contributed to this report.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">551 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have you noticed the tag line in Barack Obama's latest television ad - the one where the senator suggests we &quot;end the war responsibly?&quot; This newly minted statement by the Obama campaign is ironic, since it is exactly what John McCain and his Republican colleagues have consistently argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. McCain, a &quot;responsible end&quot; means: &quot;The best way to secure long-term peace and security is to establish a stable, prosperous, and democratic state in Iraq that poses no threat to its neighbors and contributes to the defeat of terrorists. When Iraqi forces can safeguard their own country, American troops can return home.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forget about timelines and time horizons for the moment and consider that this &quot;responsible end&quot; to the war is exactly what has been roundly ridiculed by Democrats, including Mr. Obama, who incessantly demands an immediate end to the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The phrase was reiterated by Michelle Obama in her speech to Democratic Party convention-goers Monday night. Buried amid the flowery prose of her everyday American girl story, Mrs. Obama said her husband is fighting for everyday folks and those who serve their country, &quot;That is why he's running - to end the war in Iraq responsibly,&quot; she insisted. If you blinked (or sneezed), you could've missed it, but it was there. Sen. Hillary Clinton repeated it Tuesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is still missing and yet to be answered is: What is responsible? How does Mr. Obama now define that: In all actuality, it seems that it was irresponsible to repeatedly demand an immediate troop withdrawal since January 2007, while American lives were on the front lines, the territory unstable and a way out unsure. His own Web site still touts: &quot;Barack Obama opposed the war in Iraq from the beginning.&quot; In addition, Mr. Obama has been on record mocking Gen. David Petraeus, insisting the surge strategy would &quot;never&quot; work and refusing (until prompted by Mr. McCain) to get a firsthand look at progress on the ground. And now, Mr. Obama wants the public to accept his &quot;judgment&quot; on the &quot;responsible&quot; way to end the war?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We suspect the polls (which we're sure Team Obama checks frequently) may have something to do with the new terminology. Although a vast majority of Americans do want &quot;an end&quot; to the war, an equally large margin want a &quot;responsible end,&quot; as opposed to an immediate pullout. Sound familiar? Democrats realized last year how popular their &quot;pullout now&quot; mantra was, thus giving up the fight without so much as an amendment to President Bush's Iraq supplemental bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain has been consistent on Iraq from the beginning. In spelling out the way forward, he sums it up well: &quot;I do not want to keep our troops in Iraq a minute longer than necessary to secure our interests there ... And I believe we can achieve that goal, perhaps sooner than many imagine But I do not believe that anyone should make promises as a candidate for president that they cannot keep if elected. To promise a withdrawal of our forces from Iraq, regardless of the calamitous consequences to the Iraqi people, our most vital interests, and the future of the Middle East, is the height of irresponsibility. It is a failure of leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's leadership has certainly evolved on this issue. We question how much public opinion and political expediency had to do with this evolution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Virginia Gov. Timothy M. Kaine unloaded some red-meat rhetoric yesterday as he prepared to make the biggest speech of his political career tonight before 75,000 people and a national television audience. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaine called a new attack ad by a John McCain supporter &quot;slimy&quot; and had the Virginia delegation in stitches by poking fun at McCain's inability to recall the number of homes he owns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;How many homes do you have? Good God!&quot; he exclaimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain's wife, heiress to a beer distributorship founded by her father, is independently wealthy and owns seven homes, the McCain campaign has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaine declined to say what he will talk about tonight in his speech at Invesco Field, sometime before Barack Obama accepts the Democratic presidential nomination. Former Vice President Al Gore also is scheduled to speak before Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaine, speaking from Denver on a conference call with Virginia reporters, said he had not had any conversations with the Obama campaign about the tone of his address, whether it should be &quot;too hot, too cold, or just right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some Democrats were critical of former Gov. Mark R. Warner's keynote address, saying it was too subdued in its criticism of McCain. Warner emphasized a bipartisan approach to governing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think Mark was true to himself last night,&quot; Kaine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaine was anything but bipartisan yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We've got to draw a sharp contrast with the other side, not with words, but with deeds,&quot; he told Virginia Democrats at a breakfast meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaine said Virginia Republicans spend so much time fighting among themselves that &quot;they are our best allies sometimes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democrats need to &quot;knock down the silly rumors and negativity that comes from the other side,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We go on the offense about that message of change - that we need a better economy, that four more years of spiraling deficits and job loss and increasing energy and food costs and more home foreclosures is not what we need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaine addressed the Texas delegation in Aurora, Colo., early in the morning before the Virginia breakfast. He was joined there by his wife, Anne Holton, son, Nat, and his mother and father, who had driven from Kansas City, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conference call was meant to rebut a new TV ad running in Virginia that attempts to associate Obama with William Ayers, a former radical activist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Senator McCain is squandering his career in public service with these kinds of slimy operators,&quot; Kaine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ad, appearing in Richmond, Roanoke and Norfolk, was financed by a group called the American Issues Project. One of its financiers is a Texas billionaire who helped finance the 2004 Swift Boat attacks ads against Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ayers was a member of the Weather Underground, a radical organization that claimed responsibility for a dozen bombings between 1970 and 1974. He now is a college professor and helped Obama get started in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaine suggested that McCain had turned to &quot;the merchants of the negative&quot; because he didn't want to talk about the issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This shows a disrespect for the electorate - a belief that they are dumb and can be manipulated,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaine said he was looking forward to his moment in the sun.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aug. 28--Virginia Gov. Timothy M. Kaine unloaded some red-meat rhetoric yesterday as he prepared to make the biggest speech of his political career tonight before 75,000 people and a national television audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaine called a new attack ad by a John McCain supporter &quot;slimy&quot; and had the Virginia delegation in stitches by poking fun at McCain's inability to recall the number of homes he owns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many homes do you have? Good God!&quot; he exclaimed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's wife, heiress to a beer distributorship founded by her father, is independently wealthy and owns seven homes, the McCain campaign has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaine declined to say what he will talk about tonight in his speech at Invesco Field, sometime before Barack Obama accepts the Democratic presidential nomination. Former Vice President Al Gore also is scheduled to speak before Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaine, speaking from Denver on a conference call with Virginia reporters, said he had not had any conversations with the Obama campaign about the tone of his address, whether it should be &quot;too hot, too cold, or just right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Democrats were critical of former Gov. Mark R. Warner's keynote address, saying it was too subdued in its criticism of McCain. Warner emphasized a bipartisan approach to governing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Mark was true to himself last night,&quot; Kaine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaine was anything but bipartisan yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to draw a sharp contrast with the other side, not with words, but with deeds,&quot; he told Virginia Democrats at a breakfast meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaine said Virginia Republicans spend so much time fighting among themselves that &quot;they are our best allies sometimes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats need to &quot;knock down the silly rumors and negativity that comes from the other side,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We go on the offense about that message of change -- that we need a better economy, that four more years of spiraling deficits and job loss and increasing energy and food costs and more home foreclosures is not what we need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaine addressed the Texas delegation in Aurora, Colo., early in the morning before the Virginia breakfast. He was joined there by his wife, Anne Holton, son, Nat, and his mother and father, who had driven from Kansas City, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference call was meant to rebut a new TV ad running in Virginia that attempts to associate Obama with William Ayers, a former radical activist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator McCain is squandering his career in public service with these kinds of slimy operators,&quot; Kaine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, appearing in Richmond, Roanoke and Norfolk, was financed by a group called the American Issues Project. One of its financiers is a Texas billionaire who helped finance the 2004 Swift Boat attacks ads against Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayers was a member of the Weather Underground, a radical organization that claimed responsibility for a dozen bombings between 1970 and 1974. He now is a college professor and helped Obama get started in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaine suggested that McCain had turned to &quot;the merchants of the negative&quot; because he didn't want to talk about the issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This shows a disrespect for the electorate -- a belief that they are dumb and can be manipulated,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaine said he was looking forward to his moment in the sun.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER, Aug. 27</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day did not start well for the activists from the District.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed with buttons, bumper stickers and postcards, they took to the downtown streets here to sign up compatriots in their fight to win the District a seat in Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here, have a wooden nickel,&quot; said D.C. resident John Capozzi, pressing a coin stamped &quot;Taxation Without Representation&quot; into a woman's hand. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She looked confused. &quot;Do I need this for the bus?&quot; she asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the D.C. delegation attends yet another convention hoping to draw attention to the long and so far fruitless cause, members have found that their message of democracy and equality for the colony known as the District of Columbia is as much of an afterthought, curiosity or nuisance as ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During an action-packed week, the D.C. contingent is being drowned out not just by the official convention activities but also by dozens of other protest movements, Hollywood celebrities and advertisers competing for air time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) gave an address on voting rights Tuesday, the 19,000-seat Pepsi Center was largely empty. When the delegation rallied Wednesday at the U.S. Mint, the passers-by were outnumbered by security guards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation has been frustrating for a group that thinks it is on the verge of success. Last year, the House approved a bill that would give a House seat to the majority-Democratic District and one to predominantly Republican Utah. But the bill fell three votes short of reaching the Senate floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denver resident Joanna Fletchall was riding her bicycle past the mint when she stopped to watch the gathering. Like many who saw the D.C. activists, Fletchall said she had never considered the city's plight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm astounded,&quot; she said. &quot;It's a city, they're people, they should have a vote.&quot; But Fletchall said she wasn't sure how well the message was getting out. A bigger protest involving Code Pink and other national groups had taken place a block away the day before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even D.C. Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) appeared preoccupied, arriving 15 minutes late. He is staying at a different hotel from the rest of the city's delegation and spent the morning on a 45-minute bike ride, angering some delegates when he failed to show up at their planning breakfast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fenty marched with the group from the mint, holding a &quot;Taxation Without Representation&quot; banner. But he was not as fiery as Norton, and he uncharacteristically preached patience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The best thing we can do for D.C. voting rights is to get Barack Obama elected,&quot; the mayor said, &quot;and get as many seats in the Senate and House as humanly possible. This bill will not be moved until next year, so between the elections and the inaugural, that's our real time to get something done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All over Denver, small victories were met with setbacks. After Norton's speech Tuesday, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) drew high marks for her prime-time address -- except perhaps from the District's delegates, who said they were stung by her failure to mention the city when she said: &quot;I will always be grateful to everyone from all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the territories who joined our campaign on behalf of all those people left out and left behind by the Bush administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She left us out on purpose,&quot; said Michael D. Brown, the District's shadow senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the streets, the half-dozen canvassers were having mixed success finding people to sign their voting rights petitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just signed up three McCain supporters!&quot; said Janis Davis, second vice president of the National Federation of Democratic Women. She frowned. &quot;But they asked me if I supported the right to bear arms first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making their way along an outdoor pedestrian mall, the group tried to hand out its literature only to be handed fliers from people stumping for other causes, such as Free Speech TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Speaking of free speech . . . &quot; said Eli Zigas, program coordinator for DC Vote, an advocacy group. He sported a beard sans mustache and had dressed up in a tux and top hat to resemble Abraham Lincoln.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a man with Free Speech TV wasn't interested in Zigas's voting rights spiel. &quot;Hey, sister, what's up?&quot; the man said with a smile to Ekua Boateng, a DC Vote intern standing next to Zigas. Without saying a word, Boateng slapped a sticker with George Washington's silhouette over the words &quot;Let Washington Vote!&quot; on the man's T-shirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He signed the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people just say, 'Oh, you're cute, can I take your picture?' &quot; said Zigas, who said he poses for as many as 100 pictures a day as Lincoln. &quot;But the next time people see or hear something about this, they'll be like, 'Oh, yeah, I remember that issue.' It plants a seed, and maybe they'll go looking for more information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the D.C. group came upon the Mexican Grill, where workers were handing out free &quot;Burritos for Obama&quot; T-shirts and asking passers-by to sign forms to be in a commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voting rights volunteers stopped and thrust their petitions into the hands of the burrito fans.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> THE NEW GOP PLAN </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">Republicans Adopt Platform That Plays to Conservatives </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans adopted a slimmed-down, conservative-leaning platform Wednesday night in a unanimous committee vote, peppering it with provisions that mesh with John McCain's political objectives. The platform will come before the full convention for a vote on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP delegates devoted a significant amount of time to crafting an energy section that addresses environmental issues, such as global warming, in greater detail compared with past platforms. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the platform advocates expanded oil and gas drilling to meet the nation's energy needs, the 112-person committee agreed to omit language calling for drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a plank in the party's 2004 platform. McCain has voted both ways on the question of drilling in ANWR, but has said this year he believes it should remain off-limits to energy exploration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), who co-chairs the platform committee, said the delegates sought to match the document's energy provisions with the presumptive GOP nominee's rhetoric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are proud to have passed the most aggressive and innovative energy platform in Republican Party history,&quot; McCarthy said in a statement. &quot;Increasing America's energy independence is an issue of critical importance to our nation, and it's an issue on which John McCain has demonstrated strong and continued leadership with his 'all of the above' approach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from the energy section, the rest of the platform largely adheres to traditional Republican positions. It calls for constitutional amendments banning abortion and same-sex marriage -- two changes McCain has disavowed -- and opposes amnesty for illegal immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Above all, the platform asserts presidential authority. The document makes it clear that the president, not Congress, should determine how war is waged in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also calls for an end to all &quot;earmarks,&quot; provisions in which lawmakers specify federal funding for specific projects -- a position McCain has championed. In one controversial vote, the platform committee approved a total ban on embryonic stem cell research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The platform's energy section breaks with the past on several fronts. For the first time, it acknowledges that human activity has contributed to climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The same human activity that has brought freedom and opportunity to billions has also increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere,&quot; the document reads. &quot;Increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the platform sidesteps the question of whether to cap carbon emissions on the federal level, an approach McCain endorses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the day, the delegates discussed an endless string of amendments to the platform, most of which were aimed at making the document more conservative. Adrienne Wing, a delegate from Hawaii, tried to change the heading for a section on Social Security from &quot;entitlement reform&quot; to &quot;benefit reform,&quot; on the grounds that Americans should not see Social Security as a basic right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we really are sincere about changing -- not changing, improving -- Social Security,&quot; she said, then Republicans need to &quot;change the mind-set&quot; about such federal programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other Republicans voted down Wing's proposal, arguing that it could become a political liability if Democrats sought to exploit the issue. Tony O'Donnell, a delegate from Maryland, warned against triggering &quot;unintended consequences for us in future elections,&quot; adding: &quot;This becomes our platform, not just McCain's platform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain did weigh in on one relatively obscure issue, demanding that delegates insert language pledging the party's commitment to maintaining a special U.S. envoy for Northern Ireland. His Democratic opponent,  Barack Obama, recently said he would review whether such an envoy was still necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said the senator wanted the envoy commitment &quot;enshrined in the 2008 Republican platform&quot; to underscore how strongly he feels about the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The special U.S. envoy was first appointed by President Clinton and has been critical to fostering peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland,&quot; Rogers said. &quot;That Senator Obama would be willing to toss aside one of the signature diplomatic accomplishments of the Clinton administration and put the progress in Northern Ireland at risk is only further evidence that he is simply not ready to lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor pointed out that McCain had frequently criticized Clinton's foreign policy during the mid-1990s, including the former president's decision to grant a visa to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams. In a June 1996 Foreign Policy article, McCain wrote of Clinton, &quot;With his credibility now substantially at risk in Northern Ireland, the President finds himself stuck in a conflict that has frustrated the best efforts of many a skilled statesman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --  Juliet Eilperin <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">'Easy Wasn't in the Cards,' Michelle Obama Tells Crowd </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER -- All the talk of anxiety among Democratic delegates about Barack Obama's chances this fall may have gotten to his wife, Michelle. Addressing several hundred members of the convention's black caucus at the Colorado Convention Center on  Wednesday, she appeared to be referring to those worrying about the closeness of the race when she seemed to break off her train of thought before pausing and declaring in a serious and gently upbraiding tone: &quot;This is not going to be easy. There's nothing about electing Barack Obama to be the next president of the United States that could ever be easy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd laughed knowingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Easy wasn't in the cards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd laughed again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always tease Barack. I say, 'You just don't do things easy, do you?' But just because it's not easy doesn't mean it's not possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd broke into loud applause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEDONA, Ariz. -- Democrats are planning to use images of John McCain embracing President Bush on billboards and in bus stops around Minneapolis and St. Paul during the Republican National Convention next week, part of an effort to drive home their message that McCain represents &quot;more of the same&quot; in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The images show McCain and Bush in a hearty embrace against a black background. The words &quot;More politics as usual&quot; and &quot;Does this look like change to you?&quot; are written above and below the image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad will run in more than 20 bus shelters, Democratic sources say, including four that serve the Xcel Center, where the convention is being held. It will also run on a mobile billboard that will follow McCain from Dayton, Ohio, to the convention.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Borrowing a familiar theme from past GOP presidential campaigns, Sen. John McCain is sharpening his efforts to portray Sen. Barack Obama as naive and inexperienced on foreign policy, rolling out an ad that accuses the Democrat of not taking Iran seriously and ridiculing his explanation for the end of the Cold War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The efforts amounted to a preemptive GOP strike on the Democratic nominee's foreign policy credentials. But as their party's convention shifted its focus yesterday to national security, leading Democrats sought to turn the tables by questioning McCain's judgment on Iraq and accusing Republicans of making America less secure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our position in the world has been weakened by too much unilateralism and too little cooperation,&quot; former president Bill Clinton told delegates last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate evokes past presidential contests, in which Republicans lacerated Democratic nominees as weak on national security. This year, however, polls suggest that Democrats have been closing the gap in public perceptions over which party is most capable of dealing with external threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In some way, the McCain people would love to see this as a repeat of Reagan versus Carter in 1980, where Reagan got to run as the candidate of America and Carter was the candidate of complexity and no answers,&quot; said Walter Russell Mead, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest attempt to frame the issue that way came yesterday with a new McCain television ad quoting Obama as describing Iran as a &quot;tiny&quot; country that &quot;doesn't pose a serious threat.&quot; The Obama campaign said his words were taken out of context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quote came from a May 18 speech in which Obama talked about the importance of U.S. presidents talking to their adversaries, as they did during the Cold War. &quot;Iran, Cuba, Venezuela -- these countries are tiny compared to the Soviet Union. They don't pose a serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union posed a threat to us. And yet we were willing to talk to the Soviet Union at the time when they were saying, 'We're going to wipe you off the planet,' &quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan Rice, an Obama foreign policy adviser, called the McCain&nbsp;ad &quot;another dishonest and desperate attack that bears zero relationship to reality,&quot; adding that Iran poses more of a threat now than eight years ago because &quot;failed Bush-McCain policies have let that threat grow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeremy Rosner, a Democratic pollster and former foreign policy aide in the Clinton White House, said the McCain attacks are unlikely to succeed because voters have been soured by the &quot;toxic and dangerous effects of a neocon unilateralist style that has nearly shattered our alliances and made Americans weaker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it has the same resonance and intellectual honesty that it had in an earlier era,&quot; Rosner said. &quot;The public feels the Republicans have been quite reckless on these things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have proved effective in painting the Democrats as feckless on foreign policy, seizing on particular comments to make a broader point. During the 2004 campaign, for instance, President Bush denounced his Democratic rival, Sen. John F. Kerry (Mass.), for suggesting that the United States would have to pass a &quot;global test&quot; for preemptive military action. Bush said Kerry was ceding national security decisions to other countries. Kerry's campaign said Bush was distorting his words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar dispute unfolded this week, after McCain went after Obama's recent comments about the end of the Cold War. During a speech in Berlin last month, Obama said, &quot;People of the world -- look at Berlin, where a wall came down, a continent came together and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, in a speech before the American Legion's convention in Phoenix, disputed what he said was Obama's conclusion. &quot;The Cold War ended not because the world stood 'as one' but because the great democracies came together, bound together by sustained and decisive American leadership,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of McCain said he was raising a fair point. &quot;For a lot of people who lived through the '80s, Obama's version does not ring quite right, and I do think it says something about his view of the world,&quot; said Robert Kagan, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and informal adviser to the McCain campaign. &quot;It does fit into a certain way of looking at the world that takes the view that all you ever need to do is get everyone in the same room and have a nice, pleasant chat and work everything out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama backers bristled at the criticism, saying McCain was caricaturing his rival's explanation for the end of the Cold War. &quot;I don't understand the McCain criticism,&quot; Rosner said. &quot;He's saying we prevailed because we had allies working together. Barack Obama is saying the same thing. . . . Obviously, the whole world didn't stand as one. It's obviously figurative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reginald Dale of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the debate touches on a larger theme of recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Historically . . . the Democrats as a whole, including Obama, have tended to look at the world more like Europeans. They think that things can be settled by negotiation and signing new treaties,&quot; Dale said. &quot;Republicans tend to be more skeptical of the influence of a united Europe and [want to] protect American sovereignty against the encroachment of treaties, multinational organizations and international agreements.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEDONA, Ariz., Aug. 27</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican  presidential candidate John McCain has settled on a running mate, and the pair will appear together on Friday at a rally in Dayton, Ohio, according to Republican sources outside the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain will notify his choice on Thursday, one source said. The decision is closely held among just a handful of the senator's  top advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speculation has centered on several candidates, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Choosing Lieberman or someone else who supports abortion rights, such as former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge, would be risky for a candidate who has worked hard to rally conservatives to his side, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. The survey indicates that 20 percent of McCain's supporters would be less likely to vote for him if he selects a running mate who supports abortion rights. In a recent interview, McCain told the conservative Weekly Standard that supporting abortion rights would not be an immediate disqualifier in his choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, hunkered down at his   ranch in Sedona, is planning to campaign with his vice presidential pick in a three-day tour of  contested battlegrounds in Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania. &quot;Special Guest TBA&quot; is how his campaign Web site advertises the Friday event at Wright State University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans may pass Democratic Sen. Barack Obama and his running mate, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (Del.), on their way to next week's GOP convention in St. Paul, Minn. The Democrats have scheduled a bus trip through Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator from Arizona dropped from public view after a fundraiser Tuesday night in San Diego, not even leaving his ranch on Wednesday for his routine trip to Starbucks. He conducted phone interviews with local reporters in Ohio and Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain camp's silence did not stop speculation, with pundits and Web sites throughout the day mentioning rarely mentioned possible candidates -- including Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (Tex.), for instance, who opposes an abortion ban but votes consistently for antiabortion legislation -- and debating whether recent events helped or hurt Romney's chances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the most controversial candidate remains Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2000, who was reelected to the Senate as an independent after losing the Democratic primary and has infuriated his former party with his embrace of McCain, a longtime friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You keep hearing that he really wants Lieberman,&quot; said a Republican source who talks frequently with McCain's advisers. The source added that McCain &quot;can be stubborn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another senior GOP adviser said picking Lieberman would be a way to say that McCain is a &quot;transformational politician,&quot; but it was unlikely that the benefit of that would offset the angst it would cause among party conservatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican antiabortion forces have made it known that the outrage that would be felt at next week's party convention over a Lieberman selection would dwarf any disunity on display at the Democratic gathering in Denver. And while some conservative activists love to hear Lieberman accuse Obama of being inexperienced, they have drawn the line at the notion that the party's vice presidential nominee could be someone who voted against the confirmations of conservative Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is solidly opposed to abortion rights, and nearly six in 10 of his supporters polled said abortion should be illegal in most or all cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the telephone survey of 1,108 registered voters taken Aug. 19 to Aug. 22, which tested six possible vice presidential candidates, most said the choice of a running mate would not change their vote for president. That was especially true of lesser-known candidates: Pawlenty (86 percent); Florida Gov. Charlie Crist (83 percent); Sen. John Thune (S.D.) (81 percent) and Ridge (80 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the six, Romney would generate the largest following -- 20 percent say adding the former Massachusetts governor would make them more likely to support McCain. But nearly as many -- 16 percent -- said they would be less apt to vote GOP with Romney on the ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lieberman would appear to do the most damage. Overall, about one in five voters said choosing the former Democrat would make them less likely to back McCain, more than the 12 percent who would be more inclined to support the GOP nominee. And perhaps more tellingly, among those currently supporting McCain, 22 percent said they would be less apt to support the GOP nominee if he picks Lieberman. Just 9 percent of those backing Obama would be more interested in voting Republican with Lieberman as the No. 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats are already gearing up to attack McCain's vice presidential pick, no matter whom it might be. Progressive Accountability, a left-leaning advocacy group, has prepared a dossier on five contenders: Romney, Lieberman, Pawlenty, former Ohio congressman Rob Portman and Rep. Eric Cantor (Va.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each of the opposition research documents uses the identical header, naming the McCain ally in question next to the phrase &quot;McSame as Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cillizza reported from Denver, Cohen from Washington. Staff writers Michael D. Shear in Sedona and Juliet Eilperin in Washington and polling analyst Jennifer Agiesta in Washington contributed to this report.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER, Aug. 27</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At first, it seemed, it might be all about Bill Clinton and yesteryear. The former president strode onto the stage Wednesday night to his old campaign theme song, &quot;Don't Stop (Thinking About Tomorrow),&quot; and bathed in the glow of a standing ovation that went on so long and loud that he had to finally confess, &quot;I love this.&quot; But it turned out to be not about him at all, with Clinton delivering a speech that framed the case for Sen. Barack Obama and against the Republicans in a way that no one at this convention had done before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a day earlier, when there was some unease among Clinton's associates about whether he was being straitjacketed in what he could say in his speech, Obama tried to defuse the situation by saying Clinton could say whatever he wanted. Good call, as it turned out. Perhaps not even Obama himself could have conjured up an oration so powerful on his behalf. Not only did Clinton utter the words &quot;Barack Obama&quot; 15 times, they came in his first sentence and his last, and there were long riffs about the candidate in between. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the start of the speech, Clinton joked that it seemed unfair that he had to follow the previous night's address by his wife, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who many believed had delivered the most flowing and soulful speech of her failed campaign. Fat chance. Clinton is always competitive, even in some ways with his wife, and the praise she received seemed almost to prod him to find ways to top her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The orchestration of his speech came in four parts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First was the unscripted ode to himself, which amounted to nothing more than him joyously trying to get the audience to sit down. He started and stopped three times before the crowd quieted enough to let him speak, and those several minutes, while eating up the time allotted to him -- which he was destined to ignore in any case -- served to remind everyone that for all of the controversy that seems to swirl around him, in and out of office, in and out of the campaigns, he still holds an uncommon place in the modern Democratic pantheon as the party's only two-term president of the postwar era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came an ode to Obama, which, if not overly warm, was indisputably lengthy and strong, filling the one void of his wife's largely Obama-less speech the night before. Saying he is convinced that Obama is &quot;the man for this job,&quot; he praised the nominee's &quot;remarkable ability to inspire people,&quot; his &quot;intelligence and curiosity,&quot; his &quot;clear grasp&quot; of foreign policy, the strength he gained from the &quot;long, hard primary&quot; against Hillary and the judgment he showed in choosing Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. as his running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this was all about Obama, there were also intimations of the Clinton years here. In 1992, Clinton gained momentum going into his convention by choosing Sen. Al Gore to run with him; and Obama, he said, in selecting Biden, &quot;hit it out of the park.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next came the case against Sen. John McCain and the GOP. Here Clinton went into his professorial mode, biting his lip, jabbing his finger to make a point and throwing wide his hands as a means of inviting the audience in on his wisdom as he cited a litany of Republican failings in domestic and foreign policy. The longest ovation of his speech came after a slap at the Bush administration's foreign policy propensities to go it alone and rely on force first. &quot;People the world over,&quot; Clinton said, &quot;have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of this riff, Clinton paused, gathered in the audience and said, &quot;They actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more,&quot; a bewildered expression crossing his tanned face. &quot;Let's send them a message that will echo from the Rockies all across America: Thanks, but no thanks. In this case, the third time is not the charm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And finally Clinton brought it all together by linking his presidency to the prospect of a &quot;President Obama&quot; -- and in putting those two words together, it was as though he were finally, after months of reserve and hotheadedness, giving the new kid his blessing. Long gone was the Hillary Clinton campaign ad asking whom people might trust when the phone rang in the White House at 3 in the morning. Sixteen years ago, Bill Clinton said, the Republicans tried to diminish him by &quot;saying I was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief. Sound familiar? It didn't work in 1992, because we were on the right side of history. And it won't work in 2008, because Barack Obama is on the right side of history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the most repetitive theme of Clinton's political life: that he always finds a path to redemption when he is down, and in many ways he proved that again with this speech. And he might also have accomplished something larger and less self-centered -- by doing all he could to bring Obama up at the same time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER, Aug. 27</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama will step onto a stage bordered by Greek columns and walk down a runway that dead-ends at a lectern on an island. There, alone at the center of Colorado's biggest stadium, he will stare out at 2,000 lawn chairs pressed toward the stage, 80,000 people crammed into three levels of seats and 450 stadium spotlights pointed directly at him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even for Obama, a veteran speechmaker, the setup at Invesco Field makes for the most intimidating venue of his career. On the 45th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King's &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, Obama will become the first African American to accept a major party's nomination for president when he addresses the crowd Thursday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign has gambled on the historic moment by creating a stage that will magnify his performance. Succeed here, in front of the largest Democratic National Convention crowd in nearly 50 years, and Obama's speech will be remembered as one of the most powerful moments in modern politics, a perfect launch into the final stage of the general election. Fail, and Obama risks fueling Republicans' criticism that he is an aloof celebrity, fond of speaking to big crowds but incapable of forming genuine connections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama wrote the speech last week in his customary manner, crafting a first draft by hand on yellow legal paper. He studied past convention speeches and found inspiration in remarks by Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy, advisers said. Then he sequestered himself in a Chicago hotel room, preferring it to the chaos of his house or campaign headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His speechwriters have traveled with him, helping trim and edit -- a process that continued Wednesday afternoon as Obama flew into Denver. The longtime aides have learned to leave the essential elements of Obama's speeches intact, those close to the candidate said. Advisers often say Obama is his own best speechwriter. It surprised nobody in his campaign when he seized control of writing Thursday's address and shaping its message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think I have to do two things,&quot; Obama said this week. &quot;I want to make the choice between myself and John McCain as clear as possible. I don't want people to be confused. And I also hope that the convention conveys who I am. You know, during the course of a 19-month campaign, I think that you, you're on the television screen, you're in big auditoriums, but sometimes who you are may get lost. And I want people to come away saying, 'Whether I'm voting for or against the guy, I know what he stands for.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said he expects his acceptance speech to be &quot;workmanlike,&quot; which would mark a major departure from the formula he has relied on during key public moments in his life. In his 1990 speech as incoming president of the Harvard Law Review, Obama told a story of his mixed-race biography that drew the venue's cooks from the kitchen and caused waiters to stop serving, friends who were there recalled. Early this year, he wrote a major speech about race at a moment when his past association with the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. threatened to derail his campaign, and delivered it in Philadelphia against the instincts of his closest advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the last Democratic convention, in Boston in 2004, Obama cemented his reputation as a talented public speaker by delivering a 17-minute keynote address that focused thematically on the country's divisiveness. His speech contained few new ideas, but it transformed him overnight from a little-known Illinois state senator into a national figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday's speech, Obama said, will have few similarities to his 2004 address. He has become sensitive to the criticism that his speeches are lacking in content, friends said, and he is expected to outline the ways he will try to address the nation's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But changing his style carries some risks. &quot;You can talk all you want about policies and programs, but that's not what people respond to,&quot; said Martin Medhurst, a professor of rhetoric at Baylor University. &quot;People respond when they are touched emotionally, and that's what he's so good at. It's going to be very important in his speech tomorrow night that people get excited emotionally. That's what they want from him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama will step to the lectern under the burden of tremendous expectation. Not since Kennedy spoke to 80,000 people in Los Angeles at the 1960 Democratic convention has a nomination-acceptance speech generated so much anticipation. Public tickets, given away online, disappeared in just more than a day. Some scalpers now sell single tickets for more than $1,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 5 p.m. Thursday, convention officials will close down the Pepsi Center, and the assembled delegates and journalists will migrate one mile west to the football stadium. Traffic officials will close Denver's main highway. A major musical act -- maybe Bon Jovi -- will play a brief set. Confetti and fireworks will shoot into the sky at the end of Obama's speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, dozens of workers hurried around Invesco Field to finish the stage. One woman scrubbed dirt off the hollow Greek columns. Another cleaned the wooden lectern. Obama's image will be beamed onto the stadium scoreboard and two other screens behind him, officials said, but vendors also plan to make binoculars available for rent to those in the upper deck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama turned up Wednesday night to  familiarize himself with the stage, also using the opportunity to regard the stadium from different vantage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time Obama delivered a major speech -- to 200,000 people in Berlin -- images from the event ended up in the background of a John McCain&nbsp;ad, which referred to Obama as &quot;the biggest celebrity in the world.&quot; On Wednesday, the McCain campaign e-mailed reporters descriptions of the Greek columns as more proof of its portrayal of Obama as egotistical and out of touch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends said Obama rarely gets nervous before appearing in public anymore, but few speeches have mattered as much as this one. As he walks down the 20-yard runway toward the lectern, he will have plenty to contemplate. Can he deliver a speech rich in both policy and passion? Can he stand out and yet not stand apart?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's the thing about Barack,&quot; said Marty Nesbitt, Obama's closest friend in Chicago. &quot;I keep thinking that maybe he's getting in over his head, and this is too hard and it's going to get to him. But he surprises me and delivers every time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not with a bang but a whimper, the Clinton era ended. An angry and frustrated Bill Clinton could only watch as Hillary's pitifully shrunken delegate numbers were posted on the counting board. It was enough to make a devoted husband wish his wife had clung to her own name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the vote, the last vestige of the &quot;old&quot; Democratic Party was swept away. No more &quot;the middle way,&quot; no more of the relative moderation of the Clinton years. The sea of black, female, gay (but not necessarily cheerful) and radical faces at this convention testify to the celebration of the spirit of the '60s, the most squalid decade of a grim and contentious century. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonight it's the Anointed One taking center stage, the stage moved to the Denver Broncos football stadium so he can make the speech of his life against the backdrop of a facade of plaster columns worthy of the righteous wrath of Samson. They're calling this one the Temple of Obama. But facades are fragile. We know what happened to Samson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama camp, if not the senator himself, is nevertheless growing increasingly nervous that they haven't put up enough mirrors or conjured enough smoke. He ought to be already getting his poll bounce, padding what he expected to be a comfortable lead. But neither the emotional accolades of Teddy Kennedy nor the oaths of loyalty from Hillary, manufactured overnight of high-impact plastic, have moved the needle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the eve of what should be the biggest night of the nominee's career, the campaign dispatched its legion of lawyers to attempt to suppress the First Amendment in pursuit of squelching a television commercial asking inconvenient questions about Mr. Obama's friendship and association with two violent and unrepentant '60s radicals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign commercial, not authorized by the McCain campaign, makes no wild accusations, raises no questions about anybody's patriotism, but asks pointed questions about a man's judgment in choosing his friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ayres connection, and what can be made of it, frightens the Obama campaign. There's no question that the senator has been pals with William Ayres and his wife, Bernardine Dohrn, and what we know about that friendship is damaging enough. Mr. Obama launched his political career at a fundraiser in the home of William Ayres; Bernadine Dohrn was the evening's hostess. The two men served together on a foundation that dispensed money to left-wing causes and institutions in Chicago, including the Rev. Jeremiah Wright's church. The two of them appeared in tandem as recently as 2002 on a panel at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The panic-like reaction to the new television commercial suggests there may be other things someone doesn't want us to know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the unrepentant bomb-throwers were trying to live quiet lives, to reflect on their evil, they picked an unfortunate day to emerge from those reflections. Their op-ed essay, &quot;No Regrets For a Love of Explosives,&quot; appeared in the New York Times just a few hours before Islamist terrorists flew airliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Talk about getting a bang for your buck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't regret setting bombs,&quot; he told a Times reporter in an accompanying profile. &quot;I feel we didn't do enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This dynamic husband-and-wife duo were well known in their day. Bernadine Dohrn cut a striking figure at rallies of the Weather Underground, the first home-grown American terrorist cult, in her signature leather miniskirt and high-heeled black leather boots cut at a shapely thigh. (That's the way everybody could talk then.) She invited the like-minded to conspire with her against &quot;Amerikkka,&quot; and once raised a three-fingered &quot;fork salute&quot; to Charles Manson and the &quot;family&quot; who killed and mutilated the actress Sharon Tate and friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dig it!&quot; she told that rally in Flint, Mich., in 1969. &quot;First they killed those pigs. Then they ate dinner in the same room with them, they even shoved a fork into a victim's stomach! Wild!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama has described William Ayres as &quot;just somebody I know in the neighborhood.&quot; He protests now that he was only 8 years old when these friends &quot;in the neighborhood&quot; were killing cops and blowing up things. Nobody is suggesting that he was there, only that his judgment is not reliable. Who can trust a man who chooses friends like that?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of presumptive presidential nominees Sen. John McCain and Sen. Barack Obama are targeting unaffiliated voters in Virginia who could make the difference in November's election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're &quot;reaching out not only to Republicans but to Democrats and independents who are open-minded and increasingly enthusiastic about the candidacy of John McCain,&quot; said Carly Fiorina, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee Victory 2008 campaign. &quot;While people are realizing that party unity is important, the direction of the country is more important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican officials on Wednesday announced the formation of a Virginia branch of their Citizens for McCain Coalition, an organization within the McCain campaign consisting of voters who are not Republicans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia is seen as a swing state that could decide the election in favor of either candidate, even though the last Democrat to claim the state's electoral votes was Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 226,000 voters have been added to the Virginia rolls between Dec. 2, 2004, and Aug. 1, according to the state Board of Elections. That has created a pool of potentially undecided voters for both parties to target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters in Virginia do not register by party. But Christy Swanson, a Democrat and small-business owner in the Richmond area, said she decided to vote for Mr. McCain after hearing him speak at a summit in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's plan to cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent &quot;is huge in our arena,&quot; said Mrs. Swanson, who serves as the vice chairwoman of the Virginia citizens coalition and will speak at the Republican National Convention in Minnesota on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am voting for John McCain even though I have traditionally voted Democrat and feel that he is best suited for the job with his experience,&quot; Mrs. Swanson said. &quot;And the support for small businesses is huge for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Fiorina said polls show that Mrs. Swanson is not alone among independent and Democratic voters pledging support for Mr. McCain, although Gallup Poll tracking data released Wednesday showed that the percentage of conservative Democrats now backing Mr. Obama has declined from 71 percent in June to 63 percent this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are millions of people who have never voted Republican before that are now voting for John McCain,&quot; Mrs. Fiorina said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign on Monday also released a television ad featuring a former delegate for Mr. Obama's competitor in this year's Democratic primary, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, pledging her support for Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-second spot comes as Mr. Obama is attempting to win over former Clinton supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign spokesman Kevin Griffis said McCain supporters should focus on maintaining their Republican base, given widespread dissatisfaction with the Bush administration and the difficult state of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that they have a lot more to worry about in terms of keeping Republicans on their side,&quot; Mr. Griffis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has poured resources into Virginia, opening 36 offices for an operation that Mrs. Fiorina admitted is &quot;much more expensive and labor intensive&quot; than Mr. McCain's. The campaign will open a 37th office this weekend in Bridgewater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Griffis said officials are relying on grass-roots efforts by volunteers in those communities to target independents and moderate Republicans disillusioned by Mr. McCain's and the Bush administration's policies on topics like abortion, the Iraq war and the federal budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The folks who are out there making that case are people from these individual communities,&quot; Mr. Griffis said. &quot;They know the neighborhood, they know the communities and they know who they're talking to.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain has a golden opportunity to craft a historic Republican ticket by selecting a female as his nominee for vice president. Such a move can appeal to 52 percent of the electorate who are women and who might be drawn to a ticket that will include America's first female vice president - another glass ceiling shattered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Geraldine Ferraro was the only female nominee to appear on a presidential ticket of the two major parties in a 1984 unsuccessful bid for the White House. If Mr. McCain wins the election, for the first time in American history, a woman would be one heartbeat away from the presidency - and possibly one term away from being the first female president. What better way to steal Barack Obama's thunder as an agent of change? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain would also appeal to Hillary Clinton supporters who feel betrayed by the Democratic Party. According to a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, 27 percent of Mrs. Clinton's supporters are dissatisfied with the Democratic nominee and will not vote for Mr. Obama - an increase from 16 percent in late June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the top of the list of viable female vice presidential picks for Mr. McCain is Carly Fiorina, former CEO of Hewlett Packard and one of Mr. McCain's leading economic advisers. Mrs. Fiorina, 53, was named by Forbes magazine, in 1998, as the most powerful woman in business. Mrs. Fiorina is articulate, forceful and intelligent. In an Aug. 26 appearance on Fox News' &quot;On The Record With Greta Van Susteren,&quot; for example, she was formidable in explaining that women care most about economic issues, are opening small businesses at a rate of 2-to-1 in contrast to their male counterparts and are drawn to a low-tax, free-market agenda. As a strong, capable woman with executive experience, she can appeal to Clinton supporters. And as a pro-lifer she will galvanize the evangelical base of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The downside of selecting Mrs. Fiorina is that she is still relatively unknown. Furthermore, she commanded a huge salary as CEO and could be painted as out-of-touch with ordinary Americans. Her 2005 departure from HP was turbulent. She also recently sparked a firestorm with her comments that insurers cover Viagra but not birth control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another choice for Mr. McCain is Sarah Palin, the first female governor of Alaska. She is intriguing as a woman with impeccable conservative credentials, a reformer with a reputation for vetoing big spending bills and taking on big oil. She has had approval ratings in Alaska as high as 90 percent. Mrs. Palin is staunchly pro-life, a lifelong member of the National Rifle Association and a former beauty queen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the pitfalls are that she may be too young, her state has only three Electoral College votes and in July she became embroiled in a scandal over the firing of the Alaska Commissioner for Public Safety Walt Monegan. An investigation is ongoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The longest-tenured female Republican senator, Kay Bailey Hutchison, has also been touted as a possible contender. Mrs. Hutchison has a wealth of experience: She headed the Senate Republican Conference, has strong foreign-policy credentials and currently serves as chairman of the Republican Policy Committee. Hailing from Texas, she has a proven record in attracting Hispanic voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, Mrs. Hutchison's candidacy would rile the evangelical base of the party since she supports embryonic stem cell research and is pro-choice. Also, having two senators on the Republican ballot might be potentially fatal in an era where anti-Washington sentiment runs high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In assessing the pros and cons, it appears that Mrs. Fiorina could be the best choice among the female contenders. Mr. McCain can make 2008 the year Republicans blaze a new trail.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on the selection of Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware as Barack Obama's running mate on Fox News Sunday, Gov. Tim Kaine was asked this question by moderator Chris Wallace: &quot;Virginia has not voted for a Democrat since 1964, but the polls say Virginia is undecided. What, if anything, can Joe Biden do for the Democrats in Virginia?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Kaine's response was: &quot;Joe comes from a state, Delaware, that borders Virginia. The Eastern Shore of Virginia is not only bordering, but very, very similar, and I think there is a lot in common and Joe understands that.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hats off to Gov. Kaine for recognizing what many maps and politicians fail to acknowledge. The Eastern Shore is truly wonderful and a big economic contributor. However, even though he knows of the Eastern Shore, he certainly does not know much more than that. The Eastern Shore of Virginia does not border Delaware as he twice asserted; it borders Maryland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In turn, Delaware borders Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania (including the outskirts of Philadelphia). That's not exactly &quot;very, very similar&quot; to the way of life on the Eastern Shore and southern Virginia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re &quot;Are you better off now?&quot; Hampton Roads, Aug. 22:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After watching Barack Obama's town hall meeting in Chesapeake, I am even more convinced that his inexperience would be damaging to the U.S. economy and to our nation as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says that he doesn't believe the government should be taking care of everyone, but turned around and said that he is for free health care. So which is it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wants free or almost free medical care, state-provided mental health care and so forth, yet doesn't have any idea of how we are to pay for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He talks about how people worry about how they are going to put their kids through college, then talks about his own path via student loans and work. Why can't the kids today continue to do so? If they want it bad enough, maybe they can do the same, or join the military and earn it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Columnist Kathleen Parker appealed to &quot;higher principles&quot; in her struggle to find a place to attack Rick Warren for hosting an interview with John McCain and Barack Obama (&quot;Purpose-driven politics,&quot; op-ed, Aug. 22).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's wrong with finding out what a candidate for public office believes? If he wants to lie about it, as she implies, does that negate the need to ask the question? And, more importantly, does bringing religious thought into the public sphere equal un-Americanism? It does, only if Americans buy into the prevailing climate of anti-religious thought. This was not our Founding Fathers' intent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowhere in the Constitution is it mandated that religion shall play no role in government or public life; in fact, the Constitution ensures the right of individuals and organizations to express their faith both privately and publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the colonization of the new world, religious minorities, like the Baptists, were routinely imprisoned for publicly practicing their faith. The leaders of this new nation wanted to create a world where people of faith (which were the vast majority) could openly and without fear of reprisal practice their faith and have an equal opportunity to sit at the table of government. There was to be no &quot;wall of separation,&quot; there was to be no restriction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the political/legal climate we live in now. Today, people of faith are called &quot;un-American&quot; when they attempt to publicly express themselves with integrity. People of faith and faith organizations have as much right to be in the political/governmental process as do people of no faith and secular organizations. It is constitutional; it is American.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is more than a person; he has become a movement. In history, Abraham Lincoln, FDR, John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. are examples of men who became movements. And they all became movements by their vocal powers to persuade, convince and lead their fellow Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say that the pen is mightier than the sword, but I say that the voice is even mightier than the pen in a world in which communication is immediate and the message is heard worldwide, like Obama's speech in Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, the opponents try to suppress Obama's oratory, saying it comes from an empty suit with little experience. Try to convince the millions who have seen and heard his voice and who have come away convinced to give this young man his day in the light on Nov. 4, Election Day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An intelligent and most valuable voice was silenced this month when Tom Robotham resigned his post as editor in chief of Port Folio Weekly. It seems that the publication's corporate owners just couldn't put up with someone who gave the paper a distinct point of view and a bit of attitude, attributes sorely lacking in most of our local newspapers and magazines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also couldn't stand the idea that readers might actually want to learn about slightly off-the-radar subject matter and hear from people who hold unusual, non-mainstream points of view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Robotham, Port Folio Weekly was a straight-shooting, tell-it-like-it-is publication, and not a focus group driven &quot;product,&quot; which is exactly the direction the current owners wish to take the paper. It is the same mode of thinking that turned commercial FM radio into the dull, repetitive and unimaginative wasteland it has been for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will all be poorer for Robotham's departure. Let us all now turn on our radios, where &quot;Another One Bites The Dust&quot; will no doubt be airing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER, Aug. 26</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sen. Barack Obama's campaign and its allies, mindful of the lessons of the Swift boat attacks of 2004, have begun  an aggressive, multi-pronged attack on an advertisement running in swing states that seeks to link the Democratic presidential candidate to former domestic terrorist William Ayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With threats of legal action, boycotts and a response ad launched quietly to avoid publicity, the Obama campaign has put conservative donors and television stations on notice that 2008 will not be 2004, when Sen. John F. Kerry, the Democratic nominee, waited weeks to respond to attacks on his Vietnam War record and ultimately did so ineffectively. Christian Pinkston, a spokesman for the American Issues Project, which is airing the anti-Obama&nbsp;ad, called the response intimidation and harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign lawyer Robert F. Bauer replied: &quot;If someone rides up to a convenience store with a sawed-off shotgun and a prior record, I'm not intimidating anybody by calling the cops. . . . If this [Republican] campaign is going to be run in McCarthyite fashion by lawbreakers in an illegal way, they are going to pay a price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayers was a member of the Weather Underground, a radical organization that claimed responsibility for a dozen bombings between 1970 and 1974. He is now a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago and an expert on public school reform. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, financed with a $2.9 million donation from Texas billionaire Harold Simmons, a fundraising bundler for Sen. John McCain's Republican campaign, says that Obama has defended Ayers as &quot;respectable&quot; and &quot;mainstream&quot; and that he launched his political career from Ayers's home. The Obama campaign says the assertions are demonstrably false.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why would Barack Obama be friends with somebody who bombed the Capitol and is proud of it?&quot; intones a voice on the ad, which is running in conservative areas of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. &quot;Do you know enough to elect Barack Obama?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is no video stunt, said Evan Tracey of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks political advertising. It began running  last Thursday, and as of Tuesday, $360,000 had been spent on 264 showings, 52 of them in the Grand Rapids, Mich., media market, just under 40 around Cincinnati, 18 in Norfolk, and half a dozen around Pittsburgh, a corner of Pennsylvania that Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton dominated in the spring Democratic primary battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Certainly it connects with base voters,&quot; Tracey said. &quot;If you can't get excited about voting for McCain, these are the kinds of ads that get them excited about voting against Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The television spot has left Obama with the same dilemma that Kerry faced four years ago: Respond and risk pushing the issue onto the political talk shows and front pages of newspapers, or ignore it and hope the attack will not sink in. Kerry, convinced that few would believe that a decorated Vietnam combat veteran would fabricate his war record, chose to ignore the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. When he finally responded, his national advertisement stoked the issue all over again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign officials are taking a different tack. They are running an ad to counter the Ayers spot in the same media markets, but they did so with no national media announcement or news conference. The ad itself blames McCain for the independent Ayers campaign, accusing him of &quot;talking about the '60s&quot; and crimes Ayers committed when Obama was 8 years old, instead of war spending, economic crisis and tax breaks for companies that send jobs overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simmons, who helped finance the 2004 Swift boat campaign, has raised $50,000 to $100,000 for McCain's bid, according to the campaign's Web site. Ed Failor Jr., who sits on the American Issues Project board, was an adviser and paid consultant for the McCain campaign. A news release announcing Failor's joining of the McCain presidential exploratory committee was recently removed from the candidate's Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The counter ad is only part of the Obama team's response. Bauer has written legal letters to television stations, asserting that the Ayers ad is illegal and false, and that its  airing is subject to a Federal Election Commission penalty. Obama did not call Ayers &quot;respectable&quot; and &quot;mainstream,&quot; Bauer said. Those words were used by a journalist in an article that was posted along with many others on the Obama campaign Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers called it &quot;100 percent misleading&quot; to blame the Republican for an ad he had nothing to do with. He said the campaign has had no discussions with Simmons about  the ad, the issue or the organization. Failor has not been involved in the McCain campaign for more than a year, Rogers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Rogers made no effort to distance McCain from the Ayers issue. &quot;If he thinks his long association with an unrepentant domestic terrorist is nothing the American people should be concerned about, he's delusional or naive,&quot; Rogers said of Obama. &quot;The guy's running for president. It's an issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayers did hold a gathering for him in 1995 when Obama first ran for the Illinois Senate, and he later contributed $200 to his reelection campaign. But Bauer said that hardly constitutes launching the political career of a University of Chicago Law School lecturer and the first African American president of the Harvard Law Review, who had just published his first memoir, &quot;Dreams From My Father.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Bauer letter to Deputy Assistant Attorney General John C. Keeney challenges him to make good on a promise to vigorously act in the face of &quot;a knowing and willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 93,000 pro-Obama e-mails have flooded Sinclair Broadcasting Group stations that are running the ad, many of them threatening to boycott the stations and their advertisers. Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor warned that other stations that accept  the ad can expect the same response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts to stop the Ayers ad have not  come only from the Obama campaign. A film company in Berkeley, Calif., that made an Oscar-nominated documentary in 2004 on the Weather Underground group has issued a cease-and-desist letter to the American Issues Project, saying that it illegally appropriated copyright images from the film for the ad. Brook Dooley, an attorney for the Free History Project, said shots of Ayers speaking into a camera in an interview and the aftermath of a Weather Underground bombing were copyrighted. The group has informed about 150 stations in Ohio and Michigan of its objection, but Dooley said no decisions have been made about legal action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, a new effort by Democratic strategist Tom Matzzie, called Accountable America, is aimed at warning conservative donors of the legal thicket they may be entering by financing independent attack ads like the Ayers spot. He said his group's first target is Simmons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pinkston said his group and his donors are undaunted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama campaign has raised this to front-page news, frankly, with this response ad, with these legal attacks, with their outreach to reporters,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER, Aug. 26</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton roused the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday night with sharp criticism of Sen. John McCain and a full-throated endorsement of Sen. Barack Obama, her former rival for the party's nomination, urging Democrats to put the long and bitter battle behind them and unite to take back the White House in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You haven't worked so hard over the last 18 months, or endured the last eight years, to suffer through more failed leadership,&quot; Clinton told an audience packed to overflowing at Denver's Pepsi Center. &quot;No way. No how. No McCain. Barack Obama is my candidate. And he must be our president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With some Clinton supporters still voicing reluctance to back the senator from Illinois, the former first lady's address was the most highly anticipated of the convention, short of Obama's acceptance speech on Thursday night. Her appearance was designed to signal the final transition from leader of her own historic campaign, which drew 18 million votes and pushed Obama to the limit, to unabashed supporter of the party's presumptive nominee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Introduced as &quot;my hero&quot; by her daughter, Chelsea, Clinton received a thunderous welcome when she walked onstage to a sea of white placards with her familiar &quot;Hillary&quot; signature in blue. Before her entrance, delegates watched a video, narrated by her daughter, that not only paid tribute to her campaign but also gently mocked her well-known laugh and her inability to carry a tune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton described the passions that drove her to seek the presidency, including a desire to rebuild the economy, enact universal health care, end the war in Iraq and stand up for what she called &quot;invisible&quot; Americans. &quot;Those are the reasons I ran for president. These are the reasons I support Barack Obama. And those are the reasons you should, too,&quot; she told an audience that included her husband, former president Bill Clinton, and Obama's running mate, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (Del.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she finished, the white placards that had greeted her gave way to narrow blue-and-white signs that said &quot;Obama&quot; on one side and &quot;Unity&quot; on the other, as well as signs that said &quot;Hillary&quot; and &quot;Unity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton called McCain &quot;a colleague and a friend who has served his country with honor.&quot; But she told the delegates, &quot;We don't need four more years of the last eight years,&quot; and she drew a huge cheer when she described McCain as a virtual clone of President Bush who would continue the administration's policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It makes sense that George Bush and John McCain will be together next week in the Twin Cities,&quot; she said, referring to the site of the Republican National Convention in Minnesota. &quot;Because these days, they're awfully hard to tell apart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama aides said he called Clinton after watching her speech at a house in Billings, Mont., and thanked her for her support. He also called Bill Clinton and congratulated him on his wife's performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Hillary Clinton arrived at the convention, former Virginia governor Mark Warner, delivering the keynote address, described Obama as the candidate best equipped to put the United States on course to win &quot;the race for the future&quot; in an increasingly competitive global economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arguing that the status quo &quot;just won't cut it,&quot; Warner said McCain would explode the deficit, ignore the nation's infrastructure needs and continue spending $10 billion a month on the Iraq war. &quot;That's four more years that we just can't afford,&quot; he said to cheers. &quot;Barack Obama has a different vision and a different plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election, Warner said, is about not left vs. right but future vs. past. He said Obama would not govern as a partisan Democrat but would reach out to the opposition to get things done. &quot;We need leaders who will appeal to us not as Republicans or Democrats but first and foremost as Americans,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As convention delegates looked toward the evening program, top Democratic elected officials continued to raise questions about Obama's campaign strategy and worried aloud that he must do more to overcome the doubts that voters in their states have about his readiness to be president. Their concerns came as McCain blasted Obama in a speech to the American Legion convention in Phoenix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania Gov. Edward G. Rendell, a prominent Clinton supporter, said that Obama is still struggling to connect with working-class voters and that the presumptive nominee reminded him of Adlai Stevenson, the brainy Illinoisan who lost the presidential campaigns of 1952 and 1956.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You ask him a question, and he gives you a six-minute answer,&quot; Rendell told Washington Post reporters and editors. &quot;And the six-minute answer is smart as all get-out. It's intellectual. It's well framed. It takes care of all the contingencies. But it's a lousy sound bite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) said Obama's campaign must demonstrate its willingness to engage against a Republican Party that he said is well skilled in political combat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only thing they're going to do is, in old Brooklyn terms, rabbit-punch every day, and Obama has to show the American people that he can rabbit-punch, that he can be in that street fight,&quot; he told The Post. &quot;I think there was a reluctance initially in the Obama campaign to engage in that. I think they now realize they have to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Monday night's convention program lacked a fighting spirit, Obama brought his to the campaign trail on Tuesday -- fiercely laying out the case for his candidacy and the contrast with McCain. Obama even mentioned McCain's prisoner-of-war status in Vietnam in a way that suggested he will begin to challenge that as a credential for being president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain has a great biography, has been a POW,&quot; Obama told a small group gathered at an aircraft maintenance facility in Kansas City, Mo. &quot;I have a funny name.&quot; He said the Republicans are arguing &quot;that you don't know whether I can be trusted to lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I'm just going to remind everyone here: This election is not about me,&quot; he said. &quot;It's about you. It's about who's going to be fighting for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, meanwhile, continued to pound away at Obama in his speech to the American Legion. He accused the senator from Illinois of failing to stand up to criticism of the United States elsewhere in the world and ridiculed his rival's words during a speech in Berlin last month, in which Obama said &quot;the world stands as one&quot; as it looks to the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Cold War ended not because the world stood 'as one' but because the great democracies came together, bound together by sustained and decisive American leadership,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Republican effort continued with a new McCain&nbsp;ad that uses Clinton's words about her rival during the Democratic primary campaign in an ad about a 3 a.m. phone call to the White House: &quot;I know Senator McCain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the White House. And Senator Obama has a speech he gave in 2002.&quot; A narrator in the McCain&nbsp;ad continues: &quot;Hillary's right. John McCain for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And even after Clinton's speech Tuesday night, McCain's campaign made it clear that it would not hesitate to continue invoking her rhetoric from the primary season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that Barack Obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief,&quot; McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said. &quot;Nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment. Nowhere tonight did she say that Barack Obama is ready to lead. Millions of Hillary Clinton supporters and millions of Americans remain concerned about whether Barack Obama is ready to be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Democrats looked to day two of their convention, they were still debating what had happened on opening night.  An ailing Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (Mass.) electrified the crowd with a speech urging the party  to rally behind Obama, and the candidate's wife, Michelle, in the final speech of the night, made a powerful case that her husband's biography and values are widely shared by the American people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the general absence of criticism of McCain or Bush left some Democrats wondering whether they had sacrificed an opportunity to fire back at Republicans at a moment when one of the largest audiences of the campaign may be tuning in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama officials defended the scripting of Monday's program as necessary to begin filling in Obama's profile but said that as the week goes forward, the GOP will receive plenty of tough criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast to Monday's opening program, Tuesday's speakers criticized McCain and Bush. Democrats cast McCain as a clone of the president, out of touch with the lives of ordinary Americans and an advocate of economic policies that would widen the income gap between rich and poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, in whose state Obama's mother was born, called McCain a candidate who &quot;believes in country-club economics,&quot; who would privatize Social Security, and who has supported tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also mocked McCain for the number of houses that he and his wife, Cindy, own. &quot;Barack Obama has a plan to save the dream of homeownership for families who've lost their homes or fear they can never afford one -- unlike John McCain, who has so many he can't keep track of them all,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rendell, whose unscripted remarks earlier Tuesday may have created some heartburn for the Obama team, was fully on script when he appeared onstage in Denver, attacking McCain on energy policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you look past the speeches to his record, it's clear: John McCain has never believed in renewable energy, and he won't make it part of America's future,&quot; Rendell said. &quot;For all his talk, here's the truth: John McCain voted against establishing a national renewable-energy standard. He voted against tax incentives for renewable-energy companies. And for all his talk of drilling, he refused to endorse a bipartisan effort to expand domestic oil production because that bipartisan proposal would end tax breaks for Big Oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The night's speakers also included Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (Pa.), a prominent Obama supporter during the Democratic primaries. Sixteen years ago, his father, then governor of Pennsylvania, was denied a speaking slot in part because he opposed abortion rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama and I have an honest disagreement over the issue of abortion,&quot; Casey said Tuesday night. &quot;But the fact that I'm speaking here tonight is testament to Barack's ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Staff writers Shailagh Murray in Denver, Anne E. Kornblut with Obama and Michael D. Shear with McCain contributed to this report.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Mr. Obama and the Clintons; <BR>Beyond political differences, a legacy the Democratic nominee can build on</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A12</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">516 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NO DOUBT, when Sen. Barack Obama pictured the ideal nominating convention, he did not cast his wife and himself as bookends for Hillary and Bill Clinton. But that, at least from a scheduling perspective, is how things have turned out. Despite Mrs. Clinton's stirring appeal for Democratic unity last night, which the former president is likely to echo tonight, the focus on them and the persistent questions about party divisions are, if nothing else, a distraction from the story Mr. Obama would like to be presenting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, the media focus on the continuing Clinton drama may distort reality in a couple of ways, overstating the political significance of any party rift -- and obscuring the potential value of the Clinton legacy to an Obama campaign and presidency. As to the former, most Democrats probably will agree by Election Day with Mrs. Clinton's argument that electing one of their own  matters far more than nursing any bruises remaining from the primary campaign. Republican candidate John McCain's professed admiration for Supreme Court justices John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr.  alone is likely to be enough to bring most Clinton voters around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to the value of the legacy, the calculation is admittedly more complex. Bill Clinton's performance during the primary campaign, and the prospect of more during the next four years, probably explains more than any other factor why Mr. Obama did not even consider putting Hillary Clinton on his ticket. But Mr. Clinton is the only Democratic president to serve two full terms in the past 64 years, and his accomplishments could point a President Obama in some useful directions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're thinking here, as a prime example, of Mr. Clinton's understanding that America's future prosperity depends on a deepening economic and commercial engagement with the world. As president, Mr. Clinton communicated an understanding of the stresses globalization was placing on U.S. workers. But he insisted, and had fair success in bringing the country along with him, that the answer was not to turn inward but to improve education, expand research and in other ways enhance America's ability to compete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither Mr. Obama nor Hillary Clinton embraced that theme this year, and without question, the economic challenges the next president faces will differ from those that greeted Mr. Clinton in 1993. Wages have stagnated and inequality has worsened under President Bush; China's economy has continued its extraordinary growth; rising commodity prices and falling home  values have stoked  anxiety. Any comprehensive response to global challenges will have to include reform of pensions and health care as well as schools and worker training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to respond to today's anxiety by regressing on open trade and investment would guarantee more stagnation for American workers and continued poverty for hundreds of millions overseas. Mr. Clinton sought and often managed to convince  Americans that the global economy was an opportunity and not a threat. Whatever his legacy from this campaign, that legacy of his presidency should be built upon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton relished one final public embrace Tuesday from the millions who propelled her historic campaign, then rallied them behind the man who crushed her presidential aspirations in a rousing speech that declared &quot;it is time to take back the country&quot; from a failed Republican leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laying rest to a bitter primary battle that left many of her supporters - especially women - seething months later, Mrs. Clinton used her prime-time convention address to reassure her coalition of 18 million voters that Barack Obama and his running mate Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. would carry on her battle for universal health care, economic growth through green jobs and renewed American prestige abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She argued passionately that the Democratic ticket was a better alternative to Republican John McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You haven't worked so hard over the last 18 months, or endured the last eight years, to suffer through more failed leadership. No way, no how, no McCain,&quot; the first lady implored after being welcomed to the stage by her daughter Chelsea and an adoring, roaring crowd waving signs with her name on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama is my candidate, and he must be our president,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As her husband, former president Bill Clinton watched from a convention center box, Mrs. Clinton declared &quot;It is time to take back the country. ... We are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on the sidelines The time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, watching the speech from the campaign trail in Montana, said his onetime rival was &quot;outstanding.&quot; He spoke with both Clintons on the phone to thank her for the speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats also used the second night of their nominating convention to propel Virginia - normally an afterthought at Democratic conventions past - to the foreground of the fall election with a keynote address by former governor and current Senate candidate Mark Warner, a centrist Democrat with a proven record of winning in the South and a businessman's pragmatism on politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The race for the future is on, and it won't be won if only some Americans are in the running,&quot; Mr. Warner said, using themes he's pushed on the trail for years. &quot;It won't be won with yesterday's ideas and yesterday's divisions. And it won't be won with a president who's stuck in the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also showcased was prolife Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, an early Obama supporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama and I have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion. But the fact that I'm speaking here is testament to Barack's ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Monday's warm tribute to the ailing Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and a deeply personal speech from Michelle Obama about her husband and family, the tone on Day Two turned notably harsher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Mr. McCain aggressively wooing the blue-collar workers and women who supported Mrs. Clinton, the former first lady took the lead in attacking the Republican ticket as wrong for the country and a misguided continuation of George W. Bush's policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton said Mr. McCain is her friend, &quot;But we don't need four more years of the last eight years ... With an agenda like that, it makes sense that George Bush and John McCain will be together next week in the Twin Cities Because these days they're awfully hard to tell apart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within minutes of the end of her speech, Mr. McCain's campaign had responded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that Barack Obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief. Nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment. Nowhere tonight did she say that Barack Obama is ready to lead,&quot; spokesman Tucker Bounds said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaker after speaker on Tuesday night leveled withering attacks against Mr. McCain and his positions in an orchestrated effort to portray him as a wealthy Republican elitist detached from average Americans and determined to carry on in the footsteps of President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only thing green in John McCain's energy plans are the billions in tax breaks he'll be giving to oil companies,&quot; Pennsylvania Gov. Edward G. Rendell said. &quot;The only thing he'll recycle is George Bush's failed energy policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Casey added his dig as well: &quot;John McCain calls himself a maverick, but he votes with George Bush 90 percent of the time. That's not a maverick, that's a sidekick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates waved red signs blaring, &quot;McCain: More of the same,&quot; and booed as speakers rattled off the Republican's voting record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Clinton, who follows his wife by speaking Wednesday night, arrived in Denver and gave a short speech that made no mention of his past criticisms of Mr. Obama but which cast some doubt on the certainty of a fall victory</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Suppose for example you're a voter. And you've got candidate X and candidate Y. Candidate X agrees with you on everything, but you don't think that person can deliver on anything. Candidate Y disagrees with you on half the issues, but you believe that on the other half, the candidate will be able to deliver. For whom would you vote?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans, meanwhile, crashed the Democratic celebration. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, in the running to be Mr. McCain's running mate, led a GOP delegation to Denver and played the role of attack dog. &quot;Barack Obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but he's not ready to be president,&quot; Mr. Romney argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back at the convention hall, the finishing touches on Mr. Obama's nomination process were put in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Ken Salazar, Colorado Democrat, learned he will formally place the Illinois senator's name in for the nomination Wednesday night. That will follow the official nomination roll call of each state delegation, one that is expected to be cut short by Mrs. Clinton herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Clinton fund-raisers remain cool to Mr. Obama's candidacy, raising fears they might sit on the sidelines or even gravitate to Mr. McCain. But some on the floor Tuesday night seemed satisified to have heard a last word from the former first lady.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's a wonderful leader and has a great future ahead of her,&quot; said Rebecca Gladstone, a delegate from Oregon who used to be a Clinton supporter but has embraced Mr. Obama's candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told delegates and the national audience, amid hundreds of camera flashes, that her campaign was about her deep desire to &quot;renew the promise of America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She mentioned her key campaign promises of rebuilding the middle class and helping families save for college, a home and retirement, along with &quot;green collar jobs&quot; to fight global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But her passion on the campaign trail and Tuesday was focused on health care that should be &quot;universal, high quality and affordable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those are the reason I ran for president. Those are the reason I support Barack Obama,&quot; she said. &quot;And those are the reasons you should too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Together we made history,&quot; Mrs. Clinton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convention officials were telling people it was so crowded the fire marshalls would not allow anyone else in to the bowl or floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton, who received several minutes of solid, standing ovation, paid tribute to the people she met along the way on the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She thanked her female supporters, calling them &quot;my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the loudest applause lines was when she said she was &quot;a proud supporter of Barack Obama,&quot; and aides passed out bright blue signs reading &quot;Unity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speech, which quoted Harriet Tubman's &quot;Keep going,&quot; was tough and tender at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You taught me so much, you made me laugh, and you even made me cry,&quot; she said, a reference to her tears in a New Hampshire diner before the primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before we can keep going we've got to get going by electing Barack Obama,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton said Mrs. Obama will be &quot;a great first lady for America,&quot; and outlined her former rivals campaign promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clinton speech also fell on the 88th anniversary of the 19th amendment that guaranteed women the right to vote, a symbolic date that many Clinton supporters are using to justify the roll call vote despite Republicans eager to exploit party divisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton used the attack theme to rally her own backers to Mr. Obama, hoping to head off any overtures from Republicans this fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mrs. Clinton did not wither from her blistering attack, saying in an earlier speech to women activists that Mr. McCain &quot;still doesn't believe women deserve equal pay for equal work,&quot; an issue that was to be showcased Tuesday night on the convention stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He doesn't believe that women deserve the right to choose,&quot; Mrs. Clinton said. &quot;He would turn the clock back. ... The choice facing women in this election could not be clearer, the stakes could not be higher&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She got loud applause from the Emily's List gala when urging everyone who supported her candidacy to &quot;work as hard for Barack Obama as you did for me in the next months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's go make it happen,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For her evening speech, she was introduced by a biographical video created by the same Hollywood team - Harry Thomason and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason - that did the &quot;Man from Hope&quot; series of videos for her husband's nomination at the 1992 Democratic National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daughter Chelsea Clinton introduced her mom, a role with which she became comfortable in this campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton also paid tribute of her own to two friends recently struck by tragedy - Arkansas Democratic Party Chairman Bill Gwatney was shot and killed this month, just before Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio died from a sudden seizure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anne Price-Mills, a Washington state delegate, wept through the entire Clinton speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She would have made a great president,&quot; she said, wiping away tears. &quot;She did it as beautifully as she always has, she reached the people she needed to reach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All day, delegates signed petitions so the Clinton roll call vote will be formal and on the convention floor, not held in an off-site hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donna Brazile, D.C. superdelegate and former campaign chairman for Al Gore, led the charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did that in honor of Shirley Chisholm,&quot; the first woman to get a roll call vote at a convention, she said, her eyes glistening, paying tribute to other female trailblazers and the late Mrs. Tubbs Jones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did it because Barack Obama understands that a united Democratic Party is a victorious Democratic Party in 2008,&quot; she said. &quot;We will one day put a woman in the White House. Oh, yes we can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She received a standing ovation when pushing the convention's unity theme: &quot;Let's celebrate Hillary Clinton, and in November, let's elect Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not every woman in the room was on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ellen Malcolm of Emily's List told amembers of the Democratic Women's Caucus, &quot;I was such a proud supporter of Hillary Clinton, but I've got to tell you, right now, I'm fired up to elect Barack Obama president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But over the cheers and tambourines, a few boos could be heard from the back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the caucus, two women wearing Hillary shirts were overheard heatedly using the word &quot;Rezko,&quot; a reference to convicted Chicago real estate developer Tony Rezko, who has ties to Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton supporters voting for Mr. McCain led protests in downtown Denver. A man and woman with a megaphone shouted at delegates on the streets while riding through town standing in the sunroof of a Hummer that was painted with Obama insults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, we con,&quot; the SUV displayed. &quot;Obama's a fake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates who disagreed shouted &quot;Why, why?&quot; at the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some protesters held &quot;Nobama&quot; signs and claimed 3 million members, but there was little evidence the group has much strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suzette Young, a lifelong Democrat from Everett, Wash., said she will vote for Mr. McCain and there's nothing Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton can say to change her mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm that angry,&quot; she said, adding she'd come to the DNC &quot;to support Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama &quot;doesn't have any experience,&quot; she said. &quot;He's great at reading a teleprompter but when it comes to one-on-one debate it's blah, blah, blah. McCain will kill him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sen. Barbara Mikulski said women fighting for equal rights &quot;stood together,&quot; and the same philosophy applies for the Nov. 4 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the way we need to be now, shoulder to shoulder,&quot; she said. &quot;We've got to feel riled up, revved up and ready to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the repeated calls for unity, several delegates said they were worried about recent polls showing about one-third of Clinton supporters refuse to support Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keenly aware of the challenge, members of the Women's Caucus on Tuesday attempted to refocus the Obama-McCain race on abortion, saying the primary wounds must heal to prevent Mr. McCain from winning the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund and daughter of the late Texas governor and icon Ann Richards, showed a Planned Parenthood ad mocking Mr. McCain for not having an answer to a question about whether it is &quot;unfair&quot; that some insurance companies cover Viagra but not birth control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ad, Mr. McCain told a reporter, &quot;I don't know,&quot; when asked about the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm here to say that where women's health care is concerned, what he really means is, 'I don't care,'[TFI]&quot; Ms. Richards said. &quot;My mother would have said that women voting for John McCain would have been like chickens voting for Colonel Sanders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Biden, who formally accepts his vice presidential nomination with a keynote speech Wednesday, spoke to his home state of Delaware delegates, and admitted his talkative nature has sometimes been a problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's all out there in the clear public view,&quot; he said. &quot;My private life has been lived in the public arena because y'all got me started so young.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wiped away tears while thanking his friends and family, saying: &quot;The only reason I came by is to tell you that I love you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Women's Caucus earlier, hundreds of women shook bright-colored tambourines in honor of the &quot;first serious female contender for the White House,&quot; with key women leaders saying her bid opened doors for women everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just think, less than a century ago we didn't even have the right to vote,&quot; said Andrea Wong, CEO of Lifetime Networks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither presidential campaign can claim to be in the nation's cultural and economic mainstream - but they sure do try.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the fight for swing voters, both camps have gone into overdrive at trying to show who is more in tune with average Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Barack Obama and his campaign surrogates have been bashing John McCain for not knowing how many homes he and his wealthy wife, Cindy, have, while Michelle Obama portrayed herself and her husband Monday night as people of humble beginnings, with little money starting out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling her husband's life &quot;a great American story,&quot; she said both of them were raised with &quot;many of the same values&quot; of hard work, honesty and self-reliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign constantly reminds voters that the Obamas are wealthy, Harvard-educated lawyers who met at a law firm when they started out of college. She became a well-paid hospital administrator. He went into politics and made millions of dollars on two best-selling books about his life that gave them the means to buy a mansion in Chicago and enjoy an elite lifestyle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign ads frequently remind voters of Mr. Obama's remarks this year at a posh San Francisco fundraiser that it was not a surprise that rural, small-town people &quot;cling to guns, religion or antipathy&quot; because they are &quot;bitter&quot; over their economic circumstances. His remarks were &quot;elitist&quot; and showed he was out of touch with ordinary Americans, McCain surrogates said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama camp struck back Monday with two attack ads, one of which cited Mr. McCain's December remark that economics was &quot;not something I've understood as well as I should.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats denied the Obama camp was playing class warfare, but acknowledged the crossfire has intensified and will likely get hotter in the weeks to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wouldn't say it's hand-to-hand combat or class warfare, but they sure have ratcheted it up a bit,&quot; said Democratic media strategist Bud Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign has been hitting Mr. Obama with new TV or Internet attack ads almost every week this month, defining him as out of touch with Americans on skyrocketing oil and gas prices as well as taxes, and the freshman senator's polls have been falling as a result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats have to improve on punching back hard,&quot; Mr. Jackson told The Washington Times on Tuesday. Other Democrats here expressed similar frustrations this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With both candidates accusing the other of being elitist and out of touch with the everyday lives of working people, a new battleground poll showed Mr. McCain edging ahead of or gaining on Mr. Obama in three key states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, for example, the Arizona Republican was leading his rival by 47 percent to 43 percent, according to the Quinnipiac University survey conducted from Aug. 17 to 24. Mr. Obama had a slight lead in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain was leading among independents by eight percentage points, white voters by 20 points and Catholics by 22 points. Mr. Obama wins almost all black voters and leads among voters younger than 35 by 19 points, but loses older voters to Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ohio, the race remains a dead heat with Mr. McCain edging ahead 44 percent to 43 percent, revealing a slight decline for Mr. Obama. Whites back Mr. McCain by 11 percentage points, but his opponent has a 14-point lead among women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Pennsylvania, a state that has voted reliably Democratic in recent presidential elections, Mr. Obama's lead has shrunk slightly since June. Mr. McCain now trails him by seven points, 49 percent to 42 percent. Mr. Obama lost the Pennsylvania primary to Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, and about a third to half of her supporters have told pollsters they either will vote for Mr. McCain or will not vote at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic pollsters say their surveys are showing similar weaknesses in Mr. Obama's numbers, blaming the shift on Mr. McCain's fierce offensive campaign and the Obama campaign's tepid ad responses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The central challenge for Obama is to start defining the choice in this race on his terms, and putting McCain on defense,&quot; Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said last week in her analysis for the bipartisan Battleground Poll.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carolyn Brown-Spiller's pale-yellow shirt said it all: Hillary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sen. Barack Obama will leave the Democratic National Convention here as the party's nominee for president. But Brown-Spiller, a Louisiana delegate, plans to vote tomorrow for Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'll vote for the Democratic candidate in November,&quot; she said. &quot;Here, I'll vote for Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an attempt to placate Clinton supporters such as Brown-Spiller, Obama agreed to allow Clinton's name to be placed in a roll-call vote for the nomination tomorrow night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clinton said yesterday that she won't tell her backers how to vote but that she will vote for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A CBS News/New York Times poll released Sunday found some of the Clinton delegates still are upset over her defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So the Democrats were orchestrating a deal that would provide a state-by-state vote for the presidential nominee, during which Clinton delegates could support her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the voting would be cut off after several states, the officials said, perhaps ending with New York, when Clinton herself would call for nomination of Obama by acclamation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brown-Spiller bristles at the idea that Clinton supporters should step in line behind Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's not my job to unify the party,&quot; she said. &quot;It's his.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clinton publicly is urging the party to come together, despite reports of continuing clashes between her camp and Obama's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement released yesterday after Sen. John McCain, the probable Republican nominee, began running ads featuring Clinton criticizing Obama during the primaries, Clinton reiterated her support for the likely nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Every one of us could stand up and recite all the reasons why we must elect Barack,&quot; she said. &quot;So let there be the no mistake about it, we are united. We are united for change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a breakfast for New York Democrats, she took her own shot at McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Now I understand that the McCain campaign is running ads trying to divide us. I'm Hillary Clinton, and I do not approve that message,&quot; she said, to laughter and applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama, for his part, said in Iowa yesterday that both Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, &quot;couldn't have been more clear&quot; in their support for his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some Democratic women - many of whom were Clinton supporters - say too much is being made about a possible rift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several Clinton delegates said they were unhappy McCain was using their &quot;family fight&quot; against Obama, particularly in an ad released Sunday about Clinton being passed over as the vice presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It makes me sad,&quot; said Pam Durham, a Clinton delegate from Fort Worth, Texas, who has not yet embraced Obama. &quot;It may unite our party against the outsider.... What he said was the truth, but it may unite us against him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Whatever Hillary says, we'll do,&quot; said Pam Wallace, president-elect of the Alabama Federation of Democratic Women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was elected as a Hillary delegate, so whatever she says.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hazel Rigby will support Hillary Rodham Clinton until her dying day, and even after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The New York senator cemented a place in Rigby's psyche decades ago, when Clinton's school-improvement efforts as first lady of Arkansas impressed the teacher from Alexandria, Va.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rigby became an ardent supporter of Clinton, and after months of campaigning for Clinton's unsuccessful presidential bid, her loyalty is unwavering. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wearing her delicate silver &quot;Hillary&quot; pin, she proudly will pledge her support to Clinton when her name is placed into nomination for the presidency at the Democratic National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm 72, and I thought I'd see the first woman president before I die,&quot; Rigby said. &quot;I want it on my tombstone that I supported Hillary Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Clinton addresses the convention tonight in Denver, and when her name is placed in nomination, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama's campaign will gauge whether Clinton supporters such as Rigby will be on board in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The campaign of presumptive Republican nominee John McCain has released an ad that features a former Clinton supporter who now plans to vote for McCain, saying others will too and that &quot;it's OK, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And according to a USA Today/Gallup poll, 30 percent of Clinton's supporters in the primaries say they will back McCain, someone else or no one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">***************</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rigby is an example of how Clinton supporters in the Virginia delegation, like those in the rest of the country, vary in coming to terms with Clinton's defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While many delegates interviewed for this article said they are on board with Obama and are working to unify the party and win the White House, others are not ready.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rigby hopes to find catharsis when she casts her pledge to Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I haven't turned the page yet,&quot; she said. &quot;I will never leave her in spirit and mind, but I am going to work to make Virginia blue&quot; when she returns home from the convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are mixed feelings in the Virginia delegation about putting Clinton's name in nomination. Some say it promotes unity, and others say unity is getting on board with Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Juan Carlos Perez, a Virginia delegate from Leesburg, is not excited about seeing Clinton's name put in nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I would rather not,&quot; he said. &quot;Just to not walk that fine line again. We have to move forward. We don't have much time here, and we have to unify the party and strengthen the party unity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Perez respects the feelings of people such as Virginian Elizabeth Chitwood, 22, who believes putting Clinton's name into nomination is an important honor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chitwood supported Clinton until the delegate math started to work against the New York senator and then she switched her support to Obama. The Radford University senior and pledged delegate for Clinton from Pulaski County senses there still are some hurt feelings to salve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think there's some work to do, not to say these obstacles are insurmountable,&quot; she said, adding that placing Clinton's name in nomination &quot;is critical because she's done extraordinary work in her public life and she deserves such an honor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The act &quot;doesn't magnify any problems. It just honors her public service,&quot; Chitwood said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">***************</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clinton would not be the first woman whose name was placed formally in nomination by a major party. Others include Maine Sen. Margaret Chase Smith at the 1964 Republican convention and New York Rep. Shirley Chisholm at the 1972 Democratic convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Katherine Pino of Falls Church, Va., who is not a convention delegate, said she still is not sure about Obama and came to Denver to learn more about him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said Obama's &quot;rock-star&quot; status gives her some pause, because that might not translate into leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't know a lot about Obama,&quot; she said. &quot;My heart is with Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Edward M. Kennedy issued a summons to fellow Democrats to rally behind Sen. Barack Obama's quest for the White House during a poignant opening Monday to a party convention in search of unity for the fall campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack will finally bring the change we need,&quot; seconded Obama's wife, Michelle, casting her husband as a leader with classic American values. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She pledged he would end the war in Iraq, revise a sputtering economy and extend health care to all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats opened their four-day convention as polls underscored the closeness of the race with Republican Sen. John McCain. Obama faces lingering divisions from a fierce battle with Hillary Rodham Clinton for the nomination, tough ads by McCain and his Republican allies, and a reminder that racism, too, could play a role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are people who are not going to vote for him because he's black,&quot; James Hoffa, president of the Teamsters union, said in an interview . &quot;And we've got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests No. 1.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kennedy and Obama's wife were the bookends of an evening that left the delegates cheering .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The work begins anew, the hope rises again and the dream lives on,&quot; Kennedy said , reprising the final line of a 1980 speech that brought a different convention to its feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator has been undergoing treatment for a malignant brain tumor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's wife said it was time to &quot;stop doubting and start dreaming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments later, Barack Obama appeared via satellite from Missouri, drawing cheers .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of their first orders of business, delegates ratified a party platform tailored to Obama's specifications. It backs &quot;complete redeployment within 16 months from Iraq,&quot; as well as health care for all, a new economic stimulus package and higher taxes on families earning more than $250,000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay, and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is scheduled to deliver his acceptance speech Thursday at a football stadium, before a crowd likely to total 75,000 or more. Then he and Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, his vice presidential running mate, depart for the fall campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the opening night's convention program had a feel-good quality, not so the intensifying campaign outside the hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama struggled to quash a television commercial financed by an independent Republican group that linked him to a 1960s-era radical - before it could damage his candidacy as the infamous Swift Boat ads helped sink John Kerry four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also shipped a new commercial that used humor to depict McCain as an extension of the Bush administration, the latest in a series of negative advertisements by both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Really can't explain the price of gas, or what has happened to the middle class,&quot; the announcer sings to the tune of Sam Cooke's &quot;Wonderful World.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With McCain and Bush appearing together on the screen, the announcer says, &quot;Do we really want four more years of the same old tune?&quot;<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">opening day</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howard Dean, the party chairman, rapped the opening gavel on schedule at 3 p.m. Mountain time - before only a smattering of delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are ready to compete in all 50 states in November,&quot; he said. Michelle Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wife of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama spoke on the first night of the convention.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the way to Election Day 2008, the following has happened:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is there  such a thing as toxic love? In recent days, Republicans have been loving them some Hillary Rodham Clinton, calling her wise and prescient and all sorts of things they presumably wouldn't be calling her if she'd won the Democratic nomination. After releasing an ad suggesting that Clinton was &quot;passed over&quot; as Barack Obama's veep pick because she told &quot;the truth&quot; and Obama didn't like it, McCain's camp released another ad yesterday featuring Debra Bartoshevich, a &quot;proud Hillary Clinton Democrat&quot; (but no longer Wisconsin delegate) who praises Clinton's &quot;experience and judgment&quot; and then announces that for the first time in her life, she's decided to support a Republican. (Guess who?) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Wineke, chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, offered few loving words for the turncoat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people I think that are most angry at Ms. Bartoshevich are Clinton delegates because it puts a pox on all of them,&quot; Wineke said yesterday from Denver. He added: &quot;She can do what she wants. She was stripped of her status.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the RNC just released an ad featuring clips of Clinton praising McCain's experience -- and dissing Obama's lack of it. &quot;Was she right?&quot; the ad asks ominously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton = oracle? (Or, Hillary Clinton = perfect foil?)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton spurned her suitors yesterday in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am Hillary Clinton, and I do not approve that message,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER, Aug. 25</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anxiety comes in several forms, but particularly common is the pained look, followed by the quick glance away and the lengthy pause, in the face of a simple question: How is Barack Obama doing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ahhh . . .,&quot; said Barry Bogarde, political director for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in Pennsylvania, a battleground state that the senator from Illinois needs to win. &quot;Better,&quot; he finally said. &quot;He's doing better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked how things are going for Democrats in New Hampshire, another swing state that the party carried in 2004, the state party chairman, Ray Buckley, did not even mention Obama's race against Sen. John McCain. He talked instead about efforts to win a Senate race and hold two congressional seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Beasley, the commissioner of Ohio's Department of Transportation, did not have high hopes for Obama in his area of southern Ohio. &quot;Ahhh, well. Rural Ohio will be difficult,&quot; he said. &quot;Rural areas are difficult for him.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Democrats kicked off a convention designed to unite support behind Obama, interviews with several dozen delegates pointed to an undercurrent of anxiety among many from key swing states who will be charged with leading the push in their communities. They expressed doubts bordering on bewilderment: Why, in a year that had been shaping up as a watershed for Democrats, amid an economic downturn and an unpopular Republican presidency, is the race so tight?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sentiment is strongest among former supporters of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, though it is not limited to them. While many say they now back Obama -- a New York Times-CBS poll of delegates showed widespread support -- they are candid about the challenges they say he faces in their states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some have also shown signs of still being focused on the Democratic primaries and not being fully invested in the general-election effort. On Sunday night, Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland echoed recent comments by Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell that media coverage during the primaries had been biased in Obama's favor. And several top Clinton advisers will not be staying in Denver to see Obama accept the nomination, according to sources familiar with their schedules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A CNN-Opinion Research Corp. poll of registered voters released Sunday found that roughly two-thirds of self-identified Clinton supporters are now backing Obama, while 27 percent said they will vote for McCain. Other polls have shown Obama receiving less support from Clinton backers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, many delegates here confidently shared the campaign's assurance that all is going according to plan. They argued that polls understate Obama's strength because they miss many of his younger supporters who use cellphones, and that many voters are only now tuning in to the election. Judy Byrne Riley, a delegate from Niceville, Fla., said she is impressed by the excitement about Obama in her mostly Republican area. &quot;He can carry the state,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates were interviewed at state get-togethers, at targeted events such as rural and African American caucuses, and on the street. They largely represented the swing states where the last few elections were decided -- Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida, as well as New Hampshire and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegates offered plenty of advice, such as urging Obama to deliver a more visceral message on the economy to win over stressed working-class voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's got to kick [butt] a little more about it,&quot; said Bill George, a former steelworker from western Pennsylvania who is the president of the state chapter of the AFL-CIO. Acknowledging that Obama's style may be too cerebral for that, George said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., Obama's pick for running mate, could serve that role. &quot;He's going to go run across this state and kick John McCain from one side to the other,&quot; George said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for some delegates, the concern is a more fundamental one: They do not share Obama's confidence that he can overcome the resistance many voters may have to electing a black president with an unusual background and name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some, such as Rendell, worry aloud about the &quot;Bradley effect&quot; -- the theory, disputed by some political scientists, that voters are likely to tell pollsters they will support a black candidate even though they don't intend to. With a little more than two months to go until Election Day, some of these most ardent and veteran Democrats have not bought into the idealism that has driven the campaign from the start and are unsure whether their neighbors and co-workers are ready for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't want to play the race card, but it's out there,&quot; Bogarde said. He, like others, said he hopes Obama's selection of Biden would help get wary voters over the hump, with Biden acting as an emissary to communities like his native Scranton, Pa. &quot;I just think the trade and labor movement was not ready for some of the major changes we're looking at&quot; in Obama, Bogarde said. &quot;Biden's close to the trades, and it plays better with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bogarde's superior, AFSCME President Gerald W. McEntee, was more blunt. &quot;It shouldn't be as close as it is now. It just seems to me it shouldn't be that close. It should be a no-brainer,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union spent heavily on Clinton's campaign before lining up behind Obama, but McEntee insisted that his concern about the closeness of the race is not meant as an &quot;I told you so.&quot; Other Clinton supporters here also sought to put their apprehension in context, saying that it was possible that had the senator from New York won the primaries, she would be facing her own tough fights in key states because of her polarizing effect on many voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Hamilton, a Clinton supporter who works for the Ohio Federation of Teachers, linked Obama's challenges in the state to the resistance that other Democratic presidential candidates have faced in trying to trump social issues with economic ones. &quot;I really think it still has to do with 'Gods, guns and gays.' You bring in his race, and the Muslim rumor, all these things are factors that are easy to play out in the rural areas,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Obama's most senior advisers acknowledged the angst among Democratic insiders that the race has remained so close, but suggested that it is normal for a party on the cusp of winning the White House after eight years of the Bush administration. &quot;In politics, only the paranoid survive,&quot; said former Senate majority leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.). &quot;At the end of the day, even though I'm anxious, I'm still confident we're going to win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daschle emphasized the need to pull off a smooth convention, then have Obama judged the winner of the debates. After that, he said, a superior get-out-the-vote effort by Obama's campaign should translate into an Election Day victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Joe Turnham, chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party, said Democrats are still mired in a period in which they have to &quot;make everybody feel affirmed, especially the Hillary people.&quot; This has left the Obama campaign too focused on appeasing Democrats rather than focusing on independents and Republicans who have grown disaffected by the Bush administration. &quot;We need to be talking to each other, but we also need to be talking to America,&quot; Turnham said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worry extends to some rank-and-file Obama supporters, such as John Crenshaw, a real estate investor from Birmingham, Ala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're all anxious,&quot; he said. The last month of political coverage in the media, he said, has centered on &quot;tabloid&quot; issues of the extramarital affair of former senator John Edwards (D-N.C.), charges from the McCain campaign that Obama is an elitist and the run-up to Biden's selection. All this has knocked the Obama campaign from focusing the debate on the issues of ending the Iraq war and turning around the economy. &quot;We're not talking about any of that -- and it's crazy,&quot; Crenshaw said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the anxiety about racial resistance to Obama rankles some African American delegates here. They note that he has already made it much further than most expected him to, and warn against using worries about his race as an excuse not to work all- out in trying to win over undecided voters. Tony Hill, a state senator from Jacksonville, said he understands that delegates do not want to be overconfident, but noted that the campaign has registered hundreds of thousands of voters in Florida alone, and has far outpaced McCain in fundraising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lynette Bryant, a physician from Little Rock, said delegates are not keeping up the idealism that drove the campaign this far. &quot;We're going to win. They should take a deep breath,&quot; she said. &quot;Faith is a belief that will carry us through what needs to be done. And it must be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER Aug. 25</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After an emotional speech by an ailing Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, the face of the Democratic Party shifted on Monday night to a new generation of leaders, as Michelle Obama opened the Democratic National Convention with a tribute to her husband and a call to the country to listen &quot;to our hopes instead of our fears,&quot; and &quot;to stop doubting and to start dreaming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seeking to ground Sen. Barack Obama in the experience of America's working class while recapturing the lofty ideals that propelled him toward his party's presidential nomination, Michelle Obama's family-themed speech was the climax of a dramatic opening day for a political party confident of its chances of capturing the White House but still struggling to lay aside its own divisions. A weak economy and a war in Iraq now in its sixth year have offered Democrats and their young candidate an ideal political environment in which to push for widespread change. But Obama has yet to close the deal with the electorate, or even some of the Democrats who backed his primary opponent, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But once the curtain raised on a raucous Pepsi Center, the party appeared poised to come together. The delegates cheered every mention of Clinton and gave the same treatment to Obama's running mate, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (Del.), and the party's 2004 nominee, Sen. John F. Kerry (Mass.). Kennedy, who has a brain tumor but appeared spry in a surprise appearance, offered a poignant moment of reflection on the last time a youthful Democrat won the White House. To thunderous applause, he promised to be present in the Senate in January to greet a new Democratic president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The work begins anew. The hope rises again, and the dream lives on,&quot; he said, echoing his speech from the 1980 Democratic convention, in which he was denied the party's nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michelle Obama also did her part to try to heal the lingering wounds of the long struggle for the nomination when she recognized Clinton, &quot;who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling, so that our daughters -- and our sons -- can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the stream of new faces -- including Michelle Obama's brother, Craig Robinson, and freshman Sen. Claire McCaskill (Mo.), one of the candidate's fiercest supporters -- and a rousing anthem from John Legend, who helped craft the viral music videos that have powered the Obama movement, signaled that the torch is  changing hands. Caroline Kennedy tried to bridge that generational shift when she told the crowd, &quot;I have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them, but I do now: Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Michelle Obama took to the podium, she was greeted with sustained applause and a sea of blue &quot;Michelle&quot; placards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack doesn't care where you're from, or what your background is, or what party -- if any -- you belong to. That's not how he sees the world,&quot; she said. &quot;He knows that thread that connects us -- our belief in America's promise, our commitment to our children's future -- is strong enough to hold us together as one nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After she finished, daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, met her onstage, where they were soon joined by her husband via a video link from Kansas City, Mo., where he watched the speech at the home of Jim and Alicia Girardeau. &quot;You were unbelievable,&quot; he said, &quot;and you look pretty cute,&quot; to which Sasha replied, &quot;Thanks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michelle Obama's task was to reintroduce her husband to the nation as the candidate most capable of responding to the struggles of ordinary Americans, weary of war and beset by debt, division and fears of decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though he had this funny name, even though he'd grown up all the way across the continent, in Hawaii, his family was so much like mine,&quot; she recalled of the man who courted her as a young lawyer. &quot;He was raised by grandparents who were working-class folks just like my parents, and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did. And like my family, they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves. And Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you're going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing &quot;where the current of history meets this new tide of hope,&quot; the woman who would be the first African American first lady looked ahead to an evening when her daughters would tell their children about the 2008 election, and &quot;how this time, in this great country -- where a girl from the South Side of Chicago can go to college and law school, and the son of a single mother from Hawaii can go all the way to the White House -- we committed ourselves to building the world as it should be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the anti-Republican red meat was left for an unlikely source, soft-spoken former GOP congressman Jim Leach of Iowa, who hailed Obama as &quot;a transcendent candidate&quot; as he criticized his own party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The party that once emphasized individual rights has gravitated in recent years toward regulating values,&quot; Leach said. &quot;The party of military responsibility has taken us to war with a country that did not attack us. The party that formerly led the world in arms control has moved to undercut treaties crucial to the defense of the Earth. The party that prides itself on conservation has abdicated its responsibilities in the face of global warming. And the party historically anchored in fiscal restraint has nearly doubled the national debt, squandering our precious resources in an undisciplined and unprecedented effort to finance a war with tax cuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning in Iowa, Obama tried to ease his party's divisions, conceding that &quot;there are going to be some of Senator Clinton's supporters who we're going to have to work hard to persuade to come on board -- that's not surprising.&quot; But, he added: &quot;If you take a look this week, I am absolutely convinced that both Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton understand the stakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the nerves were not easily calmed ahead of Hillary  Clinton's speech on Tuesday and Bill Clinton's appearance on Wednesday. Hillary Clinton addressed the New York delegation at a breakfast in the morning. But while supporters waved signs declaring &quot;Hillary Made History,&quot; the senator's focus was on the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were not all on the same side as Democrats, but we are now,&quot; she said. &quot;We are united and we are together and we are determined.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton is expected to release her delegates to Obama on Tuesday. That  symbolic gesture  reduces the prospects for major disruptions when the roll is called to nominate the senator from Illinois -- a historic moment when Obama will become the first black politician to head a major party's national ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Divisions clearly remain, however, and the campaign of Republican Sen. John McCain did its best to foment unrest. It released  a new advertisement featuring Wisconsin delegate Debra Bartoshevich declaring herself &quot;a proud Hillary Clinton Democrat&quot; who for the first time is supporting a Republican, McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of Democrats will vote McCain,&quot; she says in the spot. &quot;It's okay, really.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton repudiated the ad in her appearance before the New York delegation, saying: &quot;I'm Hillary Clinton, and I do not approve that message.&quot; But Howard Wolfson, who was her communications director, went public with the grievances her husband is still nursing. Writing in  the New Republic, Wolfson said the former president &quot;feels like the Obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administration's accomplishments. And he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolfson made it clear that he thinks it is Obama who needs to make amends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Obama would go a long way towards healing these wounds if he were to specifically praise the accomplishments of the Clinton presidency in a line or two during his speech on Thursday,&quot; he concluded. &quot;That should be painless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff writers Shailagh Murray in Denver and Anne E. Kornblut, traveling with Obama, contributed to this report.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forget soccer moms, security moms and NASCAR dads - the ultimate swing group this year may be the former party stalwarts each campaign is angling to poach from the other party, and chief among those are supporters of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Sen. John McCain struck first, with Republicans deploying surrogates and running a new commercial featuring a Clinton delegate who was ousted from the Democrats' nominating convention and is now supporting Mr. McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am exactly like millions of other Clinton supporters. I do believe people will come out and support Senator McCain,&quot; said Debra Bartoshevich, a Clinton supporter and one-time delegate who was kicked off the convention list earlier this summer after she said Sen. Barack Obama wasn't qualified to be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know there are more delegates. I spoke to a lot of delegates who are in the same position I am in, but they are not ready to come out yet,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama counters this week with speeches from the convention by two Republicans, former Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa and Jim Whitaker, mayor of Fairbanks, Alaska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning in Davenport, Iowa, at an event designed to persuade independents and Republicans to support him, Mr. Obama was introduced by longtime Republican Randy Wehrman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans across the country like myself are just as eager as Democrats an independents to elect a leader with new ideas and a proven ability to work with all sides,&quot; Mr. Wehrman said. &quot;To some here today, at one time that person might have been John McCain, and it might have been for me, too, back in 2000 [when he was] the self-described original maverick. However, I imagine the reason you are sitting here today is because you are wondering, like myself, what happened to the maverick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going after the other party's voters is standard practice, and both parties like to have prominent crossover figures speak at their conventions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this year the competition is more intense. On the one hand, polls show fewer voters identify as Republicans than did four years ago, while on the other side, Mrs. Clinton has shined a spotlight on a group of Democrats uneasy with Mr. Obama as their nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans are trying to exploit that opening, scoring their biggest coup in having Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, the 2000 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, speak at their convention's opening night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also brought four Democrats to Denver on Monday, at least three of them former Clinton supporters, to explain why they are backing Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have been a Democrat for over 30 years. I have been a lifelong Hispanic. Well, Obama has ignored us. He does not even know we are around,&quot; said Silverio Salazar, a former Democratic Party activist in Pueblo, Colo., whose cousins are Sen. Ken Salazar and Rep. John Salazar, both of whom are supporting Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I strongly feel it's our duty and our obligation to get out there and let these Democrats and these Hispanics know, it's OK, you don't have to vote Democratic just because your ancestors did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carly Fiorina, a top adviser to Mr. McCain, has been traveling the country to try to build support for the Republican among women, Democrats and independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett said Monday she is using some of her time in Denver doing counterprogramming with women who had supported Mrs. Clinton, working to convince them to support the Illinois senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are women who really wanted to hear directly from someone who knew Senator Obama to try to answer their questions and their reservations that they had,&quot; she said during a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton, in an attempt to dismiss any lingering doubts about where her support lies, said she would release her delegates, freeing them to vote for Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are gathered here in Denver for a very clear and simple purpose, and that is to come out of this convention energized and excited and ready to elect Barack Obama as the next president of the United States,&quot; Mrs. Clinton said at the New York state Democratic delegation breakfast. &quot;And now what I ask each and every one [of my supporters] is to work as hard for Barack and Joe Biden as you worked for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Mrs. Clinton stopped short of telling her backers how to vote, saying that she understands her supporters' frustrations and realizes some of her delegates won't heed her request to support Mr. Obama. She said she &quot;doesn't know&quot; what to do to convince those in her delegation who refuse to support Mr. Obama. &quot;I'm doing everything I can possibly do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the delegates began to filter in to the Pepsi Center on Monday afternoon, the man proudly wearing his Hillary T-shirt was hard to miss. Michael Wagner, a delegate from Washington state, was one of those who fought to ensure Mrs. Clinton's name would be placed into nomination here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his pro-Clinton stance doesn't have to mean anti-Obama, but he said he doesn't think the presumptive Democratic nominee has enough experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel that at age 47 you should have some accomplishments to show the work you have been doing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A CNN poll released this weekend found that just 66 percent of Democrats who wanted to see Mrs. Clinton as their nominee are backing Mr. Obama, which is down from 75 percent at the end of June. Of the others, 27 percent say they'll support Mr. McCain, up from 16 percent in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning in Iowa, Mr. Obama said there is ground to make up among some Clinton supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's not surprising,&quot; he said, but he said Mrs. Clinton and her husband can help this week with their own convention speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am absolutely convinced that both Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton understand the stakes. They understand that if we keep on doing the same things that we are doing, which is what John McCain intends, that the American family is going to have a harder time paying the bills,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest polls ought to alarm Barack Obama. The Illinois senator desperately needs to change the narrative of the last few months - and this week's Democratic convention is a good opportunity. Since he captured the nomination in June, he has made a string of costly errors which have resulted in squandering his previous lead over John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC poll reveals that the race is now a statistical tie: Mr. Obama has 45 percent support in contrast to Mr. McCain's 42 percent support. Since last month, Mr. McCain has closed Mr. Obama's six-point lead. This trend is confirmed in other national polls that indicate the candidates are tied. John Zogby's latest poll even has Mr. McCain leading Mr. Obama by 46 percent to 41 percent - and Mr. McCain has a nine-point lead as better able to handle the economy, too. Even more striking: According to the George Washington/Battleground 2008 poll, Mr. Obama has lost his lead among independent voters. The Arizona senator is now favored by independents by a 45 to 35 percent margin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama began to lose support when it became clear that he was not the &quot;new kind of politician&quot; he has been touting. His glaring flip-flops have led voters to question his sincerity and his competence. He has appeared weak and unsure of himself in addressing a number of key issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he positioned himself for the general election, Mr. Obama flip-flopped on the The North American Free Trade Agreement, on public financing of his election campaign, on his willingness to meet rogue leaders, on whether Jerusalem ought to be divided, on the D.C. gun ban, on granting immunity to telecommunications companies for wire-tapping and on offshore drilling. He even stated that his Iraq policy, the centerpiece of his campaign for the Democratic nomination, would be further &quot;refined&quot; according to events on the ground. Rather than strengthening his candidacy, these reversals or evasions, which came in rapid succession, took the bloom off the rose of his candidacy. His &quot;movement&quot; came to a screeching standstill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama was further weakened by his positions on foreign affairs. During his Mideast/European tour, in an interview with CBS' Katie Couric, he acknowledged that the Iraq surge contributed to declining violence but that he had not been wrong in his previous opposition to it. His response made little sense. His speech in Berlin, before a massive audience, contained so many puzzling references to &quot;world&quot; leadership and so much flowery language that it provided the McCain campaign with a golden opportunity: Mr. Obama could be an object of ridicule. The McCain campaign unleashed an ad in which Mr. Obama is presented as a celebrity - akin to Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. The McCain camp also issued ads in which Mr. Obama is mocked as &quot;The One&quot; ; this makes light of his messianic persona. Mr. Obama's eloquence is now being used as a boomerang against him: he is being pegged as a lightweight who makes incomprehensible statements. In response, Mr. Obama has been uncharacteristically flat-footed. He has not yet adequately rebutted these charges, nor has he addressed the fundamental question raised during his world tour: As commander-in-chief, whose interests will come first, America's or the world's? Is he, in the final analysis, a globalist who will be unable to defend America's national interest?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's image was further battered by his response during the crisis in Georgia - he appeared weak and timid in contrast to Mr. McCain's more robust stand. The latest Wall Street Journal/ NBC poll, taken after the Georgia crisis, reveals that 52 percent of voters say that Mr. McCain would be better than Mr. Obama on &quot;international crises such as Iran or Russia and the nation of Georgia.&quot; Only 27 percent say that Mr. Obama is better on these issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama was also not as effective as Mr. McCain during the Aug. 16 debate in Saddleback Church in California, hosted by the Rev. Rick Warren. Mr. Obama's responses were long-winded and overly-nuanced; whereas Mr. McCain was crisp, concise and decisive. Mr. Obama stumbled in response to the question of when life begins and said that was above his &quot;pay grade.&quot; Again, he appeared inept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has now chosen Sen. Joseph Biden as his running mate and will conclude the convention with another speech before another mammoth audience. Yet, trouble continues to loom. His vice-presidential pick is a long-time senator who contradicts his anti-Washington, change message. And the convention will highlight the Clintons - who have undermined Mr. Obama at every turn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illinois senator is learning an important political lesson this summer. Momentum, is like youth: once lost, it is very difficult to recover.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama says his acceptance speech for the presidential nomination Thursday will not attempt soaring rhetoric but offer a &quot;workmanlike&quot; outline of policies that draw a stark distinction with Republican Sen. John McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to make the choice between myself and John McCain as clear as possible,&quot; Mr. Obama said Monday while campaigning in Iowa. &quot;I want people to understand that John McCain intends to continue the Bush economic policies that have resulted in record foreclosures and flat incomes and wages for middle-class Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his speech also will seek to better define his personal narrative for voters, likely continuing his new &quot;regular guy&quot; theme on the stump that courts working-class voters who may have lingering suspicions about his character and his exotic upbringing. He stresses that before his recent political success, he was a middle-class family man worried about paying off college student loans and saving for his daughters' education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the course of a 19-month campaign, I think that you are on the television screen [or] you are in big auditoriums but sometimes who you are may get lost,&quot; Mr. Obama told reporters at the Quad Cities Airport before flying to stay here overnight. &quot;I want people to come away saying, 'Whether I'm voting for the guy or against the guy, I know what he stands for. I know where he comes from. I know what he believes.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But mostly he wants voters to understand how he differs from Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am confident that if the American people know what my plan for America is and what John McCain's plan for America is, I will win this race,&quot; Mr. Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has been pummeled by Republican ads painting him as an inexperienced celebrity, as his poll lead evaporated and the race became tied. Democrats are using this week's convention to go on offense, releasing a Web video showing Mr. McCain acknowledging he usually sides with President Bush on the major issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not going to make the same mistake we did in '04,&quot; a Democratic official familiar with the ad said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats erred at their 2004 convention and during the entire campaign of Sen. John Kerry that year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was emblematic of the campaign not being as critical as it needed to be, early enough,&quot; she said. &quot;Myself, I would have had it be about the Iraq war and not the Vietnam War. ... We'll know at the election whether we were tough enough&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, whose meteoric rise in national politics began with his stirring keynote speech at the 2004 convention, said the speech Thursday will be &quot;a more workmanlike speech&quot; that does not aim for &quot;a lot of high rhetoric.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is touring swing states, including Wisconsin and Iowa, in the run-up to his acceptance speech Thursday at Denver's Invesco Field at Mile High. He plans campaign stops here Tuesday and in Billings, Mont., on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John McCain's campaign suggested yesterday that rival Barack Obama snubbed Hillary Rodham Clinton as his running mate because of her criticism during the battle for the Democratic nomination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While McCain had no public schedule yesterday, he told CBS News that Biden was a &quot;wise selection&quot; who will be formidable. But the Arizona senator was critical of the Obama-Biden ticket on foreign policy, citing disagreements with Biden's decision to vote against the first Gulf War as well as his position that Iraq should be divided &quot;into three different countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama's campaign dismissed the claim about snubbing Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Campaigning in the battleground state of Wisconsin, Obama said he was &quot;absolutely convinced&quot; fellow senator Biden was right for the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He's got the passion to lift up middle-class Americans, he hasn't forgotten his working-class roots, he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up,&quot; Obama told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Previewing the week ahead, he said he hoped convention viewers would conclude, &quot; 'He's sort of like us. He comes from a middle-class background, went to school on scholarships. He and his wife had to figure out child care and how to start a college fund for their kids.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama was also planning campaign stops in Iowa, Missouri and Montana before the nomination becomes his Thursday in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since Biden's selection on Saturday, the McCain campaign has come out with two campaign ads addressing the Democratic candidate's choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest, released by the campaign early yesterday, features clips of Clinton during the primary battle saying critical things about Obama, including, &quot;Senator Obama's campaign has become increasingly negative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A voiceover announcer says, &quot;She won millions of votes but isn't on the ticket. Why? For speaking the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clinton spokeswoman Kathleen Strand said the New York senator's &quot;support of Barack Obama is clear. She has said repeatedly that Barack Obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country, getting us out of Iraq and expanding access to health care. John McCain doesn't. It's interesting how those remarks didn't make it into his ad.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the eve of the Democratic National Convention, Barack Obama said Sunday he hoped a week of political speechmaking would persuade reluctant middle-class voters to swing behind his bid for the White House, while Republicans sought to stir discontent among Hillary Rodham Clinton's supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton was having none of it. In a gesture of unity, Obama's rival in the bruising battle for the nomination was expected to release the delegates she won in primaries and caucuses, telling them in midweek they are now free to join her in supporting the victor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who if elected would become the first black president, campaigned through swing-state Wisconsin, then flew home to Chicago to work on the acceptance speech he will deliver before 75,000 partisans on the convention's closing night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he hoped convention viewers would conclude, &quot;He's sort of like us. He comes from a middle-class background, went to school on scholarships. He and his wife had to figure out child care and how to start a college fund for their kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton outpolled Obama among working-class voters in many states through the winter and spring, and Sen. John McCain and the Republicans have worked relentlessly in more recent weeks to depict the Illinois senator as an elitist who is out of touch with blue-collar concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Democrats descending on their highly fortified convention city, party officials worked energetically to ensure a harmonious week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of blue signs that read simply &quot;Unity&quot; were stockpiled inside the Pepsi Center for distribution to convention delegates at whatever moment Obama's high command deemed appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on a unanimous vote, the party's credentials committee restored full voting rights to delegations from Florida and Michigan. Both states were stripped of their voting rights earlier in the year in retaliation for holding primaries before party rules allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all Democrats know we are full partners,&quot; said Chris Edley Jr., a member of the panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Democratic unity was uppermost in the minds of Obama's aides, McCain had other ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican presidential contender's campaign readied a television commercial suggesting Obama had snubbed Clinton when he picked Delaware Sen. Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She won millions of votes but isn't on the ticket. Why? For speaking the truth,&quot; says the ad, which also shows Clinton criticizing Obama during their battle for the Democratic nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former first lady has praised the selection of Biden. In response to the ad, spokeswoman Kathleen Strand noted that Clinton &quot;has said repeatedly that Barack Obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country, getting us out of Iraq and expanding access to health care. John McCain doesn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first arrests of the convention week were reported when about 1,000 anti-war demonstrators marched through downtown under the watchful eye of police in riot-control gear. Officials did not immediately provide details on the number of those taken into custody, or even confirm that those arrested had taken part in the march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the Pepsi Center, where the convention's opening gavel falls today, the floor seating was rearranged. Delaware's delegates were granted a spot closer to the front, an upgrade resulting from Biden's selection as Obama's running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With McCain trying to use Clinton to divide the Democrats, Obama defended his choice, a selection that seemed designed to fill a gap in his own foreign policy resume while appealing to blue-collar voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's got the passion to lift up middle-class Americans, he hasn't forgotten his working-class roots, he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up,&quot; Obama told reporters before boarding his plane in Eau Claire, Wis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opening night convention program - featuring an appearance by Michelle Obama - was scripted to reach out to the same segment of the electorate. Officials said her remarks would present her husband - the son of a white mother from Kansas and a black father from Kenya who later left the family - as anything but elite.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">in the polls</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent public opinion polls give Barack Obama a modest advantage at best in the race to become the nation's 44th president. John McCain has successfully cut into what had been a slightly more comfortable lead for Obama. hotel scare</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was briefly evacuated from her downtown Denver hotel on Saturday when a man carrying two hunting rifles and two pistols tried to check in to the hotel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it gathers next week in  Minneapolis-St. Paul for its quadrennial convention, the Republican Party will try to turn the page from George W. Bush to John McCain. It won't be an easy trick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenge for the party -- and by definition Bush, as the titular leader of the party -- is not completely dissimilar to that faced in past conventions, in which the nominee looked to escape the large shadow of an incumbent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1988, Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, labored to create his own image independent of Ronald Reagan, who gave the senior Bush a warm though hardly effusive send-off at the New Orleans convention. In Los Angeles in 2000, Bill Clinton offered an effusive endorsement for Al Gore, after a lengthy recitation of what he saw as his administration's significant accomplishments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Bush and McCain, the political hurdle will be even higher, given the deep unpopularity of the president outside the convention hall. The last thing the McCain campaign wants is for Bush to reinforce the Obama message that the senator from Arizona is running for a third Bush term; what the McCain team seems to prefer is for Bush to help close the deal with voters in the GOP's base and with delegates who remain skeptical of McCain -- and otherwise get out of the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The best way for George Bush to help McCain is to galvanize the Republican base, the conservatives, the evangelicals -- those folks with whom he has great credibility,&quot; said one McCain adviser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House has been willing to oblige the McCain campaign's apparent desire that the president keep a healthy distance, with Bush quietly raising money for the GOP efforts this fall and aides biting their tongues over obvious gibes -- such as the McCain television ad stating bluntly that things are worse in this country than four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House team appears to be living the mantra popularized by Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis: &quot;Just win, baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Save for a brief handshake on the tarmac in Arizona, the two men have not appeared in public together since a White House lunch in March. GOP operatives don't expect the two men to cross paths in the Twin Cities, where Bush is planning a quick trip to deliver his speech next Monday night before clearing out for McCain's arrival later in the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One GOP strategist close to both camps said he expects that Bush will be accompanied by much of his family, including his brothers, and that there will be a family-and-friends type reception on the day of the speech. First lady Laura Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney will also be on hand to speak to the convention Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big question is how Bush will use his final moment in the limelight, and to what extent he will try to defend the record of his administration. His aides were not prepared last week to offer many details, though press secretary Dana Perino said the speech will focus on McCain and give Bush's sense of why McCain is ready to tackle the challenges of the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He will call on the party to do everything it can to elect John McCain,&quot; Perino said.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Whither the E-Mails? </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An internal White House document provides some fresh clues about the status of the controversy that has been simmering since 2007, when it was discovered that potentially millions of White House e-mails over a two-year period were missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exactly what the clues suggest, however, is a bit murky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document in question, first obtained by the Associated Press, is a draft nine-page &quot;statement of objectives&quot; for a contractor to provide a &quot;comprehensive technical and management approach for the recovery of electronic mail records&quot; from backup tapes. The number of days of e-mail &quot;to be restored range from as few as 25 to as many as 225 days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may actually suggest there are fewer missing messages than some earlier estimates that more than 400 days of e-mail traffic might be lost. The White House is required by law to maintain the e-mails under the Presidential Records Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House says the document in question is out of date and inaccurate. But it won't say what is accurate: Indeed, after acknowledging that millions of e-mails might be missing, the White House is now refusing to say any e-mails are lost and says that previous analyses were inaccurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privately, officials suggest the number could be far lower than the initial estimates. But aides say that only after a full audit is complete  will the administration offer any further public information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The office of administration, working with outside technical experts, is conducting a thorough accounting of the e-mail archiving system,&quot; said White House spokesman Scott Stanzel. &quot;It is important that that work be complete and accurate and therefore they are taking great pains to do a through analysis. That's where we are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anne Weismann, chief counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group that has focused considerable attention on the missing e-mails, said the White House document is a tacit acknowledgment that some e-mails are missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The White House is taking some steps to recover these e-mails -- that's good,&quot; she said. &quot;On the other hand, they have waited very late and it's not going to be done for quite a while.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, washingtonpost.com launches PostPartisan, a blog of Post columnists and editorial writers. Throughout the conventions, Post writers will offer analysis and insights into what's happening on the stage and behind the scenes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photo ops and sound bites beginning tonight will all be designed to show Democratic unity -- Tim Kaine thinks Joe Biden was a great VP choice, Hillary Clinton thinks Barack Obama is the tops and so forth. But a pre-convention event at the Denver Art Museum yesterday afternoon showed that at least on one big issue -- education -- it's not all one happy family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington Mayor Adrian Fenty, his Newark counterpart Cory Booker, the Rev. Al Sharpton, New York City superintendent Joel Klein and others gathered to push for merit pay for teachers and other accountability measures for urban schools.  The biggest obstacle, they all agreed, is &quot;special interests,&quot; by which for the most part they mean teachers unions -- whose members will make up about a tenth of convention delegates, according to National Education Association executive director John Wilson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton described the terrible schools open to many poor black children as the biggest civil rights issue of the 21st century. &quot;If our parents could stand up to biting dogs in Alabama, we can stand up to special interests in America's cities,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fenty said he supports Obama and his message of change -- &quot;and change is most important in education.&quot; He offered ongoing teacher contract talks in the District as &quot;a real life example.&quot; Chancellor Michelle Rhee's proposed contract includes merit pay for teachers who achieve results. But the American Federation of Teachers, &quot;which I don't think does anything for the District of Columbia,&quot; is weighing in against the contract. Why? &quot;The only thing I can figure out is, the people who are elected [as union officials] want to keep their jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NEA's Wilson, in the audience, told me he found the references to special interests, and the exclusion of unions from the conference, &quot;disrespectful to teachers, and naive . . . . You're not going to change the current system until you bring in teachers and their collective voice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, both big teachers unions insist they favor transformation and reform. But any time the talk goes to pay for performance or other ways to attract the best teachers to the worst schools, they change the subject to the problems with parents, or say the need for change is so big that we shouldn't get bogged down with little tactical things like the right to get rid of teachers who don't perform.  There was a lot of hope expressed in the auditorium yesterday that Obama would stand up to the unions -- and for children who are being deprived a decent chance in life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, Obama hasn't done much more than nibble at that one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fred Hiatt </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national political conventions are gatherings of VIPs, and every VIP expects a good hotel room. That's why media types tend to be relegated to the outskirts, or the suburbs, or the exurbs. And that's why the Cherry Creek neighborhood of Denver -- it is indeed inside the city limits, barely -- has become a vast resettlement camp for notebook-carrying, camera-toting refugees from Washington and New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We stick out. We're the ones on foot (this part of town was definitely made for cars), wandering in circles, hoping to stumble across a Starbucks. Helpful hint: If you ask a local, and he or she describes a destination as &quot;right up the street,&quot; that means two or three miles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was trudging &quot;right up the street&quot; yesterday morning when I ran into a displaced person from the New York Times whose stride, anomalously, had bounce and purpose. He was carrying a swimsuit. &quot;At our hotel, they said we could use the pool at the Holiday Inn if we showed our room card,&quot; he said. My smile was, perhaps, needlessly patronizing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our hotel has a pool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eugene Robinson </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exactly two hours before Sen. Joe Biden was to take the stage for his unveiling as Barack Obama's running mate, an e-mail arrived from the Republican National Committee laying out the case against both men. Printed out, it ran seven pages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before sun-up yesterday, the John McCain-GOP presidential campaign had rolled out two television ads blasting the Democratic ticket, including one that accused Obama of snubbing rival Hillary Clinton in the veepstakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama camp fired back at McCain almost immediately, labeling the ad &quot;demonstrably false.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also received an e-mail release from Hillary Clinton's office restating her support for Obama and their shared &quot;commitment to changing the direction of the country, getting out of Iraq, and expanding access to health care.&quot; Clinton chided McCain for not including those remarks in his ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All that by lunchtime on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I cut my political teeth on the 1952 presidential campaign between the Republican candidate, and war hero, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower and Illinois's Democratic governor, Adlai E. Stevenson. The toughest campaign ad was Eisenhower's animated cartoon about himself accompanied by an Irving Berlin tune, &quot;I like Ike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Folks, as comedian Flip Wilson used to say, &quot;are so touchy these days.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Republican National Committee member from North Dakota will introduce a resolution at the GOP national platform committee meeting on Tuesday urging GOP lawmakers in Congress to ignore lobbyists for the &quot;ONE Campaign.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics call the project a dream effort by do-gooders to spend huge sums of money on poverty and disease around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A goal of the ONE Campaign is to persuade the rich nations to forgive all debt owed them by some of the poorest countries. So far, it has succeeded in convincing the United States and others to forgive some debt from about half of the targeted countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RNC should urge members of Congress to &quot;report any suspected lobbying to the Internal Revenue Service,&quot; Curley Hoagland, a longtime RNC member, said in his resolution opposing &quot;ONE Vote '08,&quot; backed by billionaire Democrat Bill Gates, but also by a bipartisan array of famous names, including Cindy McCain, Michelle Obama and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Curley says the campaign's arm ONE Vote '08 is a &quot;political committee working to influence specific legislation in Congress and soliciting commitments to support their agenda from all of the candidates for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His resolution claims that ONE Vote &quot;seeks to grant Bono, a foreign national rock star, and the super-rich Bill and Melinda Gates the power to earmark at least one percent of the United States annual budget for charitable purposes of their choosing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ONE Campaign has a $1.75 million TV ad campaign featuring actor Matt Damon, New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Mrs. Obama and Mrs. McCain in the lead up to the Democratic and Republican conventions. Its ad highlights what supporters call &quot;the lifesaving impact America is having in the poorest parts of the world, thanks to support from everyday Americans and political leaders from across the spectrum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE Campaign literature quotes Mr. Damon saying the campaign &quot;isn't about taking sides; it's about taking action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America is saving millions of lives in the poorest parts of the world - I saw it myself in Zambia and Tanzania - but people don't know about the impact our investments are having,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hoagland resolution notes that the law bans U.S. political parties and candidates in the United States from accepting foreign contributions for political activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says ONE Campaign is a tax-free, nonprofit group prohibited from contributing to political parties or candidates and from lobbying for special legislation or supporting or opposing candidates.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can actually feel this party splitting,&quot; said Diane Mantouvalos, co-founder of Just Say No Deal coalition, an Internet-based collection of more than 250 groups vehemently opposed to the impending presidential nomination of Mr. Obama at the party convention in Denver. &quot;There is a lot of anger out there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The renegade Democrats plan to stage protests outside the convention hall, flood the Internet with live blogs from Denver and air a TV ad challenging the legitimacy of the party's nominating process. Miss Mantouvalos said her group is screening two anti-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama documentary films in Denver this week, including &quot;The Audacity of Democracy,&quot; a play on the title of one of Mr. Obama's autobiographical books. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama exacerbated the ill will Saturday by tapping Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware as his running mate, dashing Clinton supporters' dreams that she would at least get the No. 2 spot on the ticket. The Obama team didn't even ask Mrs. Clinton for the papers and records needed for the customary vetting process, a sign that she never was seriously considered despite Mr. Obama's public words, Clinton aides said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a total dis to Senator Clinton,&quot; Miss Mantouvalos said. &quot;It just speaks volumes about how Barack Obama doesn't stand for anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With polls showing as many as half of Mrs. Clinton's voters up for grabs in the fall, Republican Sen. John McCain's campaign sought to immediately seize on the opportunity by airing a TV ad Sunday quoting the former first lady's criticisms of Mr. Obama during the primary campaign. The ad also features a voice-over announcer echoing Clinton supporter's frustration about Mr. Obama's vice-presidential pick: &quot;She won millions of votes but isn't on the ticket. Why? For speaking the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton spokeswoman Kathleen Strand dismissed the ad, saying Mrs. Clinton's &quot;support of Barack Obama is clear. She has said repeatedly that Barack Obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country, getting us out of Iraq and expanding access to health care. John McCain doesn't. It's interesting how those remarks didn't make it into his ad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Bower, a registered Democrat in the District who co-founded an anti-Obama group called PUMA, nonetheless said he likely will vote for Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel that Obama has won a fraudulent campaign,&quot; Mr. Bower said. &quot;He's done nothing. He's great at speeches and that's it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His misgivings about the senator from Illinois echo the primary campaign attacks by Mrs. Clinton, although the senator from New York has since recanted and embraced his nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bower isn't alone. Polls taken over the last week show as many as one in five of the Clinton supporters now back Mr. McCain, and many more are up for grabs. A Zogby International poll showed about 25 percent of Democrats do not support Mr. Obama. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll taken Saturday and Sunday showed that 66 percent of Clinton voters now back Mr. Obama, with 27 percent supporting Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups opposed to the Obama nomination did not identify any members who were convention delegates capable of affecting the outcome of the nomination vote. Some Clinton delegates aggressively pushed for the roll-call vote at the convention and expressed determination to vote for Mrs. Clinton, even if the outcome appears predetermined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penny Snow, a convention delegate from Portland, Maine, told the political news Web site Politickerme.com that she intended to cast her vote for Mrs. Clinton at the convention and would have a hard time voting for Mr. Obama in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign officials said the disgruntled Clinton voters do not reflect the steady stream of her supporters joining the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a fairly emotional process that we are all going through at different rates,&quot; said Dana Singiser, a former Clinton campaign adviser on outreach to female voters who now does that job for Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said more Clinton supporters will gravitate to the Obama camp as the race progresses this fall. &quot;We probably won't get all 18 million voters who voted for Hillary but we are going to keep talking to her voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has made a series of concessions and conciliatory gestures at the four-day convention to placate disaffected Clinton supporters:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has tapped her and former President Bill Clinton for prime speaking slots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign is proposing new nominating rules for the next election that will reduce the influence of superdelegates - party officeholders and activists who are free to vote as they wish and who under current rules handed Mr. Obama the nomination. The senator from Illinois won a slight majority of the pledged delegates, those awarded through primaries and caucuses, but he could not get the 2,118 delegates needed for an overall majority that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegations from Michigan and Florida, which had conducted their primaries in violation of party rules, had their full voting rights restored Sunday by the party's credentials committee. Neither Mr. Obama nor Mrs. Clinton campaigned in the states, but the senator from New York won both nominating contests. How the national convention would handle their delegations was a major bone of contention in late spring with the race still in the balance and Mrs. Clinton calling anything but full voting rights a form of disenfranchisement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign also struck a deal with Mrs. Clinton to include her name in the roll-call vote, although she is expected during her prime-time speech Tuesday night to urge her delegates to back Mr. Obama if the tightly orchestrated convention goes according to script. Mr. Obama is expected to win the nomination in a roll-call vote on the convention floor Wednesday and make an acceptance speech Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Democrats opposing Mr. Obama and the nomination process vow to crash the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They hope that Mrs. Clinton somehow will win the nomination when the delegate votes are tallied, although Mrs. Clinton has disassociated herself from their efforts and has been campaigning for Mr. Obama in swing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Clinton does not support any effort that detracts from party unity and support of Senator Obama's victory in the fall,&quot; Miss Strand said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, many Clinton supporters will use the roll call as a cathartic event to air their support one more time for the senator from New York and to bring closure to the bitter primary battle. Among those planning to cast a vote for Mrs. Clinton is Pennsylvania Gov. Edward G. Rendell, a former Democratic Party chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Away from the convention, the race nationally is a statistical dead heat, as Mr. Obama's lead evaporated this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's on the ropes,&quot; said pollster John Zogby, but Mr. Obama could get the big bump he needs from the convention with a stirring speech like his keynote address at the 2004 convention that launched his political career onto a national trajectory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember, this whole thing started with a big speech at a big convention,&quot; Mr. Zogby said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another band of former Clinton voters determined to make waves at the convention is the Denver Group, which does not oppose Mr. Obama but which accuses the Democratic Party of rigging the nominating process. They have collected more than $50,000 in donations since June to fund an advertising campaign calling for an open roll-call vote at the convention, including podium time for Mrs. Clinton's supporters to make the case for her nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Going through the motions of voting is not the same as respecting the franchise,&quot; said Heidi Li Feldman, a Georgetown University Law Center professor who helped establish the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's all fodder for what they say is a significant bloc of Mrs. Clinton's die-hard supporters who refuse to join the Democratic fold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bottom line is they won't vote Democrat this year, which is really kind of sad,&quot; said Miss Mantouvalos, who is taking time off from her job as a public relations consultant in Miami to work full time for the coalition. &quot;They feel that he was really ill-equipped to be commander in chief.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she is considering casting her vote for Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign, acutely aware of the lingering ill will from the primary fight, made a concerted effort beginning in July to contact each of Mrs. Clinton's pledged nominating delegates won in primary votes and each of the superdelegates who declared their support for the former first lady.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior campaign staff court these key supporters with weekly conference calls for delegates to which Mrs. Clinton's backers are invited and with a weekly newsletter to delegates, campaign officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign spokesman Nick Shapiro said neither fluctuations in the polls nor rhetoric from these groups would diminish voters' appetite for the political change Mr. Obama promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite any up or down movement in the polls, John McCain offers just more of the same at a time when the American people are looking to change the way business gets done in Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal bloggers, who helped spark the rise of Mr. Obama, have been critical of the presumptive Democratic nominee. Markos Moulitsas, founder of the Daily Kos, took some heat for saying Mr. Obama was moving toward the center, particularly after Mr. Obama voted this summer for a bill to broaden wiretapping powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't buy that Obama is a centrist,&quot; Mr. Moulitsas said Sunday. &quot;What he did on the intelligence bill was negating a political attack from the right. He did it for political reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to disagree with Obama,&quot; he said. &quot;But he is not going to be like the Republicans who watched George Bush destroy America. We're not going to agree with everything Obama does, but at least he will take this country in the right direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama has a problem. And it lives in a hut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His name is George Hussein Onyango Obama, and he is the 26-year-old half brother of Mr. Obama, the multimillionaire autobiographer who neglected to write that his paternal sibling lives on less than a dollar a month in the outer slums of Nairobi, Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have met twice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unearthed by Italian Vanity Fair and virtually ignored by the American press, the inconvenient George Obama could emerge as a compelling character in the freshman senator's carefully edited road-to-the-White-House narrative - especially now that his campaign has unleashed a personal attack on Sen. John McCain's station in life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama hit job on Mr. McCain seizes on his clumsiness in answering a reporter's question about how many houses he and his wife, Cindy, own. &quot;I think - I'll have my staff get to you,&quot; Mr. McCain fumbled. In a well-funded nationally televised ad spot titled &quot;Seven,&quot; Mr. Obama's messenger twice repeats the correct answer as the words on the screen reinforce the meme of class warfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seven. Worth $13 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sunday morning shows parroted Mr. Obama's shocking discovery that the McCain family is well-off. Smarting Obamaniacs campaigning for their messiah are now scripted to ask voters in battleground states how many houses they own and participate in an official campaign contest, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: McCain Edition.&quot; Winners receive hope, change and fist bumps - spoils of the &quot;new kind of politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someone who made $4.2 million last year and lives in a mansion that a mobster helped pay for should not be throwing stones. When Mr. Obama's flesh-and-blood lives in squalor, raising the standard of living of his opponent's extended family is probably not a smart idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's scary to think that this could be a preview of an Obama presidency in which attacking the rich is all the rage, and the rich in the news media pretend it's OK. Hugo Chavez is having a helluva run bringing down his formerly prosperous nation of Venezuela with that formula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, of course, would be publicly eviscerated if he funded an ad campaign called &quot;12&quot; - as in the amount of dollars a year Mr. Obama's half-brother subsists on. The message also could accurately point out that Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, have consistently fallen short of the national average in charitable contributions since they entered the highest income bracket - despite their ballyhooed &quot;progressive&quot; religious faith that touts &quot;economic equality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would also be fair game now to point out that preaching &quot;social justice&quot; pays better than being a United States senator. The Trinity Baptist Church is building a mansion for the Rev. Jeremiah Wright that includes an elevator, a butler's pantry, a bar, a rubberized exercise room - and the 10,000-square-foot estate backs up to the Odyssey Country Club. (Memo to wealthy Caucasian Republican members of the golf club: &quot;Fore!&quot; )</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attached to Mr. Wright's church-funded property is a peculiar $10 million line of credit - presumably, none of which will be given to George Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's&nbsp;ad also could highlight that Michelle Obama is on leave from her $317,000-a-year job at the University of Chicago Medical Center, which is now under scrutiny - along with Obama campaign chief David Axelrod and two other staffers - for a scheme that, according to the Chicago Sun-Times, &quot;steers patients who don't have private insurance - primarily poor, black people - to other health care facilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The medical professionals who have come to me are accusing the university of dumping patients on its neighboring institutions,&quot; Toni Preckwinkle, alderman for the 4th Ward, told the paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patient-dumping poor blacks may be interesting, but not quite as newsworthy as John McCain marrying a beer heiress 28 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does anyone think if Mr. McCain had a sibling living in a trailer park making minimum wage (892 times more than Mr. Obama's half brother's yearly income) that the mainstream media and the Obama campaign wouldn't notice?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, last week National Public Radio ran a piece titled, &quot;Cindy McCain's Half Sister 'Angry' She's Hidden,&quot; highlighting that Mr. McCain's wife's half sister was left out of her father's will. The piece was duly filed under the publicly funded network's &quot;conservative compassion deficit&quot; media template.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Mr. Obama has a half brother who lives in Africa on three cents a day, and the story breaks in an Italian magazine and is picked up by a London newspaper and a few others in Australia. Perhaps the story would be carried widely in America if they could figure out how to blame President Bush. But as Bob Geldof pointed out, he &quot;has done more [for Africa] than any other president,&quot; and of the press harshly judged, &quot;You guys didn't pay attention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor will they pay attention that the McCains have adopted a poor Bangladeshi child and done untold amounts of humanitarian and charity work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes this story newsworthy for Italians, Brits and Aussies, but not Americans, is that the U.S. free press is free to ignore stories that could take down their preordained president. And after the Internet and talk radio-driven &quot;Swift Boat&quot; story unexpectedly sank their last guy, the mainstream American press is taking extra precautions this time around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If for some inexplicable reason the media are forced by their online and talk radio betters to run with this outrageous and creepy story, key Obama supporter Oprah Winfrey can come to the rescue at the Democratic National Convention. On Night 3, the billionaire television hostess can synthesize her two best show archetypes: the heart-wrenching family reunion and &quot;Oprah's Favorite Things,&quot; the giveaway of material goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine the emotional fireworks when 75,000 Obama supporters at Invesco Field witness Barack Obama reconnecting with his destitute half brother as is he lavished with Kai Body Butter &amp; Buffer, Perfect Endings Cupcakes by Williams-Sonoma, Hand-Blown Crystal Champagne Glasses by Deborah Ehrlich and a Pure Simplicity Pumpkin Purifying Mask.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controversy averted. Because Democrats care more.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In case you missed them, some items of dubious import currently in the news....</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the Olympics, Chinese authorities have restricted access not only to Web sites, protest areas, leading dissidents, and key regions of the country. They also have banned the sale of dog meat - this apparently so as not to distress on-site foreigners somehow insufficiently distressed by China's screaming lack of individual liberty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Democrats were on to something similar. Until someone with sense called a halt, the Democratic Convention's host committee was telling convention vendors not to serve fried food because - please sit down for this - frying affects the environment. Also contemplated: mandatory meal diversity, with (a) 50 percent of each meal consisting of veggies and fruits, and (b) every meal (excluding garnishes) displaying at least three of these five colors: green, yellow, red, blue/purple, and white. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The convention's &quot;director of greening&quot; (a first in convention history) reportedly has set an 85 percent recycling goal and banished from the convention premises not only plastic water bottles but foam cups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The University of Chicago, long deemed among the most sensible in the land in e.g. economics, law, and political philosophy, may have but one foot in the land of right reason. The business, law, and economics faculties have proposed naming a research institute after the late great Nobel economist Milton Friedman. But about 100 teachers throughout the school are objecting because, according to The New York Times, &quot;the honor could be interpreted as a wholesale endorsement of Friedman's free-market ideology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Has the press made up its mind on a subject regarding which the scientific jury is still out? (1) In its &quot;Green Zone&quot; collection of wire-service reports on the environment, the Arizona Republic has a standing logo declaring: &quot;We know being green is important to you&quot; - and never mind that many readers may not be totally keen on &quot;being green.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And (2) how about this for an example of journalistic bias (for polar bears, against oil companies and the Bush administration) - from a June 15 Associated Press dispatch: &quot;Less than a month after declaring polar bears a threatened species because of global warming, the Bush administration is giving oil companies permission to annoy and potentially harm them in the pursuit of oil and natural gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alaska's Governor Sarah Palin says Alaska will sue the federal government to challenge the Interior Department's listing of polar bears as a threatened species. She notes the paucity of evidence to support Interior's listing - adding that polar bears in Alaska are well-managed and during the past three decades polar bear numbers in Alaska have dramatically increased. Fact: The world polar-bear population (24,000) stands at a modern-day high, up 40 percent since 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials at Milan's La Scala have announced (according to The Washington Post) they have commissioned composer Giorgio Battistelli to turn Al Gore's &quot;global-warming book/lecture/movie ['An Inconvient Truth'] into an opera for their 2011 season.&quot; Makes you feel warm all over, doesn't it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Romania's parliament has passed a law requiring newspapers and television stations to report equal amounts of news &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad.&quot; An excess of bad news is dangerous for the nation's health - or something. Opponents are hoping for the good news of a presidential veto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Susan Sarandon, each day challenging Jane Fonda and Barbra Streisand for the Oscar for Idiocy, has proclaimed, in &quot;this critical time,&quot; her &quot;faith in the American people.&quot; To do what? To elect Barack Obama, of course. If the voters should prove so misguided and immature as to elect the dread John McCain, she says, she'll hop the first plane out for Canada or Italy - there to take up permanent residence. Which would be yet another benefit of a McCain presidential victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, this: A Wall Street Journal piece about Internet religious start-ups discovers the marvelously named &quot;Church of the Latter-Day Dude.&quot; According to the church's 40-year-old founder, who lives in Thailand, Dudists (The Journal notes) practice &quot;a modified version of Taoism and principles from the movie 'The Big Lebowski.' &quot; Let the record show that - probably - they also have more fun.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama introduced Sen. Joe Biden as his running mate at a rally in Springfield, Ill., on Saturday, revealing a choice that strengthens the Democratic ticket's credentials on foreign policy as Obama heads into the fight with Sen. John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Biden, Obama selected a six-term senator best known for his expertise on foreign affairs - Biden spent last weekend in Georgia as that nation engaged in a tense confrontation with Russia - but also his skills at political combat. Obama passed over other candidates who might have brought him a state or reinforced the message of change that has been central to his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the rally outside the Old State Capitol where Obama announced his candidacy for the White House 20 months ago, Obama offered a portrait of a running mate who filled in what many Democrats have described as his political shortcomings. He presented Biden as the product of a Catholic blue-collar home in Pennsylvania who had endured personal tragedy in the death of his wife and daughter and his own near-death, who could relate to the culture of the Senate or of blue-collar voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can tell you that Joe Biden gets it,&quot; Obama said. &quot;He's that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in Cedar Rapids and the corridors of the Capitol, in the VFW hall in Concord and at the center of an international crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's because he is still that scrappy kid from Scranton who beat the odds, the dedicated family man and committed Catholic who knows every conductor on that Amtrak train to Wilmington,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The choice of Biden suggested a concern by Obama's advisers that his overseas trip this summer may not have done enough to deal with persistent voter concerns about his level of experience, especially on national security. He announced his decision when the conflict between Russia and Georgia has provided Republicans an opportunity to re-inject foreign policy into an election that has increasingly focused on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama woke up to a TV ad from McCain's campaign Saturday morning - even before the rally began - using Biden's own words from when he was running against Obama to discredit him, showing Biden saying that Obama, 47, is &quot;not ready&quot; to be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For good measure, it included a quotation from Biden talking about McCain on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; in 2005: &quot;I would be honored to run with or against John McCain, because I think the country would be better off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After trotting onto the stage Saturday, Biden said McCain was &quot; genuinely a friend of mine. I've known John for 35 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, he argued that, in what aides said was part of an effort to push back on McCain's efforts to use his past criticism of Obama in this campaign, he'd seen him grow in the crucible of a presidential campaign in which &quot;you're tested and challenged every single day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the past 18 months, I've watched Barack meet those challenges with judgment, intelligence and steel in his spine,&quot; Biden said. &quot;I've watched as he's inspired millions of Americans to this new cause. And during those 18 months, I must tell you, frankly, I have been disappointed in my friend John McCain, who gave in to the right wing of his party and gave in to the Swift Boat politics he once so deplored.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in a sign to McCain that friendship goes only so deep in politics, he mocked McCain for owning at least seven houses, as he talked about the kitchen table conversations struggling Americans were having today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's not a worry John McCain has to worry about,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a pretty hard experience: He'll have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama announced his choice in text and e-mail messages that began streaming out of his Chicago headquarters at 3 a.m., hours after news of his decision began leaking out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack has chosen Senator Joe Biden to be our VP nominee,&quot; read the text message. &quot;Watch the first Obama-Biden rally live at 3pm ET on www.BarackObama.com. Spread the word!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the process, Obama was working off a list of four contenders: Biden, Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana, Gov. Timothy M. Kaine of Virginia and Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas. It did not, by every account, include Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton issued a statement Saturday morning praising the choice and calling Biden &quot;an exceptionally strong, experienced leader and devoted public servant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden, 65, is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and is familiar with foreign leaders and diplomats around the world. Although he initially voted to authorize the war in Iraq - Obama opposed it from the start - Biden became a persistent critic of President Bush's policies in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden, who sought the Democratic presidential nomination himself this year before pulling out after performing poorly in the first contest, in Iowa, has shown himself to be a tough political brawler, a characteristic that many Democrats say Obama has not displayed against McCain. That is something that presidential candidates typically look for in a running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden seems likely to fill in other gaps in Obama's political appeal that became increasingly clear during the primary season and going into the fall. He has a blue-collar background, potentially giving him appeal among white working-class voters. And he was born in Pennsylvania, a battleground state that could be vital to both parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The selection was disclosed as Obama prepares for the party's four-day convention starting Monday. From Springfield they went their different ways: Obama is going to begin a tour of swing states that will bring him into Denver on Wednesday. Biden is to head straight to Denver where, aides said, he would spend time meeting Obama delegates, with a particular effort to try to help soothe any tensions with Clinton's supporters there.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">the choice</SPAN><BR></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPRINGFIELD, Ill., Aug. 23</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama introduced Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. as his vice presidential running mate here on Saturday, embracing him as a &quot;statesman with sound judgment&quot; who had never forgotten his humble roots or lost his fundamental decency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden is that rare mix. For decades, he has brought change to Washington, but Washington hasn't changed him,&quot; Obama (Ill.) said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement -- made official only hours earlier -- capped weeks of speculation and brought an infusion of experience and aggressiveness to the Democratic ticket two days before the start of the convention in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden, 65, a sharp-witted and energetic foreign policy expert who has held two of the most critical Senate chairmanships, bounded out onto the stage just after 2 p.m. Central time. The senator from Delaware hugged Obama and then, taking the podium as the vice presidential candidate for the first time, eagerly assumed the role of attack dog against the presumptive Republican nominee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden said Sen. John McCain -- although a longtime friend -- has &quot;yielded to the very Swift boat politics he once deplored&quot; during the course of the current race. And he made fun of McCain for recently forgetting that he owns seven properties, saying McCain cannot understand what struggling Americans discuss over their kitchen tables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He'll have to worry which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at,&quot; Biden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama settled on Biden during his vacation in Hawaii the week before but did not make his choice known, even to the other contenders, until late in the week, aides said. He called Biden on Thursday night to offer him the job, catching him at the dentist during his wife's root canal procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That set into motion a cloak-and-dagger operation to bring the two together here Saturday. After the appearance, Biden and his wife, Jill, conducted interviews and were photographed with Obama and his wife, Michelle. When Michelle Obama and Jill Biden met Saturday, after speaking first by phone, they had what one person in the room described as an &quot;instant comfort level.&quot; They discussed the pending glare of the cameras at the convention and shared anecdotes about their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bidens returned to Delaware after Saturday's event and are scheduled to fly to Denver on Monday. The two families plan to campaign together again after the convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and also served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He commands a loyal, if small, clutch of followers in the battleground state of Iowa, having twice campaigned for president there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His home state of Delaware has just three electoral votes, but he is originally from Pennsylvania, a critical swing state with 21. Democrats hope he can help break down any perceptions of elitism on the ticket, especially among working-class white voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden does not come without risks. Accusations that he plagiarized then-British Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock helped sink his presidential campaign in 1987. During the primaries, Biden also attacked Obama aggressively, questioning his lack of experience. Those comments had already resurfaced in a McCain&nbsp;ad released shortly before the announcement was made official; it also quotes Biden, in 2005, praising the Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats largely embraced the choice, although some supporters of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton expressed disappointment that Obama's top challenger in the primaries was never considered for the second slot. A senior Obama adviser confirmed that Clinton was not asked for paperwork but said it was because she had asked Obama not to vet her unless he was seriously considering her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears Obama never did. A Clinton loyalist who talked to her throughout the process said the senator from New York did not want to &quot;make him feel he had to stage a Kabuki theater process for her&quot; by pretending to consider her if he did not want to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She made it crystal clear in public and in private that this was entirely his decision to make any way he wanted, choose whomever he wanted,&quot; the loyalist said. &quot;Clearly, he had no interest. No meetings, no conversations, no requests for information, no real consideration whatsoever. And that was his prerogative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new McCain TV ad aims to tap into the frustration of Clinton supporters over the decision by suggesting that Obama dissed his onetime rival. &quot;Why? For speaking the truth,&quot; a narrator says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad shows clips of Clinton criticizing Obama for vaguely discussing how he would govern and for his connections to Chicago developer Antoin Rezko. &quot;The truth hurt. And Obama didn't like it,&quot; the narrator concludes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton issued a statement praising Biden, and some close to her said the choice of Biden validated their belief that experience is an important trait in the race -- even though as a 35-year veteran of Washington he does not project an image of &quot;change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong, experienced leader and devoted public servant,&quot; Clinton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and Biden made their joint debut in front of a crowd of tens of thousands at the old Illinois statehouse, where the presumptive Democratic nominee launched his campaign a year and a half ago. The first blue &quot;Obama-Biden&quot; signs were on display -- quickly produced under the cloak of secrecy as the campaign tried to keep the announcement from leaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his introductory remarks, Obama described Biden's life story: as a boy raised on Catholic values in working-class Pennsylvania; as a young senator who lost his first wife and daughter in a car accident; as a senator who had fought against tyranny and injustice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was clear from Obama's speech that he views Biden as bringing dual assets: being able to play the role of a down-to-earth fighter, appealing to Catholics and the working class; and serving as a statesman and expert on foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is still that scrappy kid from Scranton who beat the odds -- the dedicated family man and committed Catholic who knows every conductor on that Amtrak train to Wilmington. That's the kind of fighter who I want by my side in the months and years to come,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described Biden as being &quot;at home in a bar in Cedar Rapids&quot; as well as on the world stage -- two settings in which Obama has struggled over the course of the race. Scranton is of particular significance for Obama: Clinton, who also has family from the area, dominated it in the primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden, in characteristic language, noted that some people accuse him of speaking too colloquially -- and then proceeded to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's something about this guy, there's something about Barack Obama, that allows him to bring people together,&quot; Biden said. &quot;It's been amazing to watch him, but then again, that's been the story of his whole life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Obama has the &quot;vision and courage&quot; to improve the country, calling him a &quot;clear-eyed pragmatist who will get the job done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden is also running for reelection and, under Delaware law, can remain on both the presidential and Senate ballots. He is expected to cruise to reelection, and if the Obama-Biden ticket prevails, Gov. Ruth Ann Minner would appoint his replacement in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His son, Beau, Delaware's attorney general, is considered a favorite for that potential appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the selection process, the Obama campaign had kept a close watch on Virginia Gov. Timothy M. Kaine as a potential running mate. Kaine told associates that he had &quot;very serious&quot; conversations with Obama about joining the ticket and that he provided documents to the campaign about his background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speculation over Kaine reached a fever pitch last week when Obama spent two full days campaigning across Virginia and spent the night Wednesday in downtown Richmond, a few blocks from the governor's mansion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, with a swarm of reporters parked outside, Kaine sneaked out of the mansion through an underground tunnel to help his son move to George Washington University. Kaine was notified of Obama's decision late Thursday night or early Friday, though he declined repeatedly Saturday to reveal when. He then flew to Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wayne Turnage, Kaine's chief of staff, sent an e-mail to the governor's cabinet at 11:09 p.m. Friday with the subject line &quot;Vice President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Governor has indicated that Obama did not select him as a running mate,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few hours later, at 3:10 a.m., the Obama campaign sent out a text message to an estimated 3 million supporters nationwide with the official news. But details had already begun to leak as Secret Service agents were dispatched to Biden's home in Delaware, and as Kaine and the others on the shortlist were informed they did not get the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In keeping with its secretive approach to the vice presidential rollout, Obama's campaign said it will release no details on how he made his decision. Obama also did not take questions; he has not done so for at least two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff writers Shailagh Murray and Perry Bacon Jr. in Denver, Anita Kumar in Richmond and Michael D. Shear, with McCain in Sedona, Ariz., contributed to this report.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT USED TO BE that scandals were named for buildings. (Remember Watergate?) Now, it seems, they're about buildings. John McCain doesn't know how many houses he and his wife own. Barack Obama bought his with an assist from a man later convicted of felonies. So much for the substantive, high-road campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can bemoan this elevation of the trivial without being deluded into thinking that it's something new -- although the velocity of the 24-7 news cycle, the omnipresence of cable television and instantaneous transmission over the Internet have intensified this phenomenon. Small moments that capture -- or appear to capture -- a deeper truth about a candidate are easy for voters to grasp and for rival campaigns to exploit. George H.W. Bush was painted as being out of touch because he supposedly marveled at a supermarket scanner. Al Gore was portrayed  as a r&Atilde;&copy;sum&Atilde;&copy;-puffing blowhard because he supposedly claimed credit for launching the Internet or uncovering problems at Love Canal. Smart candidates have always known that they need to keep abreast of the price of a quart of milk. (Keeping up with the price of arugula at Whole Foods doesn't count.) Now they'll need to refresh their recollection of their real estate holdings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign, having already  collected research on the McCain real estate holdings, quickly produced an ad to taunt him. And it's not as though the McCain campaign has been higher-minded: Comparing Mr. Obama to Paris Hilton, Britney Spears and Charlton Heston as Moses isn't exactly a reprise of the Lincoln-Douglas debates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Really, do the McCains' real estate holdings and his failure to keep count of his wife's Coronado condos make Mr. McCain oblivious to the concerns of ordinary Americans -- any more than their family estates made Franklin D. Roosevelt or John F. Kennedy incapable of feeling the pain of the common man? Do Mr. Obama's four fireplaces, music room, wine cellar and four-car garage count against him? Likewise, Mr. Obama has long said that he had a lapse in judgment in getting entangled with Tony Rezko, a friend and fundraiser who in June was convicted of 16 counts of felony corruption  in an influence-peddling scheme,  in buying his house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But anyone who votes on the basis of this sound-and-fury politics deserves the president he gets.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hating will reach a pinnacle in Denver and St. Paul., Minn., this week and next. At the Democratic and Republican nominating conventions, we'll get soaring speeches about how awful Washington is. How it is a quagmire of corruption. How it does nothing for anyone. How it needs to change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians have disparaged Washington since long before the days of air conditioning, but the anti-D.C. comments have been especially sharp during the 2008 presidential campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The city of Satan,&quot; John McCain declared to a crowd in Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The place where people &quot;boil all the hope out of&quot; you, Barack Obama warned in Akron, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And these are men who work here and are asking to be elected to the top of the heap of this stinking swamp --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One moment. We have a bit of clarification from Scott W. Berg, author of &quot;Grand Avenues,&quot; about Pierre L'Enfant's glorious vision for a glorious city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;D.C. is not a swamp,&quot; says Berg, who lives in  Reston. &quot;It has some low areas of marshy ground, but it's not a swamp. It didn't become known as a swamp until a whole bunch of politicians came in and started referring to it as a swamp in metaphor. You call it a swamp enough, and people think it is. The name-calling changed what people thought of the physical place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ain't that the truth. Everyone jabbers about the perceived negatives of the District, and suddenly they're true. Politics, and the media coverage of politics, seem to blot out our fair city's positives. McCain and Obama have buttressed their presidential campaigns with quotations about how they want to remake Washington into a cleaner, brighter place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Washington's broken,&quot; says the narrator of a McCain TV ad airing this month. Obama made the same diagnosis in a speech in Indiana on Aug. 8: &quot;Washington is broken,&quot; he concluded. Republican Mitt Romney repeated this mantra before his own presidential campaign broke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, we know they're talking about the political side, but it's still agitating to hear disparaging comments grouped nominally under the city as a whole. And this goes beyond presidential campaigns to every congressional district in the United States, where candidates seek to assure people that they're not a part of Washington, but they want to work there, hold their nose and maybe freshen it up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's kind of comical, because people fight, connive and scheme to get to a place they profess to hate, and then they fight, connive and scheme to stay in the place they profess to hate,&quot; says Democratic strategist James Carville, who maintains a home in Alexandria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I kind of like Washington. Where else could I live where it takes me 12 minutes to go to a major league baseball game, 15 minutes to the airport, 15 to the Capitol? In terms of the way the government runs, there's a lot to criticize. 'Washington' has just become a shorthand. I detest the government but love the city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The iconic Washington putdown is often attributed to John F. Kennedy. &quot;Somebody once said that Washington was a city of Northern charm and Southern efficiency,&quot; relayed the president in a 1961 speech. Sounds like a compliment for about two seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog,&quot; was Harry Truman's pithy assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there's the line about the nation's capital  being &quot;Hollywood for ugly people,&quot; a phrase uttered so many times it has lost its sting. So we're ugly and charmless, hostile and inefficient, not at all like the leaders who will storm into the city after this election cycle and make it all better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems to me whatever temporary gain you make in the election campaign by presenting yourself as outside the special interests of Washington, it's counterproductive in the long run,&quot; says writer Doris Kearns Goodwin, a scholar of presidential history. &quot;It further denigrates the whole field of public service. Painting with such a broad stroke -- 'Washington is bad' -- only feeds public perception that politics is not an honorable vocation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the negativity that's recycled every election year, we wondered whether  any members of Congress  had anything nice to say about Washington. So we called a bunch and asked them, pretty please, to provide a kind word about our city.  Many did, even the ones who voted against giving the District  representation in Congress. Examples of their niceties follow. Consider this a salve, a pre-convention reconciliation, brokered in the eye of an electoral hurricane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, yes, we called McCain and Obama, but they had nothing to say. Obama's press team declined to pass along our request. McCain's camp didn't respond at all.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MANCHESTER, N.H.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, lists the November races that will swell his party's majority, New Hampshire is one of the first he brags about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here on the ground, it looks a lot less certain that Democrat Jeanne Shaheen will cut short the promising career of Sen. John Sununu, namesake son of a White House chief of staff under the first President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen, a former governor who lost a close race to Sununu six years ago in an environment much more hospitable to Republicans, was a double-digit favorite early this year when she heeded supporters' pleas and left a Harvard administrative job to test Sununu again. But last weekend, as she and Sununu marched with their supporters in the Londonderry  parade and then hobnobbed with voters at the Greekfest here, Shaheen acknowledged that things have changed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reflecting on a University of New Hampshire poll released July 23 that gave her a 46 percent to 42 percent lead -- the tightest in any public poll in a year -- Shaheen said, &quot;We always knew it would be close. It's always difficult to beat an incumbent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu, who moved from the House to the Senate, gloated in a separate interview that he has hoarded his TV ad money, while &quot;Shaheen spent $700,000 this summer and didn't move her numbers at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a race where both candidates expect total spending to reach $20 million -- an extraordinary sum for such a small state -- Shaheen implored her backers last week to help her overcome &quot;my opponent's $3 million cash-on-hand advantage.&quot; Conservative independent expenditure groups are also mobilized, she warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu, Norm Coleman in Minnesota and Gordon Smith in Oregon are three relatively young senators the GOP hopes can survive this difficult year and provide a base for the future. All three stress their independent credentials, while their opponents try to categorize them as Bush clones. Democrats have been resurgent in all three states, but Sununu faces the toughest challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2006, Democrats won everything in New Hampshire -- reelecting the governor, capturing both House seats and turning over both houses of the Legislature. Opposition to the Iraq war and economic worries left longtime Republican incumbents stranded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past year, the state has not been as badly shocked by the housing crisis as some others, but voter interviews in heavily Republican Londonderry found a strong undercurrent of anxiety about energy and food prices and the cost of heating oil for next winter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu is trying to exploit that by advocating an aggressive offshore drilling program, while Shaheen, like other Democrats, would limit the sites for new wells and emphasize conservation and alternative energy sources. More broadly, they differ on taxes and on Iraq -- with Shaheen challenging Sununu's assessment that the war issue has faded since 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu, an engineer by training, comes across as the more forceful advocate, but Shaheen has the warmer personality. Her procession through the savory food stalls at the Greekfest was marked by hugs, smiles and family photos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen supporters argue that this race should be easier for her than her 2002 run, when she was still governor and had to fit her campaigning into an official schedule. But voter interviews found that the controversies of Shaheen's Concord years are more familiar to many voters than the details of Sununu's Senate term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the margins, Sununu probably has the presidential candidate who helps him most in John McCain. The two have traveled the globe together, and McCain praises Sununu as &quot;the smartest guy in the United States Senate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Democratic side, the tension remaining from the Clinton-Obama  contest here last winter remains a problem for Shaheen. She is identified as a Clinton partisan, in part because her husband, Bill Shaheen, was the New York senator's volunteer co-chairman until he was asked to resign after making disparaging comments about Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Shaheen insider said, &quot;The Clinton people are all with us, but we need more from the Obama side to win this.&quot; When Shaheen fired her campaign manager, Bill Hyers, last month, he was picked up by the Obama headquarters in Chicago. The new manager, Robby Mook, is a Clinton veteran, and some Democrats see the changes at the top as another sign that this victory is not yet in hand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPRINGFIELD, Ill. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama returned Saturday to the spot where he began his improbable presidential run to present his newly picked running mate, introducing Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware as a man with &quot;a distinguished record and a fundamental decency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden is that rare mix,&quot; the Illinois Democrat said. &quot;For decades, he has brought change to Washington, but Washington hasn't changed him. He's an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He touted Mr. Biden's blue-collar upbringing in an Irish Catholic family in Scranton, Pa., a narrative that will be repeated regularly as the campaign reaches out to voters in the swing state of Pennsylvania, and to Catholics and working-class voters who have been reluctant to back Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama also touted his running mate's practice of commuting daily by train between Washington and Delaware as proof of his not having been captured by his 35 years in the Senate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Biden, who is not wealthy by the standards of U.S. senators, picked up the economic-populist theme in his speech, painting presumptive Republican nominee Sen. John McCain as so out of touch with ordinary people that he'd have to &quot;figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at&quot; when considering his economic future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Delaware senator spoke of Mr. Obama in reverential terms as having &quot;something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I know I'm told I talk too colloquially, but there's something about this guy,&quot; he said, gesturing with his thumb to Mr. Obama, who was sitting behind him. &quot;There's something about Barack Obama that allows him to bring people together like no one I have worked with and seen. There's something about Barack Obama that makes people understand if they make compromises, they can make things better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The choice of Mr. Biden, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and just back from a trip to war-torn Georgia, most notably added national security and Washington experience to the Democratic ticket, but it also underscored Republican criticism that Mr. Obama is untested and not ready for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Mr. Obama presented his running mate, he called him &quot;the next president,&quot; before correcting himself to say, &quot;the next vice president of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign promptly called the error a &quot;Freudian slip&quot; and said it echoed criticisms Mr. Biden had made of Mr. Obama during his own unsuccessful 2008 Democratic presidential bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor, when he introduced Joe Biden as the next president,&quot; McCain campaign spokesman Ben Porritt said. &quot;The reality is that nothing has changed since Joe Biden first made his assessment that Barack Obama is not ready to lead. He wasn't ready then, and he isn't ready now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign declined to comment on the criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, addressing a crowd of thousands in front of the historic Statehouse building where 19 months ago he announced his bid for president, said his running mate was &quot;uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joe Biden is what so many others pretend to be: a statesman with sound judgment who doesn't have to hide behind bluster to keep America strong,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;Joe won't just make a good vice president. He will make a great one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Biden, who as an early candidate for the presidential nomination criticized Mr. Obama's lack of experience, said he had come to respect and admire Mr. Obama even as he lost faith in his longtime friend and colleague, Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack has the vision, and what you can't forget ... he also has the courage, the courage to make this a better place,&quot; Mr Biden said, adding that Mr. Obama was a &quot;clear-eyed pragmatist who will get the job done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Biden, who also sought the White House in 1988, was elected to the Senate at the age of 29 in 1972, only turning the legally required 30 between the election and his taking office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In selecting Mr. Biden, Mr. Obama passed over former first lady Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, his tenacious rival across months of primaries and caucuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, Mr. Obama has gone to great lengths to gain the confidence of her primary voters, agreeing to allow her name to be placed in nomination at the convention and permitting a roll-call vote that threatens to expose lingering divisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fulfilling the vice-presidential nominee's traditional role as campaign attack dog, Mr. Biden said Mr. McCain &quot;gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very Swift Boat politics that he once so deplored.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said Mr. McCain blindly followed the economic, tax and Iraq war policies of President Bush and &quot;signed on to Bush's scheme of privatizing Social Security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't change America when you supported George Bush's policies 95 percent of the time,&quot; he said. &quot;You can't change America when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of George Bush's presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent weeks, Mr. Obama's lead evaporated in most polls as the McCain campaign assailed him as a pop-culture celebrity who is not ready to be commander in chief. The race is now a statistical tie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign used Mr. Biden's selection to remind voters of what they characterize as an experience deficit at the top of the Democratic ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours of the announcement, which the campaign made by text message at about 3 a.m. Saturday, the McCain campaign put out a TV ad that featured a video clip of Mr. Biden saying Mr. Obama is not ready to be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the footage from a Democratic primary debate, ABC News' George Stephanopoulos asks Mr. Biden: &quot;You were asked, 'Is he ready?' You said, 'I think he can be ready but right now, I don't believe he is. The presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training.'[TFI]&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Biden responds: &quot;I think that I stand by the statement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic consultant Mary Anne Marsh said the pick shows that the Obama campaign thinks it needs to counter these attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vice-presidential picks telegraph what a campaign thinks it needs. In this case, picking Biden, the Obama campaign feels it needs to have someone with foreign-policy experience and Washington experience to demonstrate that they will be able to create change by getting things done,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden parted ways after the Springfield rally and will not hit the campaign trail as a team until after next week's Democratic National Convention in Denver. Mr. Obama flew home to Chicago for the night before campaigning Sunday in Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Biden flew to his home in Wilmington, Del. His next stop is Denver to boost the ticket during the convention, where Mr. Obama is expected to arrive Wednesday and accept the nomination Thursday. Mr. Biden is slated to address the convention Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said yesterday that the financial crisis that has pounded the country - coupled with higher inflation - is taking a toll on the economy and poses a major challenge to Fed policymakers as they try to restore stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Although we have seen improved functioning in some markets, the financial storm that reached gale force&quot; around this time last year &quot;has not yet subsided, and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment,&quot; Bernanke said in a speech to a high-profile economics conference here. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Bernanke welcomed the recent drops in oil and other commodities' prices, and believes inflation will moderate this year and next, the Fed chief also warned that the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Fed, he said, would monitor the situation closely and will &quot;act as necessary&quot; to make sure that inflation doesn't get out of hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current financial and economic environment is one of the most challenging to Fed policymakers &quot;in memory,&quot; he acknowledged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given those dueling economic cross-currents - weak economic growth and higher inflation - many economists believe the Fed will leave rates where they are at its next meeting on Sept. 16, and probably through the rest of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They won't act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy,&quot; said Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Decision Economics Inc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many fear the economy will hit a rough patch later this year as the bracing effect of the government's tax-rebate checks fades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The economy is the top concern for voters and of keen interest to presidential contenders Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain, who are gearing up for their party's conventions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Financial and credit problems are expected to smolder into next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, the unemployment rate, which jumped to a four-year high of 5.7 percent in July, is expected to keep rising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bulk of Bernanke's speech dealt with the need to bolster oversight of the nation's financial system to make it better able to withstand future shocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To that end, Bernanke recommended that regulators work on ways to assess the health of the entire financial system, rather than the condition of individual banks, Wall Street investment firms or other financial companies - as is currently the focus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered,&quot; he said. &quot;Some caution is in order, however, as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise.&quot; He added that &quot;stress tests&quot; for a range of financial firms might also be helpful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Fed has taken unprecedented steps over the past year to battle the nation's worst credit and financial crises in decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To brace the wobbly economy, the central bank has slashed its key interest rate by 3.25 percentage points, the most aggressive rate-cutting campaign in decades. Those rate cuts aggravated inflation, though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Fed also has taken some debatable action to stabilize the shaky financial system and to get credit - the economy's lifeblood - flowing more freely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Fed agreed in March to let investment houses draw emergency loans directly from the central bank, and last month extended that option to Fannie and Freddie. For years, such lending privileges were extended only to commercial banks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Bernanke's economic outlook</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fed speak: Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said the current economic environment is among the</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN THE DEAD of night in a small hideaway office in the deserted Capitol, a clandestine meeting takes place between two senators with one goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They grin at each other as they lift their celebratory shots of brutally cold Stolichnaya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's to The One,&quot; they toast in unison. &quot;He's toast!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama should have picked you, Hillary,&quot; John McCain tells her. &quot;It isn't fair, my friend. But it just makes it easier for me to whup him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't worry, John, I've put it behind me,&quot; Hillary replies. &quot;I'm looking toward the future now, a future that looks very bright, once we send Twig Legs back to the back bench.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They chortle with delight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's a bright young man, but he got ahead of himself,&quot; McCain says. &quot;He needs to be taught a lesson, and we're the ones to do it. Have you seen the new polls? Obama's dropped and we're even again. The Bullet's getting all the credit, but you and I know, Hillary, that it's these top-secret counseling sessions we're having. And thanks again for BlackBerrying me the Rick Warren questions while I was in the so-called cone of silence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, John, you know I love you and I'm happy to help,&quot; Hillary says. &quot;The themes you took from me are working great -- painting Obama as an elitist and out-of-touch celebrity, when we're rich celebrities, too. Turning his big rallies and pretty words into character flaws, charging him with playing the race card -- that one always cracks me up. And accusing the media, especially NBC, of playing favorites. It's so easy to get the press to navel-gaze; they're so insecure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're all pinko Commies,&quot; McCain laughs. &quot;Especially since they deserted me for The Messiah. Seriously, Hill, that Paris Hilton-Britney Spears ad you came up with was brilliant. I owe you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking pleased, Hillary expertly downs another shot. &quot;His secret fear is being seen as a dumb blonde,&quot; she says. &quot;He wants to take a short cut to the top and pose on glossy magazine covers, but he doesn't want to be seen as a glib pretty boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain lifts his glass to her admiringly. &quot;If I do say so myself, while the rookie was surfing in Hawaii, I ate his pupus for lunch. Pictures of him pushing around a golf ball while I'm pushing around Putin. Priceless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a little secret to tell you about that, John. Bill made it happen. He loves you so much. He called Putin and told him that if he invaded Georgia, he could count on being invited to the Clinton Global Initiative every year for the rest of his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wow. Should I call him? I saw your husband's kind words about me in Las Vegas on Monday, saying I'd be just as good as Obama on climate change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he'd like that,&quot; Hillary smiles. &quot;He's still boiling at Obama. And you don't have to worry about my army of angry women. We've spread the word in the feminist underground -- as opposed to that wacky Obama Weather Underground -- that 'catharsis' is code for 'No surrender.' My gals know when I say 'We may have started on two separate paths but we're on one journey now' that Skinny's journey is to the nearest exit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Obama's says he's finally ready to hit back,&quot; McCain says, frowning. &quot;He's starting a blistering TV campaign and attacking me for attacking his patriotism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, John, you know that every time he tries to get tough, he quickly runs out of gas. Sometimes in debates, he'd be exhausted by the third question. He must use up all his energy in the gym. He doesn't have any stamina, and he certainly doesn't have our bloodlust. Besides, you can throw that Mark Penn stuff at him that I couldn't use in a Democratic primary about how he's not fundamentally American in his thinking and values. While he's up on his high-minded pedestal, you'll scoot past him in your Ferragamos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can I ever thank you, my friend?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can announce that you won't be running for re-election because you'd be 76, and you can pick somebody really lame to run with, like your pal Lieberman. That means one term for you, and two for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a deal,&quot; McCain says, sticking out his hand to shake on it. &quot;That was inspired to snatch his convention away -- makes him look so weak. Listen, why don't you stop in Sedona on the way to Denver? Wear a black wig and I'll spirit you up to the cabin for the night. I'll catch a catfish in the mill pond and grill it for you. It will be an adventure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a knock on the door. Jesse Jackson sticks his head into the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is it over?&quot; he asks his co-conspirators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, he's over,&quot; they respond in unison.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">384 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT USED TO BE that scandals were named for buildings. (Remember Watergate?) Now, it seems, they're about buildings. John McCain doesn't know how many houses he and his wife own. Barack Obama bought his with an assist from a man later convicted of felonies. So much for the substantive, high-road campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can bemoan this elevation of the trivial without being deluded into thinking that it's something new -- although the velocity of the 24-7 news cycle, the omnipresence of cable television and instantaneous transmission over the Internet have intensified this phenomenon. Small moments that capture -- or appear to capture -- a deeper truth about a candidate are easy for voters to grasp and for rival campaigns to exploit. George H.W. Bush was painted as being out of touch because he supposedly marveled at a supermarket scanner. Al Gore was portrayed  as a r&Atilde;&copy;sum&Atilde;&copy;-puffing blowhard because he supposedly claimed credit for launching the Internet or uncovering problems at Love Canal. Smart candidates have always known that they need to keep abreast of the price of a quart of milk. (Keeping up with the price of arugula at Whole Foods doesn't count.) Now they'll need to refresh their recollection of their real estate holdings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign, having already  collected research on the McCain real estate holdings, quickly produced an ad to taunt him. And it's not as though the McCain campaign has been higher-minded: Comparing Mr. Obama to Paris Hilton, Britney Spears and Charlton Heston as Moses isn't exactly a reprise of the Lincoln-Douglas debates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Really, do the McCains' real estate holdings and his failure to keep count of his wife's Coronado condos make Mr. McCain oblivious to the concerns of ordinary Americans -- any more than their family estates made Franklin D. Roosevelt or John F. Kennedy incapable of feeling the pain of the common man? Do Mr. Obama's four fireplaces, music room, wine cellar and four-car garage count against him? Likewise, Mr. Obama has long said that he had a lapse in judgment in getting entangled with Tony Rezko, a friend and fundraiser who in June was convicted of 16 counts of felony corruption  in an influence-peddling scheme,  in buying his house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But anyone who votes on the basis of this sound-and-fury politics deserves the president he gets.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">AKRON, Ohio</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pleasant summer evening was &quot;Imagine Unity&quot; night at Canal Park, home of the minor-league Akron Aeros, and was sponsored by a group of local ministers devoted to promoting reconciliation across racial, gender and religious lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting in the stands along the right-field line, Judy McGovern pondered the question of whether race has been thrust into the presidential contest between Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama. Yes, she said, adding that she was not happy about it, and quickly assigning blame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only one candidate is doing it,&quot; said McGovern, a retired communications specialist from Medina, who is supporting McCain. &quot;Barack Obama is guilty of it, whether it's him or his campaign people. All that talk about how he looks different is typically done to make him a victim. I think that's wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such sentiments convince the Rev. Ronald J. Fowler, a black minister and Obama supporter, that the candidate will raise race only gingerly in the future. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the intent on Obama's part was to use a little humor to try to make a point that being different sometimes is viewed as a liability when it's really an asset,&quot; said Fowler, one of the ministers behind Imagine Unity, as he sat in the office of the Rev. Knute Larson, a white evangelical minister and close friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He did open the door, but I don't think he was trying to make that an issue. That's the last thing that Obama needs to do is to come out and remind people that 'I'm black.' If anything, he needs to do the very opposite -- 'I'm American' -- and to stick with that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a presidential campaign that features the first African American to secure the nomination of a major party, the issue of race has bubbled beneath the surface like magma waiting to burst through a fissure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many thought that time had come a few weeks back. The McCain campaign aired an anti-Obama&nbsp;commercial featuring Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, two white, female celebrities,  and drew criticism that it was racially tinged. Then, Obama said his Republican opponent would point out that he does not &quot;look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills,&quot; a comment that prompted the McCain campaign to accuse the Democrat of playing the &quot;race card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns have since backed away from the touchy issue of race. In a series of interviews in this northeast Ohio city, which has aggressively engaged in efforts to promote racial harmony, people expressed satisfaction over the absence of racial themes in the contest and generally blamed the news media for periodically focusing on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really don't think race is being injected in the campaign at all, and I'm really glad that it's not,&quot; said Leila Lualdi, a software marketer who is white and an Obama supporter, as she chomped on a burrito at a Chipotle in the city's trendy Highland Square neighborhood. &quot;I think the people who are injecting it are the ones who have to fill a 24-hour news cycle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Todd McKenney said he is relieved about the racial discourse of the presidential campaign so far, but he is mightily worried about its future tone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An independent who unsuccessfully ran for municipal judge last year as a Republican, McKenney said he didn't think the Paris Hilton-Britney Spears ad had much to do with race. He said he thought Obama's &quot;dollar bills&quot; assertion was unfair but a slip of the tongue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said that as the race intensifies after the conventions, tougher rhetoric will be more the norm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My concern in this campaign is that these things are going to get spun out, and they are going to generate more confusion in an already-tough area,&quot; said McKenney, a lawyer who has yet to decide whom he'll support. &quot;I think that before the election, that will happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, few polls have measured the extent to which the public thinks race has been actively injected into the campaign. In a recent Los Angeles Times-Bloomberg poll, 48 percent of respondents said they did not think either candidate was using race as an issue. Of those who did, 28 percent said Obama was using it (13 percent said in a positive way, 15 percent in a negative way), while 15 percent said McCain was injecting it into the campaign (3 percent said positively, 12 percent negatively).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, the poll echoed the views of the more than 20 people interviewed in an unscientific survey in this city -- a fact that may be particularly telling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the local newspaper, the Beacon Journal, published a Pulitzer Prize-winning series on Akron's race relations, civic leaders, businessmen and activists in 1993 established the Coming Together Project, an initiative that promoted dialogue across racial lines on issues such as health care, unemployment, and relations between the community and the police department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort garnered enough acclaim that in 1997 President Bill Clinton, as part of his race initiative, hosted a national town hall meeting at Akron University to discuss hot-button racial issues, particularly affirmative action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort has faltered. Funding dried up for the Coming Together Project, and it shut down last year. Still, some residents say the experience made many in Akron, where blacks make up 28 percent of the population of 200,000, more attuned to racial issues than residents of many other places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we're a little bit more heightened to racial issues than other parts of the country because of the project,&quot; said David Hertz, vice president of a public relations company who, as a 30-year-old night editor at the Beacon Journal, conceived the race-relations series that led to the Coming Together Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perhaps Akron is a bit more prepared for an ongoing conversation of race that may or may not come about during this presidential election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some involved in race relations in Akron say Obama's campaign offers a historic opportunity for the country to directly address race and issues of concern to minorities. So far, they say, they are disappointed that, except for Obama's speech in Philadelphia, made in the wake of a controversy over remarks by his longtime minister, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., the campaign's racial component has not gone much beyond name-calling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there's going to be a racial discussion, let's talk about how do we level the playing field for a number of these issues that are affecting our communities -- minority communities disproportionately -- such as HIV-AIDS, which is on the rise, particularly in the African American community; incarceration rates, particularly among black men; failing educational system; housing foreclosures,&quot; said Bernett L. Williams, president of the Akron Urban League. &quot;I'd be interested in their urban agendas. I really don't care what they look like.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama comes in for some tougher criticism in this regard. Even though he lays out an &quot;urban policy,&quot; which calls for such things as job creation and ending racial profiling, he seldom mentions those issues on the stump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police brutality, racial profiling --  these are issues that people are reluctant to put on the table,&quot; said Fannie L. Brown, who for years was executive director of the Coming Together Project. She added: &quot;But, you know, if he started talking about racial profiling, he's a dead duck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever issues are put forward, Larson, the white minister, said he prays they will be done so civilly, though he added that he is concerned that in the intensity of the campaign's final days, they won't be. &quot;I'm always scared of what even nice people do with regard to racial issues,&quot; he said. &quot;This could be a great time for this nation, no matter who wins. It is a great time. This is a great achievement.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama kept the nation waiting Friday as rumors swirled around his choice for a running mate, while his campaign stayed on the offense, criticizing Sen. John McCain as a rich and confused elitist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is expected to name his vice-presidential nominee Saturday before a planned afternoon rally in Springfield, Ill., where he announced his candidacy in February 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia Gov. Tom Kaine spread word he had been ruled out, and Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana was told he was not Mr. Obama's choice, according to party officials, the Associated Press reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kaine said Mr. Obama had telephoned him as another leading contender, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, maintained an unusually low profile. Mr. Biden spent the day at his home in Delaware, huddled with friends and family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As speculation about which name would come via text message, Team Obama pushed a second day of negative attacks against the Republican rival, who was not able to tell a reporter this week how many homes he owns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Call it 'country club economics,' &quot; a new Obama&nbsp;ad accuses. &quot;How many houses does he own? John McCain says he can't even remember any more. Well, it's seven.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad shows Mr. McCain riding in a golf cart with former President George H.W. Bush during a recent fundraiser in Kennebunkport, Maine, and contrasts that with images of people struggling to pay the bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic National Committee joined in, using language that portrayed Mr. McCain, 71, as senile. &quot;McCain loses track of his homes as Americans lose theirs,&quot; a DNC release blasted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain camp released its own new ad blasting Mr. Obama as proposing tax increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Celebrities don't have to worry about family budgets, but we sure do,&quot; an announcer states. &quot;He's ready to raise your taxes, but not ready to lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the ad wars, the vice presidential speculation dominated political conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Chicago, Mr. Obama, who could be seen in the back seat of a black sport utility vehicle, was spirited into the Park Hyatt Hotel through a side-street ramp marked &quot;private&quot; that accessed an underground garage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illinois senator spent about five hours Friday afternoon bunkered in the hotel in the swanky Streeterville neighborhood. The campaign said he was working on his nomination acceptance speech for Thursday at the Denver convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conspicuous presence of Secret Service agents and TV news crews caused a stir in the neighborhood, dotted with high-rise condominiums, upscale boutiques and four-star hotels and restaurants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I knew something was going on,&quot; said the bartender at the Pippin's Tavern across a side street from the Park Hyatt, when she learned why men in dark suits with earpieces were loitering around the service entrance and private garage entrance to the hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is he doing in there?&quot; she asked, echoing the thoughts of reporters staking out the hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News networks were in a frenzy all day over a possible running-mate announcement, with camera crews staked out in front of the top contenders' homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a dark horse emerged when aides confirmed to the Associated Press that Rep. Chet Edwards, who represents President Bush's congressional district in Texas, had submitted vetting papers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Democratic official close to Bill Richardson said the New Mexico governor was told he had been passed over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius rounded out the roster of likely contenders - a list that did not take into account any surprises that Mr. Obama might harbor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, no, no, no, no, no, no, nooooo,&quot; Mrs. Sebelius told reporters who asked for her latest thoughts on the months-long search, the Associated Press reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howard Wolfson, a former spokesman for Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, said on Fox News that the one-time Democratic front-runner was not vetted for the vice presidential spot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She was never asked for any documents,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton, who has been campaigning for her former rival, demurred when asked about being Mr. Obama's running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not in that arena,&quot; she told reporters. &quot;That's for him to decide. This is his decision, and I expect him to make it however he believes is best for him and for our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain may have created his own housing crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours after a report that the Republican presidential nominee-in-waiting didn't know how many homes he and his multimillionaire wife own, Democratic rival Barack Obama launched a national TV ad and a series of campaign stops aimed at portraying McCain as wealthy and out of touch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the economy the top issue in the race, Obama sought to turn McCain's gaffe into one of those symbolic moments that stick in voters' minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think John Kerry sailboarding or the first President Bush wowed by a grocery store checkout scanner, Michael Dukakis riding in a tank or Gerald Ford eating a tamale with the husk still on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think - I'll have my staff get to you,&quot; McCain told Politico when asked Wednesday how many houses he owns. &quot;It's condominiums where - I'll have them get to you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, the McCain campaign told Politico that McCain and his wife, Cindy, have at least four in three states - Arizona, California and Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Property records reviewed by media show McCain and his family appear to own at least eight homes: A ranch and two condos in Arizona; three condos in Coronado, Calif.; a condo in La Jolla, Calif.; and another in Arlington, Va.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week McCain cracked that being rich in the United States meant earning at least $5 million a year. His latest comments gave Democrats an opportunity to suggest that McCain cannot relate to ordinary voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides are trying cast the other as too rich to understand the working class .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's tax returns showed a total income of $405,409 in 2007. According to her 2006 tax returns, Cindy McCain had a total income of $6 million. She has not released her 2007 returns, which she files separately from her husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and his wife, Michelle, reported making $4.2 million in 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underscoring how seriously the McCain campaign takes the house controversy, the Republican National Committee responded with a Web site highlighting Obama's ties to Chicago businessman Antonin &quot;Tony&quot; Rezko, a friend and contributor who was convicted in June on more than a dozen felonies in a corruption scandal.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">more election news</SPAN><BR></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 19 people were examined at hospitals or were quarantined outside the office in Centennial, Colo., a Denver suburb. The office was evacuated, and authorities were trying to determine whether the powder was hazardous.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE AD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Narrator: &quot;Barack Obama knows a lot about housing problems. One of his biggest fundraisers helped him buy his million-dollar mansion. Purchasing part of the property he couldn't afford. From Obama, Rezko got political favors including 14 million from taxpayers. Now, he's a convicted felon, facing jail. That's a housing problem.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANALYSIS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This John McCain&nbsp;ad attempts to drag back into the news Obama's dealings with a corrupt fundraiser, which the senator from Illinois has described as a &quot;boneheaded&quot; mistake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts are generally accurate, though some of the ad's insinuations are not. Tony Rezko was an Obama fundraiser, and when Obama and his wife bought their Chicago home in 2005 for $1.65 million, Rezko's wife bought an adjacent side lot for $625,000. Months later, the Obamas bought a small part of that lot for $104,000. Viewers of the ad may not realize, however, that Rezko was not under investigation at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a state senator, Obama did write letters to officials supporting a $14 million Rezko bid to build senior citizen housing, but he was not the decision-maker. While the ad features a Chicago Sun-Times headline --&quot;Obama Surfaces in Rezko Case&quot;-- he was tangential to the testimony and had no connection to the fraud and money-laundering charges on which Rezko was convicted in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain spot, marked by ominous music, was released yesterday hours after an Obama&nbsp;commercial chided the senator from Arizona for failing to remember that he owns seven houses. The counterattack ad attempts to shift the focus from McCain's wealth to Obama's judgment by reviving a controversy that was fully aired during the primaries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">     Maybe you're struggling just to pay the mortgage on your home. But recently John McCain said, &quot;The fundamentals of our economy are strong.&quot; Hmm. Then again, that same day, when asked how many houses he owns, McCain lost track -- he couldn't remember. Well, it's seven. Seven houses. And here's one house America can't afford to let John McCain move into. [Shot of the White House] </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANALYSIS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">     This Barack Obama&nbsp;ad attempts to paint the senator from Arizona as a wealthy, out-of-touch elitist -- precisely the tactic that Republicans once used against John Kerry and John Edwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain did make the comment about the economy and, in an interview with Politico yesterday, could not enumerate how many houses he owns. (An on-screen graphic notes that they are worth $13 million.) The McCain camp says he and his wife, Cindy, whose fortune comes from a family beer distributorship, use four of the properties, with the others occupied by relatives or others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The underlying assumption -- that McCain's personal wealth makes him insensitive to the struggling economy -- is highly debatable. McCain has repeatedly talked about the need to address economic problems, and both he and the senator from Illinois voiced support for -- but did not vote on -- a housing bailout bill passed by Congress. Still, the tactic could be an effective counterpunch to McCain's ads dismissing Obama as a mere celebrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama spot implicitly makes one other charge. By showing McCain speaking in slow motion with melancholy music in the background, while the narrator says he can't remember the number of homes, the ad suggests the 71-year-old Republican is confused.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain's inability to recall the number of homes he owns during an interview yesterday jeopardized his campaign's carefully constructed strategy to frame Democratic rival Barack Obama as an out-of-touch elitist and inspired a round of attacks that once again ratcheted up the negative tone of the race for the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week dominated by vice presidential speculation and the run-up to the Democratic National Convention was quickly overtaken by the McCain miscue. In an interview with Politico.com, the presumptive Republican nominee was asked how many houses he and his wife, Cindy, heir to a beer distributorship, owned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think -- I'll have my staff get to you,&quot; McCain replied. &quot;It's condominiums where -- I'll have them get to you.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign and the Democratic National Committee pounced with remarkable speed. By mid-morning, reporters had received a video log featuring Cindy McCain's childhood estate in Phoenix, an Architectural Digest spread on another property the McCains had owned previously, and tax records and photos detailing seven houses and condominiums -- in Coronado and La Jolla, Calif.; Phoenix and Sedona, Ariz.; and Arlington. By 11 a.m., the Obama campaign had produced a television advertisement titled &quot;Seven&quot; and was answering the question McCain could not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's seven, seven houses, and here's one house Americans can't afford John McCain to move into,&quot; the ad concludes over an image of the White House. (If a California beachfront condo that Cindy McCain purchased for their children this year is included, the number of homes owned by the McCains rises to eight.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That provoked a furious response by McCain campaign and Republican National Committee aides, who charged hypocrisy and argued that the senator from Illinois had received help purchasing his South Side Chicago mansion from businessman Tony Rezko, a convicted felon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does a guy who made more than $4 million last year, just got back from vacation on a private beach in Hawaii and bought his own million-dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses?&quot; asked McCain spokesman Brian Rogers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator from Arizona also quickly assembled a response ad, in which a narrator intones, &quot;Barack Obama knows a lot about housing problems.&quot; The spot raises Obama's relationship with Rezko, saying that &quot;one of Obama's biggest fundraisers helped him buy his million-dollar mansion,&quot; and charges that in return &quot;Rezko got political favors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the day's end, the Democratic National Committee was threatening to escalate the fight further by highlighting McCain's connections to the &quot;Keating Five&quot; savings and loan scandal, in which the senator ended up before the Senate ethics committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They go Rezko, we go Keating,&quot; said a Democratic strategist, speaking on the condition of anonymity to divulge potential campaign strategy. &quot;If they want to escalate, bring it on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a Democratic candidate suffering from a barrage of attacks on his &quot;celebrity,&quot; McCain's inability to recall the scope of his family holdings was a timely break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess . . . if you don't know how many houses you have, then it's not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong,&quot; Obama told an audience in Chester, Va. &quot;But if you're like me, and you've got one house, or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they don't lose their home, you might have a different perspective.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign aides and Democratic National Committee researchers had been sitting on film clips, tax records, photos and other information on McCain's real estate holdings for weeks. The now-defunct Progressive Media USA, a liberal activist group, had done polling on the potential line of attack and concluded that it alone would have little impact against McCain, whose &quot;brand&quot; as a maverick Republican has proved difficult to crack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama aides were collecting documentation of separate incidents they wanted to string together as a narrative: McCain economic adviser Phil Gramm's comment to the Washington Times that the United States was &quot;a nation of whiners&quot; stuck in a &quot;mental recession&quot; and overstating the current economic woes; a McCain assertion that the economy is fundamentally strong; and the Arizonan's comment Saturday at the Saddleback Civil Forum in California defining the threshold for being rich as an income of $5 million a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When McCain made his comment to Politico, Obama communications director Dan Pfeiffer flashed the green light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the slip doesn't resonate broadly with the electorate, it could have meaning for the one group Obama has had the most difficulty with: working-class white voters, said Democratic strategist Tom Matzzie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also muddles what had been a clear Republican line of attack on Obama. Throughout the summer, the GOP had worked furiously to turn one of Obama's greatest strengths -- his ability to whip his supporters into a passionate movement -- into a weakness, framing him as an inexperienced, featherweight celebrity who is not ready to lead. Obama's edge in many national polls has dwindled since that line of attack was launched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain's wealth was bound to eventually become entangled in the debate. The McCain campaign grudgingly released Cindy McCain's 2006 tax returns in May but refused to release the more detailed schedules that delve into the source of her wealth. Her 2007 tax returns have still not been released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those 2006 returns showed a woman with income that year of more than $6 million. Of that, just $299,418 came from wages and salary. The bulk of it -- $4.55 million -- came from real estate rentals, partnerships and other passive ventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those real estate holdings include a Sedona ranch with three dwellings, worth $1.1 million; a Phoenix condominium suite that had originally been two units, worth $4.7 million; an $847,800 three-bedroom high-rise condo in Arlington; an oceanfront condo in La Jolla, Calif.; a half-million-dollar loft in Phoenix purchased for their daughter Meghan; another Phoenix condo, worth $830,000; and two beachfront condos in Coronado, Calif, one of which is valued at $2.7 million. The other was purchased just this year, as McCain was lamenting the difficulties that struggling Americans were facing just to make their mortgage payments. Cindy McCain told Vogue magazine the family needed the second condo because the first was getting too crowded as their family grew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's confusion could be rooted in the scattered nature of the family's holdings. Public records show they were purchased by various McCain family entities, with names such as Dream Catcher Family LLC and Wild River LLC, and at least one is listed as rental real estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ferocity of the McCain campaign's response to Obama made it clear how seriously it viewed the potential for damage from the Arizonan's remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people 'cling' to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about who's in touch with regular Americans?&quot; Rogers demanded. In an interview, he was even more animated, saying Obama lived in a &quot;frickin' mansion&quot; in Chicago and adding that he is confident McCain resonates more with regular Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In terms of who's an elitist, I think people have made a judgment that John McCain is not an arugula-eating, pointy-headed-professor type based on his life story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But recent events, some of them attributable to McCain or his advisers, have threatened McCain's regular-guy image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday night, during an appearance with the Rev. Rick Warren, an evangelical leader, McCain was asked to define the word &quot;rich&quot; and responded: &quot;I think if you are just talking about income, how about $5 million?&quot; Warren and the audience laughed, and McCain quickly added: &quot;But seriously, I don't think you can -- I don't think seriously that -- the point is that I'm trying to make here, seriously -- and I'm sure that comment will be distorted -- but the point is that we want to keep people's taxes low and increase revenues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain had distanced himself from Gramm after the &quot;whiners&quot; comment but welcomed him back to the campaign at a meeting of advisers last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And liberal bloggers have struck as well, pointing out that McCain's standard campaign uniform of blue &quot;Navy&quot; baseball cap and khakis is anchored by a distinctive pair of $500 Ferragamo loafers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Democrats celebrate in Denver next week, Republican presumptive presidential nominee Sen. John McCain will be trying to fire up some star power of his own by collecting checks and support from conservatives in Hollywood. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain will attend a fundraiser at the Beverly Hilton on Monday, the day the Democrats' convention opens, bringing together top leaders from the Los Angeles business and entertainment communities, according to an invitation for the event obtained by The Washington Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Show-business publication Variety reported that Angie Harmon, David Zucker, Jon Cryer, Lionel Chetwynd, Craig T. Nelson, Jon Voight, Craig Haffner and Robert Duvall are among those expected to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tickets start at $500 for those 35 or younger, and $1,000 for everyone else. As usual at these events, those who give more get more time with Mr. McCain, and chances for private photos with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several of the expected attendees did not return calls from The Times seeking comment, but Variety said some of the stars are expected to go to the Republicans' nominating convention the week after, in St. Paul, Minn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Republican Party operative said on the condition of anonymity that the hope is the celebrities will drive up attendance and interest in the fundraiser and in the McCain message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers said the event is meant to attract a wide swath of Los Angeles supporters, not just the Hollywood glitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're proud to have such a broad cross-section of support in the Los Angeles area from people who share the firm belief that John McCain is the best prepared leader to move America forward,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatives in Hollywood have slowly been joining the political fray this year. Last month, The Times reported that Hollywood figures, organized by Gary Sinise and others, have been meeting in a loose-knit network dedicated to supporting U.S. troops and traditional American values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mr. Voight wrote an op-ed arguing that an Obama presidency would mean &quot;we will live through a socialist era that America has not seen before, and our country will be weakened in every way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to figures from the Center for Responsive Politics' OpenSecrets.org, employees in the entertainment industries of TV, movies and music have contributed $4.7 million to Sen. Barack Obama, dwarfing the $838,101 to Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That figure includes contributions from media bosses such as Jerry Bruckheimer, who is listed as one of the co-chairs of Monday's event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain angered some of the Hollywood set when his campaign began running a television commercial earlier this year comparing Mr. Obama to celebrities Paris Hilton and Britney Spears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Hilton's mother, a McCain donor, was harshly critical, and Miss Hilton herself made a well-received video response spoofing both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Los Angeles Times reported that some in Hollywood thought Mr. McCain a bit hypocritical since eight years ago, in his primary battle with then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush, he was considered the darling of Hollywood.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">961 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama's campaign is providing more details about who would pay higher taxes if he becomes president, in an attempt to beat back charges that he intends to increase the tax burden on the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After sending conflicting signals earlier in the campaign, Mr. Obama has attempted to nail down the details of his tax policies before he formally accepts the Democratic Party's presidential nomination Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, has charged in a recent campaign ad that Mr. Obama would raise taxes on Americans making just $42,000 per year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama has voted in support of higher taxes 94 times in just three years,&quot; said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, chief economic adviser to Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of how Mr. Obama voted as a senator, his presidential campaign minces no words in declaring whose taxes would not increase after he enters the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any and all charges that Obama would raise [tax] rates on capital gains, dividends, income, savings and so on for the approximately 98 percent of American families making less than $250,000 are simply not true,&quot; Jason Furman, economic policy director of the Obama campaign, told The Washington Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since last year, before the first primary votes were cast in January, Mr. Obama has pledged to reinstate the Clinton-era wage-and-salary income-tax rates of 36 percent and 39.6 percent for families earning more than $250,000. Today's top income-tax rate is 35 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, Mr. Obama indicated that today's top capital-gains tax rate of 15 percent might increase to as much as 28 percent - the rate that prevailed after Congress and President Reagan reformed the tax system in 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Clinton and a Republican Congress agreed to lower the 28 percent capital-gains rate to 20 percent in 1997, and President Bush and a Republican Congress further lowered it to 15 percent in 2003. Mr. McCain voted against the 2003 tax cut, but wants to retain it today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mr. Obama promised to eliminate the Bush tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000, some analysts expected him to raise the top dividend tax rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Mr. Furman and Austan Goolsbee, another Obama economic adviser, announced that the top tax rate for both capital gains and dividends would be 20 percent. That rate would apply only to individuals and couples earning more than $200,000 and $250,000, respectively. Below those levels, capital gains and dividends would continue to be taxed at a top rate of 15 percent, Mr. Furman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama also has sent different signals on Social Security taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we kept the payroll tax exactly the same but applied it to all earnings and not just the first [$102,000], we could virtually eliminate the entire Social Security shortfall,&quot; Mr. Obama wrote in an op-ed published in Iowa's Quad-City Times in September. Currently, only the first $102,000 of a worker's wage-and-salary income is subject to the Social Security payroll tax of 12.4 percent, which is split between employee and employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's op-ed led Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign to charge that he wanted to raise Social Security taxes on middle-class families, a charge his campaign denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, Mr. Obama floated the idea of imposing Social Security payroll taxes on incomes above $250,000 - without specifying what the tax rates would be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign now says that it is considering levying Social Security taxes &quot;in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent&quot; on wages above $250,000. But the increase would not take place for at least a decade. Policy-makers have historically phased in changes in Social Security, Mr. Furman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A cash infusion 10 years from now makes sense,&quot; said Roberton Williams, a principal research associate for the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington. Implementing the Social Security tax increase earlier would enable Congress and the president to spend the extra funds on other programs, he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Obama has repeatedly shifted his position on taxes to support his political situation,&quot; said Mr. Holtz-Eakin, Mr. McCain's economic adviser. &quot;It is a fundamental credibility issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Iowa, he was going to fix Social Security by eliminating the payroll cap. Now it is a 2-to-4 percent tax above $250,000 10 years from now. I have no doubt after the election he would ... revert to his 2007 position on Social Security,&quot; Mr Holtz-Eakin told The Washington Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to reinstating the top income-tax rate of 39.6 percent, Mr. Obama would restore two provisions that limited personal exemptions and itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers. Restoring those items, which the 2001 tax cut eliminated, would add 4.5 percentage points to the top 39.6 percent tax rate, according to Robert Carroll, vice president for economic policy at the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based think tank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, since 1993, a Medicare payroll tax of 2.9 percent has applied to all wages, lifting the effective top tax rate by nearly three more percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Mr. Obama's full package of upper-income tax increases goes into effect, the top marginal tax rate would be nearly 50 percent, a incentive-destroying level we haven't seen since 1986,&quot; said Mr. Carroll, who served in the Bush administration as deputy assistant secretary at the Treasury Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Furman, the Obama campaign adviser, thinks Mr. Carroll's 4.5 percentage-point estimate is too high, but he does not deny that the top marginal tax rate would rise by a significant amount in an Obama presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What the McCain campaign doesn't tell you is that, according to the Tax Policy Center, middle-class families will get at least a three-times-larger tax cut under the Obama plan than under Senator McCain's,&quot; Mr. Furman said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the country's most scrutinized - and often thankless - volunteer job. Say too much and you are labeled a loudmouth. Say too little and you're a robot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the job of first lady, and Michelle Obama, wife of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama, is trying to find the happy medium for her image during this long campaign season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The role is a help-wanted ad with a changing definition, said Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway, author of the book &quot;What Women Really Want: How American Women Are Quietly Erasing Political, Racial, Class and Religious Lines to Change the Way We Live.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most political wives are accidental politicians,&quot; Mrs. Conway said. &quot;Their husbands made the decision to enter politics at this level long after they were married. Most of them didn't ask for this.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reluctant leader or not, the first lady still has an important job, said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first lady is, in some ways, more influential than the secretary of state,&quot; he said. &quot;She has the president's ear and knows all the secrets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impressive resume</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If first ladies were judged by resumes, Michelle Robinson Obama, who addresses the Democratic National Convention on Monday, would seem well-qualified for the job. The daughter of a city worker and a homemaker, she grew up in a two-family bungalow in a black neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. She attended public schools - skipping second grade - and went on to Princeton University. Mrs. Obama was one of 94 black freshmen in a class of more than 1,100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Princeton came Harvard Law, then a job at Sidley Austin, a Chicago corporate law firm. It was there she was asked to mentor Mr. Obama, a fellow Harvard Law graduate and a new associate. The couple married in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually, Mrs. Obama left the firm for the staff of Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, where she worked with service agencies to help the disadvantaged. Along the way, the couple had two daughters - Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7 - and Mrs. Obama went to work as vice president of community affairs for the University of Chicago Medical Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the intangibles, though, that make Mrs. Obama far from the traditional first lady and more of a hard sell to some.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics have suggested favoritism as Mr. Obama's political influence rose, as when Mrs. Obama took a board seat for TreeHouse Foods. The family's association with controversial pastor the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. also has earned her criticism, bringing up racial stereotypes the family has long tried to overcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking a hit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came remarks made at a February campaign stop in Madison, Wis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time in my adult life, I am really proud of my country,&quot; Mrs. Obama told the crowd. &quot;Not just because Barack is doing well, but I think people are hungry for change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Add &quot;unpatriotic&quot; to the list of potential negatives. Cindy McCain, wife of Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain, countered with, &quot;I have, and always will be, proud of my country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Obama explained herself a few days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I was clearly talking about was that I'm proud how Americans are engaging in the political process,&quot; she told reporters. &quot;For the first time in my lifetime, I am seeing people rolling up their sleeves in a way that I haven't seen. That's the source of pride that I was talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unlikely source rallied to Mrs. Obama's defense: first lady Laura Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think she probably meant I'm 'more proud,' you know, is what she really meant,&quot; Mrs. Bush told ABC News. &quot;You have to be very careful in what you say. I mean, I know that. That's one of the things you learn, and that's one of the really difficult parts both of running for president and for being the spouse of the president, and that is, everything you say is looked at and in many cases misconstrued.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The damage was done, though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Rasmussen Reports survey in early June found that 42 percent of voters viewed Mrs. Obama unfavorably, while 29 percent viewed Mrs. McCain unfavorably. The same poll showed that 61 percent of voters said their perceptions of a candidate's spouse were at least somewhat important to their choice in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, an ABC News poll taken a week later gave Mrs. Obama a nine-point edge in favorable opinion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 'proud of her country' comment is going to follow her constantly,&quot; said Myra Gutin, professor of communication at Rider University and author of the book &quot;The President's Partner: The First Lady in the Twentieth Century.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It gave people a certain take on her,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the gaffe, Obama campaign staffers have paid more attention to what Mrs. Obama is going to say and to whom she is going to say it. Observers note she is speaking less off the cuff and more from scripted remarks. She co-hosted ABC's &quot;The View&quot; and has given interviews to Good Housekeeping, Ebony, and People magazines highlighting her role as a busy working mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mother's workload</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Mrs. Obama noted in People that much of her life mirrors most women who are trying to be many things to many people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple does not have a full-time nanny, and Mrs. Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, pitches in to watch the girls - running them to soccer, dance, tennis and piano lessons - when the Obamas are on the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Obama tries to fit in a couple of 90-minute workouts a week to maintain her enviable muscle tone, noticeable in the sleeveless sheaths she wears at campaign appearances. She worries about the food her girls eat and what the future holds for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Obama has been speaking to smaller groups and is reaching out to other working mothers. She met with military wives in Norfolk and in Hopkinsville, Ky., in early August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that, too often, it seems like you're doing it all on your own,&quot; she told the Norfolk group, assuring them she is there to listen and to relay concerns back to Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Obama is also trying to head off speculation that she will be a &quot;co-president&quot; in the tradition of Hillary Rodham Clinton during her husband's White House years. Her first priority, should her husband win the election, will be the well-being of her daughters, she has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said last year that &quot;no one can predict what Americans will need from their first lady a year from now, so I will be whatever I need to be for the country. My sense is that being first lady is a full-time job, but I will know more about that when the time comes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Obama expanded on the theme more recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My primary focus will be making sure my girls are whole and healthy,&quot; she said at the Norfolk appearance, &quot;but once we deal with our readjustment period, I want to be productive and engaged as much as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter what role Mrs. Obama takes on if she is first lady, don't expect the criticism to abate, Mr. Sabato said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a shame, really,&quot; he said. &quot;We trivialize first lady candidates and make them papier-mache when they are complicated human beings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added Ms. Gutin, &quot;Scrutinizing the first lady goes back as far as Martha Washington. It goes along with Americans are very much divided on what they want. In the final analysis, first ladies are only a small part of our election decision, but they may be important as a measure of a candidate's character.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two rich men who want to be president traded new attacks Thursday accusing each other of being out of touch with the Americans, as Sen. Barack Obama got more aggressive amid his slipping poll numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama mocked Sen. John McCain for not knowing on the spot the number of houses he owns, saying, &quot;If you're like me ... you've got one house,&quot; as his campaign released an attack ad on the same topic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When asked how many houses he owns, McCain lost track. He couldn't remember. Well, it's seven. Seven houses,&quot; a narrator says in the ad, running on national cable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain team fired back in a statement, reminding voters of Mr. Obama's several gaffes and his own wealthy status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does a guy who made more than $4 million last year, just got back from vacation on a private beach in Hawaii and bought his own million-dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses?&quot; McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people 'cling' to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about who's in touch with regular Americans?&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's tax returns showed that he and his wife, Michelle, earned $4.2 million in 2007. Their Chicago home is worth $1.6 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, whose wife,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cindy, is a wealthy heiress, earned $405,000, according to tax returns released by the campaign. Mrs. McCain, worth an estimated $100 million, is chairman of a beer distributor affiliated with the Anheuser-Busch group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple's Sedona property - where the senator from Arizona has hosted political reporters and potential running mates - spans 6 acres and has several houses. It is owned by the Cindy Hensley McCain Family Trust, and the other properties also are owned by Mrs. McCain, who files her taxes separately and has not released her 2007 returns for review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her 2006 tax returns showed income of $6 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his response, Mr. Rogers accused Mr. Obama of wanting to raise taxes, saying that demonstrates the Democrat is &quot;completely out of touch with the concerns of average Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama often notes that his book sales made his family wealthy. Before that, he has said, he and his wife were &quot;normal&quot; and just six years ago paid off student loans. This week, he told voters that his single mother sometimes had to use food stamps and used Mrs. Obama's father as an example of a working-class man who put his children through college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Democrats embraced the line against Mr. McCain after the Republican's gaffe on his houses and definition of being &quot;rich&quot; as an annual income of $5 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In four swing states he visited in the past week - New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina and Virginia - Mr. Obama recounted that when Mr. McCain was asked who are &quot;the rich&quot; during last weekend's Saddleback Forum, he answered &quot;$5 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator from Illinois asked voters to raise their hands if they were making $5 million. When no one did, and the audience laughed at Mr. McCain's expense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Democrats approved of the hard tactic against Mr. McCain, since Mr. Obama has slipped in several polls and fell behind the Republican in some others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Republicans found an opportunity to exploit an Obama weakness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain team quickly crafted an ad noting Mr. Obama's association with indicted Chicago developer Antonin &quot;Tony&quot; Rezko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama donated to charity more than $20,000 in political contributions from Mr. Rezko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has said it was a mistake to work with Mr. Rezko, who bought a vacant lot next the home Mr. Obama wanted as the owner aimed to sell both properties at once. Mr. Rezko then sold part of the property to the Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Democrats delighted in Mr. McCain's uncomfortable moment, and distributed audio from the Politico interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked how many homes he owns, Mr. McCain said: &quot;I think, uh ... I'll have my staff get to you It's condominiums where ... I'll have them get to you&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain aides later told Politico that Mr. McCain and his wife have &quot;at least four in three states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama returned to the issue several times during an event in this Richmond suburb with Gov. Tim Kaine, considered a contender for an Obama vice-presidential pick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answering a question about postal workers as working-class people, he said, &quot;They don't have seven houses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During another question about teachers frustrated with the No Child Left Behind Act, Mr. Obama noted that underpaid teachers may have a hard time paying their mortgages, Mr. McCain, &quot;I promise you he and his wife are itemizing, and they get a mortgage deduction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain said he was joking that the threshold for being rich is $5 million, but Mr. Obama quipped: &quot;I guess, if you're only making $3 million a year, then you're middle class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also reprised McCain economic adviser Phil Gramm's comments to The Washington Times this summer that the U.S. is a &quot;nation of whiners&quot; and is experiencing a &quot;mental recession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kaine also hit Mr. McCain on the issue, saying on CNN in the morning that the senator &quot;couldn't count high enough apparently to even know how many houses he owns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to PolitiFact, the seven McCain homes are located in five cities: Sedona, Ariz.; Phoenix; Arlington; La Jolla, Calif.; and Coronado, Calif.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats are seizing on the revelation that Mr. McCain wears $520 Ferragamo Italian leather loafers, and Obama strategist David Axelrod alluded to the many McCain homes in an interview with the New York Times recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, his strategists met on the portico of the McCain estate in Sedona - or maybe in one of his six other houses - and decided what line of attack they were going to use,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign went on full offense, deploying Democratic governors as surrogates to push the issue in swing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, the Obama team began a mock &quot;statewide search&quot; to find voters who, &quot;like John McCain, have so many homes that they just can't keep track of the number.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MARTINSVILLE </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama began a two-day Virginia campaign swing Tuesday in a community with the state's highest unemployment rate, telling a Martinsville audience that he will take aggressive steps to improve the plight of economically-distressed communities that are reeling from plant closings and layoffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not saying that every job is going to come back to Martinsville just because I'm elected president,&quot; Obama said in a town hall-style meeting at Patrick Henry Community College's Virginia Motorsports Technology Center. &quot;I'm not saying that suddenly all of the schools are going to be fixed. But what I can do is I can say that I'm going to wake up every day thinking about you and thinking about how to make your life a little bit better.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 300 people invited by Obama's campaign filled folding chairs in the uncomfortably warm building to hear Obama, who hopes to become the first Democratic presidential candidate in 44 years to carry Virginia. Obama shared the spotlight with former governor and U.S. Senate candidate Mark Warner, and spoke to an audience that was surrounded by race cars propped on lifts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign bus later rolled to Lynchburg, where he joined Sen. Jim Webb for a public event at E.C. Glass High School that drew some 2,000 people, including Roanoke Mayor David Bowers, Del. Onzlee Ware and Virginia Sen. John Edwards. Congressional candidates Tom Perriello and Sam Rasoul also attended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama will join Gov. Tim Kaine, a possible vice presidential running mate, for events today in Chester and Chesapeake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign had billed the Martinsville event as a forum to discuss trade policies that have affected communities with manufacturing-based economies. But Obama largely stuck to broader economic themes, and said he has a more effective plan than Republican John McCain to jump-start the economy. And he said Martinsville's ailing economy, which had relied heavily on textile and furniture manufacturing, is similar to those of struggling communities in the industrial Midwest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People feel like the American dream is slipping away,&quot; he said. &quot;We can't keep going in the same direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said he would end tax breaks for corporations that move jobs overseas; create incentives for those that foster jobs in the U.S.; add jobs in alternative energy industries; and provide $1,000 per-family tax credits to cushion the impact of rising food and energy costs. In front of an audience that included union members, Obama also said he supports proposed legislation that would allow employees to organize unions without being required to hold a secret ballot election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also questioned why Iraq is being allowed to shelter billions in oil revenues while the U.S. foots the bill for rebuilding efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should be using some of that money to rebuild Virginia, laying roads, building broadband lines and putting people back to work,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama argued that McCain will continue the economic and trade policies of President Bush, and used a rhetorical question to frame the contrast between the candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many of you are better off now than when George Bush took office?&quot; Obama said. &quot;Go ahead, raise your hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warner's focus on economic conditions in rural areas was cited by Obama's campaign last week when Warner was chosen to deliver the keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention. Warner said Martinsville was an appropriate stop for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a lot of ways, this is ground zero for 'can we get the information age right?' &quot; Warner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warner called Obama &quot;a man of deep faith -- faith in God, faith in country and faith in recognizing that every community has got to get a fair shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Lynchburg, Webb revisited the theme of economic inequality, which he pushed heavily during his 2006 campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that Virginia has the highest disparity from top to bottom of any state and bemoaned job losses in Southside and central Virginia's manufacturing sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he also underscored the importance of those regions in Democrats' efforts to flip the state for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Virginia may be the key to deciding the future of America,&quot; Webb said to a roar of applause and stomps. &quot;This part of Virginia may well hold the key to the election here in Virginia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spoke for just over an hour, repeating many of the themes he'd addressed in Martinsville for the larger Lynchburg audience. He also spoke about attacks in recent weeks, saying that Republicans had circulated ads and rumors &quot;denying my faith as a Christian, or denying my patriotism as an American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The folks in charge haven't been very good at governing, but they have been very good at campaigning,&quot; Obama said. &quot;They will run negative ad after negative ad, attack after attack, with the goal of making you lose focus on the issues and their failures and try to focus on me and to make me out to be a risky, scary guy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to say I don't find myself particularly scary, or particularly risky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign fired back at Obama after the Martinsville event, enlisting an economic adviser and Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling to blast Obama's economic plans in a conference call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They cast Obama as a captive of Democrats who would advocate tax increases and greater government spending, and argued that he could not get the economy out of its rut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to communities such as Martinsville, McCain adviser Doug Holtz-Eakin said McCain has acknowledged that &quot;globalization doesn't automatically help everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Holtz-Eakin said McCain would take steps such as improving transition assistance for displaced workers and containing rising health care costs, which Holtz-Eakin cited as &quot;the reason that people are not getting a raise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa Foster, a Martinsville resident and former college administrator, bemoaned the fact that young people don't return to communities like hers after getting college degrees. Obama cited the community college's motorsports program as an example of the kind of investments that can help young workers develop skills tied to local economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't just have one sector that's doing well and have the state thrive over the long term,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain chided his Democratic rival on Wednesday for getting &quot;a little testy&quot; as Barack Obama sharpened his tone amid a tightening White House race .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I honor his service. I don't honor his policies. I don't honor his politics,&quot; Obama said, taking on his GOP opponent with renewed vigor while some Democrats fret that their candidate has not been aggressive enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates also unveiled fresh attack advertisements ahead of their back-to-back national conventions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trying anew to tie McCain to the unpopular President Bush, Obama's TV commercial asks: &quot;Can we really afford more of the same?&quot; It slams McCain's tax plan as a giveaway for big corporations and oil companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's radio ad claims: &quot;Celebrities like to spend their millions. Barack Obama is no different. Only it's your money he wants to spend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats are questioning whether Obama has a second act beyond his message of change and wondering whether he can throw an effective punch against a Republican Party willing to play hardball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans, in turn, are emboldened by improving poll numbers that show McCain starting to close a summer-long Obama edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pew Research Center's latest survey found Obama at 46 percent and McCain at 43 percent, tighter than the 8-percentage-point gap two months ago. The survey found that McCain has solidified his base of support, particularly among whites, men, Republicans and evangelicals. Conversely, Obama has made few gains, but has retained his overwhelming advantage among blacks and younger voters, while also leading among women.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">spending</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain spent $32 million in July, with nearly $2 of every $3 devoted to advertising, according to financial reports filed Wednesday to the Federal Election Commission. He reported raising more than $26 million during the month. He began August with more than $21 million in the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His aggressive media strategy - he spent nearly $19 million to produce and place advertising spots - kept him on the air as much as Democratic rival Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deadline for filing July financial reports is midnight Wednesday. Obama had not yet submitted his at press time, but the campaign announced last weekend that he had raised more than $51 million in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP convention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Socially moderate former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former Democratic vice presidential nominee Joseph Lieberman will have featured speaking roles at next month's Republican National Convention, party officials announced Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giuliani, who once thought he would be the one accepting the GOP nomination, will deliver the keynote address on the Tuesday night of convention week. The mayor ended his campaign without winning a single delegate. But he remains a popular figure among Republicans, and is thought to appeal to Democrats and independents.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain spent $32 million in July, with nearly $2 of every $3 devoted to advertising, according to financial reports filed Wednesday to the Federal Election Commission. He reported raising more than $26 million during the month. He began August with more than $21 million in the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His aggressive media strategy -- he spent nearly $19 million to produce and place advertising spots -- kept him on the air as much as Democratic rival Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deadline for filing July financial reports is midnight Wednesday. Obama had not yet submitted his at press time, but the campaign announced last weekend that he had raised more than $51 million in July.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Socially moderate former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former Democratic vice presidential nominee Joseph Lieberman will have featured speaking roles at next month's Republican National Convention, party officials announced Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giuliani, who once thought he would be the one accepting the GOP nomination, will deliver the keynote address on the Tuesday night of convention week. The mayor's unorthodox campaign never found favor with the party's faithful, and he ended his presidential bid without winning a single delegate. But he remains a popular figure among Republicans, and is thought to appeal to Democrats and independents. Lieberman, who ran with Democrat Al Gore in 2000, supports his former party enough to give it control of the Senate, but is an ardent backer of McCain, a longtime friend and colleague. His address on the opening night of the convention is intended to signal McCain's independence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Schmidt will not budge, and Mark Salter is begging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why do I have to do this if you're not going?&quot; Salter, a close John McCain confidant, is whining to the man now running the GOP presidential operation. &quot;Get up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not going,&quot; Schmidt shoots back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, you are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not. I do not want to do it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Come on. Dude. I'm not going if you're not going,&quot; Salter pleads from the doorway of Schmidt's small office at McCain headquarters in Arlington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will not appear in the pages of GQ,&quot; Schmidt declares defiantly, referring to the photo shoot on campaign hotshots that the magazine is doing for the November issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salter sulks out, and Schmidt jumps up to lock the door with a loud click.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't need anyone knowing who I am,&quot; he mutters, almost to himself. &quot;It's the thing I despise most about this job. I don't want to be in GQ. I want to go home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Schmidt has made a career out of not being a creature of Washington. If the 2008 campaign were an action film, he would play the tough-talking Steven Seagal character, an idiosyncratic hero who is duty-bound to rescue the desperate from burning buildings (which Schmidt literally did last Christmas), but who longs to retreat into his easygoing world of family and suburbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 37, Schmidt is one of the most forceful, successful and unconventional political operatives of his generation, running one of the most uphill GOP presidential efforts in decades -- yet he is hardly known outside  political circles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a 6-foot frame carrying 225 pounds, plus a shaved head and an intense, clipped New Jersey style of speech, it's a little hard for him to stay under the radar. But try he has. He rarely appears on TV and avoids talking about strategy publicly. He would not be photographed for this story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, this was not at all how he planned to spend his fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A veteran of George W. Bush's 2004 campaign as a communications strategist, and well regarded for his instincts in shepherding Bush's nominations to the Supreme Court through the process, he was heavily courted by the top GOP presidential contenders last year. Mitt Romney sent him an antique chair to symbolize a seat at the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schmidt was drawn to McCain, but planned on a limited role so he could have a life and remain in California, where he had settled after running Arnold Schwarzenegger's 2006 gubernatorial reelection campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It never quite turned out that way. Schmidt was in the thick of things almost immediately, evolving into one of the Arizona senator's closest advisers. Then he joined McCain on the campaign trail right before the New Hampshire primary -- and never left. &quot;I knew if we won New Hampshire I was not going home anytime soon,&quot; he says in a rare interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, McCain asked Schmidt to take over the daily operations of an unfocused campaign that was languishing in Barack Obama's shadow. Frustrated Republicans saw an organization incapable of making the case for its candidate, switching themes and messages almost daily -- and failing to resonate with voters. Add to that a bad economy, a problematic war and an opponent who had turned into a phenomenon, and Republicans were privately writing McCain's obituary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schmidt wasted no time shaking up the campaign like a California earthquake. He centralized power at headquarters between himself and campaign manager Rick Davis, who has been overseeing the convention, fundraising and the vice-presidential selection. He made sure everyone understood their jobs and was communicating with each other. He insisted that aides stick to a closely controlled message, and he pushed for a more aggressive stance against Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within weeks, McCain was ridiculing Obama's rock-star image in a provocative ad comparing him to Britney Spears, and seizing every opportunity to hammer him  -- for canceling a visit to the troops, accusing him of suggesting McCain was a racist, painting him as an elitist -- all designed to make voters question whether he is ready to be president. At the same time, McCain himself has stuck to Schmidt's playbook with uncharacteristic discipline, even abandoning his daily freewheeling exchange with reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some loyalists complain that this new, more negative strategy is demeaning to McCain, and killing his trademark spontaneity and candor. But there is no question that it is working. McCain has new life, with national polls showing him dead even with Obama. Democrats are nervous enough to urge Obama to fight back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since the changes, things are happening,&quot; observes Karl Rove, architect of George W. Bush's presidential races. &quot;A guy who'd been in and out of the campaign for months told me he quickly saw a new crispness and order to the operation. He knew it when he walked in  one day and there was a large calendar with daily message points plotted for several weeks -- a sign of strategic thinking that hadn't been so evident before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time, there is a consistent narrative. . . . Steve brought extreme message discipline to an organization that never had it before,&quot; says Todd Harris, a political consultant who worked on McCain's 2000 presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schmidt is a leader in a new class of professional campaign managers, who run the equivalent of hundred-million-dollar corporations overseeing thousands of employees and volunteers. They are in it for the win, not for a White House job, and engage in take-no-prisoners warfare. He is called &quot;the bullet&quot; -- for his swift and accurate aim at the target, as well as for the shape of his shaved head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schmidt  often projects a combative partisan demeanor, but his allies insist he is no ideologue. He has referred to himself as a &quot;raging moderate.&quot; In fact, sources say, it bothers him to be called a protege of Rove's, whose name became synonymous with the contentious partisan politics of the Bush era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schmidt's sister, his only sibling, is gay, and he has made it clear that he is appalled by the party's hostile attitudes toward  gay rights. He urged Schwarzenegger last year to sign the California gay marriage bill, which the governor vetoed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and colleagues say he never pulls his punches with candidates. He told Schwarzenegger during his reelection bid to lose the leather coat, stop driving his gas-guzzling Hummer around the state, spend more time in Sacramento and start acting like the governor. He bluntly told McCain in June he was going to lose the election unless he brought some discipline to his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like his counterparts in the Obama campaign, Schmidt finds himself running a presidential campaign unlike any other in history. He is up against a 24-hour news cycle, relentless bloggers and a mainstream media obliged to feed Web sites constantly,  and he has adapted to this new reality. He curtailed McCain's media availability because he found journalists were more interested in filing hour-to-hour for the Web, rather than reporting more in-depth looks at the day on the trail. &quot;There has been a transformational change in the way Americans get their news,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, Schmidt says he won't allow the campaign to get thrown off by momentary distractions and pundits shooting from the hip. To that end, he and his colleagues have developed what they jokingly call the &quot;Dave Gergen theory of the campaign&quot; -- a metaphor for all talking heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gergen, a veteran of four  presidential administrations, is a frequent pundit on cable news. If senior members of the campaign disagree on a strategic move, they watch what Gergen has to say. They then do the opposite.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Commander of the War Room </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schmidt grew up in middle-class North Plainfield, N.J., was an Eagle Scout, a tight end on the high school football team, and says he loved politics as far back as he can remember. The first presidential race he clearly recalls -- he was 10 -- was the Ronald Reagan-Jimmy Carter matchup. &quot;You intuitively understood that there was something special about him,&quot; he says of Reagan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attended the University of Delaware but came three credits short of graduating because he couldn't pass a required math course. &quot;I'd still be there,&quot; he says, noting that he has been diagnosed with a learning disability that makes higher math difficult for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schmidt had a swift rise in politics, careening around the country to manage Republican congressional races in his 20s and coming up through the GOP staff ranks on Capitol Hill. He was catapulted to the top tier of operatives in 2004, when he landed the job of directing the Bush campaign's war room, monitoring the media and the opponent all day, every day. Then as now, he strove to define the opposition for the voters, and never let a news cycle to go by without a comment from his side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, for someone who refuses ever to go off-message, Schmidt has forged good relationships with political reporters, and tries to address their needs while sticking with his plan. Reporters on John Kerry's plane in 2004 came to know him well, as he called them several times a day -- sometimes to offer a comment on the text of a speech he managed to obtain but that Kerry had not yet delivered. He is credited with pushing the campaign to relentlessly stick with branding Kerry as a flip-flopper on issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who work with him say he is a master of the details. Brian Jones, who grew up with Schmidt and has worked with him on campaigns, said that to prepare for debates, he would demand dry runs among the staff in the war room -- to anticipate what the opponent might say, and respond quickly. Staffers were assigned different floors at headquarters to simulate the varied venues  they would work from on the night of a debate, and he would use a stopwatch to time how fast they could send an e-mail blitz to the media. His was a tight ship, and he was known to hang up on everyone during a conference call, to send a message if one staff member forgot to get on the call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In truth, he mentored an army of young GOP professionals who adore him. Most are fanned out among  local races around the country, in the White House or working for various public officials. &quot;The heart of all campaigns is kids in their 20s, many of whom are in the early stages of work experience, and these are concepts not taught in college, but you have to learn in the real world,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was like a big brother to me,&quot; says Matt David, a spokesman for Schwarzenegger who worked for Schmidt in 2004. &quot;He made me earn my stripes, and I've followed him ever since.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2006, Schmidt went right from the Supreme Court nominations of John Roberts and Samuel Alito -- which he managed from Dick Cheney's office -- to the reelection campaign for Schwarzenegger, who was in trouble. He had lost several important ballot initiatives, his popularity had plummeted, and he had little money to launch an aggressive campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schmidt's first course of action was to remove Schwarzenegger from all the props and sideshows that had caused the actor-turned-governor to be dubbed the &quot;Governator,&quot; and to present him as a serious chief executive who was committed to the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Carrick, the media strategist for Democratic challenger Phil Angelides, said Schmidt and company were effective in turning Angelides into a hapless politician with a series of ads that manipulated footage to show him walking backward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is widely applauded for getting Arnold out of a mess,&quot; Carrick says. &quot;In the end, he was able to restore Arnold's original appeal. The face of Arnold became less about ideology and back to the idea of bipartisanship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schmidt is aware that in running campaigns, he can be intimidating. On the Schwarzenegger campaign, he stopped attending the scheduling meetings because people were afraid to talk when he was in the room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and his wife liked the West Coast so much that they decided to stay put and raise their two young children in California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which brings us to the fire. Last December, unbeknownst to guests at a neighborhood Christmas party, the host's attic was in flames. Smoke slowly started seeping into the house, but not fast enough to slow down the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People were still trying to get drinks at the bar -- it was unbelievable,&quot; recalls Kelly Resendez, the home owner. &quot;Steve and another guy were responsible for getting everyone out of that house. . . . I was in shock, and here's Steve taking down pictures from the walls -- he saved all our family photos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schmidt was the last person out of the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not 10 minutes later the roof popped,&quot; says Resendez, &quot;and the house went up in flames.&quot;<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">'My Happiest Moment' </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schmidt never saw himself being this involved in the 2008 race, and in fact, he thought he'd be back in California by now, back at his job as a partner in Mercury Public Affairs, a political and communication consulting firm. When McCain's operation imploded a year ago, he and Schmidt talked regularly by phone. But things looked grim. For most of the past year, Schmidt was an unpaid volunteer, only recently drawing a salary from the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he stayed around because of his affection for McCain, because he could not leave something midstream and because he believes McCain can win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he is unequivocal about his future in running campaigns: This is his last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Internet has created a wave of venom that is very disturbing,&quot; he says of the e-mails and calls he receives. &quot;People who run these campaigns have become targets very directly. Who needs it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My happiest moment is when the plane lands in San Francisco and you have lowered enough to see the rolling green hills of Northern California,&quot; he says, &quot;and there is a level of happiness and joy that overcomes me. That is mirrored by the exact opposite emotion when I can see the approach to Dulles.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain, who watched from a prison camp as America failed to deploy the overwhelming force necessary to win the Vietnam War, seized the moment after Republicans lost Congress in 2006 to push President Bush not to make the same mistake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain sent a private letter to Mr. Bush on Dec. 12, 2006, that challenged the president to show the &quot;will&quot; to win the Iraq war by deploying 20,000 troops into Baghdad and the Sunni Triangle to beat back a growing insurgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter was the climax of a 3 1/2-year effort to persuade the president to send more troops to Iraq. The former Navy pilot, who had his arms repeatedly broken during nearly six years of captivity, couched his argument in the terms born of the Vietnam War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question is one of will more than capacity,&quot; wrote the senior Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. &quot;If we are not willing to provide the troops necessary for victory, however, victory itself will be impossible.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, whose letter is made public here for the first time, added that &quot;surging five additional brigades into Baghdad by March&quot; was the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush, who had resisted Mr. McCain's call for a troop surge for years, now praises him for persisting in his argument that expanding the war in Iraq was the way to win it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John recognized early on that more troops would be needed in order to achieve the security necessary for the Iraqis to make the political progress we're seeing now,&quot; the president told The Washington Times this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He supported that action even though many said it would hurt his campaign [for president]. He didn't care about popularity; he cared about success for our troops and our country. And now that the surge has worked, it proves that John's judgment was correct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's push to increase troops in Iraq began five years ago this month, just after his first visit to Baghdad and three months after Mr. Bush had proclaimed the end of major combat before a banner reading &quot;Mission Accomplished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need a lot more military,&quot; the senator said during a stop in Pakistan on his way home. &quot;We need to tell the American people, and I think they'll support it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week later in Washington, he delivered the same message to any senior official who would listen: Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. In November, Mr. McCain warned about the &quot;lessons&quot; of his own war &quot;We lost in Vietnam because we lost the will to fight, because we did not understand the nature of the war we were fighting, and because we limited the tools at our disposal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For much of his 3 1/2-year advocacy for the surge - an attempt to persuade the president to adopt a strategy that his commanders said was unnecessary, that Democrats in Congress angrily opposed and that Mr. McCain's Republican colleagues bitterly resented - the former Navy pilot was an army of one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after Republicans lost control of Congress in November 2006, Mr. McCain gained leverage in his argument with a president who was soon to face an empowered majority of Democrats and a Republican panicked by the idea that the election was a mandate on Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon the architects of the failing strategy in Iraq - the generals and their civilian superiors - would be banished, and a dissenting general who had sought an increase in troops and a new counterinsurgency strategy would take charge of the war in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president, with no acknowledgement then of Mr. McCain's arguments, would adopt the senator's plan. Democrats who predicted the failure of what they mockingly called &quot;the McCain surge&quot; would fall silent when the 20,000-troop increase led to a dramatic reduction of violence, falling to a low of just 11 troops killed in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They don't call it that anymore,&quot; Sen. Lindsey Graham said, smiling in triumph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South Carolina Republican, an early convert to the McCain cause who observed much of the senator's backdoor efforts, is unabashed in his praise for his longtime friend, blinking back a tear as he recalls trips he took to Iraq with his colleague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without John McCain, there would never have been the surge,&quot; he said emphatically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain declined to be interviewed for this account, privately telling an aide, &quot;I won't take credit for the surge.&quot; Other top advisers said he won't talk about private conversations with the president and the military leaders serving under him. The man who refused to leave his Vietnam prison camp ahead of those captured before him is said to be determined not to take credit for success that belongs to soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's views contrast sharply with those of his Democratic rival in the November election. Sen. Barack Obama, a freshman senator from Illinois, joined his party's elders to oppose the surge, even after military leaders agreed that it was necessary, and now only grudgingly acknowledges the success of the surge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's plea for change in Iraq, and how he finally accomplished it, is detailed here through scores of documents and interviews conducted by The Times during a six-month investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Mission Accomplished'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just six weeks after the start of the war, Mr. Bush flew in a Lockheed S-3 Viking fighter-bomber to a smooth landing on the flight deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln as the aircraft carrier bobbed in the Pacific in May 2003. Its crew had just returned from combat operations in the Persian Gulf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush was greeted by the crew with wild enthusiasm, posing for photographs in his flight suit with pilots and ship crewmen beneath a huge banner boasting &quot;Mission Accomplished.&quot; The White House would later say the banner was meant in salute only to the crew of the Abraham Lincoln.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the battle of Iraq,&quot; the president said, &quot;the United States and our allies have prevailed.&quot; But he warned there was still &quot;difficult work to do in Iraq. We are bringing order to parts of that country that remain dangerous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the following weeks, hawks in the Senate who had pushed for war in Iraq began to feel vindicated. Their prime spokesman - a man literally born into the military and the progeny of two Navy heroes - Mr. McCain had declared a week after the war began March 19, 2003, &quot;there's no doubt in my mind that we will prevail and there's no doubt in my mind, once these people are gone, that we will be welcomed as liberators.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three weeks after the president's speech, Mr. McCain took to the chamber's floor to proclaim an American triumph of arms. &quot;We won a massive victory in a few weeks, and we did so with very limited loss of American and allied lives,&quot; he declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator felt the same way a month later, when Fox News' Neil Cavuto stated flatly that &quot;many argue the conflict isn't over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, then,&quot; replied the senator, &quot;why was there a banner that said 'Mission Accomplished' on the aircraft carrier? The major conflict is over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this view changed after he went to Iraq in August 2003 and met a blunt-spoken British commander in Basra, where a disintegrating situation was turning to chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British colonel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike most of his Senate colleagues, Mr. McCain did not take a vacation or junket during the lengthy summer recess in 2003. Instead, along with Mr. Graham, he went with a congressional delegation to Iraq. With his trademark curiosity and adherence to Ronald Reagan's famous caution to &quot;trust but verify,&quot; the senator wanted to see for himself the victory that America had won so quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once on the ground, the senators were taken into Basra, a Shi'ite city in southeastern Iraq controlled by British troops. &quot;I never will forget it,&quot; Mr. Graham recalled. &quot;He gets up and starts speaking, looks at Senator McCain and says, 'You know, I'm a British citizen, I don't pay taxes in America and I will never vote for you and I will probably never see you again, but here's what I think: We don't have it right - we don't have enough people, I don't have the right kind of people. If we do not get ahead of this, it is going to be a very big problem.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That British colonel opened our eyes beyond anything else. You can be briefed in Washington, they can show you charts, but when you get on the ground and actually talk to the people it's a completely different story,&quot; Mr. Graham said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two senators quickly concluded that conditions inside Iraq were clearly worse than American commanders were reporting to the White House. While Mr. McCain and the others were in Iraq, 17 people, including the top U.N. envoy who was a key figure in the political transformation of Iraq, were slain in an attack on an installation of the United Nations. The attack occurred as the senators were meeting with U.S. Ambassador L. Paul Bremer and Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, then the commander of U.S. troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, characteristically blunt, looked the ambassador and the general &quot;right in the eye,&quot; Mr. Graham recalled, &quot;and said, 'You're going to have to start shooting some of these looters.' It was his belief that the looting and the other signs of the growing insurgency had to be dealt with and he asked point-blank, 'Do you have enough troops?' Everybody said 'Yes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An about-face</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's opinion changed on that first trip. The campaign to oust Saddam Hussein and neutralize Iraq's military had been won, but the peace was at risk because of an insurgency that, fueled in part by Iran and Syria, had quickly materialized. The insurgents were gaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there's a danger that unless we do what's necessary quickly, that we could find ourselves in an extremely - and I emphasize extremely - difficult situation,&quot; he said Aug. 29 in an interview on National Public Radio. &quot;We need more troops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator said on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; that another division of troops - 20,000 soldiers - was needed to secure Iraq, and repeated the call for two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His rhetoric crystallized in November 2003 in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. With inside-the-Beltway punditocracy beginning to call Iraq a &quot;quagmire&quot; - the term that came to define the Vietnam War - the senator repeatedly insisted that &quot;Iraq is no Vietnam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he again called for more troops and a strengthened will to win the war. &quot;The simple truth is that we do not have sufficient forces in Iraq to meet our military objectives,&quot; he said. &quot;Simply put, there does not appear to be a strategy behind our current force levels in Iraq, other than to preserve the illusion that we have sufficient forces in place to meet our objectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As evidence, he cited Gen. Sanchez's acknowledgement from the ground in Iraq that his forces could not handle new battles. &quot;If a militia or an internal conflict of some nature were to erupt,&quot; the senator quoted the general, &quot;that would be a challenge out there that I do not have sufficient forces for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this speech, he said another division should be deployed to Baghdad and the Sunni Triangle, which stretches from Baghdad west to Ramadi and north to Tikrit. In what would become a frequent refrain, he lashed Mr. Rumsfeld, who just three days earlier had repeated his emphatic assertion that no more troops were needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope that Secretary Rumsfeld would recognize that - the realities on the ground. And the realities on the ground are that things are not getting better. ... However you do it, I think we need more people there&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day after that, the defense secretary called to invite Mr. McCain to breakfast. The meeting the next morning was chilly; Mr. Rumsfeld opened by saying: &quot;I read your speech.&quot; (Mr. McCain later joked that &quot;that must have been an enjoyable experience for him.&quot; )</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense secretary, who had made his own visit to Iraq in September, was perplexed by Mr. McCain's assessment of the conditions on the ground, said a senior McCain adviser who asked not to be named because the meeting was private. But the senator spelled out what he thought was needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He told Secretary Rumsfeld there was danger that the peace was being lost and asked that they ramp up both the troop strength and the civilian assistance programs,&quot; the senior adviser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator &quot;made a very passionate case that we need to look at adding more troops,&quot; said Mr. Graham, who talked with Mr. McCain soon after the meeting with the defense secretary concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In that first visit [to Iraq] in August, it was very subtle as to what was going on, and it wasn't obvious to everybody that the country was going into chaos, but John could see that the dynamics were all wrong,&quot; Mr. Graham said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which has oversight of military operations and considerable authority in shaping the Defense Department's budget, Mr. McCain offered blunt advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain believed the Pentagon was spending too much time on search and destroy missions that were ineffective, when in fact the troops needed to focus on the growing threats to civilians targeted by the insurgency, creating a chaos that could destabilize the entire country,&quot; the McCain adviser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretary was not persuaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rumsfeld responded by assuring Senator McCain that the commanders had told him they had all the assets they needed on the ground,&quot; the adviser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An aide to the secretary said Mr. McCain's account is incorrect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In November 2003, Secretary Rumsfeld and Senator McCain had one of a number of conversations that ended with the two in agreement on the need to win in Iraq,&quot; Keith Urbahn said. &quot;Senator McCain may prefer to characterize their meeting as a Showdown at the OK Corral, but that's not straight talk. It's a fairy tale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rumsfeld wrote a two-sentence summary shortly after his meeting, according to his office. &quot;I had breakfast with Senator McCain. He said, 'The answer may not be more troops in Iraq, but the answer is not the status quo.' I agree with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain nevertheless left the breakfast table convinced that the Pentagon was out of touch with reality, a conclusion that eventually would drive him to become one of Mr. Rumsfeld's harshest critics. He made several additional private attempts to persuade the Pentagon and the White House to make changes in both strategy and tactics, and when those efforts failed, he decided to use his influence as a senator and a war hero to push the Pentagon to send more troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bully-pulpit years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next three years would set David against Goliath, the 5-foot-7-inch, 165-pound senator from Arizona against the heavyweights in the White House and the Pentagon, the very men and women who had shaped the strategy that was failing. He got little help from his Senate colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans embraced the idea, 'Well, this violence is basically manufactured by the media; it's not as bad as it looks,'[TFI]&quot; Mr. Graham recalled. &quot;Democrats were so over the top - 'This is hopeless and we can't win' - so John's voice, which was consistent, was drowned in the raucous clamor of partisan politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November 2003, Mr. McCain took his frustrations public. Unless the United States immediately dispatched at least 15,000 additional troops to Iraq, he said, the United States risked &quot;the most serious American defeat on the global stage since Vietnam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He continued even in the midst of the 2004 presidential election campaign. Risking alienating the president, whom he joined on the campaign trail, Mr. McCain rebuked Mr. Rumsfeld for refusing to challenge his military commanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not up to the commanders on the ground. It's up to the leadership of the country to make these decisions,&quot; Mr. McCain said. &quot;That's why we elect them and have civilian supremacy. We're now facing a terrible insurgency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite his increasingly sharp criticism of the conduct of the war, he met frequently with Mr. Bush, sometimes in the Oval Office and occasionally aboard Air Force One, en route to campaign stops together. Their relationship had grown cordial, the bitter battle of the 2000 Republican primary battle forgotten and forgiven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, just two weeks before the November presidential election, Mr. McCain publicly disputed Mr. Bush's assertion that sufficient troops were on the ground in Iraq. &quot;I think that we need more troops in Iraq,&quot; he said. &quot;I've thought that for a long time, election or no election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of the year, Mr. McCain was contemptuous of Mr. Rumsfeld, declaring that he had &quot;no confidence&quot; in the Pentagon chief. &quot;I have strenuously argued for larger troop numbers in Iraq, including the right kind of troops - linguists, special forces, civil affairs and so forth,&quot; he said. He kept up the pressure as the war stretched into the new year. &quot;We've got stay and expand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Path to election defeat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditions in Iraq continued to spiral downward. Casualties increased. The players on the yellow sofa in the Oval Office - Vice President Dick Cheney, Miss Rice, Mr. Rumsfeld, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff - dug in their heels. No one was ready to depart from the strategy they designed, and each thought that a few tweaks of tactics would lead to triumph. Democrats, meanwhile, continued to relentlessly attack Republicans for &quot;staying the course of failure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By November 2005, Mr. McCain's frustration became bitter resignation. &quot;It will take time, probably years, and mean more American casualties to win in Iraq,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House would soon raise expectations of withdrawing troops; Mr. Bush, with midterm congressional elections coming in November, himself asserted in early 2006 that the United States could soon begin to bring some troops home, provided Iraqis began to take responsibility for saving themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The declarations further exasperated Mr. McCain, who was reduced to repeating himself. &quot;You know, I've always said that we needed more troops over there. I have said that for years,&quot; he said in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the partisan aisle, a new power center was emerging in the Democratic Party. Mr. Obama, a fit young freshman senator with a golden tongue, was putting together an upstart presidential campaign built on grass-roots dissatisfaction with the Iraq war. With Mr. McCain moving to the front of the Republican field for 2008, the man from Illinois sought to draw differences between them, emphasizing his oft-stated opposition to the war, and in particular his belief that sending more troops to Iraq would accelerate the rush to failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the deteriorating situation, it is clear at this point that we cannot, through putting in more troops or maintaining the presence that we have, expect that somehow the situation is going to improve, and we have to do something significant to break the pattern that we've been in right now,&quot; Mr. Obama told audiences as the midterms approached.The president continued to defer to his commanders on the ground, including Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the man in charge in Iraq. &quot;General Casey will make the decision as to how many troops we have there,&quot; the president said. &quot;I've told him this. I said, 'You decide, general.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the eve of the 2006 elections that would rout Republicans everywhere, Mr. Bush pledged to stand by the deeply unpopular Mr. Rumsfeld. He could stay as defense secretary for the length of his term as president, Mr. Bush declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the voters spoke, handing Mr. Bush the most damaging loss of his presidency and opening his eyes to change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'A new idea'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican losses would lead inexorably to the surge. Mr. Rumsfeld resigned, and key men in uniform, like Gen. Casey, who for years had assured the administration he had enough troops at hand, were pushed aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The irony of ironies, in my opinion, is that if the Republicans had not lost in 2006, the House and the Senate,&quot; Mr. Graham said. &quot;I doubt Secretary Rumsfeld would have ever been replaced, and when he left it gave an opening to a new idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the long run-up to the 2008 presidential campaign approached, Mr. McCain redoubled his support for the surge. This time, he would have the president's undivided attention after the midterm defeat that Mr. Bush himself called &quot;a thumpin'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain planned his fourth trip to Iraq in December 2006, and spent the early part of the month persuading Mr. Bush to accept the necessity of sending more troops. He met the president at the White House on Dec. 6, the day that the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, a distinguished panel of politicians and diplomats led by James A. Baker III, secretary of state during the administration of Mr. Bush's father, and Lee H. Hamilton, the widely respected former Democratic congressman from Indiana, delivered a report urging Mr. Bush to begin withdrawing U.S. combat forces from Iraq by the beginning of 2008. The alternative was &quot;a slide into chaos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans were stunned. Many panicked. Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia, who had been an early and strong supporter of the war effort, joined Democratic critics to explore the idea of mandating a withdrawal from Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They thought Iraq was the death blow to the Republican Party,&quot; Mr. Graham recalled. &quot;So you had a group of different Republicans coming up with different plans that had the same result. We would begin to end combat operations and pull out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain saw retreat as defeat. He turned to two of his closest friends, Mr. Graham and Sen. Joe Lieberman, to devise a strategy to push aside Pentagon critics of the surge, to convince the president that the surge was the right strategy and finally to thwart efforts to force a congressional vote on a troop withdrawal, which Democrats might win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think John's finest moment, and in many ways mine and Senator Lieberman's, was to stop the stampede of Republicans who wanted to find ways out of Iraq,&quot; Mr. Graham said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, leading in the early Republican presidential polls for the 2008 nomination, used his celebrity in front of the camera to make a case for the new strategy and to buck up demoralized Republicans. Blocking a Senate vote on withdrawal was crucial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conservative American Enterprise Institute sent a draft report to Mr. McCain from its own panel, dubbed the Iraq Planning Group. Unlike the Baker-Hamilton group, the AEI plan mirrored Mr. McCain's, calling for more troops in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Graham assumed dual roles. He acted first as a floor whip in the Senate, collecting and coddling the 41 votes needed to prevent a vote to withdraw troops on a specific timetable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further behind the scenes, he worked with Gen. David H. Petraeus, who was poised to take over management of the Iraq war in 2007. The two discussed a specific counterinsurgency plan that would focus on restoring security in the streets of Iraq's most dangerous cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. Petraeus was a counterinsurgency expert and a strong advocate of increasing troop levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were a lot of late-night phone calls where General Petraeus and I talked,&quot; Mr. Graham recalled. &quot;And then I'd be relaying everything to John, who was on the campaign trail.&quot; Armed with the AEI panel's conclusions and Gen. Petraeus' thinking on how to implement a surge, Mr. McCain set out to change the president's mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Letter to the president</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made his case in a blunt three-page letter to Mr. Bush. &quot;While there's no doubt that a number of changes in policy are necessary, I believe that none will be successful without an increase in the number of U.S. forces there,&quot; Mr. McCain wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He detailed a plan distilled from Gen. Petraeus' thinking for a surge of 20,000 fresh troops. &quot;Only the presence of additional coalition forces will give the Iraqi government the opportunity to restore its authority and install the government,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Surging five additional brigades into Baghdad by March, tasking them with traditional counterinsurgency activity, including protection of the population and intensive reconstruction, would give the coalition, in concert with Iraqi security forces, a real chance to succeed in its mission. The surge shouldn't be limited by an artificial timeline.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document was notable not only for its detailed analysis, but for its pep talk to Mr. Bush, which including a whiff of a lecture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hero of an unpopular war ultimately lost in Vietnam, Mr. McCain argued that the primary obstacle to winning in Iraq was the government's inability to make a tough decision, commit more troops and stick with the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question is one of will more than capacity,&quot; he wrote Mr. Bush. &quot;I believe success in Iraq is still possible, and that, by finally bringing security to Baghdad, and by reducing the violence plaguing other areas, we can give Iraqis the best possible opportunity to construct a stable and self-governing state. Our national security compels us to try, and to try immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back to Iraq, then decision</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain set off at once for Baghdad again, to hear firsthand from commanders on the ground. On this, his fourth trip to Iraq, conditions had again clearly grown worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he returned to Washington, he met with Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to spell out &quot;where he thought things needed to go,&quot; the top McCain adviser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several days later, on Dec. 18, Robert M. Gates - who had been president of Texas A&amp;M University and a member of the Iraq Study Group that recommended withdrawal from Iraq - succeeded Mr. Rumsfeld as defense secretary. The next day, Mr. Gates, too, slipped off to Iraq to see the war for himself. &quot;I do expect to give a report to the president on what I've learned and my perceptions,&quot; he said on his last day in Baghdad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretary delivered his findings at the president's Prairie Chapel Ranch shortly after Christmas, joining the generals and senior Bush aides. But the president gave a hint of a change in his thinking while Mr. Gates was still in Baghdad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a year-end press conference, the president dispensed with his usual pledge to heed ground commanders in Iraq, saying he would listen but not necessarily defer to the generals. The same day, Gen. John Abizaid, a Rumsfeld favorite and one of the holdouts against changing strategy in Iraq, retired as commander of U.S. Central Command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. Casey, another of the old guard and the commander in Iraq, would exile himself from the core group just before New Year's Day. Expressing doubt about the wisdom of a surge, he told the New York Times on Dec. 28 that &quot;It's always been my view that a heavy and sustained American military presence was not going to solve the problems in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush administration, from the president down, was now poised to move to the new strategy. When the president returned from Texas to Washington in early 2007, a letter from Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Graham awaited him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now is the time for bold and decisive leadership to chart a new course forward in Iraq,&quot; the senators wrote in their Jan. 8, letter, echoing the calls of Mr. McCain. &quot;Some of the necessary changes, including new leadership in both the civilian and military leadership, have already been made. We also strongly encourage you to send additional American troops to Iraq to improve the security situation on the ground. For far too long we have not had enough troops in Iraq to provide security. It is time to correct this mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days later, on Jan. 10, the commander in chief addressed the nation in prime time to announce he would do just that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is clear that we need to change our strategy in Iraq,&quot; a grim Mr. Bush said. &quot;Our past efforts to secure Baghdad failed for two principal reasons: There were not enough Iraqi and American troops to secure neighborhoods that had been cleared of terrorists and insurgents. And there were too many restrictions on the troops we did have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though Mr. McCain and his colleagues had prevailed, the trio of senators who had pushed for the surge restrained the natural urge to celebrate. &quot;It was also the day you realized you just helped to expand this war,&quot; Mr. Graham said. &quot;That wasn't lost on John, me or Joe Lieberman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 41st vote</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next nine months would be dark and solemn days for Mr. McCain. With his reputation on the line, his bid for the presidency was tied tightly to the success of the strategy he had persuaded Mr. Bush to embrace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the winter and spring of 2007, the senator, along with the help of a few colleagues and Mr. Lieberman, would struggle to keep Democrats in Congress from cutting troops or funds for Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Partisan bickering broke out almost immediately. The last of the surge troops Mr. Bush ordered would not arrive in Iraq until June, but less than a week after the president's announcement on Jan. 10, the top Senate Democrats, joined by a leading dissident Republican, introduced a resolution opposing the surge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution fell just a few votes short of getting to the floor for debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the following months, the Republicans, along with one or two straying Democrats and always Mr. Lieberman, withstood more than a dozen attempts to reduce funding for the war in Iraq or to set a timetable for troop withdrawal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A steady drumbeat of Democratic voices called the surge a failure even before all the fresh troops were in place. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid exploited a succession of car bombings in Iraq that killed more than 200 Iraqis in April 2007 to declare the surge a failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe ... that this war</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is lost, and this surge is not accomplishing anything,&quot; he said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, campaigning in Mr. Reid's home state of Nevada, hotly disputed the Senate leader. &quot;It seems to me Senator Reid has lost all sense of priority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on vote after vote the McCain alliance held, preventing a congressional mandate for withdrawal. Mr. Lieberman was the key to the achievement. The senator from Connecticut, an early and consistent supporter of the war, became an outcast in his own party, taking relentless criticism from the powerful antiwar flank, much of it coming from MoveOn.org.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2006 Democratic primaries, Mr. Lieberman even lost his party's nomination. Undeterred, he changed his party affiliation to independent and won decisively in the general election, sealing the victory that separated him from the Democratic powers. In 2007, thoughcontinuing as a member of the Democratic caucus in the Senate, he became Mr. McCain's 41st vote, a reliable ally of the 40 other senators whom Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham had assembled to prevent votes on withdrawal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We couldn't have done it without Joe,&quot; Mr. Graham said. &quot;He replaced a [lost] Republican vote. He gave us the vote that we needed on many occasions to avoid pulling the plug on Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dark days</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as Mr. McCain was winning the battle to preserve prospects for victory in Iraq, the wheels of his &quot;Straight Talk Express&quot; campaign bus came hurtling off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign had become badly bloated and was bleeding money. His standing was plummeting in the polls as violence spiked in Iraq and public faith in the wisdom of the surge declined. The senator slashed his staff and reporters abandoned the candidate, the story moving on to the lively presidential campaigns of former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His organization nearly broke, Mr. McCain began traveling on scheduled commercial flights, often squeezing into a seat in economy, instead of the comfortable chartered private jets that are the mark of successful campaigns. Sometimes aides drove him through the night to campaign events. &quot;He went through the airport carrying his own bags,&quot; Mr. Graham recalled. &quot;We were fifth in a four-person race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain nevertheless kept a stiff upper lip, joking in New Hampshire that &quot;in the words of Chairman Mao, it's always darkest before it's totally black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Americans about to embark on a long weekend of backyard barbecues, cold beer and fireworks to celebrate the Fourth of July of 2007, several candidates declared a timeout. Not Mr. McCain. He set off for Iraq, again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A renewed faith</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accepted an invitation from Gen. Petraeus to spend America's birthday with the troops and to attend a re-enlistment ceremony. Nearly 600 men and women packed themselves into the Al Faw Palace, once used as a duck-hunting retreat by Saddam Hussein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ceremony at the palace, rechristened by the Americans as Camp Victory, included the naturalization of 166 soldiers as American citizens. Gen. Petraeus administered the oath of enlistment. When the senator stepped up to speak, he could see troops hanging off balconies and crowding staircases to get a glimpse of a man they credited for sending them reinforcements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two pairs of empty boots stood upright in a chair near the senator, a melancholy reminder of two soldiers killed before they could take their scheduled oaths as Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know it's not possible for even the most grateful nation to compensate you in kind for the measure of devotion that you have with great personal sacrifice given our country,&quot; Mr. McCain told the dogface soldiers. &quot;We have incurred a debt to you that we can never repay in full. We can offer you only the small tribute of our humility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the war in which you have fought has divided the American people. But it has divided no Americans in their admiration for you. We all honor you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have lived a long, eventful and blessed life,&quot; he said. &quot;I have had the good fortune of knowing personally a great many brave and selfless patriots who sacrificed and shed blood to defend their country. But I've known none braver nor better than you. You are my inspiration, and your country's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain arrived in Baghdad weary and discouraged. He left Iraq energized and eager to continue his own struggle, which he knew paled in comparison with those of the men and women he had just met - and he met every one, staying for hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was just John and myself in the plane, with a few staff folks,&quot; Mr. Graham recalled of the flight home. &quot;I never will forget, as we took off he looked over at me and said, 'If these kids can do this, we can get our campaign back going.' It rededicated him to winning the primary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A campaign shift</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain arrived home and hit the ground running. He trimmed fat out of his campaign bureaucracy and would run it on a shoestring budget of $1 million a month. &quot;This campaign is going to be won on the ground, vote by vote,&quot; he wrote to his supporters in a fundraising e-mail appeal, &quot;and I'm convinced that if every voter learns of my unparalleled experience, we will win.&quot; He made his resolve to win in Iraq the centerpiece of his campaign, embarking on what staffers dubbed &quot;The No Surrender Tour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tour started in Veterans of Foreign Wars huts and American Legion posts, aimed first at the millions of veterans across the nation. He took several men who had shared prison cells with him, along with veterans of the fighting in Iraq. They distributed stickers vowing &quot;No Surrender.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His bus zigzagged across Iowa, over to New Hampshire and down to South Carolina, and at nearly every stop he displayed the full-page advertisement in the New York Times, posted by MoveOn.org mocking Gen. Petraeus as &quot;General Betray Us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's disgraceful,&quot; Mr. McCain told voters in Iowa, displaying his anger, and challenged his Democratic opponents to denounce the message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The badgering questions from reporters, asking whether and when he would drop out of the race, began to recede as he stayed stubbornly on message: The surge will work, given time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That message would soon be delivered loud and clear by the very general in charge of making the surge work. Mr. McCain's future in politics was clearly at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The buildup was dramatic: Gen. Petraeus and Ryan C. Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, testified before the House and the Senate beginning Sept. 11, 2007, six years to the day after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House had deflected the verdict on the success of the surge until the general and ambassador could testify, and now, against a media backdrop of speculation that the administration would be forced to re-evaluate the war, Democratic critics in Congress waited to pounce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Gen. Petraeus, in full dress khaki with dozens of television lights playing on the four stars on his shoulders and a lavish array of medals and service ribbons on his chest, sat unbowed and unmoved through six hours of grueling questions. &quot;As a bottom line upfront,&quot; he said, &quot;the military objectives of the surge are, in large measure, being met. In recent months, in the face of tough enemies in the brutal summer heat of Iraq, coalition and Iraqi security forces have achieved progress in the security arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The level of security incidents has decreased significantly since the start of the surge of offensive operations in mid-June.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general took the bat out of Democrats' hands. &quot;Based on all this, and on the further progress we believe we can achieve over the next few months, I believe that we will be able to reduce our forces to the pre-surge level of brigade combat teams by next summer without jeopardizing the security gains that we have fought so hard to achieve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he appeared the next day to answer more questions from senators, Mr. Obama was ready. &quot;I think the surge has had some impact, as I suggested, &quot; he said, his &quot;just one question&quot; prefaced by a seven-minute speech. But he added: &quot;I would argue that the impact has been relatively modest given the investment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain was briefer. &quot;Gen. Petraeus, it's astonishing the number of things that people come up with, but one of the latest statements is that the surge had nothing to do with Anbar province and the rather stunning success we've had there. How do you respond to that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well,&quot; the general replied, &quot;the success in Anbar province is a political success but it is a political success that has been enabled very much by our forces, who have been enabled by having additional forces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain cut in with the question to emphasize a point: &quot;Would it have happened without the surge?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. Petraeus replied: &quot;It would not have happened as quickly without the surge and I don't know whether we could have capitalized on it the way that we have without the surge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Graham sums up the effect of the exchange succinctly: &quot;Petraeus comes back, Crocker comes back in September, and they knock it out of the park. We're in the ballgame now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Mac is back'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain aides - and especially the candidate himself - thought they now knew how to proceed with the presidential campaign: The senator had survived by being himself, being true to long-held beliefs, and they decided he should continue with that strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain surrounded himself with a tight group of longtime friends and aides and set his sights on New Hampshire. &quot;After we had the meltdown and went from a national campaign of 30 states down to two or three, that put a lot more emphasis on New Hampshire,&quot; said Steve Duprey, a former Republican chairman in New Hampshire who now is a top aide for Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator later joked that he had spent so much time in the small state that some residents thought he lived there. Continuing as if he were continuing the quest of eight years earlier, he held more than 100 town-hall meetings, telling his unfunny jokes at every stop and shaking every hand offered along the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the surge and the new counterinsurgency strategy began to reduce violence in Iraq, the moribund campaign quickened, and soon was back on the front pages and on the nightly television newscasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain began to enjoy a little winner's luck. The front-running Mr. Giuliani skipped the Iowa caucuses and Mr. Romney was overtaken by an unlikely upstart, Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor. Mr. McCain followed Iowa with a solid win in New Hampshire, delivering a rousing victory speech to supporters waving &quot;Mac is Back&quot; placards. Like American prospects in Iraq, his campaign was reborn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the following weeks, Mr. Romney won his native state of Michigan, and a second McCain victory in South Carolina blunted the Giuliani strategy of focusing on Florida. By the time the campaign got to there in late January, the McCain momentum was permanent, and he was en route to clinching the nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, Mr. McCain has painted his unwavering support for the surge as evidence of his ability to be commander in chief. He cites Mr. Obama's yearlong denial of American success in Iraq as evidence that Mr. Obama lacks the steadiness, foresight and judgment to make an effective commander in chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This summer, the Republican and his allies sharpened their attacks on Mr. Obama, questioning why he took just a single trip to Iraq before opposing the surge. &quot;If the only time you had been to Iraq was in January 2006 and you're thinking about running for president as a Democrat, you heard what you wanted to hear,&quot; Mr. Graham said, echoing a now-common attack on Mr. Obama. &quot;He saw what he wanted to see, he came back, and declared the war lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An exchange between Mr. Obama and Katie Couric of CBS News, conducted in Amman, Jordan, in the midst of his extensive overseas trip to the Middle East and Europe in July, illustrates the presumptive Democratic nominee's difficulty in addressing the surge now that it has worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You raised a lot of eyebrows on this trip, saying, even knowing what you know now, you still would not have supported the surge,&quot; Mrs. Couric told him. &quot;People may be scratching their heads and saying, 'Why?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mr. Obama deflected the question, she broke in: &quot;But didn't the surge - &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me finish, Katie,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She did, but later broke in again, trying to pin down a direct answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Katie, as ... you've asked me three different times,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and I have said repeatedly that there is no doubt that our troops helped to reduce violence There's no doubt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Couric persisted. &quot;But yet you're saying, given what you know now, you still wouldn't support it, so I'm just trying to understand this. ... I really don't mean to belabor this, senator, because I'm really, I'm trying to figure out your position Do you think the level of security in Iraq ... would exist today without the surge?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His impatience showing, Mr Obama replied: &quot;Katie, I have no idea what would have happened had we applied my approach, which was to put more pressure on the Iraqis to arrive at a political reconciliation. So this is all hypotheticals. What I can say is that there's no doubt that our U.S. troops have contributed to a reduction of violence in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes later, Mr. McCain sat for an interview with the CBS anchor, blasting his presidential opponent and setting out what is at stake in the November election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Obama has indicated by his failure to acknowledge the success of the surge that he would rather lose a war than lose a campaign,&quot; he said. &quot;Senator Obama does not understand the challenges we face and he did not understand the need for the surge, and the fact that he did not understand that and still denies that it has succeeded, I think the American people will make a judgement.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Smart Republicans like Jim DeMint of South Carolina and Jeb Hensarling of Texas are starting to recognize their party holds the ultimate trump card in the current energy debate,&quot; Wall Street Journal editorialist Stephen Moore writes at www.opinionjournal.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 41 days, the long-imposed moratorium on offshore oil drilling and domestic oil shale production is set to expire - gone. This happens automatically and can be stopped only if Congress votes to re-establish the ban. Lifting the moratorium might free up as much as 100 years' worth of oil and gas for domestic consumption,&quot; Mr. Moore said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But keeping domestic energy supplies off limits is something Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and their environmentalist allies desperately want to do. Ms. Pelosi has said that stopping new oil production is about 'saving the planet.' Nevertheless, Mr. DeMint tells me it would be a 'tough vote for congressional Democrats to make just weeks before an election.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No kidding, with gas prices at near $4 a gallon and polls showing voters supporting an America-first drilling strategy by a two-to-one margin,&quot; Mr. Moore said, noting that Mr. DeMint says he already has 38 senators poised to filibuster any attempt to extend the drilling moratorium, and Democrats &quot;would need 60 votes to get a budget passed with the drilling moratorium rider attached.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can Republicans keep it together? A House Democratic leadership aide says Democrats will accuse Republicans of shutting down the government and preventing seniors from collecting Social Security checks. But Democrats run Congress now, so 'it will be difficult for Pelosi and her gang to blame the minority Republicans for a congressional train wreck,' answers Mr. DeMint.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back to back</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time in memory, the two parties are holding their conventions right after one another,&quot; Dick Morris writes in the Hill newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Within 72 hours of Obama's acceptance speech on the night of Aug. 28, in front of 75,000 adoring fans outdoors in Invesco Field at Mile High, the Republican Convention's opening gavel will come crashing down. How will it work? What will be the impact of these nearly simultaneous events? Nobody really knows, but the answer is critical. Usually, the post-convention polling sets a pattern that lasts at least until the candidates debate,&quot; Mr. Morris said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Will Obama's magic and aura last for the ensuing week, casting a fog over the Republican Convention, obscuring its proceedings and dulling its impact? Or will the winds of criticism against Obama, for four nights in a row in [St. Paul, Minn.], dissipate the vapors and nullify his bounce?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the moment, the scheduling of the conventions appears to make a prolonged deadlock between the two campaigns the most likely result.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exceptional race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Primary elections among challengers for a House seat held by the other party aren't normally of great political interest. But the race for the Republican nomination in a New Hampshire district is an exception,&quot; Fred Barnes writes at www.weeklystandard.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reason: Jennifer Horn, a conservative talk radio host, is running. She's the first member of the talk radio tribe, so far as I know, to give up her radio perch to run for Congress,&quot; Mr. Barnes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Horn, the mother of five, has proven to be an impressive campaigner in her first bid for public office and no slouch at the rough-and-tumble of electoral politics. When one of her four Republican opponents, Grant Bosse, accused her of misusing campaign funds, she fired back with a press release headlined, 'Grant 'Make Up the Facts' Bosse Strikes Again.' She denied the charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Horn's breakthrough in the race came last week when she won the endorsement of the state's most influential newspaper, the Manchester Union-Leader, after being grilled by publisher Joe McQuaid and editorial page editor Drew Cline. 'She is smart, likable, energetic and solid on the issues,' the paper wrote. 'She stands the best chance of beating [Democrat] Paul Hodes this November, and if elected, she would vote the way a New Hampshire representative ought to - for smaller, more responsible government, a strong national defense and low taxes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hodes defeated Charles Bass, a 12-year Republican incumbent, in the Democratic landslide in 2006 in New Hampshire, once considered a reliably Republican state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giddy media</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The headline conveyed urgency: 'Obama Ready to Announce Running Mate' said a breathless New York Times. In language worthy of a Madison Avenue pitchman, the paper reported Obama had 'all but settled' on his choice and would launch 'an elaborate rollout plan' of events,&quot; New York Daily News columnist Michael Goodwin writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Holy hype, Batman. Another day, another inflated report on the routine doings of The One.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's mocking nickname for Obama came in an ad comparing Obama's grandiose promises to Moses parting the Red Sea. It was funny, but I'm starting to think it wasn't a joke. The Obama campaign and its media handmaidens are taking their candidate way too seriously.&quot; Mr. Goodwin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So much so that they could be setting up a backlash against the hype. No human being can meet the wildly inflated expectations that accompany the rookie senator's every move. It can't help that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Obama 'a leader that God has blessed us with at this time.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the kind of remark that can turn voters into problems. Most Americans famously resent being told an election is over months before the polls open or that God is taking sides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forget Clinton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As Sen. Barack Obama gets set to announce his running mate, there is growing evidence that his backers and the public in general do not favor an Obama-Clinton ticket,&quot; Paul Bedard writes in the Washington Whispers column of U.S. News &amp; World Report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In our exclusive Washington Whispers poll, Obama's success in ending the Clinton era was cited by nearly 1 in 3 as his best aspect, right behind his liberal-progressive positions,&quot; Mr. Bedard said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Synovate eNation Internet poll of 1,000 nationally representative households asked: What aspect of Sen. Barack Obama do you like most? &quot;Liberal-progressive positions&quot; came in at 34 percent, followed by &quot;Ended the Clinton era&quot; at 30 percent, &quot;Youthfulness&quot; at 25 percent, and &quot;Mixed-race background&quot; at 11 percent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite all the political obstacles Republicans may face in this troubled election year, Barack Obama has some big problems of his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when the GOP is swimming upstream against a slowing U.S. economy, an unpopular war and a damaged party brand, the freshman senator is showing signs of weakness in the polls amid growing questions about his inexperience and his inability to boldly respond with authority in a national security crisis. Heading into the final week before his nominating convention, major polls showed him slipping in the national numbers as well as battleground states where he had led but is now in a dead heat against John McCain or slightly behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest Pew Research Center poll reports that &quot;Obama's lead over John McCain has disapppeared.&quot; Mr. Obama had a 3-point edge (46 percent to 43 percent) compared to the 8-point lead he held in June. Other polls showed a tie or a statistical dead heat. The Gallup tracking poll showed the two rivals at 44 percent each one day and a few points apart the next. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More troubling for Mr. Obama's candidacy, Pew showed Mr. McCain attracting more support from his party's base, including white evangelical Protestants (68 percent to 24 percent) as well as white working-class voters. He also leads overall among white voters and crushes Mr. Obama among Southern whites by 29 points (60 percent to 31 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An even greater percentage of voters than in June now see McCain as the candidate who would use the best judgment in a crisis, and an increasing percentage see him as the candidate who can get things done,&quot; Pew reported last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Pew asked 2,414 registered voters &quot;which candidate would use good judgment in a crisis,&quot; 51 percent said Mr. McCain and 36 percent said Mr. Obama - a 15-point lead on a critical issue in a still dangerous world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the poll was conducted largely before Russia's military invasion of the Republic of Georgia, its findings strongly underscored the favorable reviews defense analysts gave to Mr. McCain's response to that crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama campaign's behavior during the Georgia crisis vindicated the suspicions of many that Obama is not up to speed on major international conflicts,&quot; said Ariel Cohen, a Heritage Foundation top foreign policy analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His campaign was vague and slow to react in their response to the Russian invasion. It's clear that Obama is within the mainstream of Berkeley, Calif., in terms of the security and defense issues that concern American voters,&quot; Mr. Cohen told me. &quot;I think voters are aware of the candidates' life stories and exposure to the crises, including McCain's career as a naval officer in time of war, and his work over many years in foreign affairs issues that came before Congress, and have concluded that is better preparation to be a crisis manager than being a state senator in Illinois,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama's weakness runs deeper. Several weeks ago he was running quite well in a number of Republican battleground states that Democrats have targeted for takeover this year. This week, Mr. McCain either was tied or had the edge in Colorado, Ohio, Virginia, Florida, Missouri and Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Colorado, a state that has been trending Democratic, Mr. McCain has edged ahead by 3 points, according to a Rocky Mountain News poll. In Ohio, an economic basket case that Democrats swept in 2006, the Real Clear Politics Web site showed Mr. McCain with a slight edge in the pivotal state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is making an all-out effort to tip Virginia into the Democrats' electoral column for the first time since 1964. Democrats are expected to pick up their second Senate seat there in November. But Rasmussen and internal Republican polls have Mr. McCain edging slightly ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, Mr. McCain has lost some ground, but is still clinging to a nearly 2 point lead. In Missouri, he leads Mr. Obama by 2.3 points. In Nevada, he is up by 3 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Michigan, a must-win state for Democrats where the economy is in a full-scale depression, Mr. Obama should be flattening Mr. McCain. Instead, only a couple of points separate the two candidates and the McCain campaign has thrown increased resources into the race there. &quot;A lot of it is because Obama is not well-known among undecideds and also has low favorable numbers,&quot; says Bernie Porn, head of the Lansing-based EPIC/MRA polling group. &quot;The undecideds could break for McCain,&quot; he told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the automotive industry treading water, voters have turned sharply in favor of Mr. McCain's push for offshore oil drilling and a near-majority even favors drilling in the Great Lakes. That Mr. McCain and the Republicans have made a Democratic state like Michigan competitive is astounding. That he could win it, would be a stunning rebuke of Mr. Obama's mercurial candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national news media is still in the throes of Obamamania and hasn't come to grips with the electorate's growing lack of confidence in a young celebrity who until a few years ago was just another state lawmaker who was hardly qualified to be commander in chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton's haunting primary debate question that asked if he was ready to handle that 3 a.m. phone call in a national crisis is being echoed in John McCain's campaign ad that asks &quot;Is he ready to lead?&quot; Now voters are asking themselves the same question.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think I realize why America is having so many problems in our country and through the world. It is called lack of respect. All of the old politicians have been playing with those same old attitudes for too long. We deserve better and should demand better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to start term limits. We need to stop the big corporations from getting tax breaks for the big money they pay to get the people they want in office. We need to demand that a &quot;none of the above&quot; slot be put on our voting ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we think the candidates are not good for America, we can find new candidates to run. There are many people walking the streets who could do a better job. This is because they have lived under the hardships caused by the rich and politicians running the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These people never had to balance a budget, worry about where their next meal was coming from, the utilities being turned off or if they were going to be put out on the street. People who have never had any hard times in life don't understand the problems of many people in this country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whoever gave Sen. John McCain advice on attacking Sen. Barack Obama's Americanism also attacked all Hawaiians as not being American enough. That Obama was a minor and probably had no say in where his mom and grandparents chose to live is a point not in evidence in McCain's recent political ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did McCain forget about Obama's Kansas roots, or has McCain mentally banished that state from the Union, too? What poor advice and bad judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;An aquatic center would make a big splash,&quot; Aug. 8 commentary:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an instructor with Aquatic Adventures and a former teacher in the Roanoke city schools' swim program, my attention was drawn to the commentary from Chris John. His praise and recognition of the Roanoke Valley Aquatic Association and Salem YMCA were well deserved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RVAA has been a major player in the local aquatic program for decades. The Salem Y stepped up this year and helped to continue the outstanding tradition of the city/county meet. Regrettably, there was one error in his facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Roanoke City Public Schools, under the leadership of Kathy Tucker, implemented a learn-to-swim program that addressed the health and wellness of young children and provided an excellent opportunity for every elementary student. This year it was announced that the program would no longer be part of the system's instructional effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether because of budgetary constraints or because it was an obstruction on the path to standards of learning success, the school system has relinquished its role in this portion of our community's health. Let's hope others in our valley recognize the importance of aquatic activity and step up to meet this need.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sublime is thinking that any nation wouldn't oppose having its neighbors join a historically antagonistic military alliance. Ridiculous is claiming that Russia's counterattack on Georgia marks the return of &quot;an almost 19th-century style of great-power competition&quot; for resources and influence and &quot;shocks our 21st-century sensibilities -- the use of military power to obtain geopolitical objectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have been praying for Eddie Shepherd Sr. every day since I read his letter. &quot;Homosexual&quot; does not appear anywhere in the King James Version of the Holy Bible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am a reborn Christian who has been baptized. I am also faithfully attending Metropolitan Community Church in Roanoke. I have served in the U.S. Navy and now I serve God every chance I get. I am a happy homosexual, praising God and showing my kindness to all, such as God wants us all to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Shepherd is so unhappy that he must put false words in the Bible, I invite him to come to my church where I will share some of my happiness and joy with him. I will pray for him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunting dogs suffer just like other dogs even if they are part of a &quot;proud Virginia tradition&quot; (&quot;Treatment of hunting dogs examined,&quot; Aug. 5 Virginia section). Many members of the Humane Society of the United States have contacted us after seeing mistreated and malnourished dogs year after year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our members cite countless &quot;emaciated dogs . . . with ribs sticking out so far they collapse -- gasping for air.&quot; &quot;They're kenneled in small runs and undernourished . . . . They're quite literally skin and bones,&quot; said one member, while others said many dogs had untreated wounds and were covered with ticks and fleas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humane Society members have pulled dozens of dead or dying dogs off the road each year, while others describe hunting dogs who are abandoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mistreatment of hunting dogs in Virginia is routinely dismissed by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries and must be taken seriously. We urge the Hunting with Hounds Stakeholder Advisory Committee to take steps to remedy this sad situation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Edwards goes public with affair,&quot; Aug. 9 news story:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank goodness we have the National Enquirer to keep tabs and investigate rumors involving ultra-liberal political candidates. It appears our liberal presses, such as The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and Charlotte Observer, only have time to dig into the dirt on fundamentalist politicians and clergy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without the Enquirer, Sen. John Edwards might again be a presidential candidate. He still claims to be &quot;99 percent honest.&quot; Sort of reminds me of &quot;it depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fathers are taking on the nicotine addiction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few will challenge angry parents protecting their young. They will fight to the death, and the motivation is love, not hate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mothers Against Drunk Driving is an example. That effort did more to expose and curb the rising tide of alcoholism than any other campaign up to that point. It caused legislators to take notice, change and enforce laws that previously were lax and ineffective. Many an alcoholic was forced to face his or her addiction and seek help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fathers Against Nicotine, or FAN, is just such an effort, a newly organized Roanoke Valley group motivated by love and angrily determined to curb the worldwide pandemic of nicotine addiction. Rights must be usurped, liberties must be restricted and freedom governed when the actions of one so devastatingly affect others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Self-righteous? Holier-than-thou? Controlling? You bet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suicide and homicide are individual choices, but they are not sane choices. The loving choice is to protest, intervene and cease to enable such destructive behavior. Whether you agree or not, this addiction has met its match.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the cramped, crowded cubicles inside Sen. Barack Obama's campaign headquarters here, sandals are as ubiquitous as iPods. Two young guys in shorts and T-shirts throw a football around. An electoral college map (California 55, Texas 34, etc.) is taped to the wall in the men's bathroom. A BlackBerrying staffer sneezes and blurts out, &quot;Whew! I think I'm allergic to hope!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is Triple O -- Obama's online operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five years ago, Howard Dean's online-fueled campaign cemented the Internet's role as a political force. Exactly how big a force no one was quite sure. But this year's primary season, spanning six months, proved that online buzz and activity can translate to offline, on-the-ground results. Indeed, the Web has been crucial  to how Obama raises money, communicates his message and, most important, recruits, energizes and turns out his supporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With less than three months to go before the election, Triple O is the envy of strategists in both parties, redefining the role that an online team can play within a campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Theirs is an operation that everyone will be studying for campaigns to come,&quot; says Peter Daou, who was Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's Internet director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adds Andrew Rasiej, founder of Personal Democracy Forum, an online hub of how politics and technology intersect: &quot;Obama's success online is as much about how our society has changed, how our media ecology has changed, just in the past four years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rasiej describes how his 81-year-old father, an Obama supporter, has taken to e-mailing videos of the  senator's  speeches and policy plans to 50 of his friends. &quot;In one afternoon, my dad is reaching friends who in the past would have taken him a whole year to be in contact with. That's not necessarily Obama. That's the Internet,&quot; he continues. &quot;But you have to give credit where credit is due: Obama's Internet team is doing a hell of a job taking advantage of all these changes. They've basically leapfrogged not just the Clinton and McCain campaigns but also the mainstream media when it comes to reaching their supporters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Trippi, who's widely credited with Dean's pioneering use of the Web, says: &quot;I like to say that we at the Dean campaign were the Wright brothers. We put this rickety thing together and got it off the ground. But the folks in Obama's online team are the Apollo project. The question is, are they Apollo 8 or Apollo 11? If they're Apollo 11, they're going to launch a guy and land him in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The launch began in early 2007, when Joe Rospars, a veteran of the Dean campaign and the Democratic National Committee, was hired as new-media director. In the following weeks, the 27-year-old assembled a group that included one of the co-founders of Facebook, an award-winning CNN producer and a text-messaging enthusiast. BarackObama.com was born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year and a half ago, Rospars led a group of 11. It's easily double that now, with staffers taping signs on the back of their furniture that read, &quot;This is not an extra chair! This chair belongs to . . .&quot;  Rospars won't divulge the total number of people in his team. &quot;We don't want to give away our entire playbook,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he and other members of the group were willing to discuss many other details behind Triple O. This is how the pieces of their operation fit together.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">'Not Just About Obama'&nbsp;</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forget CNN, Fox News, NBC et al. Obama stars  on his own channel, and it's headed by Kate Albright-Hanna, a self-described YouTube addict who runs Obama's video team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, Albright-Hanna's group has shot more than 2,000 hours' worth of footage and uploaded  about 1,110 videos on Obama's YouTube channel -- more than four times what's available on Sen. John McCain's channel. For months, Obama's 37-minute race speech following the furor over the remarks of his former pastor has remained the channel's most watched video, seen more than 4.7 million times. But what's striking about Obama's channel is the breadth of its content. Though most of the videos are centered on the candidate -- his speeches and rallies, his TV and online ads, his TV appearances -- many others feature his supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Early on, we wanted to capture the sense that this campaign is not just about Obama,&quot; says Albright-Hanna, 32.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Emmy winner, she joined CNN's political unit in 1999 and met Rospars while filming a documentary on Dean. When she heard that Rospars was working for Obama, Albright-Hanna called and said she wanted to produce a doc on Obama. The campaign planned to develop its own video content, Rospars said. Intrigued, Albright-Hanna sent him a proposal on video strategy. Weeks later, she left CNN and moved with her husband and 3-year-old son to Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least nine staffers have contributed to the video team -- an astounding figure compared  with many mainstream news organizations and past campaigns. (McCain's aides declined to say how many videographers the campaign has. It has four staffers devoted to Internet activities, and has also hired an outside vendor.) Some travel with Obama and his press pack. Others work in the field. Some of the videos last less than five minutes; others go on for as long as 25. They're posted on BarackTV, the video portal on BarackObama.com, and on YouTube.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 13-minute video featuring students at the Bronx High School  for Performance and Stagecraft, for example, shows black and Hispanic teenagers talking about their school's racial atmosphere and their reaction to Obama's race speech in Philadelphia. &quot;I like . . . how [Obama] always says blacks, whites, Spanish, Asian,&quot; Ryston Buchanan, a junior, says in the video.  &quot;He says all the races, so you can see that he's not focused on one group of people.&quot; Albright-Hanna shot that video herself, and it's been viewed more than 400,000 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess I've kind of been rebelling from my CNN days, where video had to be a certain length, a certain format with a certain sensibility. Where I came from, there's a lot of concern about ratings and about what they think people, everyday people, are interested in watching,&quot; Albright-Hanna says. &quot;Here, we don't worry about how many views our videos get. That's not the priority. One of our goals is to get people talking about what's going on in their lives and why they're supporting Barack -- and hopefully not only will they watch the videos but also comment on them and forward them to relatives and friends and co-workers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, when reporters and pundits saw Clinton as the front-runner for the nomination, Albright-Hanna's team tried to capture how Obama's excited supporters were organizing. In December, weeks before the Iowa caucuses, a two-minute video was posted telling the story of Helen Kwan, an Obama precinct captain in Bettendorf, and Lilah Bell, a 99-year-old Obama volunteer who planned to caucus for the first time. &quot;This is primarily Republican,&quot;  says Kwan, a 46-year-old mother of five. &quot;But I have about eight strong volunteers, probably closer to 10 strong volunteers.&quot; Obama never appears in the video, which has been viewed more than 11,000 times -- just his campaign logo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pattern has continued during the general election campaign, when most news reports zero in on the day's tit-for-tat. Never mind the polls, these videos seem to say, this is what's happening in various homes and communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The videos are also used to bypass the news media. In June, Obama announced his decision to opt out of public financing in an almost three-minute video that's been viewed more than 345,000 times. Recently, a policy adviser in the campaign was featured in a three-minute &quot;fact checking&quot; video -- now viewed about 117,000 times --  rebutting McCain's attacks on Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together, the videos on Obama's YouTube channel have been viewed nearly 52 million times, according to TubeMogul.com, which tracks online videos. A viewer watching a video on the channel has an option to click on a &quot;Contribute&quot; button and, using a credit card, donate an amount from $15 to $1,000 using Google Checkout. McCain's channel, whose videos  have been viewed 9.5 million times, doesn't offer this option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some bloggers say these videos are self-serving, propagandist, almost cultlike. Others, however, say the videos give supporters a chance to see themselves as part of the campaign. Whatever the judgment, Albright-Hanna says, &quot;we don't have control over what people think of the videos -- we just put them out there.&quot;<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Texting, Texting: C U @ the Rally </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eyes rolled when Scott Goodstein rolled out the campaign's text-messaging program in June 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In part, that was because the program included custom-made Obama wallpaper and ring tones -- both staples in the mobile commercial market but untested in the political realm. Clinton and John Edwards had texting programs, too, but they didn't take them this far. Even Obama staffers were skeptical. Unlike YouTube, texting is not free; depending on their cellphone plans, supporters have to pay to receive and send messages. All of the Republican candidates except Mitt Romney saw it as a gimmick. McCain's campaign doesn't text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Goodstein, who put his D.C.-based PR business on hold to join the Obama campaign early last year, is a texting evangelist. He's the kind of guy who texts on two phones -- a BlackBerry for work and a Motorola  Razr for his personal use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To me, texting is the most personal form of communication,&quot; says Goodstein, 34. &quot;Your phone is with you almost all the time. You're texting with your girlfriend. You're texting with your friends. Now you're texting with Barack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texting is also playing a crucial role in the campaign's obsession with growing its database. Throughout last year, Goodstein sent at least a dozen texts to collect names, phone numbers and e-mail addresses. Most important, the message came with &quot;an ask,&quot; meaning users were asked to do something upon receiving it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Watch Barack debate tonight live on CNN! 7pm EDT. REPLY back with your name and your thoughts during &amp; after the debate,&quot; read a text sent on July 23, 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two months later, on Sept. 11, a text read: &quot;Please REPLY to this message with your five-digit zip code to receive local Obama campaign news and periodic updates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then as the primaries and caucuses neared, what Goodstein calls &quot;a big experiment&quot; started paying off. One Sunday afternoon in early December, minutes before Oprah Winfrey and Obama addressed about  29,000 people at a rally in Columbia, S.C., Jeremy Bird, Obama's state field director, asked the crowd to take out their cellphones and text &quot;SC&quot; to 62262, Obama's short code. The code spells &quot;Obama&quot; on phones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the following weeks, Goodstein sent texts to the numbers he'd collected and asked supporters to make phone calls, volunteer in precincts and vote on Jan. 26 in South Carolina. Obama won that state by 28 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Carolina was a defining moment in what we were going to do with text messaging -- not just with young voters but with all voters,&quot; says Goodstein, who spent three weeks  there to oversee the texting strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texting is a two-way street, and staffers and volunteers respond to texts from supporters who send questions such as &quot;Where's my polling place?&quot; He wouldn't divulge how many supporters receive texts, but the strategy was effective enough to be used in subsequent contests. &quot;Help Barack get out the vote in Pennsylvania! If you can get to PA between now and 4/22, REPLY to this msg: TVL and your NAME (ex. TVL Ann). Please fwd msg,&quot; read a text sent before the Keystone State primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Note the casual reference to the candidate (&quot;Barack&quot;); the request to forward (&quot;fwd&quot;) the text; and the timing -- the text was sent two weeks before polls opened, giving it plenty of time to be passed around. Says Goodstein, &quot;We've just begun to crack how valuable texting is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the campaign texted its supporters to say that it will announce its vice presidential pick via text. Days later, Goodstein launched Obama Mobile, a site where users can access the latest Obama news and download videos on their cellphones -- a first for a presidential candidate.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Socnets Instead of Town Diners </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Triple O had a motto, it would be: &quot;Meet the voters where they're at.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was the first candidate to have profiles on AsianAve.com, MiGente.com and BlackPlanet.com, social networking sites (a.k.a. socnets) targeting the Asian, Latino and black communities. His presence on BlackPlanet, which ranks behind MySpace and Facebook in terms of traffic, is so deep that he maintains 50 profiles, one for each state. On ALforObama, his Alabama page on BlackPlanet, for example, supporters can read an updated blog, watch YouTube videos and learn more about his text program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's difficult to measure the value of these socnets in persuading voters to choose Obama. What's clear, however, is that online networking -- how supporters communicate with  one another within their online communities -- has its advantages. A Facebook group called Students for Barack Obama, started in July 2006 by Bowdoin College student Meredith Segal, was so successful that it became an official part of the campaign. By the time Hans Riemer was brought on as Obama's youth-vote director in the spring of 2007, dozens of similar chapters were already up and running on campuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people only go to MySpace. It's where they're on all day. Some only go to LinkedIn. Our goal is to make sure that each supporter online, regardless of where they are, has a connection with Obama,&quot; says Goodstein, who also is in charge of regularly updating Obama's profiles on these socnets. &quot;Then, as much as we can, we try to drive everyone to our site.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All roads lead to BarackObama.com. In May, weeks before the end of the Democratic primary season, the site attracted 2.3 million unique visitors, according to the research company Nielsen Online. The latest figures from Hitwise.com, which regularly compares online traffic  for BarackObama.com and JohnMcCain.com, says that Obama's site draws 72 percent of the total traffic to the two sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a design team that develops content for BarackObama.com, as well as staffers who place ads across the Web to drive people to the site. A group known as the &quot;analytics team&quot; tracks which ad at what time drew the most traffic and what kinds of e-mails from the campaign get opened and read most. Usually campaigns hire outside companies to do this work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The site's epicenter is My.BarackObama.com, a socnet built and overseen by Chris Hughes, one of the co-founders of Facebook and one of Triple O's first employees. The 24-year-old left Facebook, where he has stock options potentially worth millions, and moved to Chicago in February 2007. Like Albright-Hanna with video and Goodstein with texting, Hughes was anxious to see how online networking can apply to campaigning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As great as Barack is, if the campaign hadn't been constituted in this idea of investing in our everyday supporters and helping them organize among themselves, I wouldn't have been as excited about the job,&quot; Hughes says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a million people have signed up on MyBO (pronounced My Boh), where they can blog, plan events, set fundraising goals, join groups and volunteer. So far, about 80,000 offline events have been planned using its tools, Hughes says. While most paid staff were deployed in the early-voting states, for example, volunteers were simultaneously organizing in Colorado, Idaho and Montana. The campaign's job is to communicate with users who host events, &quot;making sure the events are happening as planned, that the hosts have resources, that they count how many people actually show up,&quot; Hughes says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were able to build a state-by-state organization during the primaries because of the Internet,&quot; says campaign manager David Plouffe. &quot;Now we have to continue building on that -- in addition to making sure we keep getting our message across and asking our supporters to help us debunk any rumors and lies out there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though staffers monitor MyBO, supporters critical of Obama's positions are allowed to express their dismay. Last month, angered by Obama's compromise on FISA, a telecom immunity bill, users formed what for a time became the single largest group on the network. President Obama, Please Get FISA Right still lists more than 23,000 members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are hundreds of groups within MyBO, and some of the biggest include Women for Obama, Veterans for Obama and Environmentalists for Obama. Nikki Sutton, a recent graduate of Middlebury College, contacts supporters within these groups and encourages them to make phone calls and host house parties. &quot;That way, women are calling other women, people who list the environment as their top concern reach out to people who do, too,&quot; says Sutton, 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To foster a sense of community on MyBO, Sam Graham-Felsen, the campaign's blogger in chief, posts stories of supporters. The 27-year-old used to write for the Nation, for which he did a story on Obama's popularity among young people online. He joined the campaign shortly after that article ran. &quot;I wanted to be a part of the campaign instead of just writing about it,&quot; he says. When the campaign hit its goal of 75,000 donors in March 2007, Graham-Felsen contacted the 75,000th donor -- an IT specialist from Long Beach, Calif. -- and wrote about the donor's $5 contribution, his first ever to a campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That small profile encapsulates the hopes behind the entire online operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can see the main difference between the Obama and McCain campaigns by going to their Web sites,&quot; says Alex Castellanos, a longtime Republican media consultant whose clients have included Romney and President Bush. &quot;Go to McCain's. Pretty standard. Looks fine. But go to Obama's. At the very top, there's a quote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alongside a photo of Obama, it reads: &quot;I'm asking you to believe. Not just in my ability to bring about real change in Washington . . . I'm asking you to believe in yours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the Internet, Obama has built a movement. He's leading a cause. McCain is running on his r&Atilde;&copy;sum&Atilde;&copy;. He's leading a campaign,&quot; Castellanos continues. &quot;Now what's going to win: a cause or a campaign? We don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">559 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking at the possible vice presidential running mates for Barack Obama - chiefly Evan Bayh, Joe Biden, Tim Kaine, Jack Reed, Kathleen Sebelius, Bill Richardson, Wesley Clark - it is clear that among those most discussed there are few good choices, which is why the Illinois senator's No. 2 may be someone else entirely. The crux of Mr. Obama's problem is Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton was arguably the preferred choice for vice president when it was clear that she could not win. But the negative tone of her campaign alienated Mr. Obama's supporters, and Mrs. Clinton is still a looming issue when it comes to some of the names being vetted. Mr. Obama's convention concessions prove he will go to the end of the Earth to please the Clintons. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geraldine Ferraro said this week that the Obama-Clinton ticket was dead. Along with other supporters of the New York senator, she said that Mr. Obama could not select any woman other than Mrs. Clinton as his running mate. That almost assuredly knocks Mrs. Sebelius, the governor of Kansas, off the list - despite the benefits she would bring Mr. Obama in her traditionally conservative state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton also looms heavily over Indiana's junior senator, Mr. Bayh, an early and outspoken Clinton supporter and a member of the Democratic Leadership Council, whose regional help Mr. Obama could certainly use. Mr. Bayh, a moderate, may be an excellent choice with good foreign-policy credentials, a proven cross-party vote-getter and a bipartisan professional, but there will always be a question among staff and supporters about whether Mr. Obama can trust him. The same goes for Gen. Clark, an Arkansan and early supporter with deep Clinton ties, but even that doesn't trump the dislike military rank-and-file have for him or his lack of judgment in criticizing John McCain's war record last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remaining four have problems uniquely their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mr. Obama has marshalled all of his forces toward winning Virginia - he would be the first Democrat to do so since 1964 - Gov. Tim Kaine has shown that he is not ready for national politics on this scale. He said himself that he is not likely to be selected. Mr. Kaine also has had lackluster results in working out party differences on state transportation, taxes and energy. And those latter issues are tops in this election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico is a nonstarter with women. His exploits with Lt. Gov. Diane Denish - who has said she avoids him at functions because, &quot;He pokes me. He pinches my neck. He touches my hip, my thigh, sort of the side of my leg&quot; - would certainly be revisited ad nauseam. The backlash would negate his strong regional presence, his experience as an executive, and as a former energy secretary and U.N. ambassador.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That seemingly leaves only two truly safe choices: Mr. Biden of Delaware and Mr. Reed of Rhode Island. Both men bring strong foreign-policy credentials - which Mr. Obama sorely needs - although Mr. Reed isn't as well known. Mr. Biden, though, might draw criticism because of his gaffes - whether it is his assertion that, &quot;You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent,&quot; or that Mr. Obama is &quot;the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, none offers Mr. Obama the running mate he really needs - Joe Lieberman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aug. 19--Why is it that when certain people so much as sneeze, it warrants statewide media coverage? If Britney Spears sprains an ankle it would be a &quot;stop the presses&quot; moment. One such celebrity/politician is Governator Arnold Schwarzenegger, who recently made headlines for undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This may seem newsworthy to some, but personally I would rather see this headline: &quot;Legislature undergoes mandatory brain surgery to pass budget.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enough said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the filing deadline now having passed, residents have a better idea of just how many candidates are vying for spots on local city councils. The final tally is 32 people running for 11 open seats in the Victor Valley, including nine candidates vying for three spots in Victorville -- the most the city's seen in recent history. Apple Valley has nine candidates as well, including a &quot;Niles&quot; and a &quot;Jiles,&quot; as if voters need more confusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means one thing, folks: More signs and more campaign mail, or as I like to call it, more kindling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a recent political event a young woman mentioned the new billboards that are adorned with the initials &quot;MK.&quot; The first thing she thought of was Mary Kay, the well-known cosmetic company. She immediately became interested, wondering if they were having a sale or releasing a new product. Much to her chagrin, upon further reading she realized it was an ad for Hesperia City Council hopeful Mark Kirk. Way to grab somebody's attention, captain Kirk; hopefully you will not be asked to give makeovers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent report confirmed that the &quot;Frank&quot; referred to in Barack Obama's 1995 book &quot;Dreams From my Father&quot; is in fact Communist Party USA member Frank Marshall Davis. It seems that the blue democratic presidential candidate may have an affinity toward the red.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I guess he wasn't kidding about &quot;change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Obama did say last week that he would not raise taxes on anyone over 70, which of course means John McCain is in the clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A gettogether was held last week at Apple Valley Town Hall to welcome the new town manager, Frank Robinson, who came here from Texas. I didn't get a chance to ask him if everything's bigger there or if he plans on making Apple Valley bigger, but I did tell him about this column, encouraging him to give me a call if he ever has any &quot;dirt&quot; on local politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tend to stay away from that aspect,&quot; Robinson said. &quot;I find there's more (job) longevity that way.&quot; Touche, Mr. Robinson, I agree that a man in your position is better off avoiding political posturing. But honestly, if you change your mind, don't hesitate to call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election is getting closer and I have still not seen any submitted videos for the latest contest. The winner will receive an Apple iphone. Whoever can come up with the funniest McCain or Obama girl video wins. Just go to www. VVDailyPress.com and click on &quot;want to submit a video&quot; then follow the prompts. Please keep the videos between 15 and 30 seconds. Happy (film) shooting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Associated Press</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the red light switched off and her program went into a commercial, Laura Ingraham's face dissolved from a smile into a frown - then, a look of pure disgust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a nine-minute video clip of on-set behavior at Fox News Channel, Ingraham radiates hate at everyone around her. There's a word misspelled on her teleprompter, her script makes no sense, a stranger hanging around annoys her, a producer is talking too loudly in her earpiece. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, my God,&quot; she says. &quot;This is a train wreck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't the only locomotive going off the rails, particularly after comic Harry Shearer posted the visual evidence on his Internet channel last month and it spread virally across the Web. Those who don't like Ingraham's politics had something to ridicule her for; others had reason to question the sincerity behind her smile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shearer's &quot;Found Objects,&quot; a semi-regular feature of the MyDamnChannel.com Web site, is a place where news personalities don't want to find themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His videos capture them in that television netherworld: on set or on location but not (they might think) while the cameras are rolling. It's the time that obsessions about hairstyles or worries that they've done their homework surface - or when real personalities bubble through the makeup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anyone should realize that the camera is never really off, it's the people who make their living in front of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they forget, Shearer has his material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first posting last fall was an excruciating 17-minute video of former CBS News anchor Dan Rather on a chilly rooftop in Seattle, obsessing over whether to wear an overcoat during a standup, or whether the coat's collar should be turned up or down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month later, Rather's successor, Katie Couric, turned up online from a remote location, makeup people hovering around her. She purposely fiddled with her coat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to be like Dan Rather on YouTube,&quot; she joked. &quot;Geez, don't you think he deserves a little payback? This tart is ready to go!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Rather had been quoted as saying CBS had tried to &quot;tart&quot; up his old &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; after Couric took over.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shearer has been fascinated by such moments for decades, ever since he saw a tape of Richard Nixon shortly before he announced to a nationwide television audience in 1974 that he was resigning as president. Shearer's years working on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; at NBC's Rockefeller Center headquarters gave him access to video outtakes from around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people collect coins,&quot; said Rob Barnett, a former MTV Networks executive who's president of My Damn Channel. &quot;I collect vinyl albums. Harry collects this footage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shearer, the Spinal Tap bassist who's just released a disc of parody songs in which he impersonates Bush administration members, won't talk about his sources for the material. A powerful satellite dish might collect some. And it's not hard to imagine some technician who'd been berated by Ingraham being tempted to take revenge by slipping Shearer some video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One popular &quot;Found Objects&quot; feature is the &quot;silent debates.&quot; Shearer collects footage of politicians and journalists waiting quietly on camera for an event to begin; he fashions them into &quot;debates,&quot; where one participant appears to smile in response to someone else's silent gesture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Found Objects&quot; taps into the insatiable appetite people have for witnessing their favorite personalities in unguarded moments. If a video camera were installed in Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's home, Barnett admits he'd rush to watch it - even if it just showed the stars eating corn flakes or taking out the garbage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a combination of reality and voyeurism that captures the imagination,&quot; Barnett said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a brief moment of panic for Barnett until his lawyers assured him the material could be used legally. Shearer said the only complaint he's heard about such footage came when he used some for Comedy Central and a cease-and-desist order was sent on behalf of Diane Sawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shearer tries not to overdo it, posting videos only occasionally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A video of Couric off-air before a New Hampshire primary report on CBS had her joking about her voice, swearing in frustration and admitting to a weird fascination with Cindy McCain's eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some viewers saw a vapid, out-of-control diva. Yet one person wrote on the Gawker Web site: &quot;If Katie was this entertaining when she was actually on the air, I might even watch her little newscast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guess who took the hint?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weeks later, Couric quietly started her own Internet network. &quot;It's nice to be on YouTube when I know the cameras are rolling. Harry Shearer, I'm gonna get you!&quot; she joked on her first video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially designed as an outlet for segments of Couric's interviews with presidential candidates that didn't make it on the air, Couric now posts occasional behind-the-scenes videos - before she appeared on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; and when she sang with Bette Midler, for instance. Her most recent video shows Couric and her colleagues waiting in Jordan for Barack Obama to appear for an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the postings reveal a more playful Couric than she appears on the evening news, the Couric many viewers fondly remember from the &quot;Today&quot; show.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic and Republican conventions have a couple of tough acts to follow. Two compelling spectacles -- one glorious, one shocking -- have stolen the spotlight this summer to remind us all that whatever nostrums we hear from Barack Obama and John McCain about it being morning again in America, the truth is that we live in a much more complicated world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The glorious extravaganza is, of course, the Olympics. Anyone given to paranoia about China's burgeoning wealth and stature has new cause for alarm, because the Chinese are staging what may be seen as the most unforgettable Games ever. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It helps that marquee athletes such as Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt have come through with unbelievable performances. Even without all the world records, though, we'd still have to be impressed by the scale and audacity of these Olympics. If China is announcing its emergence as a great power, we get the message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think back to the climactic moment of the opening ceremonies when one of China's greatest sports heroes, former Olympic gymnast Li Ning, appeared to levitate around the rim of the Bird's Nest stadium before lighting the Olympic torch. It wasn't just the best torch-lighting since 1992, when the cauldron in Barcelona was ignited by an archer's flaming arrow. It was also a nifty bit of advertising -- and, arguably, Chinese commercial piracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Li Ning is chairman of an eponymous sportswear company that once dominated the Chinese market but whose position has been eroded by global giants such as Nike and Adidas. Li has fought back by signing promotional deals with internationally known athletes such as Shaquille O'Neal as a way of raising the company's international profile and enhancing its cachet at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it happens, Adidas paid an estimated $80 million to be one of the lead sponsors of the Beijing Games -- which meant that company officials had to sit in the Bird's Nest and watch as a competitor stole the show, with the billion-strong Chinese market paying rapt attention. Li's aerial coup should go down in the annals of product placement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whenever the television cameras pull back to show Beijing's stunning new architecture -- the Bird's Nest, the bubble-wrapped swimming center, the state television headquarters building that has a hole in the middle and no visible means of support for the upper floors -- it's impossible not to recall that our relationship to China is that of debtor to creditor. And the fact is that one tends to be polite to the bank that holds one's mortgage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One other moment from the opening night of the Games lingers with me. We saw a shot of President Bush in the stands, fidgeting as usual, talking and smiling, looking around, taking it all in. In the background we glimpsed Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, stone-faced and nonchalant, as impassive as Clint Eastwood in one of his spaghetti westerns. Meanwhile, Russian tanks were rolling into Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Russian invasion -- the other summer spectacle -- proved what should have been obvious all along: that the demise of communism never implied the demise of Russia as one of the world's great powers. It was only a matter of time before any country so blessed with natural resources and human capital would rise again. That day was hastened by the spike in the price of oil and natural gas, which has made Russia rich, and by Putin's calm and purposeful ruthlessness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to demands by Bush and others that those tanks be rolled back out of Georgia immediately, Russian officials have essentially said, &quot;Yeah, right, whatever, talk to the hand.&quot; It's obvious that they'll leave when they're good and ready -- and that there's basically nothing anyone can do to hurry them up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lesson that's being brought home this summer is that we live in a multipolar world. We knew that, but in our political rhetoric we prefer to ignore it. Now, neither  the Democrats nor the Republicans are going to be able to make it through  their convention without acknowledging the world's complications and interconnections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama will probably talk more about engagement and the &quot;international community,&quot; while McCain is likely to sound more confrontational. I'm pretty sure, though, that neither will come clean about a central truth: Our future is being decided not just in Washington but in Beijing and Moscow -- and in Riyadh, Islamabad, New Delhi, Dubai, Caracas, Abuja, Brasilia. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We still have the wherewithal to lead. But we're deluding ourselves if we believe we won't have to adapt to the new reality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALBUQUERQUE, Aug. 18</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama returned to the presidential  campaign trail on Monday after a week-long Hawaiian vacation and tried to assure anxious Democrats that he is ready to fight back against Republican character attacks that grew sharper in his absence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a town hall meeting here, Obama slammed Sen. John McCain for continuing the politics and policies of President Bush, part of an attempt to tether the presumptive Republican nominee to the unpopular president. In recent days, the campaign and its supporters have also begun portraying the wealthy McCain as too out of touch to represent the common man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late last week, the campaign dismissed the rising concerns of Democrats as arm-chair quarterbacking with little understanding of Obama's strategy. By Monday, not even the candidate could let such concerns slide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everywhere I go, people have told me, 'I'm getting nervous. The Republicans, they're so mean. They're going to Swift-boat you. They're doing things to you. What are you going to do?' &quot; Obama said. &quot;I have to just remind people that it is true that, just as John McCain has embraced George Bush's policies, he's embraced his politics. And the same people who brought you George Bush are now trying to package John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns from Democrats are stoked by memories of 2004, when candidate John F. Kerry did not respond vigorously to misrepresentations of his military service on a Swift boat in Vietnam. Those attacks also came in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention, and the senator from Massachusetts struggled to recover from them for the rest of his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic jitters have been rekindled since the release of &quot;The Obama Nation,&quot; an anti-Obama book written by the co-author of &quot;Unfit for Command,&quot; the 2004 book about Kerry's service. Among other falsehoods, author Jerome Corsi charges that Obama misrepresents his religion, saying that Muslim faith plays a significant role in his ideology, even though he is a practicing Christian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain showed no signs of letting up his attacks Monday, charging that behind Obama's demand to end the Iraq war &quot;lies the ambition to be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even in retrospect, he would choose the path of retreat and failure for America over the path of success and victory,&quot; the senator from Arizona told the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Orlando. &quot;In short, both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home. The great difference is that I intend to win it first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At four events Sunday and again here Monday, Obama delivered pep talks and said he is prepared for the worst that Republicans will throw at him. Democrats may be disappointed that he hasn't opened up a significant lead to match voter discontent with Bush, Obama acknowledged. But McCain is a formidable opponent, he said, and despite Bush's woes the GOP is experienced at winning national elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have a candidate who doesn't take any guff,&quot; the presumptive Democratic nominee assured donors in San Francisco on Sunday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Obama sharpens his attacks, Democratic allies have detected a green light from the campaign and have taken them much further. Last Thursday, the AFL-CIO sent out what it billed as &quot;an important union message,&quot; which depicted McCain as an out-of-touch plutocrat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain's worth . . . over $100 million. . . . He owns 10 houses. . . . He flies around on a $12.6 million corporate jet. . . . He walks around in $520 Italian loafers,&quot; the mailer states. &quot;If John McCain lost his Social Security, he'd get by just fine. Would you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Obama strategist David Axelrod took up the same cudgel, the Democratic National Committee, the Service Employees International Union and liberal filmmaker Robert Greenwald hammered the theme, with videos and statements showing off McCain's Phoenix high-rise; his beach condominiums in Coronado and La Jolla, Calif.; his ranch in Sedona, Ariz.; his apartment in Arlington; and his Ferragamo shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, some strategists close to Obama say he needs to hit harder, be more specific in his attacks, and delve into McCain's character the way McCain has hit Obama's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They need to draw a clearer contrast and not be shy or flinch from doing it,&quot; said a Chicago Democrat close to the campaign, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to be candid. &quot;He's running a commercial now that says [McCain] voted with Bush 95 percent of the time -- on what? And what about all the flip-flops?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing for the online Democratic Strategist, party communications consultant James Vega outlined a character attack that Obama could pick up. He said McCain has become &quot;a pale, diminished shadow&quot; of his former self, so desperate to win the election that he has sacrificed &quot;his deepest principles and his personal honor&quot; and allowed &quot;men he once despised . . . to manipulate him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain is actually profoundly vulnerable to a powerful, aggressive and damaging attack on his character,&quot; Vega concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Democrats are showing deference to Obama and his campaign staff, who resisted repeated calls for a more negative approach during the drawn-out primary fight and came out on top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You always have a group of people in Washington whose political profession is to get nervous during elections,&quot; said Rep. Artur Davis (D-Ala.), an Obama adviser. &quot;McCain has failed to put forward a positive case for a McCain presidency. He's entrenched himself in this administration, and that's going to turn into the biggest strategic blunder of this campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least publicly, Obama is showing no sign of worry, but for the first time he's acknowledging the concern of others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats, because we've burned in the last few elections, get nervous and skittish right around this time,&quot; Obama told about 350 people who paid $28,500 for a VIP dinner in San Francisco on Sunday night. &quot;They say, 'Oh, no, here the Republicans come -- they're so mean and they're going to be doing all these things. Obama is a funny name, and who knows what they're going to do?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So keep your stress to a minimum,&quot; he instructed them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marc Kaufman; Washington Post Staff Writer</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">A-SECTION; Pg. A04</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">906 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama has detailed a comprehensive space plan that includes $2 billion in new funding to reinvigorate NASA and a promise to make space exploration and science a significantly higher priority if he is elected president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning in Florida yesterday, Sen. John McCain responded by telling business leaders that Obama has changed his position on some key questions of NASA funding in recent months and should not be trusted to support the program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Obama's ambitious plan embraces President Bush's 2004 &quot;vision&quot; to send astronauts to the moon by 2020 and later to Mars -- a plan McCain co-sponsored in the Senate -- the Democratic presidential candidate said the administration's &quot;poor planning and inadequate funding&quot; have undermined the effort and jeopardized U.S. leadership in space. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, he criticized administration policies that will lead to a five-year period after 2010 when &quot;the United States will have to depend on foreign rockets and spacecraft to send Americans to orbit&quot; -- even to the largely U.S.-funded $100 billion international space station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As president, I'll make our space program a priority again by devoting the attention and resources needed to not only inspire the world with feats of exploration but also improve life here on Earth,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His plan also calls for reestablishing the National Aeronautics and Space Council to coordinate all civilian, commercial and military space programs; the body was in place in earlier decades but disbanded in 1992. As a signal that NASA will be a higher priority for him, Obama said the council would report directly to the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain did not directly address Obama's proposals, released on Sunday, but did emphasize that the Democrat had earlier opposed full funding for the NASA program to build a new generation of spacecraft to replace the shuttle by 2015. Obama's position has shifted since last winter, and he now says the replacement Constellation spaceship program is essential both for space exploration and for encouraging students in science and math.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office, because they say different things at different times to different people,&quot; McCain said in a closed-door meeting of business leaders in Cocoa Beach. &quot;This is a particular problem when a candidate has a short, thin record on the issues, as in the case of Senator Obama. Let me say, just in case Senator Obama does decide to return to his original plan of cutting NASA funding -- I oppose such cuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said: &quot;I will ensure that space exploration remains a top priority and that the U.S. continues to lead the world in this field.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Democratic Party campaign call after McCain spoke, former NASA associate administrator Lori Garver said that while the Republican candidate now voices support for NASA, his voting record has been far less enthusiastic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said McCain spoke against a bill introduced last year that would give NASA $1 billion to make up for costs incurred after the Columbia disaster -- money that would have gone specifically to speeding development of the Constellation program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very interesting to see McCain now paint himself as a strong supporter of NASA,&quot; she said. &quot;When he could have stepped up to support the program, he has not done that. He has no general respect for our community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garver acknowledged that Obama's positions on NASA have evolved since the primaries, but she said McCain's NASA advocacy has changed as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although McCain has said continued U.S. space superiority is essential, he has also said that as president he would freeze all discretionary spending -- and NASA, with a budget of about $17.5 billion, is generally considered in that category. McCain has spoken in mostly general terms about NASA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an earlier interview, McCain campaign spokesman Taylor Griffin said the candidate firmly supports building a new generation of U.S. spacecraft and would fund the program as needed. He also said McCain would conduct &quot;an overall review early in the administration of where NASA's money is spent to determine an appropriate plan of action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign said the additional NASA funds would be paid for by rolling back congressional earmarks to what they were in 1994, and by using the newly formed advisory council to potentially re-allocate space funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the more expensive proposals is Obama's plan to flying an additional shuttle mission to bring a $1.5 billion particle detector to the station. NASA dropped plans to ferry up the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer after the Columbia disaster, even though the instrument is one of the most expensive ever built and was funded by a group of international governments and universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under current NASA plans, the last shuttle mission will fly in summer of 2010, and the three-spacecraft fleet will be retired after that. The aging shuttles are expensive to maintain and operate, and under current budgets NASA will not have funds to build the new Constellation spacecraft unless the shuttle is grounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constellation won't be ready until 2015 at the earliest, however, creating the five-year gap when the United States will be largely dependent on Russian Soyuz transportation. NASA and the Russian space agency have worked closely and generally well together in recent years, but many are concerned that Russian military actions in Georgia will change that relationship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time was, Democrats in Southern states such as North Carolina were tied to the national party the way a boat is tied to its anchor, holding them back when it wasn't halting their progress completely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incumbent Republican Sen. Elizabeth Dole has the name recognition, the bigger war chest and a lead in the polls against her Democratic challenger, state Sen. Kay Hagan of Greensboro. Yet with Barack Obama sparking a surge in voter registrations and the national Democratic Party pouring millions of dollars into the race, the anchor may become a sail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This race is very precarious; it's very much in play,&quot; insisted Tom Campbell, a former Democratic assistant state treasurer and host of a weekly state public affairs discussion show called &quot;No Spin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You tell me how big the Obama surge is in North Carolina, and I'll tell you how the Senate race goes. For Hagan to be within five points of 'Queen Elizabeth' at this point must make the Republicans very nervous,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans, predictably, accuse their opponents of whistling Dixie in what is still largely a conservative state with one of the nation's largest military populations. Many of the same arguments - that she is out of touch with ordinary North Carolinians, that she spenttoo much time in Washington - were trotted out six years ago when Mrs. Dole comfortably defeated the well-funded Erskine Bowles, a former chief of staff to President Clinton, to win her first Senate race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Hagan, a five-term state senator and co-chairman of the budget committee, &quot;is probably the best available candidate the Democrats could have nominated, but it's still a pretty long shot for her to win,&quot; said John Hood, president of Raleigh-based John Locke Institute and a designated conservative voice on Mr. Campbell's &quot;No Spin&quot; panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The national mood is clearly not in the Republicans' favor, but Dole is likely to outperform the GOP brand in North Carolina because she has major crossover appeal,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Dole, one of a number of vulnerable Republican senators who have found a reason to miss the party's convention in Minneapolis, did not mention the R-word, President Bush or nominee John McCain in her first flight of campaign ads, which aired this spring shortly after Mrs. Hagan was selected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the ads focused on Mrs. Dole's clout in delivering for state constituents on issues such as tobacco farm payments and support for local sheriffs to crack down on illegal immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show that Mrs. Hagan has cut a double-digit deficit down to 6 percentage points over the summer, but Mr. Hood noted that the supposedly deep-red state has a history of tight Senate races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The late Sen. Jesse Helms, father of the modern Republican Party in the state, averaged just 52.4 percent of the vote in his five Senate races, topping out at just 54.5 percent in 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyone who thought Dole was going to run away with the race just doesn't understand North Carolina,&quot; Mr. Hood said, &quot;but that doesn't mean she's going to lose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent polls show Mrs. Hagan at least within striking distance, while Mr. Obama makes a big push to challenge Mr. McCain at the top of the ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A July 29 poll by Raleigh-based Public Policy Polling showed Mrs. Dole with a 49-40 edge over Mrs. Hagan. An Aug. 12 poll by SurveyUSA for WTVD saw that margin shrink to 46-41 for Mrs. Dole, with wild-card Libertarian candidate and potential spoiler Chris Cole at 7 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The momentum right now is with Hagan,&quot; said Public Policy Polling President Dean Debnam. &quot;If she has enough financial support, I think she has a shot, though she's going to have to work really hard to pull it off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats like Mr. Campbell say the Obama candidacy has sparked more than 250,000 new voter registrations in North Carolina since the beginning of the year, with newly registered Democrats outnumbering new Republicans by an 8-1 margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's got to be scaring the Republicans to death,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Debnam noted that his poll was taken before a reported $7-million-plus ad campaign for Mrs. Hagan funded by the national Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee began running its first anti-Dole campaign spots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pollster said the Obama effect in North Carolina should be easy to measure the day after the November election. Black voters, a solid Democratic bloc, typically make up about 17 percent of the state's total vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If that number gets up to 23 percent, the Democrats win the state,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National pollsters have put North Carolina in the second tier of vulnerable Senate seats for the Republicans, saying Mrs. Hagan remains the underdog but a Democratic win is still possible in a difficult political and economic environment for the Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The national Democratic Party used to be a drag on the state party, but not this time,&quot; the conservative Mr. Hood said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Put it this way: If candidates like Hagan win this year, it will be a sign that we're having another 'wave' election like 2006, where the issue was much bigger than what was happening in North Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's script</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many times have you heard commentators refer to Russia's invasion of Georgia as a &quot; 3 a.m. momen &quot; for the presidential candidates?&quot; Byron York asks in USA Today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pundits are referring, of course, to Hillary Clinton's famous TV ad arguing that Barack Obama doesn't have the experience to handle a middle-of-the-night, out-of-nowhere national security crisis. Now, the thinking goes, the situation in Georgia gives John McCain an opportunity to claim an advantage over Obama in foreign affairs. And he's doing it - with a script drawn straight from Clinton,&quot; Mr. York said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It might not seem smart to model a key aspect of your campaign on a candidate who lost - to the same guy you're running against, no less. But that is exactly what Team McCain is doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; 'Clinton's campaign was a fabulous real-time laboratory in how you run against a movement candidate,' Nicolle Wallace, a McCain adviser and spokeswoman, told me a few days ago. The McCainiacs have studied the New York senator's losing effort very, very carefully, and they've drawn some lessons from it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lesson No. 1 is that the '3 a.m.' ad worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; 'The 'Is he ready to lead?' question in our celebrity ad is the same question that the 3 a.m. ad asked,' Wallace said. Clinton portrayed a blissfully sleeping child threatened by unspecified world events, while McCain went over the top with images of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, but the message was the same: Obama is not ready.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It appears to be working, at least for now. Although still behind in most nationwide polls, McCain is inching toward Obama in a number of surveys, including those in key battleground states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama vs. Thomas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama likes to portray himself as a centrist politician who wants to unite the country, but occasionally his postpartisan mask slips. That was the case at Saturday night's Saddleback Church forum, when Mr. Obama chose to demean Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas,&quot; the Wall Street Journal says in an editorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pastor Rick Warren asked each presidential candidate which Justices he would not have nominated. Mr. McCain said, 'with all due respect' the four most liberal sitting justices because of his different judicial philosophy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Obama took a lower road, replying first that 'that's a good one,' and then adding that 'I would not have nominated Clarence Thomas. I don't think that he, I don't think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation. Setting aside the fact that I profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the Constitution.' The Democrat added that he also wouldn't have appointed Antonin Scalia, and perhaps not John Roberts, though he assured the audience that at least they were smart enough for the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So let's see. By the time he was nominated, Clarence Thomas had worked in the Missouri attorney general's office, served as an assistant secretary of education, run the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and sat for a year on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the nation's second most prominent court. Since his 'elevation' to the High Court in 1991, he has also shown himself to be a principled and scholarly jurist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, as he bids to be America's commander in chief, Mr. Obama isn't yet four years out of the Illinois state Senate, has never held a hearing of note of his U.S. Senate subcommittee, and had an unremarkable record as both a 'community organizer' and law school lecturer. Justice Thomas' judicial credentials compare favorably to Mr. Obama's presidential resume by any measure. And when it comes to rising from difficult circumstances, Justice Thomas's rural Georgian upbringing makes Mr. Obama's story look like easy street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clintons</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest question for the Democratic Party is whether its presumptive nominee, Sen. Barack Obama, has given the Clintons too large a role in next week's national convention,&quot; the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette says in an editorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, correctly ceded the race for the nomination to Mr. Obama and pledged to work for his victory in November, there is suspicion and uncertainty about what the Clintons are up to,&quot; the newspaper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Obama, nevertheless, is playing the matter correctly. In quest of Mrs. Clinton's supporters, who potentially are more attached to her than to the Democratic Party, he is giving both Clintons maximum exposure at the party's signature event. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr Obama, in his treatment of the Clintons, is showing generosity consistent with his pledge to bring Americans together. In doing so he is also laying down a marker that says to the Clintons and the party that if during the campaign they undercut him, or do not work sincerely for his election, a Democratic loss in November will lie on their heads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not No. 1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Steve Kagen's congressional campaign claims in a fundraising e-mail that former White House political adviser Karl Rove called him the top target this year - but Mr. Rove says he has no recollection of ever saying that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Karl Rove has already declared Congressman Steve Kagen their 1 candidate to beat in 2008,&quot; says the e-mail from the freshman Wisconsin Democrat, who is seeking re-election to his House seat. &quot;That means unlimited special-interest money to pay for their negative campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Mr. Rove's denial, an Associated Press search of Nexis could find no stories that quote Mr. Rove making that comment. Mr. Kagen's campaign offered sources, but none provided any solid documentation to back up the assertion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One, a January 2007 White House Office of Political Affairs memo titled &quot;2008 House Targets: Top 20,&quot; lists Mr. Kagen but also 19 other congressional Democrats. Another is a September 2006 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel blog about Mr. Rove being the guest at a Washington fundraiser for Mr. Kagen's GOP opponent, John Gard. But that makes no mention of Mr. Rove calling Mr. Kagen the No. 1 target, and in any event, the fundraiser was for the 2006 race, not this year's, which features a Kagen-Gard rematch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This isn't Kagen's first tussle with Mr. Rove. Last year, Mr. Kagen apologized to constituents in his first month on the job after telling a group of peace activists that he had taunted Mr. Rove, Vice President Dick Cheney and first lady Laura Bush at a White House reception for new lawmakers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wes who?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He ran in the 2004 Democratic presidential primaries, and pundits discussed him as having a serious shot in that crowded field. Some even said he was their man - a blunt-talking four-star general who presided over a victorious humanitarian intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, however, Gen. Wesley Clark is persona non grata at the Democratic National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was told by General Clark's personal office in Little Rock that he would not be attending. Clark was informed by Barack Obama's people that there was no reason to come. General Clark has been given no role of any kind at the convention,&quot; Steve Clemons writes at the Washington Note (www.thewashingtonnote.com) before going on to note a particularly pointed slap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rubbing salt in the wound even more, the 'theme' of Wednesday's Democratic convention agenda is 'Securing America.' Wesley Clark's PAC also happens to be called Securing America.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative blogger Sister Toldjah recalled Gen. Clark's penchant for foot-in-mouth disease, citing his famous dis of Sen. John McCain that &quot;I don't think ... getting shot down is a qualification to become president&quot; and linking back to a post detailing much, much more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I honestly don't blame the Obama campaign for telling him he wasn't needed at the convention. ... I wouldn't want him speaking at the GOP convention, either, even if he was a Democrat who had decided to support McCain,&quot; she wrote at her site</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(http://sistertoldjah.com/).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Be afraid, Austria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Self-described Cranky Conservative (http://crankycon.politicalbear.com/) Paul Zummo knows the meaning of &quot;schadenfreude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to admit that I get a certain amount of pleasure observing the sheer moonbattery of some elements of the unhinged left. There isn't a conspiracy theory too crazy to be left off the table,&quot; he writes before launching into a &quot;fisk&quot; of Robert Scheer's article on the Nation Web site titled &quot;Georgia War: A Neocon Election Ploy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the article (www.thenation .com), Mr. Scheer goes beyond merely noting (as cited here last week) that Randy Scheunemann, a top McCain aide, has been a lobbyist for the government of Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That fact becomes Exhibit A in his case that &quot;the neocons&quot; engineered the war to create an early &quot;October surprise,&quot; a &quot;garbage issue&quot; to aid Sen. John McCain and continue feeding the military-industrial complex. He calls it &quot;inconceivable&quot; that Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili would start a war &quot;without some assurance from influential Americans he trusted, like Scheunemann, that the United States would have his back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zummo laughs at such a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; about evil neocons, noting that arming Georgia and pushing for its NATO membership was the public policy of the actual, sitting U.S. government - more obvious and important surely than sympathy from a senator who may (or may not) become president in January, never mind one adviser to that man. Besides, he wrote, &quot;do you really think the leader of a country is going to risk being invaded by a much larger force based on the conjecture that he will receive some vague kind of assistance?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the high point was this Scheer smear of Georgia: &quot;How convenient to forget that [Josef] Stalin was a Georgian, and indeed, if Russian troops had occupied the threatened Georgian town of Gori, they would have found a museum still honoring their local boy ... Indeed, five Russian bombs reportedly were dropped on Gori's Stalin Square</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on Tuesday&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zummo drew an analogy between Stalin and his sometime ally and role model, Adolf Hitler: &quot;How can we possibly dare accuse the Russians of being imperialist when it's the other guy's country that bred - over a century ago - a mass murdering tyrant? Surely it's not in the Russian DNA to be tyrannical. Based on this logic, I guess Germany has carte blanche to invade Austria. Be afraid Austria, be very afraid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silent running</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Moe Lane at RedState (www.redstate.com) put it: &quot;How do we know that [Sen. John] McCain won the Saddleback forum?: Because his opponent's people are apparently claiming that McCain cheated, that's how.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saddleback Church pastor the Rev. Rick Warren asked the same questions of both men in back-to-back one-hour question-and-answer sessions. Because whoever went second could have up to an hour to mull over an answer and prepare for an awkward question, the candidates were required not to listen in, and Mr. Warren said during Saturday night's event that Mr. McCain was in a &quot;cone of silence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in an interview Sunday on CNN, linked to by a score of liberal blogs, Mr. Warren acknowledged that Mr. McCain was not in the church for the first half-hour of Mr. Obama's session but was in a Secret Service motorcade on his way there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Warren told CNN's Rick Sanchez that the &quot;no listening&quot; rule was given to both campaigns before either knew who would go first. Before Mr. McCain went on, &quot;we asked them, did you hear&quot; anything, and the McCain team denied it, Mr. Warren said, adding: &quot;I trust the integrity&quot; of both men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liberal netroots do not trust the integrity of John McCain (understatement).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The honor system, are you kidding me?&quot; says furiousxxgeorge at Daily Kos (www.dailykos.com). GottaLaff at Political Carnival (http://thepoliticalcarnival.blogspot.com ) writes: &quot;straight-talking P.O.W.s and pastors don't lie. And the audience didn't pay $2,000 to clap extra loud in support of their guy. And Orange County, CA ... isn't skewed Republican either All in all, this was a fair and balanced forum, wouldn't you agree?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign denied any cheating to both CNN and the New York TImes. An Obama spokesperson told CNN's Political Ticker (http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/) that the Illinois senator's campaign is not pursuing the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cross crossed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some in the liberal blogosphere are accusing Republican presidential candidate John McCain of making up the &quot;cross in the dirt&quot; story, which the Arizona senator told again at Saturday night's forum at Mr. Warren's Saddleback Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Sullivan said he has &quot;now heard it countless times. McCain has used what appears to be an intensely personal moment in a prison camp as a reason to vote for him in a campaign ad. As he tells it [Saturday], it was the pivotal moment in his struggle to survive in the Hanoi Hilton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yet, in his first thorough account of his time in captivity, in 1973, the story is absent,&quot; Mr. Sullivan writes, linking to a 17-Web-page first-person account Mr. McCain gave to U.S. News &amp; World Report shortly after he arrived back in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At his Atlantic blog (http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/), Mr. Sullivan also links to a Daily Kos piece by RickRocket, titled &quot; 'Cross in the Dirt' story stolen from [Aleksandr] Solzhenitsyn.&quot; Both accounts center on communist guards drawing crosses in the dirt as a secret sign of sympathy for an inmate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RickRocket further notes that the Solzhenitsyn account was in &quot;The Gulag Archipelago,&quot; which was published in the U.S. the same year Mr. McCain arrived back from captivity and that Mr. McCain frequently expressed admiration for Mr. Solzhenitsyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sullivan would only go so far as to say &quot;the story is also hauntingly like that recounted by Solzhenitsyn.&quot; Yet he concludes his post with: &quot;I have one simple question: when was the first time that McCain told this story?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats are on the verge of nominating the first celebrity presidential candidate in U.S. history. On Aug. 25, the Democratic National Convention in Denver will begin. The Democratic Party will officially endorse Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to be its nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event is a watershed moment in American politics. It is not just that for the first time an African-American will head a presidential ticket of a major party. It signifies something even more profound: the triumph of our celebrity culture. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America's stoic, traditional culture is being replaced by one of rampant hedonism, moral relativism and self-indulgence. We are no longer able to distinguish what is important and meaningful from what is frivolous and inconsequential. We are suffering from what Pope Benedict XVI calls the &quot;infantilization&quot; and &quot;entertainmentization&quot; of our society. We live in a culture dominated by TV, tabloids and trash; Hollywood, sports, sex and pop music reign supreme. In short, we have become obsessed with games and entertainment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama politically embodies this ubiquitous celebrity culture. His campaign appearances have the feel of a rock concert rather than a serious rally, with tens of thousands of cheering, adoring, screaming crowds (many of whom can be seen weeping, wailing and some even fainting from whipped-up frenzy). His track record and resume are paper-thin. His claim to the presidency is based on working as a &quot;community organizer&quot; (where his greatest accomplishment was to provide low-income students with summer jobs), serving in the Illinois State Senate, and being a U.S. senator for three years with no consequential legislative achievements - not one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is an effective public speaker, whose soaring rhetoric and carefully crafted campaign props makes for good political theater. But he lacks the experience and maturity to occupy the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is no accident that he is the favorite candidate of the Hollywood left. Many in tinsel town, such as George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, are offering to raise money for him. They are doing this for one simple reason: Mr. Obama is one of them. He is a romantic, cosmopolitan liberal whose self-righteous moralizing on practically every issue - Iraq, Darfur, global warming, universal health care - reflects their inflated self-importance and puerile worldview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is a self-absorbed narcissist who portrays himself as a political messiah - the anointed one, who by virtue of being elected will usher in a &quot;new kind of politics&quot; and badly needed &quot;change&quot; and &quot;hope.&quot; One of his campaign slogans is &quot;We are the ones we've been waiting for.&quot; It captures the messianic tone, hubris and fundamental immaturity of his movement. It is all about him and his supporters - and their supposed greatness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although John McCain was roughed up by the media for his campaign ad comparing Mr. Obama to Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, the ad was correct: Mr. Obama is a world-renowned celebrity, whose immense popularity is not rooted in reality but fantasy. He has won no wars, passed no major pieces of legislation nor liberated any country. He has not even won the presidential election (although this may be news to his campaign and the fawning press corps). His only significant accomplishment has been to defeat Sen. Hillary Clinton - a highly polarizing and flawed candidate, who was ripe for the taking. This does not make him a Douglas MacArthur or Thomas Jefferson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most vivid illustration of his celebrity fantasist politics was his speech in Berlin. &quot;The greatest danger,&quot; Mr. Obama said was not Islamic terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear weapons or the rise of fascist China and Russia. No, the &quot;greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another.&quot; He vowed that &quot;The walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand. The walls between races and tribes, natives and immigrants, Christian and Muslim and Jew cannot stand. These now are the walls we must tear down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama perceives his mission to end racism and religious division. Does he really seek to do what no other historic spiritual leader or prophet - not Jesus, Muhammad, Moses or Buddha - has done before: unify the peoples of the world? If he truly believes this, then Mr. Obama is simply kooky. If he doesn't, then he is a cynical charlatan peddling utopian snake oil. Either way, he shouldn't be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What he should get, however, is his own reality TV show called, &quot;The World According to Barack.&quot; This way he and his fellow celebrity narcissists can spout their vacuous, sophomoric platitudes - and leave the serious business of governing to the grown-ups.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama yesterday said that defining when life begins is &quot;above my pay grade,&quot; but added he would work to promote adoptions, as he and Sen. John McCain spilled their souls in what amounted to public confessions to one of the nation's top evangelical leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain was unequivocal in his answer to the question of when a baby acquires human rights, saying &quot;at the moment of conception,&quot; before going on to tout his pro-life voting record and to promise a pro-life administration and pro-life judges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men shared their first handshake - and hug - of the campaign as Mr. Obama left the stage and Mr. McCain took his seat at a Saturday night faith forum, sponsored by the Rev. Rick Warren, pastor of Saddleback Church here and an emerging leader for a broader evangelical movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said Clarence Thomas &quot;was not a strong enough jurist or legal thinker&quot; to have been nominated to the Supreme Court, and said to applause he thinks that &quot;marriage is the union between a man and a woman,&quot; but that states should be allowed to make their own definitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a manner reflecting his brusque style, Mr. McCain said without elaboration that his greatest personal failure was the collapse of his first marriage, an event for which he has often taken responsibility. He also repeatedly talked about his Christian faith having been forged by his experiences in a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the greatest failure of the country has been in not stepping up to its challenges, and he even took a swipe at President Bush, saying the country took the wrong attitude after the September 11 terrorist attacks, when Mr. Bush famously told people to boost the economy by shopping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think after 9/11, my friends, instead of telling people to go shopping or take a trip, we should have told people to join the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps or the military,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After &quot;values voters&quot; were credited with delivering a re-election victory to Mr. Bush in2004, Democrats vowed to fight for those voters, and Mr. Obama senses an opening this year, particularly among younger evangelicals who, their leaders say, are looking beyond abortion and marriage to other issues, such as AIDS, poverty and the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underscoring the importance of those voters, it took Mr. Warren, author of &quot;The Purpose Driven Life&quot; and who some have likened to the Rev. Billy Graham, to get the two candidates together on the campaign trail for the first time since they all but secured their respective parties' nominations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that this was the first such meeting was a reminder of how the rest of the campaign this year has been fought through television commercials, press releases and speeches, and how most coverage has focused on the two men's attacks and gaffes. Mr. McCain had challenged Mr. Obama to a series of 10 face-to-face town-hall meetings, but the Democrat rejected that idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Mr. Obama said that Saturday's forum was the kind of discussion the two men should be having and the country needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was more Oprah Winfrey than Lincoln-Douglas, as Mr. Warren prodded both candidates to open up on their own failings and their framework for addressing issues and problems. He had the same script of questions for both men, and so, as a result, Mr. McCain was kept in a soundproof environment while Mr. Obama was on for the first hour in the two-hour program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama swerved away from revealing too much, saying his biggest political change from 10 years ago was on welfare reform, which he said worked better than he thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And questions on abortion, a major stumbling block he faces with evangelicals and other religious conservatives, seemed to stump Mr. Obama: He couldn't name a time he'd voted to reduce abortions, and couldn't define at what point a human life has rights, instead saying he is pro-choice, but recognizes that there is a moral and ethical dimension to the issue and respects those who think life begins at conception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he would work to promote common ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Mr. Warren asking the same questions of both men, there were a number of illuminating contrasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He asked whether evil exists and how to address it - by ignoring it, negotiating with it, containing it or defeating it - and both men said they believe evil exists. But Mr. Obama said that only God can defeat evil, while Mr. McCain was flat with his answer: &quot;Defeat it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked their most gut-wrenching decisions, Mr. Obama said his was to oppose the Iraq war. Mr. McCain said his was to forgo early release - for himself alone - from a North Vietnamese prisoner of war camp, which he was offered by his communist captors but refused because it was against the prisoners' code of conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama laid out his philosophy for military intervention, saying the U.S. has a role for aggressive action to stop killing worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we have it within our power to prevent mass killings or genocide, and we can work in concert with the international community to prevent it, then we should act,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain also said the U.S. needs to stop genocide where it can, and said the U.S. can lend logistical support in places like the Darfur region of Sudan, but said U.S. troops should only be committed where national security interests are at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where Mr. Obama was smooth with his answers, Mr. McCain was specific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, when asked the three people he would listen to as president, Mr. Obama said his mother, his grandmother, and then tossed out several fellow senators. Mr. McCain listed three specific persons: Gen. David H. Petraeus, architect of the surge strategy for Iraq; Rep. John Lewis, Georgia Democrat and a civil rights leader; and Meg Whitman, former CEO of eBay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain was also able to point to specifics where he's fought his own party's interests - &quot;climate change, out-of-control spending, torture, the list goes on&quot; - while Mr. Obama pointed to only one, ethics reforms, which was actually popular with many other Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama earlier this year caused a stir when he said he would continue, though modify, Mr. Bush's faith-based initiative. Mr. McCain's campaign sent out a memo detailing his own support for faith-based initiatives to encourage adoption in the U.S. and efforts to fight malaria in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that both men were together one after the other was enough to draw full live coverage of the event by the cable news networks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain and the Republican National Committee started August with a hefty $96 million, strongly positioned to compete with prolific fundraiser Barack Obama and the Democrats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have been trying to even out the financial playing field after trailing Democrats in fundraising for most of the election cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has been a subpar fundraiser and has lagged the more adept Obama in monthly campaign tallies. But the RNC, with big-draw President Bush helping, has trounced its Democratic counterpart in collections. That has helped McCain and the GOP stay competitive financially with Obama and the Democratic National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The July numbers reflect how far McCain and the Republicans have come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain raised $27 million in July, his largest one-month fundraising haul since clinching the GOP presidential nomination, and had $21 million available to spend The RNC brought in nearly $26 million and had $75 million on hand to compete with the Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, himself now has 600,000 donors, while the party said it had reached 1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By comparison, Obama alone recently surpassed 2 million contributors, giving him a larger pool of donors to hit up for money again. He and the DNC have not yet disclosed their monthly takes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our fundraising continues to be very healthy,&quot; Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, said , noting that July was the fifth straight month that McCain has improved his cash flow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite lackluster fund&shy;raising earlier , the campaign's improved situation has let the GOP nominee-in-waiting keep pace with his Democratic riva in advertising, including $6 million in the ultra-expensive Olympics and three straight months of multimillions in 11 battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's&nbsp;ad budget for August is expected to exceed $20&nbsp;million. By the convention in early September, Davis said, McCain is on track to spend $60&nbsp;million on TV ads.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">flush with funds</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee, with President Bush helping, has trounced its Democratic counterpart in collections. That has helped McCain and the GOP stay competitive financially with Obama and the Democrats.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the rest of the political universe buzzing about a controversial new book on Sen. Barack Obama, one person is staying quiet: Sen. John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and his advisers have said nothing about &quot;The Obama Nation: Leftist Politics and the Cult of Personality,&quot; an innuendo-filled, mistake-riddled biography written by Jerome R. Corsi that will debut at the top of the New York Times bestseller list this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the book Friday, McCain replied: &quot;Gotta keep your sense of humor.&quot; A McCain aide later said he had misheard the question and thought it was about a television ad.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign was having none of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the smears piled up and the lies were exposed, John McCain spent six days in silence and on the seventh day said we should have a sense of humor,&quot; Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan said. &quot;John McCain's response to this discredited book speaks volumes -- he is a George Bush candidate running a Karl Rove campaign with a Dick Cheney sense of humor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Rogers, a McCain spokesman, declined to comment on the book. Aides said the Republican campaign has no intention of coming to Obama's defense on every attack they have no control over -- even though, in the past, McCain has ruled out certain kinds of attacks as inappropriate. In 2004, McCain denounced another Corsi book attacking Sen. John F. Kerry's service on a Swift boat in Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the new book, Corsi describes Obama as a left-wing radical driven by a black-power agenda who has &quot;extensive connections with Islam.&quot; Obama is a practicing Christian. His campaign has put out a 40-page rebuttal to the 304-page work, which the author said he wrote in the hopes of defeating Obama.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama finished up his Hawaii vacation with some bodysurfing. He also honored his deceased mother by tossing a white lei into the sea. At another point, Obama visited the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor with his wife, Michelle, and their two daughters. He took his family and some friends snorkeling at Hanauma Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost every day while Obama was gone, the Republican National Committee sent out an e-mail titled the &quot;Updated Obama Travel Guide&quot; -- mocking his two-hour basketball game, his picnic under a banyan tree and his rental of a large, oceanfront vacation home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the Obama campaign struck back with a mocking e-mail of its own. &quot;Breaking News Alert -- RNC attacks hamburgers, moviegoers and ice cream cones! Puppies and kittens feared to be next!&quot; the press release said. Listing a few examples of the Republican committee's e-mails, it continued: &quot;Apparently the folks at the RNC don't like eating cheeseburgers or ice cream with their families, and are not among the millions of Americans who enjoyed Batman.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">T. Boone Pickens, the oilman turned environmental crusader, met  Friday morning with McCain at the Aspen Institute, where he peddled his plan for energy independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a free flow of questions and answers,&quot; Pickens said afterward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less than two hours later, Pickens was the featured guest on a conference call with Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.), praising the Democrat's environmental work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who would have thought last year that T. Boone Pickens and Senator Harry Reid would be in a boat pulling that oar the same way?&quot; Reid joked on the call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Pickens both want to expand drilling off the U.S. coast to reduce reliance on foreign sources. Pickens is also a big proponent of alternative forms of energy, such as wind power. McCain has expressed support for renewable energy, but has also voted against tax credits that the young industries experts have deemed critical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the conference call with Reid, Pickens sang the praises of natural gas and urged greater use of nuclear power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Sen. John McCain posted the best fundraising month of his presidential campaign in July, bringing in $27 million, but his supporters are bracing for the near-certainty that he will be operating at a severe financial disadvantage in the two-month stretch between the end of the party political conventions and Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has spent more than three times as much as McCain to build a sprawling nationwide field operation and has television ads airing in twice as many states as his opponent -- including typically Republican strongholds such as Alaska and North Dakota. He is experimenting with some unorthodox approaches to reaching voters, such as a 30-minute infomercial that has aired on cable television in the middle of the night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anticipated financial mismatch is at least partly a result of McCain's decision to join the presidential public financing program. Under the rules governing the program, he will receive $84 million in federal money for his general-election campaign but must cease his fundraising efforts on Sept. 4, the day he is to accept his party's nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who opted out of the program, can continue to raise as much money as he can, relying largely on Internet donors who have on occasion demonstrated the ability to pump more than $2 million a day into the campaign's coffers. Obama has not released his July fundraising numbers yet, but in June he continued to raise substantially more than McCain, bringing in more than $50 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, McCain campaign manager Rick Davis told reporters he recognizes that &quot;we are in a different position financially than Barack Obama.&quot; But he said McCain's &quot;very healthy&quot; summer of fundraising will enable the Republican to maintain a strong position going into the final two months of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain finished July with $21 million in the bank, Davis said. The Republican National Committee raised an additional $26 million and finished the month with $75 million on hand -- money that can be spent during the general election to benefit McCain, but without the campaign's direct control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip A. Musser, a Republican political consultant who is helping raise money for the party, said McCain has already avoided a repeat of 1996, when President Bill Clinton used a huge financial advantage to dominate the airwaves all summer in his campaign against Republican Robert J.  Dole. McCain has spent $60 million on television ads this summer, a substantial chunk of which has gone to commercials aired during NBC's broadcast of the Olympic Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Musser said that while no campaign would choose to be outspent, most McCain supporters have come to terms with the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question is: When do you reach the law of diminishing returns?&quot; he said. &quot;We're talking about spending more than $80 million in 60 days. You get to a point where you hit your saturation point in your target states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Elmendorf, who served as deputy campaign manager for Sen. John F. Kerry's 2004 presidential bid, said he thinks that analysis amounts to little more than &quot;spin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a significant advantage,&quot; he said. &quot;The Obama campaign is going to be able to widen the playing field and put McCain on the defensive in states that he shouldn't have to be on the defensive in. Georgia, Montana, Alaska. McCain will either have to put resources there or have to face the potential of losing them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elmendorf noted that he speaks from experience. Four years ago on the Kerry campaign, he said, &quot;we had to make some tough calls in October. We pulled out of Missouri, West Virginia. These were tough calls. If we had the money, we would have tried.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama will also have the luxury of experimenting with technology. In Ohio, for instance, he has been running 15-second commercials telling potential voters that if they send his campaign a text message, they can receive a free bumper sticker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're going to have all those texts, so they can return to those people on Election Day with texts that say, 'Hey, go vote today,' &quot; said Evan Tracey of the Campaign Media Analysis Group. &quot;It's something you would do if you have money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracey said Obama may also be able to continue a practice he began during the Olympics, buying national advertisements during major sporting events, such as NFL football games or the baseball playoffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it will work remains an unknown. Brian Ballard, a Florida lobbyist who is raising money for McCain, said he has watched closely as Obama spent $7 million on commercials in his state while McCain has spent nothing on the Florida airwaves. Numbers there have narrowed slightly, according to local polls, but McCain has maintained his lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes having money brings an undisciplined campaign,&quot; Ballard said. &quot;Right now they're throwing money at wishes, not at reality. Frankly, I hope he keeps spending money here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain has so much spare cash on hand - he collected a record $27 million in July - that the Republican candidate plans to run campaign ads during the networks' coverage of the Democratic National Convention later this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Mr. McCain has agreed to accept $84 million in public financing for the general election, the presumptive presidential nominee has only until Sept. 4, when he accepts his party's nomination, to spend the more than $21 million he has on hand. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We continue to have record months of fundraising. This is now the fifth month in a row that we have exceeded the month before,&quot; said McCain campaign manager Rick Davis. The candidate's advertising budget for August is expected to exceed $20 million, he said, and, by the Republican convention, Mr. McCain is on track to spend some $60 million on TV advertising during the whole primary campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political strategists said airing ads during an opponent's convention makes sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain now has enough financial resources to break tradition and advertise during the opposition's convention week,&quot; said Republican strategist Scott Reed, who was campaign manager for former Sen. Bob Dole in his 1996 presidential run. &quot;The McCain camp is building a case about Obama's ability to lead and needs to keep the pressure on his weakness with voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh said the McCain campaign's strategy illustrates just how much presidential campaigns have changed. In past contests, one candidate went quiet while the other had his convention, and the strategist said she can't remember a candidate ever airing ads during the other's party convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ads are less an effort to get votes than make a point and get it covered by the national media while Obama has the attention of the nation,&quot; she said. &quot;No doubt the Obama campaign will do the same - now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama's campaign was staying mum on whether it would follow suit during the Republican convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't have a comment,&quot; spokesman Tommy Vietor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC), which can spend money right up until Election Day, pulled in $26 million in July and now has $75 million on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And despite media reports to the contrary, President Bush continues to be a fundraising juggernaut, having brought in $70 million for the RNC already this year and expected to bring in tens of millions more before Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When it comes to requests for the president to fundraise for Republican candidates, supply can't keep up with demand,&quot; White House press secretary Dana Perino said Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign, which almost fell apart last summer and had months of dismal fundraising receipts, was pleased with last month's tally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will start the general election fully flush,&quot; Mr. Davis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic National Committee, which had just $20 million on hand in June, plans to release its July totals Saturday. Mr. Obama also is expected to have collected tens of millions. In June, for instance, Mr. McCain raised $21 million, while Mr. Obama raised more than twice that - $52 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not counting July, Mr. Obama has raised a total of about $340 million to Mr. McCain's $140 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. McCain's once lackluster fundraising has changed dramatically. He is keeping pace and may even exceed his Democratic rival in advertising spending, including $6 million during the ultra-expensive Olympics and more millions for three straight months of commercials in 11 battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Davis pegged the advertising budget for September, October and the first few days of November at more than $100 million - including both the McCain team's publicly-financed campaign and similar spending by the RNC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain released two new TV ads on Friday in key states, including one in which he criticizes Mr. Obama on taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Celebrity? Yes. Ready to lead? No,&quot; the ad says, with the Democrats' name chanted in the background and pictures of him before adoring crowds. The commercial claims that &quot;Obama's new taxes could break your family budget,&quot; and would mean &quot;higher prices at the pump.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan said: &quot;This ad is just more of the same old, false and discredited attacks that Senator McCain knows aren't true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain also debuted an ad to run in Ohio, a battleground state, called; &quot;Maybe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe the applause has gone to his head, saying John McCain cost Ohio jobs, though it's just not true,&quot; the narrator says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's Obama's taxes that will hurt Ohio families. Higher taxes on your paycheck, your life savings, your electric bills. ... That's the real Obama Ready to tax. Not ready to lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, who claims 2 million donors to his campaign, has rejected public financing for the general election, the first major-party presidential candidate to do so. The Illinois senator has been spending robustly on television ads. In addition to a positive spot running during the Olympics, the Democrat is running several tough attacks on Mr. McCain's economic plan. He also is running state-specific ads.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats breathed a sigh of relief as Sen. Barack Obama returned from his weeklong Hawaiian vacation, happy that little had changed: the candidates remain neck and neck in national polls and the battleground states are still battlegrounds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some had feared that presumptive Republican nominee Sen. John McCain would spend the week meeting voters and reminding them that Mr. Obama was enjoying the islands but instead the Arizona senator held just one town-hall meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican participated in multiple fundraisers and private briefings and made himself available to the press for questions on the Russia-Georgia war, but he did not gain much in his week of having the mainland to himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest Gallup and Rasmussen tracking polls Friday are where they were last Friday - either tied or with Mr. Obama having a statistically insignificant lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain &quot;spent the week doing nothing,&quot; said Simon Rosenberg of the liberal think tank NDN. He compared the past week to what some called Mr. McCain's lackluster campaign schedule while Mr. Obama was locked in a fierce primary battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the election were held today, Obama would win comfortably, and John McCain has done nothing to alter that in the last two months,&quot; he said. &quot;The McCain people, for all their recent attacks, have not seen any evidence of movement in state or national polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the week, the ad war escalated, with the campaigns trading nasty back-and-forths on economic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the candidate's absence, the Obama campaign was able to generate headlines over the week. The team announced that Mr. Obama's vice presidential pick would be shared first with supporters via text message, an idea that prompted some mocking but will allow the campaign to collect valuable voter data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Team Obama also challenged Florida volunteers and organizers to make 50,000 calls this week, and they delivered, making 125,000 calls in 48 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign manager David Plouffe thanked Floridians on a conference call Thursday night, telling them, &quot;We will rise and fall together&quot; and saying the calls prove what the organization is capable of accomplishing in the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What you're doing is really going to be the recipe for victory,&quot; he said, adding the campaign &quot;will ask you to work harder than you know how.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the coming days, Mr. Obama will visit California, Nevada, New Mexico and Florida.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Browne, one of rock music's most famous activists for liberal causes, said he is incensed that the presumptive Republican presidential candidate has been using &quot;Running on Empty&quot; in campaign commercials, according to the singer-songwriter's attorney.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said the ad is not a McCain campaign ad but one put together by the Ohio Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Browne's attorney, Lawrence Y. Iser, said the suit is not politically motivated. &quot;It's a copyright infringement lawsuit ... but the fact that Senator McCain has used this song in a hit piece on Barack Obama is anathema to Jackson.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rocker  Jackson Browne is suing John McCain for using his song &quot;Running on Empty&quot; in a campaign ad, but McCain's spokesman says the ad was put together by the Ohio Republican Party, not the  campaign. Browne, a well-known activist for liberal causes, is &quot;incensed&quot; that his 1977 song is being used without permission in a  commercial that blasts Democrat Barack Obama, the Los Angeles Times reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, Browne, 59, filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against  McCain and the Republican National Committee in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting the use of the song, or any of his other compositions, as well as damages. McCain spokesman Brian Rogers told the Times that the campaign did not sponsor or produce the ad, but Browne's attorney, Lawrence Y. Iser, said they have the right defendants in their sights. &quot;We have sued the Ohio Republican Party as well, and we have been informed and believe that McCain and his campaign were well aware of the ad,&quot; Iser said. Browne declined to comment. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> No Charges Against Bale </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actor Christian Bale will not face charges related to an alleged assault on his mother and sister last month, prosecutors in London said yesterday, suggesting that their decision was based in part on Bale's family members' wishes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain's Crown Prosecution Service told the Associated Press that  insufficient evidence is available to afford a &quot;realistic prospect of conviction,&quot; and police were ordered not to take  further action in the case. In a statement, the service said that though it takes all domestic violence incidents seriously, &quot;it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British media had reported that Bale's mother and sister told police he assaulted them at the Dorchester Hotel on July 20, a day before attending the European premiere of his film &quot;The Dark Knight.&quot; Bale, 34, denied the allegations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York ruled Wednesday that heirs of John Steinbeck's widow, Elaine Steinbeck, are rightful owners of copyright to many of the novelist's best-known early works -- including &quot;Of Mice and Men,&quot; &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; and &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; -- dismissing ownership claims of the writer's biological heirs, the Los Angeles Times reports.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Jim McElhatton, THE WASHINGTON TIMES</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAGE ONE; A01</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1260 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a year before launching his White House campaign, Sen. John McCain wrote a letter urging the Bush administration to set aside tens of millions of dollars to build a new port of entry in Arizona to allow more trucks to cross the U.S.-Mexico border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five weeks after he joined the U.S. Senate, Sen. Barack Obama and other lawmakers from Illinois sent a letter to the administration in support of a grant proposal by the University of Chicago at a time when his wife was earning a six-figure salary at the university's medical center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letters from both presidential candidates, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, reveal a side of the budget process largely overshadowed by the &quot;earmarking&quot; practice that Mr. McCain frequently assails on the campaign trail. With increasing negativity surrounding earmarking, by which members of Congress slip pet projects into broader bills, lawmakers frequently push for projects in their home states by sending requests directly to federal agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such spending requests, sent privately to agencies, fall outside the public's view and don't achieve the sort of budget transparency that both presidential candidates have argued is essential for controlling spending. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's becoming more and more common as the subject of earmarking becomes more controversial,&quot; said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the nonpartisan Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides to Mr. McCain cite his $42 million request for the San Luis, Ariz., port of entry in the fiscal 2007 budget as an example of exactly how members of Congress should encourage federal money for worthy projects back home. The letter was sent after the project failed to receive funding in the fiscal 2006 budget. It won funding in 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator McCain encouraged, based on the merits, that the administration fund a project in the submission of its budget [that] would be subject to debate in the House and the Senate,&quot; McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers said. &quot;You make your case and let the regular order of the legislative process determine whether it's a national priority. That's precisely how the process is supposed to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that the General Services Administration (GSA) had requested the funding and that U.S. Customs and Border Protection listed the project as its highest priority for the southern border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Sloan said the request is still troubling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It may not technically be an earmark, but it certainly looks like an earmark,&quot; she said. &quot;He says he doesn't earmark, but then he sends a letter like this. When [the letter] says, 'I urge you to fully fund,' it looks like an earmark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Schatz, president of the nonprofit Citizens Against Government Waste, said Mr. McCain's letter doesn't meet the earmarking definition because it's a project for which the GSA had requested funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pete Sepp, vice president of the National Taxpayers Union, agreed, saying the request at some point would be subject to congressional hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is this an earmarked request? By most definitions, probably not,&quot; Mr. Sepp said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has disclosed hundreds of millions of dollars in earmark requests he has made since taking office in 2005, but he, too, sought support for home-state initiatives by writing letters. In February 2005, the junior senator signed a letter with several other lawmakers from Illinois to the Bush administration in support of the University of Chicago's request for a competitive multimillon-dollar grant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, Mr. Obama's wife was working as an executive for the University of Chicago Medical Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign said no conflict of interest arose because Mrs. Obama wasn't involved in the research grant, which eventually went to another institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Obama joined a bipartisan coalition of Illinois members of Congress led by [House] Speaker Dennis Hastert in requesting funding for a previously established biodefense center, one of only several that exists around the nation, that includes the University of Chicago and 13 other Midwestern institutions and is charged with preparing the region to combat an outbreak,&quot; said Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michelle Obama was not a lobbyist, and the medical center maintained a clear division between the personnel involved in community relations and federal government relations,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates support additional disclosure of such funding requests, aides said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sure, while additional disclosure is always good, it unfortunately will not stop government waste,&quot; Mr. Rogers said. &quot;Only a real leader like John McCain with the courage to veto all earmarks can do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. LaBolt said, &quot;Senator Obama has sponsored legislation that requires members of Congress to disclose their earmark requests, and he would support legislation that required members of Congress to disclose all of their funding requests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama-signed request called the University of Chicago &quot;the Midwest's leader in national biodefense and homeland security research efforts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The request wasn't the last time Mr. Obama sought federal money for the university system. Earlier this year, his campaign disclosed an old $1 million earmark request on behalf of the University of Chicago's medical center to build a new pavilion. Mr. Obama's campaign and the hospital have said Mrs. Obama wasn't involved and the earmark was denied. Officials also have pointed out that Mr. Obama has sought money for other hospitals in Illinois.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said he sees no conflict of interest if Mrs. Obama wasn't involved in the requests. Still, he said, the letter on behalf of the university's grant proposal raises questions about the general practice of elected officials weighing in on a competitive grant selection process, where an award is supposed to be decided on the scientific merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a little concerning,&quot; he said. &quot;Congress shouldn't be trying to influence a competitive award situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a reply to the Illinoisan lawmakers' request, the Office of Legislative Affairs for Homeland Security noted that the award process for the grant was &quot;highly competitive&quot; and the University of Chicago would receive the same consideration as other applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain aides have lambasted Mr. Obama on the subject of earmarks, saying the senator from Illinois has requested nearly $1 billion in earmarks since joining the Senate. Mr. McCain, meanwhile, &quot;has never requested an earmark,&quot; Mr. Rogers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the McCain letter, James Chessum, administrator of the Greater Yuma, Ariz., Port Authority, which oversees the project, said organizers turned to Mr. McCain and other members of Arizona's congressional delegation after the San Luis port project was not included in the 2006 budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He doesn't believe in earmarks, but we didn't feel like this was an earmark,&quot; Mr. Chessum said. &quot;It was basically a government request. It wasn't like us going in and saying, nobody wants this but us. The agencies agreed they needed it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We just wanted to make sure it stayed a priority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his letter to GSA Administrator Stephen Perry and Office of Management and Budget Director Joshua B. Bolten, Mr. McCain called funding for the project &quot;essential.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you prepare the administration's budget for fiscal 2007, I urge you to fully fund the San Luis commercial port of entry project along the Arizona-Mexico border,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also called the project &quot;an excellent opportunity to expedite travel and commerce across our southern border and improve our trade capabilities with our southern neighbors.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I DO HOPE John McCain still has Phil Gramm's number. He owes the former Texas senator an apology and maybe even a guest spot in his next &quot;Hot Chicks Dig Obama&quot; campaign commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been a month now since McCain's campaign gave its co-chairman the bum's rush for indelicately describing America as &quot;a nation of whiners&quot; who constantly grouse about how bad the economy is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've heard of mental depression,&quot; Gramm explained, slowly enough for all of us who don't have a doctorate in economics to understand. &quot;This is a mental recession.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who was presumably preoccupied with the early stages of formulating his innovative Barack-Obama-is-too-popular-to-win campaign strategy, chose not to defend his old friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, McCain declared that, by golly, the U.S. economy really is &quot;in shambles.&quot; And, as a point of clarification, he added, &quot;Phil Gramm does not speak for me. I speak for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, it turns out old Phil was right, sort of. The economy's not so bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth is, our stomachs are plump, our faces are smeared with chocolate, our lungs are filled with the satisfying cloud of toxic smoke, and all of us -- more or less -- are blotto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider the evidence, from a recent Associated Press report:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Cadbury PLC, the world's biggest confectionery company, reported a 7.3 percent boost in sales in the first half of the year. The sugar buzz extended to Hershey Co., which posted second-quarter increases in sales and profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Cigarette peddler Philip Morris International saw a 23 percent increase in earnings in the second quarter, and first-half profits were up 15 percent at British American Tobacco, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., the biggest brewer in the United States and maker of Budweiser, reported second-quarter profits. News was also good at Diageo PLC, the world's biggest producer and distributor of spirits, including familiar brands such as Johnnie Walker whiskey and Guinness stout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, it's true that these particular consumer products generally tend to fare well, even in bad times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yes, according to The AP, these so-called &quot;sin stocks&quot; benefited from increased sales in growing markets such as China and India. But it's clear we Americans are holding our own, too, thank you very much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So let's set aside, for the moment, all this whining about job losses, foreclosures, mortgage lender bailouts and Iraqi interest earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's hoist a few, take a long drag on a cigarette and accentuate the positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of wallowing in a mental recession, let's wallow in a little chocolate fondue, shall we?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I probably should note that all the &quot;sin stocks&quot; aren't thriving. The gambling and porn industries, it appears, have taken a hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's nothing a few congressional subsidies -- say, in the form of the &quot;What's Good for Vegas is Good for America Act&quot; -- cannot remedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So make that call, Sen. McCain. Tell Gramm you're sorry. And give the man a prominent role in your next ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe something along the lines of &quot;Hot Drunken Chicks With a Sweet Tooth and a Nagging Cough Dig Obama&quot;?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama released a new ad hitting Sen. John McCain on the economy Wednesday in 16 of the 18 states that the campaign has deemed battlegrounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama team, which is organizing and has offices in all 50 states, stressed that it is still running ads in both Georgia and Indiana, even though those red states were not treated to the new economy ad.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain holds a seven-point average lead in polls for Georgia, considered a Republican stronghold in previous cycles. The Obama campaign has targeted Georgia, which the Democrat captured during the primary, as competitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain is not advertising in Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Indiana, Mr. Obama holds a slim lead of less than 1 percent, according to an average tallied by RealClearPolitics. He was narrowly defeated there during the Democratic primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Team Obama released an Indiana-specific ad featuring two McCain quotes about the economy with voters from Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky disagreeing and stressing they are facing hard times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't believe we're headed into a recession,&quot; Mr. McCain said in January. In April, he said there has been &quot;great progress economically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrasting his statements are voters who say that the nation is &quot;absolutely in a recession&quot; and that &quot;the economy is in a rut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad closes with &quot;How can John McCain fix the economy, when he doesn't think it's broken?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 16-state economic ad attempts to tie the presumptive Republican nominee to President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It shows Mr. McCain smiling and notes that he supported Mr. Bush &quot;95 percent in 2007,&quot; and links his support for the Iraq war to the $10 billion spent there per month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The narrator promises that Mr. Obama will &quot;end the war responsibly&quot; and would end &quot;tax breaks for oil companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Team McCain pointed out in a statement that Mr. Obama voted for the Bush energy bill in 2005, which gave tax breaks to Big Oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the Senate, Barack Obama has voted in lockstep with President George W. Bush nearly half the time, including the Bush-Cheney Energy bill which gave close to $3 billion in new giveaways to Big Oil - a terrible policy that John McCain opposed,&quot; said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds. &quot;The truth is Barack Obama's plan is a job-killing machine that ignores the struggling economy and raises taxes on family savings, Social Security and small businesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was inevitable. Hillary Clinton is back, and she's John McCain's new, not-so-secret weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The McCain campaign unveiled Thursday the first and, his aides promised, not the last campaign ad touting Clinton's own words against</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama during the bitter primary season. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;Maverick&quot; ad, posted on McCain's campaign Web site, features half a dozen prominent Democrats, including Obama, making admiring comments about McCain. Clinton's comparison of the two men is the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I know Sen. McCain has a lifetime of experience to bring to the White House. And Sen. Obama has a speech he gave in 2002,&quot; Clinton said, referring to Obama's speech against the war in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Democratic National Committee rushed out a response ad - &quot;Maverick No More&quot; - featuring many of the same Democrats, including Clinton, saying that McCain has changed and now mirrors President Bush. The Democrats' ad ends with Bush endorsing McCain in the Rose Garden and shaking hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ronald Reagan's Eleventh Commandment - &quot;Thou shalt not speak ill of any Republican&quot; - never caught on with Democrats. Clinton wasn't intentionally giving McCain campaign fodder, but everybody knew her words would haunt the Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it could get better for McCain. Clinton also wants to give her supporters a cathartic experience at the Democratic National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SHE SAYS SHE wants them to have a voice and vent their feelings. She isn't ruling out putting her name in nomination for president at the convention. And, talking with her supporters, she leaves open the possibility she could still be Obama's running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I know from just what I'm hearing that there's incredible pent-up desire. And I think that people want to feel like, 'OK, it's a catharsis, we're here, we did it, and then everybody get behind Sen. Obama.' That is what most people believe is the best way to go,&quot; she said at a California fundraiser last week. The video is posted on YouTube.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama understandably is less than enthralled with the notion of convention as catharsis. He probably hoped after all the talk of unity that Democrats would go to Denver unified behind him. The point of the four-day confab is to spotlight the party's presidential nominee and put him forward to voters for the fall campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The last thing Obama or Democrats who want to win in November need is a series of images in the news (and in future McCain ads) of disappointed and angry Clinton supporters getting in touch with their true feelings about the man who defeated their woman for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here's Obama on his campaign plane Thursday, trying to tamp down some of the psychobabble: &quot;I don't think we're looking for catharsis. I think what we're looking for is energy and excitement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clinton and Obama put out a joint statement that they're working together to make sure her supporters are respected at the convention. He has offered her a prime-time speech Tuesday night, Aug. 26, on the 88th anniversary of women's suffrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But she says she's negotiating with the Obama campaign about her convention role. Presumably that includes her husband, who is still working through his issues. Bill Clinton can't quite say Obama is qualified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KATE SNOW of ABC News asked the former president in an interview during his Africa trip if Obama was qualified to be president. Clinton sidestepped, making the accurate but beside-the-point observation that the Constitution sets the qualifications for president, and the people decide their preference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You could argue that nobody's ever qualified to be president,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama, Clinton said, is running a good campaign. Obama can inspire, motivate, and energize. He's &quot;smart as a whip,&quot; Clinton said, and, damning with faint praise, &quot;There's nothing he can't learn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clinton allowed that he'd had a lot to learn when he became president. This hardly is the man Obama needs to have whispering into his vice president's ear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama is taking a week off for vacation in Hawaii, which is good timing for him. After the wall-to-wall news coverage of all things Obama, it was only a matter of time until voters rebelled. The Pew Research Center reports that nearly half the people - 48 percent - surveyed say they've been hearing too much about Obama lately. And that was in early August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his ABC News interview, Clinton insisted that he was enjoying his post-presidency and wasn't panting to go back to the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You have to live in the moment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sound advice, but it's hard for Bill and Hillary Clinton to accept that this isn't their moment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Jesse Washington</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Associated Press</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The year was 1984, and the state was Iowa. A white man who had just voted walked out of his precinct caucus and saw the Rev. Jesse Jackson standing outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did all I could,&quot; the man told Jackson ruefully, &quot;but I just couldn't bring myself to pull the lever and vote for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">L. Douglas Wilder laughs as he relates the story Jackson once told him, the sting eased by time and Wilder's vantage point as the nation's first elected black governor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now it's a quarter of a century later, and the man everyone's talking about is Barack Obama, the Illinois senator holding a slim lead in many polls. But can the polls be trusted? A central question about race and politics hasn't changed since 1984: Do white people lie - to pollsters or even to themselves - about their willingness to vote for black candidates?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the not-so-distant past, the consensus was a clear yes. Today, however, there is widespread disagreement about whether Obama is subject to the predicament known as the Wilder or Bradley Effect - whether, in the privacy of the voting booth, white people will actually pull the lever for the first black man to come within shouting distance of the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that surveys can have trouble uncovering the truth about many things besides race, plus the massive technological, demographic and cultural changes in play, this question is contributing to an almost unprecedented air of uncertainty surrounding this year's polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1989, Wilder polled as many as 15 percentage points ahead in the days before the election for Virginia governor, but squeaked into office by 6,700 votes. The phenomenon was first noted in 1982, when Tom Bradley endured a stunning defeat in the California governor's race after exit polls indicated he was the winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason for these disparities? A significant amount of white people did not admit that race played a role in their voting decision, pollsters and academics say. Another factor: When the person asking the questions was black, respondents were more likely to say they favored the black candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the recent Democratic primary, exit polls in 28 states overstated Obama's actual share of the final vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center, doesn't think people are lying to pollsters today about their support for Obama, &quot;because I don't think there's a lot of stigma in saying you're voting for John McCain.&quot; Kohut said it's not like polls are asking, &quot;Do you want to vote for the white guy or the black guy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he did see potential for error based on the people who decline to participate in polls, whom he describes as largely lower-income whites more likely than the population at large to have racially intolerant views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The real frailty of our polls is that we get very high refusal rates ,&quot; Kohut said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So are current polls accurate? &quot;I don't know,&quot; Kohut said, &quot;and to be honest with you, this is something every pollster I know is concerned about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilder, now the mayor of Richmond, said his internal polls during the governor's race showed it to be much closer than most people thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was clear that people were having the first opportunity to vote for an African American, and there was uncertainty,&quot; he said. &quot;You know, 'Is he going to be fair, is he just going to look out for his own people? And who are his own people?' I think we've come a great distance from that. I've seen the progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So is Wilder ready to bury the Wilder Effect?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, I won't say that,&quot; he said with a laugh. &quot;I won't go that far.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel J. Hopkins will. The Harvard University postdoctoral fellow examined data from 133 gubernatorial and Senate elections from 1986 to 2006 and concluded that the effect vanished in the early 1990s as racially divisive issues such as crime and welfare reform receded from the national stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopkins said race could play a larger role if it is injected into the campaign as it often is in waning days of close contests involving black candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days before the 2006 Senate election in Tennessee, with polls showing the race almost deadlocked, Republicans released an ad featuring a ditzy blond actress saying she met Harold Ford Jr. at the Playboy Club and asking the black Democrat to &quot;call me.&quot; Ford lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1990's tight North Carolina Senate contest, Republican Jesse Helms was running about even with Democrat Harvey Gantt when he released an ad showing white hands crumpling a job rejection letter as a narrator mentioned racial quotas. Helms won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blacks, too, have sought to use race to their political advantage: In a congressional primary this month in Memphis, a black challenger tried to link the incumbent, Steve Cohen, to the Ku Klux Klan. Cohen won easily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Obama may face some of these historical hurdles, there are other, unprecedented factors at work: a presidential instead of statewide election, a spike in black voters and the increase in young voters who are more racially tolerant, watch more YouTube than television and eschew the land telephone lines used by most polls.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If John McCain's campaign operatives were looking for strategic advice for the fall campaign against Barack Obama, they could click on the Atlantic Monthly's Web site. There they would find a raft of memos from Mark J. Penn, Hillary Rodham Clinton's chief strategist, outlining possible ways to try to defeat the presumptive Democratic nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The memos, dug up by the enterprising Joshua Green and accompanying an article chronicling the demise of Clinton's campaign, are drawing attention in large measure for what they reveal about her operation's dysfunction. They are equally revealing for what they say about the direction Penn wanted to take Clinton's message and the risks inherent for McCain if he and his campaign were to pursue the same path. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penn was always the biggest hawk in Clinton's campaign, always the one who advocated going negative against Obama. The day after the senator from New York won primaries in Ohio and Texas, Penn called for drawing a sharp contrast with Obama along the following lines:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is just words and she is a lifetime of action. . . . She is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isn't, and whose background you are beginning to wonder about. She has brought real results and even his words today are in doubt, invented for a campaign. Ultimately he cannot win against John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's campaign, he argued, &quot;must now in earnest show that their image of Obama Camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter-patter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the day on March 30, he wrote an even more pointed memo. He argued that Obama needed to be &quot;vetted&quot; on the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., his former pastor; on his ties to the corrupt Tony Rezko; and on his record in the Illinois legislature and the U.S. Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does anyone believe it is possible to win the nomination without, over these two months, raising all these issues against him?&quot; Penn wrote. &quot;A 'nice' campaign that wins the states alone that can be won -- will that be enough or do serious issues have to raised about him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of these were new positions for Penn. A year earlier, on March 19, 2007, he portrayed Obama as lacking roots in basic American values and as being a phony -- although he was more tentative on how the campaign ought to approach those topics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penn was particularly struck by what he called &quot;a very strong weakness&quot; in Obama -- &quot;His roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited. I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and in his values.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then he worried about how the Clinton campaign could draw a contrast on this without sounding negative. &quot;We are never going to say anything about his background -- we have to show the value of ours when it comes to making decisions, understanding the needs of most Americans -- the invisible Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penn's solution? &quot;Let's explicitly own 'American' in our programs, the speeches and the values. He doesn't,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Make this a new American Century, the American Strategic Energy fund. Let's use our logo to make some flags we can give out. Let's add flag symbols to the backgrounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's campaign never did quite become the flag-waving, patriotic operation that Penn envisioned in March 2007, nor did she ever go as overtly negative as he was preaching in March and April 2008. Would she be the nominee if she had? And can McCain win the presidency if he -- carefully -- pursues a similar path?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's risk, often cited by Penn's opponents inside the campaign, was that attacking Obama directly would only heighten negative impressions of her. She carried plenty of baggage as a polarizing politician; taking on Obama would have added to that baggage. Others in Clinton's high command preferred to portray her as more human. They did not think she needed to look more like a warrior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, the McCain campaign, presumably unknowingly, adopted some of Penn's provocative 2007 playbook with an ad that talked about the presumptive GOP nominee as &quot;the American president Americans have been waiting for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was even less subtle in invoking a cultural-values argument against Obama than Penn's suggestion to Clinton that she always tell audiences she was &quot;born in the middle of America&quot; and to talk about &quot;the deeply American values you grew up with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, the most provocative of Penn's memos posted by the Atlantic -- the one that talks about Obama's lack of roots in American values -- went nowhere. &quot;I don't remember there being a real discussion about this,&quot; Howard Wolfson, who was the campaign's communications director and who often differed with Penn on strategy, said yesterday. &quot;It was universally rejected, and in fairness to Mark, I don't think Mark pushed it. . . . It's one of those things people heard and said, 'That's not a good idea.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign appears to have less hesitation than Clinton's did in going after Obama. For the past few weeks, it has run a series of negative ads -- some humorous, some not so -- that portray Obama as a famous but empty suit who is wrong on many of the issues Americans care most about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads, at a minimum, may be getting under Obama's skin. It's possible they are doing real damage. Penn seems to believe that, based on what he wrote for the Politico. &quot;Fair or not, as advertising it did its job,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just how far McCain's campaign will pursue this strategy isn't clear. There are risks for him, just as there were for Clinton. Obama has proven over this long campaign to be a difficult target to hit -- at least on anything more than an occasional basis. So the mileage may be limited long term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More fundamentally, McCain risks damaging his reputation as a politician who has eschewed the politics of negativity. But what was considered out of bounds in a Democratic primary campaign may be less so in a general-election race, in which other voters come into play. McCain will have to make some difficult judgments about this in the final 82 days.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the latest Internal Revenue Service data, $706 billion of pass-through business income was reported in 2006. Of this, two-thirds was earned in households making more than $250,000 -- households on which Obama has said he will raise taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If raising the tax rate on two-thirds of small-business income isn't a tax hike on small business, what is?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax rate on two-thirds of small-business income would skyrocket under the Obama plan. The current tax rate on this income is 37.9 percent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama has a problem. He really, really doesn't want this campaign to be about race. He wants it to be about change, President Bush, the economy, gas prices, Iraq, Afghanistan -- almost anything else. But it is going to be about race, at least in part. That's the lesson of recent weeks, when the McCain campaign brought up race (on the pretext that Obama had brought it up first). The Obama campaign tried desperately to change the subject but couldn't. Once the chum was in the water, the media sharks went wild.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama should take that as a warning. Race will be central to this campaign because McCain needs it to be. He simply doesn't have many other cards to play. And it will be central because every time Republicans light the match, the press will create a forest fire. Race is just too titillating to ignore. The history of post-Vietnam presidential elections is littered with Democratic nominees who thought they could run on policy and ignore symbolism. This year, the symbolism will be largely racial. Obama can't avoid that. He needs to control the race debate instead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, there is reason to believe that race is weighing Obama down. A survey this year by CBS and the New York Times found that 94 percent of respondents would vote for a black presidential candidate. But when asked if &quot;most people&quot; would, the number dropped to 71 percent. Notre Dame political scientist David Leege estimates that 17 to 19 percent of white Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents will resist voting for Obama because he is black. That's far more than the percentage of Republicans who may vote for Obama because he is black. And it's a major reason that this election -- despite Obama's myriad advantages -- remains close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To blow it open, Obama needs to bring Leege's number down. That may be possible, because even racists can be wooed. Think about it this way: Many of the voters who right now won't vote for Obama because he's black would probably vote for Colin Powell even though he's black. That's because they don't see Powell as a racial redistributionist, a guy who  would favor his community at their expense. There's no rational reason to believe Obama would, either. But because, unlike Powell, Obama is a liberal Democrat who enjoys overwhelming black support, that's what many racially hostile white voters assume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For these voters, Obama can't make race go away by ignoring it, especially because the GOP and the media won't. He needs to acknowledge their fears and do something dramatic to assuage them. Paradoxically, his best shot at deracializing the campaign is to explicitly make race an issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He can do that with a high-profile speech -- and maybe a TV ad -- calling for the replacement of race-based preferences with class-based ones. That would confront head-on white fears that an Obama administration would favor minorities at whites' expense. It would be a sharper, more dramatic, way of making the point that Obama has made ever since he took the national stage (but which some whites still refuse to believe): that he represents not racial division but national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the merits, there's a lot to say for class-based affirmative action. Over the decades, racial preferences have played a vital role in creating a black middle class, but that middle class is now large and self-perpetuating. It is the multi-generational poor -- whether urban and black or Appalachian and white -- who truly need a boost today. And that's what Obama himself seems to believe. Arguing that his own daughters shouldn't benefit from affirmative action, he told the Chronicle of Higher Education last year that &quot;we should take into account white kids who have been disadvantaged and have grown up in poverty and shown themselves to have what it takes to succeed.&quot; Some of the parents of those white kids fear voting for Obama because they think they'll lose out. If they knew Obama's views, they might change their mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race isn't going away as a factor in American life, of course. But the defining American problem of the 21st century may not be the &quot;color line,&quot; as W.E.B. Du Bois  suggested about the 20th. In an age of growing multiculturalism and growing economic inequality, it may be the class line instead. By calling for a different kind of affirmative action, Obama could acknowledge that profound change -- and help propel himself to the White House at the same time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">YORK, Pa. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain reminded Pennsylvanians Tuesday that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama said the state's small-town voters &quot;cling to guns and religion&quot; because they are &quot;bitter,&quot; a gaffe that possibly contributed to Mr. Obama's loss in the state primary and might haunt his general election campaign in this battleground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain told a town hall meeting that this state's voters are the &quot;heartland,&quot; and &quot;beam of hope and liberty for everyone in the world.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His reprise of the &quot;bitter&quot; flap - an off-the-cuff remark made by Mr. Obama at a private fundraising event in San Francisco prior to Pennsylvania's April primary - harkened back to Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's successful campaign in the state. She won the Democratic primary by a 9-point margin, largely by appealing to the state's more conservative rural voters on issues such as gun rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign respondedby directing attention to its radio ad that debuted Tuesday in York to coincide with Mr. McCain's visit. The ad highlights Mr. McCain's opposition to &quot;buy American&quot; laws that would have required the government purchase American-made products such as motorcycles from York-based Harley-Davidson, which recently cut 300 jobs due to an economic downturn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator McCain should spend less time attacking Senator Obama and more time explaining to voters why he opposed requiring the government to buy American-made motorcycles, legislation he called 'disgraceful,'&quot; Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's stump speech, delivered to about 4,000 people at the York Expo Center's Toyota Arena, also echoed the Clinton campaigns' claims that she was the underdog in the race but was better qualified than Mr. Obama of Illinois to serve as commander in chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love being the underdog,&quot; Mr. McCain said, adding that Pennsylvania could decide the presidential election if the race is as close as expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania is considered a swing state but it has not elected a Republican president since Ronald Reagan. In 2004, Democrat John Kerry narrowly beat President Bush in the state by about a 2.5-point margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With seven visits to Pennsylvania so far during the campaign, Mr. McCain signaled he is determined to put the state in play this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He strode off the &quot;Straight Talk Express&quot; campaign bus at the event flanked by former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, who also formerly served as Department of Homeland Security secretary, and Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent Democrat who crossed party lines to endorse Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lieberman said the choice confronting voters could not be more clear &quot;between one candidate, John McCain, who has experience, been tested in war and tried in peace [and] another candidate who has not ... between one candidate who is a talker and the other candidate who is the leader our country needs&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain of Arizona, a former Navy fighter pilot who was shot down in the Vietnam War and spent five years in a prison camp, said he is a battle-tested leader prepared to face unexpected crises such as the Russian invasion of Georgia last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, who is vacationing in Hawaii demanded Tuesday that Russia immediately sign and implement a cease-fire deal. &quot;Now is the time for action - not just words,&quot; Mr. Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. McCain contrasted himself with Mr. Obama, who called for a U.S. retreat from the Iraq war and opposed the troop-surge strategy backed by Mr. McCain that proved successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We live in a dangerous world. We live in a world where we are not sure what's going to happen ... and it is hard to see around the corner of history,&quot; he said &quot;But I have been in wars. I know how to win wars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He continued: &quot;I hate war. No one hates war more than the veteran, because no one feels more deeply the loss a comrade than a veteran, so I will at the end of four years, bring the peace to America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain vowed that most U.S. forces will leave Iraq within his first term as president because the war is being won as a result of the counterinsurgency strategy implemented by Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, U.S. commander in Iraq and author of the troop-surge plan that tamped down the country's rampant violence this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have succeeded, it's not that we are succeeding, we have succeeded and we are winning,&quot; he said. &quot;And we have other challenges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The declaration of success in Iraq was punctuated by rousing applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is one of the big differences between myself and Senator Obama,&quot; he said, noting that Mr. Obama voted against funding the troops. &quot;Senator Obama said the surge ... wouldn't work, couldn't work and, incredibly, still fails to acknowledge that the surge succeeded&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How did things look on the inside, as they unraveled?&quot; Joshua Green writes in the Atlantic magazine, referring to Hillary Rodham Clinton's failure to win the Democratic presidential nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To find out, I approached a number of current and former Clinton staffers and outside consultants and asked them to share memos, e-mails, meeting minutes, diaries - anything that would offer a contemporaneous account. The result demonstrates that paranoid dysfunction breeds the impulse to hoard. Everything from major strategic plans to [catty] staff e-mail feuds was handed over. (See for yourself: much of it is posted online at www.theatlantic.com /clinton),&quot; Mr. Green said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two things struck me right away. The first was that, outward appearances notwithstanding, the campaign prepared a clear strategy and did considerable planning. ... </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The second was the thought:Wow, it was even worse than I'd imagined! The anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved Beltway wise men. Surprisingly, Clinton herself, when pressed, was her own shrewdest strategist, a role that had never been her strong suit in the White House. But her advisers couldn't execute strategy; they routinely attacked and undermined each other, and Clinton never forced a resolution. Major decisions would be put off for weeks until suddenly she would erupt, driving her staff to panic and misfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Above all, this irony emerges: Clinton ran on the basis of managerial competence - on her capacity, as she liked to put it, to 'do the job from Day One.' In fact, she never behaved like a chief executive, and her own staff proved to be her Achilles' heel. What is clear from the internal documents is that Clinton's loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make. Her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clooney and Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The London Daily Mail reports that Hollywood actor George Clooney communicates with Barack Obama almost every day by phone or e-mail, and is advising the Democratic presidential candidate on Mideast policy and on honing his image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper cited unnamed &quot;Democratic Party insiders&quot; and anonymous friends of Mr. Clooney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper quoted one party insider as saying, &quot;George has been giving him advice on things such as presentation, public speaking and body language and he also e-mails him constantly about policy, especially the Middle East. George is pushing him to be more 'balanced' on issues such as U.S. relations with Israel. George is pro-Palestinian. And he is also urging Barack to withdraw unconditionally from Iraq if he wins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The source said they &quot;text and e-mail each other almost every day and speak on the phone at least a couple of times a week, often more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Clooney last week announced that he is making a movie about the lawyer who defended Osama bin Laden's former driver, Salim Hamdan, on terrorism charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign coverage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So much for John McCain's hope that remaining on the campaign trail this week while Barack Obama vacations in Hawaii would lead to more or friendlier coverage,&quot; the Media Research Center's Brent Baker writes at www.mrc.org.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At least not on Monday night when Katie Couric highlighted how 'Obama put out a tongue-in-cheek response to Senator McCain's celebrity ad' and she helpfully pointed out: 'The ad also features six different shots of Senator McCain next to President Bush.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Later, CBS allocated more than three minutes to a 'CBS News Exclusive' interview and profile by Couric of 'Barack Obama's brain,' Valerie Jarrett, who 'just may be the most powerful woman in Chicago besides Oprah.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ABC centered an entire piece around revelations Hillary Clinton campaign operatives planned to 'question Obama's authenticity as an American. She rejected that strategy,' yet ABC managed to twist the story into Obama victimization as anchor Charles Gibson fretted: 'There are indications that John McCain may be adopting it now.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reporter Jake Tapper warned 'some say that John McCain has tried to subtly portray Obama as not quite American enough, playing up Obama's popularity abroad.' Tapper ominously concluded: 'ABC News has learned that an independent conservative group has been filming in Indonesia where Obama spent a few years during his childhood. So even if Senator McCain does not draw attention to that unusual quality of Obama's youth, someone will.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate showdown</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Tom Coburn, Oklahoma Republican, &quot;is ready for a showdown with the Senate ethics committee,&quot; Betsy Newmark writes at www. realclearpolitics.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At issue is his practice as an obstetrician. When he became senator he had to give up charging for delivering babies because senators are not allowed outside income. But Coburn has continued and is just not charging the women. He is paying his own malpractice insurance himself,&quot; said the writer, who blogs at betsyspage.blogspot.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem that the ethics committee has is that the hospital where he delivers the babies is a for-profit hospital and Senate rules forbid such potential conflicts of interest. Coburn, who is one tough guy, is willing to bring the whole issue out into the public and force a vote on whether he should be penalized for delivering babies for free even if the hospital he does it at is trying to make a profit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without a prayer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Focus on the Family Action pulled a video from its Web site Monday that asked people to pray for &quot;rain of biblical proportions&quot; during Barack Obama's Aug. 28 appearance at Denver's Invesco Field at Mile High to accept the Democratic nomination for president, the Rocky Mountain News reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stuart Shepard, director of digital media at Focus Action, the political arm of Focus on the Family, wrote and starred in the video. He said it was meant to be &quot;mildly humorous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But complaints from about a dozen Focus members persuaded the organization to pull the video, said Tom Minnery, Focus Action vice president of public policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If people took it seriously, we regret it,&quot; Mr. Minnery said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One would think the fundamental rights of conscience could be a common-ground First Amendment issue, yet anticipated Health and Human Services regulations to implement longstanding federal conscience-protection laws for health care workers have met with fierce debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her op-ed &quot;A harmful reversal&quot; (Aug. 3), Cristina Page of BirthControlWatch.org disparaged &quot;the few extremists [who] want to impose their deeply unpopular doctrine on the many.&quot; But the real question is: In opposing conscience protection, whose doctrine is being imposed on whom?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pro-choice&quot; advocacy groups like BirthControlWatch.org and Planned Parenthood are &quot;pro-coercion&quot; in denying the rights of doctors and nurses to follow their own consciences. If abortion is a &quot;choice between a woman and her doctor,&quot; don't doctors have the right to choose not to participate? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far from constraining women's choices, the regulations could broaden their access to options, as professionals would not be forced to leave the practice of medicine because of their moral and religious convictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health care professionals deserve protection from coerced participation in destroying nascent human lives. Secretary Michael Leavitt and the administration should be applauded for seeking to defend providers from such unjust discrimination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parenting column gives bad advice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have long taken issue with John Rosemond's Parenting column (Extra section). His responses inevitably devolve into repetitive rants about the 1960s, liberalism, self-expression and his favorite target, working mothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then waxes nostalgic about the 1950s, strictness and the virtues of his own mother. The decidedly political and misogynistic bent of his columns has no place in parenting advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His bizarre vitriol for all things related to the 1960s is unprofessional and tiresome, and the massive chip he carries on his shoulder can lead to terrible advice. In a recent column about misbehaving twins, Rosemond advocates group punishment. He cites his own first-grade class, in which the teacher used such a policy, resulting in the students &quot;policing one another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From my own experience, I can vouch for the fact that group punishment leads only to a resentful, toxic environment for both children and the authority. And I don't view vigilante children as an effective solution or as part of an ideal kindergarten class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, treating twins as one person guarantees problems. But Rosemond's fetish for authoritarianism practically guarantees unsound advice with a not-so-well-hidden agenda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editorial's claims defy belief</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Oil on the campaign trail,&quot; Aug. 6 editorial:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's statement that &quot;properly inflated tires and tuned-up engines could immediately save as much oil as offshore drilling would generate even at peak production in 20 years&quot; is beyond belief. In your haste to cover for this man's ignorance, you have also displayed your own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surely you cannot believe this, but you had to compound the problem by saying, &quot;He's wrong. Those simple steps would save even more, some analysts say.&quot; You owe it to your readers to print the names and credentials of your analysts or this is no longer ignorance. It is then deceit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My analysts tell me that 80 percent of cars have properly inflated tires and, starting in the mid-'80s and totally since the mid-'90s, automobiles are continually being tuned for efficiency by their computers. Also, your statement that offshore drilling is &quot;risky and unproven&quot; is totally false. These are statements that come from talking points and not from a thinker.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salem</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you love America, vote for Republicans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans in Congress were trying recently to craft an energy bill that would allow oil exploration and drilling off America's coasts. This would have an almost immediate effect on bringing down gas prices. But Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi refused to let Republicans speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She ordered the lights and microphones turned off, and the Democrats left town for the scheduled five-week congressional vacation. We should remember this outrage on Election Day and realize the last thing America needs is more Democrats in Washington.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ERIE, Pa. -- Sen. John McCain began a two-day Pennsylvania swing Monday, accompanied by Tom Ridge, but there were conflicting signs about how serious a vice presidential contender the former governor and onetime  homeland security secretary might be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some reporters initially received a copy of the day's schedule with a cryptic notation about Ridge and the No. 2 spot. The schedules were quickly retrieved, with the explanation that the note was just a reminder to McCain and his staff that reporters were likely to ask about the topic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the morning, the candidate himself talked about Ridge -- but not exactly in terms that gave the impression that the Pennsylvanian would be right down the hall in a McCain administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by a questioner at an event at GE Transportation's Erie plant what McCain would focus on during his first 90 days as president, he said he'd &quot;call Tom Ridge to Washington from wherever he's vacationing&quot; and put him to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's plant tour allowed him to touch on twin themes of energy and globalization. GE chairman and chief executive Jeff Immelt, who introduced McCain, said about half of the more energy-efficient locomotives built at the plant would be exported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the McCain campaign headed to Harrisburg, the plane departed from Tom Ridge Field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --  Robert Barnes <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">WAR AND PEACEFUL </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">Obama Talks Georgia On Hawaii Vacation </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama interrupted a family vacation Monday to address the exploding conflict between Russia and Georgia , saying he had spoken to Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili to convey &quot;my deep regret over the loss of life and the suffering of the people of Georgia.&quot; Like John McCain, Obama called for &quot;active international engagement&quot; to address the dispute, &quot;including a high-level and neutral international mediator, and a genuine international peacekeeping force -- not simply Russian troops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Democratic candidate's brief public appearance was an aberration in an otherwise quiet week on the island where Obama spent much of his childhood. The Honolulu Star-Bulletin ran photos of the senator walking in the surf with Chicago friend Marty Nesbitt and waving to onlookers after a golf outing. It reported that he had jogged barefoot on Kailua Beach and, with his wife and daughters, delivered a gift basket to his grandmother. According to the paper, Obama is staying in a private beachfront home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He sketched out his plans at a 4,000-person rally on the first day: &quot;I'm going to get a plate lunch. I might go to Zippy's. I might go to Rainbow Drive-In. I haven't decided yet. Get some Zip Min. I'm going to go get some shave ice. I'm going to go body surfing at an undisclosed location. I'm going to see my tutu -- my grandma -- and I'm going to watch my girls play on the beach, and once in a while I might go into the water. But mostly I'm going to watch them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's presence caused a stir everywhere he showed up,&quot; the paper reported, but one prominent resident wasn't impressed -- Hawaii Gov. Linda Lingle (R). &quot;This is not  'American Idol,' &quot; the McCain supporter said of the choice facing voters this year, according to the article. &quot;This is making an important decision on who should lead our nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --  Shailagh Murray <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">WHO'S THE CELEBRITY? </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">Obama Hits Back With Ad on Lobbyists </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hitting back at attacks from the McCain campaign labeling him a &quot;celebrity,&quot; the Obama campaign began airing a new ad, &quot;Embrace,&quot; on national cable TV Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For decades, he's been Washington's biggest celebrity,&quot; the ad's announcer says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as Washington embraced him, John McCain hugged right back. The lobbyists -- running his low-road campaign. The money -- billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies, but almost nothing for families like yours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is seen with David Letterman, Jay Leno and the ladies of &quot;The View.&quot; But he is also seen embracing President Bush several times -- images consistent with previous Obama and Democratic-funded advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ad comes as some Democrats have worried that the Obama campaign has not responded strongly enough to McCain's recent attacks, both in ads and on the stump.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with the agreed guidelines, both candidates should pledge, in writing and on air, that if other groups -- not officially part of the campaigns -- run commercials that violate the rules, the candidate will go on television to renounce the ads and rebuke the groups that run them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama's camp on Monday depicted Sen. John McCain as a &quot;lurching&quot; lobbyist lover using &quot;old&quot; Washington politics, a harsh response to his Republican rival's &quot;celebrity&quot; ad that a new poll shows may actually help Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Fox 5/Washington Times/Rasmussen Reports poll found that 84 percent of adults think the presidential hopefuls are running negative ads, and 44 percent of them said the ads have made them more likely to vote for Mr. Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad, called &quot;Embrace,&quot; shows Mr. McCain hugging President Bush and features six images of the Republican with the unpopular president. It uses the word &quot;old&quot; twice while showing images of the 71-year-old candidate, while the word &quot;old&quot; appears on the screen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama spot also portrays a group walking with Mr. McCain as &quot;the lobbyists running his low-road campaign,&quot; even though no one in the shot is registered as a lobbyist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For decades, he's been Washington's biggest celebrity,&quot; the narrator says as the screen flashes shots of Mr. McCain receiving a rousing welcome while appearing on popular TV shows such as &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;The View.&quot; Mr. Obama has been on both shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a shot of Mr. Bush kissing Mr. McCain on the head, the narrator says, &quot;And as Washington embraced him, John McCain hugged right back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign brushed off the Obama&nbsp;ad and posted a Web ad of its own that portrayed the Democrat as an inexperienced rock star that &quot;hot chicks dig.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is well-known for a lifetime of service to America and his record of fighting to reform Washington, while Barack Obama is simply a worldwide celebrity,&quot; said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Obama spokesman did not respond to a request seeking clarification on the image used to portray Mr. McCain's ties to lobbyists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shot that suggests that Mr. McCain is walking with &quot;lobbyists&quot; who are &quot;running&quot; his campaign is a bit off message, because the six people shown are the candidate; two Secret Service agents; economic adviser Meg Whitman of eBay fame; Greg Wendt, an investment manager who volunteers for the senator; and traveling press aide Brooke Buchanan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats have mounted an offensive against top McCain aides Charlie Black and Rick Davis, whose lobbying efforts have become a campaign issue. But those men are nowhere to be seen in the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic National Committee pushed Web ads that tie Mr. McCain and his advisers to job losses in Ohio, labeling him &quot;Job Killing John.&quot; The Obama-backing AFL-CIO labor union group mailed fliers to 100,000 Ohio voters this week urging voters to call on Mr. McCain to fire Mr. Davis for his lobbying role in shipper DHL's plan to move jobs from Ohio overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad follows several attempts by the McCain team to portray Mr. Obama as a vapid megastar unqualified to lead the nation. One ad, showing the Democrat along with Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, became a YouTube sensation and prompted Miss Hilton to hit back with her own tongue-in-cheek response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the &quot;Celebrity&quot; ad went viral on the Internet, national polls tightened to show the race neck and neck. It's debatable whether the polls reflect the negative ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rasmussen poll released Monday showed that Mr. McCain's attacks seemed to be helping Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll showed that 41 percent think Mr. McCain has run negative ads while 17 percent think Mr. Obama has run them, and 26 percent said both have gone negative. Of that group, 44 percent said the ads make them &quot;more likely to vote for&quot; Mr. Obama, while 24 percent said the same for Mr. McCain. Another 24 percent said the ads had no impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign manager David Plouffe sent supporters a fundraising e-mail on Monday reprising a theme used after the &quot;Celebrity&quot; ad first aired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain and the Republican National Committee are trying to convince you that you've been swept up and tricked into wanting change,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While supporters like you are out knocking on doors, registering new voters and organizing in your local communities, our opponents are not even trying to match your efforts,&quot; he said. &quot;Instead, they're spending millions to spread the smear that Barack is just a 'celebrity' and that our grassroots movement is just a bunch of mindless fans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Mr. McCain is &quot;really attacking real people&quot; and that the ad has encouraged new donations for the Obama campaign, which has set a record of 2 million supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign said its 30-second spot will start running on national cable Tuesday while the Illinois Democrat is on vacation in Hawaii.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad accuses the Republican of wanting to give &quot;billions in tax breaks&quot; for oil and drug companies, while flashing the words &quot;Nothing for you&quot; on the screen. It also suggests that Mr. McCain is &quot;lurching to the right, then the left, the old Washington dance, whatever it takes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It concludes with footage of the Arizona Republican on &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; a show on which Mr. Obama also has appeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Washington celebrity playing the same old Washington games,&quot; the narrator says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama used similar language when responding to attacks from his main Democratic primary rival, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, saying her ads were part of the &quot;same old&quot; game and used the same &quot;tired&quot; strategies that Washington insiders have deployed for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton, who is campaigning for Mr. Obama and will speak during prime time at the Democratic National Convention, is being urged by supporters to pursue a roll-call vote to respect the 18 million people who chose her during the long primary campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Atlantic Monthly article published Monday revealed e-mail exchanges among her top campaign aides that suggest bitter infighting on the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one, strategist Mark Penn said Mrs. Clinton should point out that Mr. Obama is &quot;not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and his values&quot; because he was raised in Hawaii and lived in Indonesia as a child. He said Mrs. Clinton should stress her American roots and highlight that &quot;contrast&quot; &quot;without turning negative.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The year was 1984, and the state was Iowa. A white man who had just voted walked out of his precinct caucus and saw the Rev. Jesse Jackson standing outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did all I could,&quot; the man told Jackson ruefully, &quot;but I just couldn't bring myself to pull the lever and vote for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">L. Douglas Wilder laughs as he relates the story Jackson once told him, the sting eased by time and Wilder's vantage point as the nation's first elected black governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now it's a quarter of a century later, and the man everyone's talking about is Barack Obama, the Illinois senator holding a slim lead in many polls. But can the polls be trusted? A central question about race and politics hasn't changed since 1984: Do white people lie to pollsters or even to themselves about their willingness to vote for black candidates? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the not-so-distant past, the consensus was a clear yes. Today, however, there is widespread disagreement about whether Obama is subject to the predicament known as the Wilder or Bradley Effect whether in the privacy of the voting booth, white people will actually pull the lever for the first black man to come within shouting distance of the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that surveys can have trouble uncovering the truth about many things besides race, plus the massive technological, demographic and cultural changes in play, this question is contributing to an almost unprecedented air of uncertainty surrounding this year's polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1989, Wilder polled as many as 15 points ahead in the days before the election for Virginia governor, but squeaked into office by a minuscule 6,700 votes. David Dinkins had a similar experience that year, when he became New York City's first black mayor. And the phenomenon was first noted in 1982, when Tom Bradley endured a stunning defeat in the California governor's race after exit polls indicated he was the winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason for these disparities? A significant amount of white people did not admit that race played a role in their voting decision, pollsters and academics say. Another factor: When the person asking the questions was black, respondents were more likely to say they favored the black candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the recent Democratic primary, exit polls in 28 states overstated Obama's actual share of the final vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center, doesn't think people are lying to pollsters today about their support for Obama, &quot;because I don't think there's a lot of stigma in saying you're voting for John McCain.&quot; Kohut said it's not like polls are asking, &quot;Do you want to vote for the white guy or the black guy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he did see potential for error based on the people who decline to participate in polls, whom he describes as largely lower-income whites more likely than the population at large to have racially intolerant views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The real frailty of our polls is that we get very high refusal rates, and we survive because the people who we interview are like the people who we don't interview on most things,&quot; Kohut said. &quot;(Racism) is not one of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So are current polls accurate? &quot;I don't know,&quot; Kohut said, &quot;and to be honest with you, this is something every pollster I know is concerned about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilder, now the mayor of Richmond, Va., said his internal polls during the governor's race showed it to be much closer than most people thought. &quot;It was clear that people were having the first opportunity to vote for an African-American, and there was uncertainty,&quot; he said. &quot;You know, 'Is he going to be fair, is he just going to look out for his own people. And who are his own people?' I think we've come a great distance from that. I've seen the progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So is Wilder ready to bury the Wilder Effect?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, I won't say that,&quot; he said with a laugh. &quot;I won't go that far.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel J. Hopkins will. The Harvard University postdoctoral fellow examined data from 133 gubernatorial and Senate elections from 1986 to 2006 and concluded that the effect vanished in the early 1990s as racially divisive issues such as crime and welfare reform receded from the national stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopkins said that race could play a larger role if it is injected into the campaign as it often is in the waning days of close contests involving black candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days before the 2006 Senate election in Tennessee, with polls showing the race almost deadlocked, Republicans released an ad featuring a ditzy blond actress saying she met Harold Ford Jr. at the Playboy Club and asking the black Democrat to &quot;call me.&quot; Ford lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1990's tight North Carolina Senate contest, Republican Jesse Helms was running about even with Democrat Harvey Gantt when he released an ad showing white hands crumpling a job rejection letter as a narrator mentioned racial quotas. Helms won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blacks, too, have sought to use race to their political advantage: In a congressional primary this month in Memphis, a black challenger tried to link the incumbent, Steve Cohen, to the Ku Klux Klan. Cohen won easily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Obama may face some of these historical hurdles, there are other, unprecedented factors at work: a presidential instead of statewide election, a spike in black voters and the increase in young voters who are more racially tolerant, watch more YouTube than television and eschew the land telephone lines used by most polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racial pendulum may even have swung back the other way, said Anthony G. Greenwald, a psychology professor at the University of Washington, citing a &quot;reverse Bradley Effect&quot; during the Democratic primary: In states with larger black populations, such as Virginia, South Carolina, Mississippi and Georgia, Obama got more votes than polls predicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Kohut, Greenwald doesn't think people are deliberately lying in polls. But he does see potential for polling errors due to undecided white voters overstating their support for Obama or choosing McCain at the last minute, and the influence of &quot;racial attitudes and stereotypes that people in many cases are not aware they have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many pollsters are trying to adjust their methods to account for these unprecedented variables. It's not easy, however, to solve these new problems in the heat of a tight presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think anyone is correct or incorrect, including me,&quot; Greenwald said of the current poll numbers. &quot;To get to the heart of that, you'd have to do the kinds of research that haven't been done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign declined to comment on how it conducts its polling. The McCain campaign did not respond to requests for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matthew Dowd, an ABC News commentator and former chief strategist for President Bush's 2004 campaign, expects the Wilder Effect to be a &quot;small factor&quot; in November. &quot;I wouldn't want to be Barack Obama and up two points going into Election Day,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My guess is that (the Obama campaign) understands that and they know it's not enough to be ahead,&quot; Dowd said. &quot;They have to be ahead by a lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A YEAR AGO, it was impossible to get through a day without some mention of Paris Hilton -- the ingenue famous mostly for being famous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, how we complained. Can't we please have just one day when we don't talk about Paris?! And then one day, America's prayers were answered. Not only did Hilton disappear, she vanished into a jail cell where she spent 22 days for violating parole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When finally she did emerge, a repentant and humble Hilton claimed she had found God. &quot;I'm not the same person I was,&quot; she averred. &quot;God has given me this new chance.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who knew God's messenger would be John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his recent ad trying to convey that Barack Obama is just another celebrity whose status is based on a thin resume, McCain effectively resurrected Hilton's career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Familiar to most by now, the ad shows Obama before a cheering crowd, then the camera pans to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. &quot;He's the biggest celebrity in the world, but is he ready to lead?&quot; asks the narrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Something about higher taxes and foreign oil got lost in the reaction to the ad's allegedly racist imagery. Apparently, a black man cannot be viewed in the same frame with white women without a suggestion of racist undertones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least that was my first response to the controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a white female, I saw the ad as simply dumb and beneath McCain. Too easy. Too cliched. We all get the celebrity bit. But upon further reflection, the ad was subliminally loaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a fact that few other faces -- black, white, male or female -- are as well known as Hilton's and Spears'. It's also a fact that few celebrities, if any, are as comparably well-known for gaining their status without much resume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is a more important fact that the two ladies are perceived as being of questionable character. Their celebrity is based in part on their sexual displays. Hilton's career was launched with a homemade porn movie. Spears is known to forget to wear undergarments in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their value as examples of celebrity is overshadowed by their sexual symbolism, in other words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first association upon viewing the ad might well be celebrity, but the second connection is surely sex. Despite racial progress in this country, the black man/white woman sexual taboo still burbles just beneath the surface of America's unconscious mind -- and easily roils to the top in some pockets where racism is still easily tapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did McCain intend it that way? My sense is no, owing to McCain's own profoundly painful experience with a similar tactic in 2000 when his daughter was the target of an ugly racist attack. Push pollers placed calls in South Carolina saying that McCain's adopted daughter (from Bangladesh) was really his illegitimate black child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if baiting racists would win him the election, it is highly doubtful McCain would allow it. But he did allow this ad, which, at the very least, showed poor judgment. A subsequent Obama-celebrity ad is missing the misses, but the damage has been done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's&nbsp;ad, meanwhile, was a gift to Hilton. Her video rebuttal not only is more clever than McCain's original, but she manages to mock the elder statesman. Seated on a chaise in bathing suit and gold heels, Hilton introduces herself: &quot;Hi, I'm Paris Hilton and I'm a celebrity, too. Only I'm not from the olden days and I'm not promising change like that other guy. I'm just hot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because McCain put her in his ad, Hilton says she figures she must be running for president. So she presents her &quot;hybrid&quot; energy plan -- a combo of McCain's drilling and Obama's new technology. Something to tide us over until, you know, the problem's solved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unsolved problem for both McCain and Obama is they have too many people telling them what to do. Too many polls, managers and handlers later, they're losing their true selves. Mavericks in their own time, they were original men who each had transcended challenging circumstances, if of different orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politics has become so shallow that a poor little rich girl, America's icon of shallowness, can spoof a war hero and veteran U.S. senator and make him seem silly. Worse, Paris Hilton is back in the buzz.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to Paris Hilton for showing us just how silly and ridiculous this election was becoming and trying to get it back on track. Unfortunately, all the attention she brought with her response to John McCain's &quot;celebrity&quot; ads criticizing Barack Obama has convinced the McCain campaign that this election will be won by the candidate who gets the most YouTube hits. McCain strategists were giddy that they beat Mr. Obama on Internet page views of his YouTube channel the past few weeks, as, Stephen Dinan reported in our Thursday editions: &quot;I think we knew it would draw some attention. I don't think we knew it would be as big a hit on YouTube,&quot; said McCain spokesman Brian Rogers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the now-infamous McCain&nbsp;ad, Mr. Obama, an Illinois senator, was compared to &quot;pop-princess&quot; Britney Spears (enough said) and Paris Hilton, who is famous for being promiscuous, taking baths on tape, having a foul mouth, being a spoiled rich brat and serving 23 days of a 45-day sentence for violating probation on an &quot;alcohol-related, reckless driving&quot; conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain thought that ads paid for by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth - essentially saying that John Kerry was less of a war hero than he claimed to be - were &quot;dishonest and dishonorable&quot; and &quot;very, very wrong.&quot; There is a debate about whether his ads are worse, better or just fine, but stupid seems to work best. The ad brought criticism from Paris Hilton's mother, Kathy, who also let slip that the Hiltons are (or perhaps were) McCain supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris, not one to take this lying down, then came up with her own ad. She called Mr. McCain the &quot;wrinkly, old-white guy&quot; and mockingly suggested that since Mr. McCain dragged her into the campaign, she might as well run for president. She then presented an eloquent alternative to both Mr. McCain's and Mr. Obama's energy plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the campaign is running an ad in which Democrats Tom Daschle, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Mr. Obama dub Mr. McCain a Democrat-lite politician. Americans across this great land may not be used to such events making news. But for Washingtonians, who are all too familiar with politicians and lobbyists alike deserting us in August, campaign ads like Paris Hilton's are bound to be noteworthy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It used to be that the conversation about the very difficult subject of race in America was best left to African-Americans, because only they have experienced the active or passive oppression that many whites cannot comprehend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let the Walter and Armstrong Williamses, the Thomas Sowells and Floyd Flakes, the Michael and Shelby Steeles, the Larry Elders and Ward Connerlys and Jay Parkers - the theory went - haggle it out with the Al Sharptons and Jesse Jacksons, the Carl Rowans and Julian Bonds, the Adam Clayton Powells and (of course) the Martin Luther Kings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then came two realizations - (1) the African-American community is as ideologically divided (between conservatives and liberals) as the white community, and (2) the McCain-Obama campaign is at hand. So now the discussion is open to all. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rightly or wrongly and largely unspoken, race is a deep-running factor in American culture - infusing much that it should not but does. Barack Obama is the first African-American with a genuine prospect of becoming president of an electorate that is 11 percent black and 77 percent white. Because of that percentage discrepancy, Obama's chances of winning depend greatly on the extent to which - in commentator Juan Williams' words - he can &quot;assure undecided white voters that he shares their [conservative social] values and is worthy of their trust.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SO HOW seemingly odd that Obama should inject race into the campaign. Possibly he did it to build a force field around himself to deflect every criticism of every kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the primaries, he blasted Bill Clinton for allegedly making race an issue in the Carolinas - implying Clinton was doing it to gin up white turnout for Hillary. Obama also perceived subtle racial undertones in John McCain's first general-election ad - i.e., its description of McCain as &quot;the American president Americans have been waiting for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In late June, Obama began mentioning his race (as he frequently had) in combination with dark implications that McCain would deploy race against Obama (as McCain never has): They're going to try to make you afraid. They're going to try to make you afraid of me. &quot;He's young and inexperienced and he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally on July 31, in Springfield, Mo., Obama dealt down and dirty:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nobody really thinks that Bush or McCain have a real answer for the challenges we face. So what they're going to try to do is make you scared of me. You know - he's not patriotic enough. He's got a funny name. You know, he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills. You know. He's risky. That's essentially the argument they're making.&quot; [Italics added.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Properly fed up, the McCain campaign jumped on the &quot;he doesn't look like all those other presidents&quot; comment. Said McCain's campaign manager: &quot;Barack Obama has played the race card, and he played it from the bottom of the deck. It's divisive, negative, shameful, and wrong.&quot; Said McCain himself of his campaign manager's comment: &quot;I agree with it, and I'm disappointed that Sen. Obama would say the things he's saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whereupon Obama's campaign manager said the McCain campaign's very mention of the &quot;not like other presidents&quot; remark, combined with a McCain&nbsp;ad depicting Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, are &quot;character attacks.&quot; He was echoed by New York Times columnist Bob Herbert, who sees a &quot;venomous McCain campaign&quot; all about &quot;trashing the opposition, Karl Rove-style&quot; - a campaign &quot;smearing Mr. Obama every which way from sundown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THIS Kabuki invites the question: What is Obama's rationale?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's racial politics, and goes like this: Because I'm a minority, you can't use race but I can. If you do, I'll zap you. And if you don't and I do and you call me on it, I'll zap you for even suggesting I'm playing racial games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But racial politics is loaded with risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama needs to maximize minority turnout while pulling enough white votes to win. Yet the polls in this campaign are all over the place, meaning there's no telling how Obama's racial games will play out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many sufferers of white guilt want desperately to vote for an African-American to prove to themselves - if to no one else - that they are not racist. Still, the extremist views of Obama's preacher Jeremiah Wright, and now the playing of the race card by Obama himself, may combine to generate in guilt sufferers the sentiment, not this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nor dare we forget ideology. Liberalism bears its own heavy racial/ethnic burdens: Liberal college administrators imposed Ivy League admission quotas on Asians and Jews. And liberals of various professional stripe turned to Anita Hill in their efforts to stop the confirmation of the conservative Clarence Thomas, who writes eloquently (in My Grandfather's Son) about the extent to which the leftist concept of affirmative action robs blacks of their dignity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama's shameless playing of the race card - his combining of race with liberal ideology - might prove his undoing in what remains a deeply conservative culture. It raises profound questions about his judgment and leadership, and may leave him in voters' minds precisely the inexperienced, insubstantial, immature celebrity of John McCain's description.</SPAN></P>

Lounging poolside in a skimpy swimsuit, she thanks &quot;that wrinkly white-haired guy&quot; for his endorsement. Hilton's ad calls McCain &quot;the oldest celebrity in the world ... old enough to remember when dancing was a sin. ...&quot; &quot;I want America to know I'm, like, totally ready to lead,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hilton's platform -- which sounds halfway sensible -- combines McCain's plan for offshore oil drilling with Obama's emphasis on manufacturing hybrid vehicles.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opening round of the general-election campaign between Barack Obama and John McCain has produced memorable images, negative ads, snarling e-mails and pointed exchanges over war, the economy and energy. What it has not done is begin to resolve questions among voters that both candidates must address to win in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid a profusion of polls and a war of words and television commercials, the underlying dynamics of the election appear little changed in the two months since the primaries ended. Democrat Obama still faces reservations among voters about his background and readiness. Republican McCain still faces questions about whether he has a governing vision that represents a clear break from the policies of President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the opening of the Olympic Games on Friday, the campaign has entered a two-week doldrums. But once the Beijing Games are over, Obama and McCain will retake center stage. In rapid succession, they will announce running mates, choreograph their nominating conventions and deliver acceptance speeches to what are likely to be the largest audiences they will reach until the fall debates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those events will dwarf what has happened to date. But they will play out against the backdrop of preliminaries that, in the estimation of the two campaigns, have positioned their candidates well for the real battle ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain advisers believe they effectively blunted any boost Obama may have gained from his overseas trip, seized an advantage on the debate over energy policy and have begun to restore the &quot;maverick&quot; appeal that distinguishes their candidate from Bush. They also say they have corrected many of the operational weaknesses that plagued their campaign earlier in the summer and drew sharp criticism from others in the Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are on offense on the most important domestic issue before the country, which is the energy crisis,&quot; Steve Schmidt, who runs the campaign's day-to-day operations, said in an interview. &quot;We have blunted Obama's momentum both nationally and in the key states, where we're ahead, even or just slightly behind in a horrific political year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama advisers think  that they have laid the foundation for a fall campaign in which voters will gradually gain confidence in their candidate's capacity to serve as president. They also believe  they have pinned the Bush label on McCain and enjoy a significant advantage in the intensity of their support, something they think will translate into bigger turnout in battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager, said his team is acutely focused on two elemental objectives: winning the battle for swing voters and winning the battle over turnout. &quot;The most underappreciated dynamic of the race is the intensity advantage,&quot; he said. &quot;That's why George Bush won in 2004. . . . They had an intensity gap, and we have it now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past month, polls have suggested a fluctuating race, with Obama leading at one point by as much as eight or nine points, losing virtually all of it to McCain after returning from overseas and then again pulling ahead. The past month also has been notable for the intensity of the engagement between the two campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But experienced political strategists say what comes next will be far more important in determining the outcome in November than anything that has happened to date. They heavily discount any supposed movement in the polls, saying it has little relevance, and are convinced that most persuadable voters are paying scant attention to the daily dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beware the polls,&quot; said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. &quot;People are very mediocre predictors of their own behavior. What they tell you in June and July will not necessarily comport well with what they do in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matthew Dowd, chief strategist for Bush's 2004 reelection campaign and now an independent analyst, said little has changed over the summer, despite Obama's overseas trip, an array of television ads and extensive cable news coverage of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The race has been pretty stagnant,&quot; he said. &quot;Obama had as good a trip overseas as you could possibly have, and nothing moved. Obama is sitting on a four-to-six-point lead, but he is underperforming where he should be&quot; in the race, given the overall political climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who has used the past two months most effectively? On that question, there is predictable partisan disagreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Geoff Garin, who finished the primaries as one of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's chief strategists, argued that Obama has put down a stronger foundation for the fall campaign than McCain has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama campaign has always been extremely disciplined and focused, and in this period they have been extremely purposeful about filling in the blanks on Obama in a way that will serve him well in September and October,&quot; he said. &quot;In order to do that, they've been willing to take a few dings from McCain. But my sense is it's nothing more than a few dings, rather than a deep and permanent definition of Obama that will haunt him throughout the campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those &quot;dings&quot; have included McCain's efforts to call into question whether Obama should have visited wounded service members in Germany after Pentagon officials indicated that he could not bring along an adviser from his campaign, and McCain's ads focusing on Obama as an international celebrity -- spots designed to raise doubts that the Democrat is ready to be president and question whether he and voters share the same values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schmidt summed up the case this way: &quot;The American people now have a window into how to evaluate his candidacy, based on his unprecedented celebrity, that can help them process the decision in tough economic times and tough national security times, particularly with regard to Obama's lack of experience and his ability to change positions on any issue at any moment given what is politically expediency at that moment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Plouffe argued that McCain's efforts to portray Obama as a mere celebrity who is not ready to serve as president may be more likely to create enthusiasm among core Republicans than to persuade swing voters. He said the campaign's research has shown that swing voters were turned off by the celebrity ad that featured Paris Hilton and Britney Spears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been covered at high-intensity levels for 19 months,&quot; Plouffe said, adding, &quot;I don't think people believe Barack Obama is an empty suit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garin did not discount the challenges Obama faces. &quot;Voters have question marks about Obama,&quot; he said. &quot;The Obama campaign in June and July and now into August has been consistently focused on trying to address those question marks, not in a way that will win him the election in August but that will put him in a better position to win the election in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain advisers think their candidate matches up well against those potential vulnerabilities in Obama. &quot;This guy's . . . weaknesses are all John's strengths,&quot; said one McCain adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to talk candidly about strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until recently, some Republicans had strongly criticized McCain  over the conduct of his campaign. But, given his new, aggressive attacks on Obama and other signs of change within his campaign, those complaints have been muted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terry Nelson, who served as McCain's campaign manager until July 2007, said McCain was right to engage Obama and argued that the change in strategy has put the Republican in a stronger position heading toward the conventions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the McCain campaign has done a good job of laying out some battle lines,&quot; he said. &quot;The Obama campaign seems to be not dominating the agenda of the campaign in the way that it was for some time. The question in my mind is, after the conventions are over, who is going to dominate the debate? The Obama campaign was able to do that for a while, but the McCain campaign is doing it now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Democratic strategists argued that McCain has done less than Obama to address his problems. &quot;John McCain at this point is identified with four more years of George Bush,&quot; Mellman said. &quot;That's exactly the way Obama wanted to paint him, and it is the way people see him. If he's going to win, he's going to have to go around fundamental perceptions that have been set.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One challenge both candidates share is their struggle to gain an edge on the economy. &quot;The dominant issue in this election is what you broadly call pocketbook and the economy, and both candidates for some reason don't have a voice on it and they don't seem comfortable,&quot; Dowd said. &quot;They talk about it and move off of it quickly. . . . The first one to get a voice on it will have an advantage.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BARACK OBAMA and John McCain have important differences on tax policy. These are fair game for campaign ads, and no one expects 30-second spots to be suffused with nuance. But Mr. McCain's latest attack on the Obama tax plan crosses the line from reasonable argument to unacceptably misleading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama voted to raise taxes on people making just $42,000,&quot; the announcer warns. The basis for this statement is the senator's vote for the fiscal 2009 budget resolution, a nonbinding blueprint that assumed that all the Bush tax cuts would expire as scheduled. However, Mr. Obama has repeatedly said he wants to extend the Bush tax cuts for families making less than $250,000 a year. If anything, he has lavished too much in tax breaks on the middle class, proposing an expensive $1,000-per-family additional tax credit and, last weekend, piling on top of that an immediate, presumably one-time, $1,000-per-family rebate for energy costs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama plan would reduce taxes for low- and moderate-income families, but raise them significantly for high-bracket taxpayers,&quot; the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center reported. &quot;By 2012, middle-income taxpayers would see their after-tax income rise by 4.6 percent, or $2,100 annually.&quot; In fact, the center found, Mr. McCain was less generous than Mr. Obama to middle-income taxpayers, trimming their taxes by about 3 percent of income, or $1,400 annually, by 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain&nbsp;ad continues in the same dishonest vein: &quot;He promises more taxes on small business, seniors, your life savings, your family.&quot; Mr. Obama would increase taxes on small business -- but only the tiny sliver that earn more than $250,000 a year. He would -- unwisely, in our view -- lower taxes on seniors, excusing those making less than $50,000 a year from paying any tax whatsoever. As for going after people's &quot;life savings,&quot; Mr. Obama would exempt 99.7 percent of households from paying the estate tax. He would tax the &quot;life savings&quot; only of couples who leave a combined estate worth more than $7 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is not blameless in the ad wars. He asserts that Mr. McCain would give new tax breaks to &quot;Big Oil,&quot; without making clear that this is part of an overall reduction in the corporate tax rate. A radio ad released Friday warns that &quot;there's something John McCain's not telling you: It was McCain who used his influence in the Senate to help foreign-owned DHL buy a U.S. company and gain control over the jobs that are now on the chopping block in Ohio.&quot; Sorry, but there's something Mr. Obama's not telling voters, either. &quot;Foreign-owned DHL,&quot; which acquired Airborne Express, likely saved jobs that were on the chopping block in 2003, when the merger took place. Then, Mr. McCain opposed an ill-considered provision by Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), pushed by DHL rivals Federal Express and United Parcel Service, that would have blocked its takeover of the struggling No. 3 Airborne. The current controversy involves a move by &quot;foreign-owned DHL,&quot; now struggling itself, to outsource air cargo operations to, yes, American-owned UPS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama should tamp down the xenophobic rhetoric. Mr. McCain should stop trying to scare voters by mischaracterizing Mr. Obama's tax plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Democratic convention approaches, it's a safe bet that the cable networks will transport us back in time to late July 2004 by showing clips of Barack Obama's electrifying keynote address to that year's gathering. That was the speech that made him a star (and unlike John McCain's&nbsp;ad team, I mean this as a compliment). But I've sometimes wondered in recent months: Whatever happened to that Obama, to that enemy of excessive partisanship and evangelist of national unity?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You will recall the money sentences: &quot;Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America. There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America.&quot; These phrases were followed by several deftly chosen images designed to skewer the stereotypes that red and blue Americans entertain about each other. &quot;We worship an awesome God in the blue states,&quot; Obama thundered. &quot;And yes,&quot; he added, &quot;we've got some gay friends in the red states.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These now-famous lines constituted just a small sliver of the speech; the rest was more standard stuff -- his biography, his concern for workers at a Maytag plant in Galesburg, Ill., (he was running for Senate, after all) and, of course, all the marvelous things that John F. Kerry would do as president. But those lines stood out for a reason: They articulated a deep yearning, held by many Americans of varying beliefs, for less polarization and division. This theme was precisely what cata pulted Obama  to the front rank of Democratic poli  ticians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now ask yourself: Have you heard Obama talk like that lately?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chances are you haven't. The grand 2004 theme of post-partisanship seems to have all but disappeared from the candidate's rhetoric. In a major foreign policy address he delivered just before his overseas trip last month, he enumerated some of the steps the United States should have taken after Sept. 11, 2001. Getting Osama bin Laden led the list, but when it came to domestic priorities, the man who burst onto the national scene talking about one America conspicuously failed to mention his regret that, instead of being united after the attacks, Americans were divided along partisan lines by an administration that wielded patriotism as an ideological cudgel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recently asked David Axelrod, Obama's chief strategist, what became of post-partisanship. &quot;Oh, I think he still speaks about it, and I'm sure it'll be a theme at our convention,&quot; Axelrod told me. &quot;It's still fundamental to who he is.&quot; I'm sure that's true, but I also think that Obama will miss an important opportunity if he doesn't use this month's convention to restate this theme -- and remind voters that a purpler America is still a pretty good idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are four theories about why Obama has moved post-partisanship to the rhetorical back burner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theory No. 1: There's only room in a campaign for one big theme at a time, and the Obama team has settled on &quot;change.&quot; That's fair enough. Change is undemanding and direct. It requires no presumed level of information, whereas describing a &quot;post-partisan future&quot; counts on voters' knowing that we're in a partisan time and being upset by that or, heck, even knowing what partisanship is to begin with. The urge to keep it simple is understandable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theory No. 2: Post-partisanship is too abstract. Obama has taken lots of fire from pundits and GOP operatives for supposedly being too highfalutin', a propensity he now feels he must guard against. (Of course, this is one of the planet's dumbest arguments: Humble people don't run for president, and that goes for John McCain, too.) So Obama's more recent rhetoric has tended to emphasize nuts and bolts -- his plans for Iraq, Afghanistan and the world and his prescriptions for the economy. Again, understandable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theory No. 3: The Obama team may feel that they've already established the purple theme sufficiently. They may be right; I don't see their internal polling results. But my sense is that if you asked the average voter today to name three or four things about Obama, few would say, &quot;He wants to bring the country together.&quot; Even a year ago, many more would have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theory No. 4: It could be that the post-partisanship theme is simply less resonant now than it was in 2004. Back then, in an election that was a referendum on President Bush, the United States really was a 50-50 country. But with Bush weak and Karl Rove gone, Democrats can be forgiven for thinking that polarization is now a less pressing issue and that the equation tilts more in their favor today. Still, the McCain campaign shows every sign of planning to run -- quite counter to the candidate's earlier pronouncements -- a Rove-style, divide-and-conquer campaign. (The man who vowed to run a substantive, honorable campaign is bringing us Paris Hilton?) Obama is giving as well as getting on this front, so we'll certainly see our share of partisan politics between now and Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So perhaps the Obama campaign has good reasons to move away from the theme that made its candidate famous. The Obama people may know exactly what they're doing. After all, they haven't done too badly so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in fact, instead of talking about post-partisanship, Obama has in some respects been demonstrating it. His apparently close relationship with retiring Sen. Chuck Hagel, the Nebraska Republican who traveled with him to Iraq and shows many signs of intending to endorse him, is the clearest manifestation of this. The recent ad bragging about Obama's nuclear nonproliferation work with Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), an ad that Lugar clearly green-lighted, is another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I suspect that Hagel will speak at the Democratic convention and appear in ads for Obama down the road. And I wonder about former secretary of state Colin L. Powell and Lincoln Chafee (the former Rhode Island GOP senator, now an independent), and Susan Eisenhower (Ike's granddaughter) and even Douglas W. Kmiec, a conservative legal scholar who is hardly a household name but whose endorsement of Obama was a huge deal in certain circles. If these folks are willing to speak for Obama, offering testimonials to his ability to lead us toward a new kind of politics, that could well do more to advance the national unity theme than any amount of rhetoric from the candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, I would like to see Obama return to the post-partisan, one-America idea himself. It's an electoral winner and a governing essential, should he be elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's an electoral winner because Democrats can't really triumph in divide-and-conquer elections. No, it's not that they're too noble for them. It's just that they're not as good at it as the Rove Republicans are, and progressive core positions don't translate as well into fear-mongering rhetoric. The Democrats fear-monger pretty effectively about Social Security -- as well they should -- but beyond that, it's hard to scare people into fearing that the other guy is going to cut your taxes too much or be too tough on our enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, Obama must attack McCain and return fire when fired upon, but he needs to do something more. He must get some percentage of people to vote their hopes, not their fears, as Bill Clinton used to put it. As McCain sprints rightward on a range of issues and dedicates himself to a negative campaign designed to scare 51 percent of the voters about Obama's euphemistic &quot;otherness&quot; and alleged lack of preparedness, a dose of trans-partisan optimism will make a useful contrast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the one-America theme will be crucial if he actually wins. As president, Obama will need to unite liberals and moderates of both parties and isolate the conservative blocs in the House and especially the Senate to get anything done. But that's getting ahead of ourselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been a while now since Obama really rocked the house with a great speech. His Berlin effort seemed medium-cool by design, as if he didn't want to create too much frenzy overseas. But in Denver, he'll be speaking to Americans, to voters. &quot;People will leave the convention with a strong sense of who he is, what animates him, and how he will govern,&quot; Axelrod told me. &quot;And I think his desire for bipartisanship is a big part of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The television coverage will remind viewers of his 2004 triumph. Obama should remind them of the core idea that made that speech a triumph -- and of why they were taken with him in the first place.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris Hilton? Britney Spears? &quot;Fight the Smears?&quot; Really?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So much for an &quot;honorable campaign&quot; as the political attack ads of 2008 begin to bombard the public airwaves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;I'm hot&quot; debate last week did not delve into the presidential candidates' energy plans as much as it focused on who descended deeper into the muck - &quot;the one who is promising change&quot; or the &quot;wrinkly, white hair guy,&quot; as Miss Hilton characterized the candidates in response to Republican Sen. John McCain's attack ad criticizing Democratic Sen. Barack Obama's &quot;celebrity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, did the socialite's cheeky video garner the presumptive GOP nominee even greater points in the polls? Slightly, it seems, at least for the moment, based on the Daily Double at Gallup. Should Mr. Obama have &quot;hit back harder&quot; to widen the gap as even some Democrats suggested? Perhaps. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the larger question is how this mudslinging with expensive negative campaign advertisements will affect the election outcome and at what cost, not only to the candidates but also to the electorate they aim to sway? Replaceable dollars? Irreplaceable values?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some folks contend they do not cotton to the negative tone campaigns take and that those messages, sophomoric or sinister, distract from the national debate the country needs to engage in every four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Allen, host of &quot;The Signs of The Times&quot; (WPGC-AM, 1590), says &quot;the majority of the listeners to my show who called on this topic were particularly surprised that John McCain compared Barack Obama to Paris Hilton and Britney Spears in an ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one put Paris or Britney down, per se. The most frequent observation was surprise that the ad resorted to trying to minimize Obama as a person. ... Some said the ad insulted their intelligence But, if the intent of the ad was to stop people from talking about Obama's recent world tour, then, in political terms, it worked,&quot; Mr. Allen added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Olympic flame-throwing had to happen sooner or later with less than 100 days until the election. One candidate, then the other, then back-and-forth, as the presidential campaign goes up in smoke as each fire starter and his surrogates claim the other lit the match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charges and counter-charges are being lobbed so fast and loose that the Obama camp installed a &quot;Fight the Smears&quot; link on his Web site, while most media outlets now employ campaign &quot;fact checkers&quot; to analyze ads. The usual suspects on the pundits' roundtables continually bemoan or belittle negative campaigns ads, but it appears that few of them have ever heard the Bible verse about &quot;casting the first stone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Television viewers, who we only wish would vote more for political contenders than for &quot;American Idol,&quot; say they are turned off by negative ads but researchers and pollsters will beg to differ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negative political advertising is as old as holding public elections in this country. Thomas Jefferson was attacked as the &quot;Antichrist.&quot; Abraham Lincoln was called &quot;a horrid looking wretch&quot; unfit to lead, according to scholars John G. Geer of Vanderbilt University and Ken Goldstein of the University of Wisconsin, who co-authored an opinion piece, &quot;The positive effect of negative ads,&quot; which first appeared in the Los Angeles Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two academics, who have been tracking presidential campaign data, concluded negative political ads energize voters even though they are unable to determine which candidate benefits the most from them. One study reported by the April Journal of Consumer Research, for example, has shown that young voters would either be more supportive in defense of their candidate or be swayed away from their original candidate after watching negatives ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Negativity is essential to democratic politics and ultimately yields a more engaged and better-informed public,&quot; they wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whether we like it or not, attack ads and the debate they trigger offer an invaluable way&quot; to answer questions that voters have about the candidates, the scholars suggest. Further, &quot;negative ads are more likely to focus on issues, are more specific and contain many more facts than positive ads,&quot; which engages the public, which in turn, makes them more likely to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson raised the specter of nuclear war evaporating a little girl in his &quot;Daisy&quot; ad against Republican Barry Goldwater. In more recent times all you have to do is mention &quot;Willie Horton,&quot; &quot;Swift boa &quot; or the &quot; red phone at 3 a.m.&quot; and most Americans remember the meaning even if they can't name the presidential candidates to whom they applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Fauntroy, George Mason University public policy professor, said &quot;for all the talk about voter's claiming not to like negative ads, they work and they move voters in one direction or another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama made early claims to run a &quot;different kind of campaign,&quot; one that was supposed to rise above the fray, Mr. Fauntroy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They planted that seed early and that's not what they wanted to do, so the voters are more likely to give him a pass, ... unless the ads get particularly egregious,&quot; he said, adding that the same applies to Mr McCain, who has also done well with independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, &quot;ultimately this campaign will look like every other campaign we've seen in recent years,&quot; Mr. Fauntroy said. If the race is close, the negative ads can sway a few independent and undecided voters in critical states such as Missouri, Ohio and Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody should be surprised that these ads are beginning to hit the airwaves,&quot; Mr. Fauntroy said, because &quot;the reality is that when you're running a campaign, the last thing you want to do is lose because you were afraid to turn the knife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the American public really deserves better than Paris and Britney and &quot;Fight the Smears.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE AD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Narrator: &quot;Life in the spotlight must be grand, but for the rest of us, times are tough. Obama voted to raise taxes on people making just $42,000. He promises more taxes on small business, seniors, your life savings, your family. Painful taxes, hard choices for your budget. Not ready to lead. That's the real Obama.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANALYSIS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This John McCain&nbsp;ad reprises what has become his signature theme, that Barack Obama is a celebrity with a hidden policy agenda. It opens with crowds cheering Obama and pictorial spreads featuring the senator from Illinois in GQ, Us Weekly and Vanity Fair. But the spot quickly turns into a standard Republican attack on a Democrat as a tax-raising liberal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charge that Obama voted to raise taxes on people making $42,000 stretches a valid point. Obama voted for a nonbinding Democratic budget resolution that would not have raised anyone's taxes. But it did envision phasing out most of the Bush tax cuts, which would have that effect. (The McCain campaign has backed off a previous charge that Obama would boost taxes at the $31,000 level, labeled false by FactCheck.org.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is selective in saying that Obama would raise taxes on seniors and &quot;your family,&quot; omitting that he would target only families, Social Security recipients and those with capital gains earning more than $250,000 a year. And it is misleading in charging that Obama wants to raise taxes on small businesses, offering the lame explanation that many affluent taxpayers who would be affected by the income tax increase also happen to own small businesses. The commercial also leaves out Obama's proposal for a middle-class tax cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But more important than the mathematical details is the portrait the senator from Arizona is trying to paint of his opponent as an untested leader whose domestic policies are obscured by the media spotlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Howard Kurtz </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Barack Obama stepping off the playing field for a week-long Hawaiian vacation, John McCain's campaign released three new attack ads yesterday, signaling that the senator from Arizona would use the void to continue pummeling the character of his rival for the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's trip to Hawaii, where he spent much of his youth, comes after a week in which his Republican opponent dominated the news with his negative assault. Obama aides said the senator from Illinois is maintaining his lead in polls and will not be goaded into responding with character attacks of his own. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the assaults on him continued yesterday, with new television ads and a radio spot portraying Obama as a lightweight celebrity intent on raising taxes across the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Life in the spotlight must be grand,&quot; a female announcer declares to paparazzi-like images of Obama and adoring chants in the background. &quot;But for the rest of us, times are tough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That advertisement and a Spanish-language ad and radio spot claim Obama voted to raise taxes on families earning just $42,000, a claim based on his vote for a nonbinding, Democratic budget resolution that allows all of President Bush's tax cuts to expire in 2011, something Obama has promised he would not let happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan called the ad &quot;a lie&quot; and &quot;part of the old, tired politics of a party in Washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain aides showed little concern for such niceties. &quot;Like it would have crossed our minds to let up on the guy just because he's on vacation?&quot; asked Charles R. Black Jr., one of McCain's top advisers, as McCain flew from Iowa to Arkansas yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Democrats are increasingly worried that trying to debunk the McCain attacks will not be enough, particularly with the candidate on vacation. The Republican National Committee mocked Obama with &quot;Barack Obama's Hawaii Travel Guide,&quot; noting the elite prep school he attended on scholarship and highlighting a Chevron station selling gasoline for $4.78 a gallon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama did counter by airing a radio advertisement in Ohio taking McCain to task over the fact that his campaign manager lobbied on behalf of a German freight-shipping company, DHL, that is laying off over 8,000 Ohioans and moving its operations to Kentucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an issue-based counterattack to McCain's character assault is not enough, worried Democrats say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It literally is the same old Democratic, consultant-driven politics,&quot; said Matt Stoller, a Democratic political consultant and blogger. &quot;It's the same attempt not to tell a story about the country and the other guy, but to prove you're right, like an academic debating seminar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign challenged Obama's&nbsp;ad in a conference call with Wilmington, Ohio, resident Mary Houghtaling, who in July tearfully challenged McCain to help with the job losses, then yesterday praised the Republican while castigating Obama and calling for his campaign to take the radio ad off the air. The hospice founder, whose husband is a pilot for DHL facing a layoff, joined in the attack, saying that &quot;Obama's going to be in Hawaii, swimming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Obama off the stage, the Democratic National Committee next week will try to take up the slack, delivering birthday cakes on the Aug. 14 anniversary of Social Security to McCain and Republican state headquarters and hitting McCain's support for carving out private investment accounts from fixed Social Security benefits. On Tuesday, the DNC plans to hold what it calls a national day of action to paint McCain as a captive of Exxon Mobil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the media attention on McCain's ads, Obama campaign manager David Plouffe argued that the most important event of the campaign this week was McCain's trip to Ohio amid coverage of his and lobbyist-turned-campaign manager Rick Davis's role in helping DHL take over U.S.-based Airborne Express, and the subsequent loss of Ohio jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain can now become an emblem for what's wrong with Washington,&quot; Plouffe said, noting that McCain cannot win the White House without Ohio. &quot;By November  4 in the Cincinnati and Dayton media markets, this will be something known by every voter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During Obama's vacation week, his campaign will be focused on organizing in the 18 states his campaign has identified as battlegrounds, registering voters and focusing on local media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a game plan and a strategy, and we're going to continue to execute it. We're not going to be terribly worried about people playing armchair quarterback,&quot; Plouffe said. &quot;By November 4, there are character dimensions to John McCain that are going to be clear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain starts his week in Pennsylvania, where he will stump across the state with its former governor and possible vice presidential choice Tom Ridge. On Tuesday, he heads to New Jersey. McCain's campaign confirmed that the senator would will probably take his own vacation in the week before the Democratic National Convention. The senator plans to retreat to his home in Sedona, Ariz., where he owns a cabin and several other houses along a river, spending several days there before returning to the campaign trail during the Democratic convention in late August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), still trying to squelch concerns about disunity among Democrats, campaigned for Obama yesterday in Henderson, Nev., and encouraged her supporters to fall in line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with Senator Obama than with Senator McCain,&quot; she said. &quot;Remember who we were fighting for in my campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Each week, more than 50 figures from the world of faith engage in a conversation about an aspect of religion. This week's includes a posting by Jacques Berlinerblau. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am vacationing off the coast of Sicily where Internet access is rather spotty (and where no sane person spends much time online anyway). But once I experienced John McCain's &quot;The One&quot; attack ad, I immediately put down my octopus-hunting harpoon and started taking notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time Charlton Heston began doing his Moses shtick, I realized I was in the presence of one of the biggest Faith and Values stories of the campaign. So please permit me a few reflections as I sip my Malvasia (BTW: How's the weather in D.C.?):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Strategy: A certain professional football coach -- whose name I refuse to pronounce -- has fashioned a storied, if not controversial, career out of doing the following: making opposing quarterbacks discover that the things they once felt comfortable doing they can no longer do without incurring tremendous risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar set of tactics, I think, is at play here. Sen. Barack Obama, as some of you may have noticed, absolutely owns the religious card. He effortlessly delivers soaring monologues filled with scriptural allusions. Rendered in churchly cadences, his rhetoric mongers hope and electoral good will far and wide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain people, I surmise, would like to put a stop to that. With this commercial they try to condition voters (and the media?) to roll their eyes every time Obama &quot;goes there.&quot; Thanks to &quot;The One,&quot; an image of a goofy Obama/Charlton/Moses casting a spell over the sea and swarms of liberal dupes will pop into the heads of Obama's auditors when his rhetoric gets too highfalutin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next time he enthuses about faith on the campaign trail, he will be looking out of the corner of his eye.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MoveOn.org and an arm of the independent political group Public Campaign Action Fund want the Justice Department to investigate whether bundlers for John McCain's presidential campaign are using &quot;straw&quot; donations -- those made in the name of someone else to evade contribution limits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The left-leaning online advocacy group, which has endorsed Barack Obama, is planning a petition drive to put pressure on Justice to look into two incidents involving McCain donors who, despite appearing to be of modest means, wrote large checks to his campaign and to the Republican National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Justice Department must thoroughly investigate John McCain and the Republican National Committee's pattern of potentially illegal donations,&quot; says an e-mail that MoveOn.org is sending backers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign on Thursday returned nearly $50,000 raised by Florida businessman Harry Sargeant III after questions arose about the money he and his colleagues collected from California donors who held jobs that seemed inconsistent with such large political gifts. A second instance involved an office manager at the Hess oil company who, with her husband, an Amtrak track foreman, has given more than $60,000 to McCain and the RNC this year. She has said she and her husband gave their own money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers said the money raised by Sargeant was returned out of an abundance of caution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Donnelly of the group Campaign Money Watch said he thought the McCain campaign's decision to return some of the money raised by Sargeant and his colleagues was &quot;a good first step.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice President Cheney will speak at the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis-St. Paul on the same day as President Bush, officials said Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The vice president looks forward to participating in the Republican National Convention and continuing to work for the election of Senator McCain and other Republican candidates in the coming months,&quot; Cheney spokeswoman Megan Mitchell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement suggests the controversial vice president's enduring popularity within the Republican base overcame concerns from some GOP insiders that his appearance would pose a political complication for John McCain, who has sought to distance himself from the current White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats have sought to tie McCain to the unpopular president, labeling him &quot;McSame&quot; and running commercials that show McCain praising Bush. Earlier this week, Democrats also unveiled a Web site called &quot;The Next Cheney,&quot; comparing possible McCain running mates to the current vice president.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the summer, The American Survey has explored the contours of independent voters - who they are and how they vote. Both the McCain and Obama campaigns seek to persuade this constituency because neither self-identified Republicans nor Democrats - by themselves - represent the numbers necessary to reach a majority. So, as in elections past, &quot;independents&quot; will tip the balance in this year's presidential election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier surveys clarified several misconceptions about these unaffiliated Americans. On June 23, I noted that while surveys show 35 percent to 40 percent of Americans call themselves independents, as many as two-thirds of this group are really &quot;closet partisans&quot; and vote like Democrats or Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who say they are independent but lean Democrat vote overwhelmingly blue, while those independents who lean Republican usually side with the red team. This means they are less of a &quot;swing group&quot; than assumed by many media accounts. Once you remove the &quot;leaners,&quot; the true independents are a much smaller group - probably closer to 10 percent rather than the 35 percent to 40 percent reported in most national surveys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 11, I described how the independent group, particularly those true independents who do not lean toward one party or the other, is least attentive to and least knowledgeable about politics. When asked for ideological self-definition, while some say they're liberal and others consider themselves moderate or conservative, the largest percentage of pure independents (about 40 percent) answer they &quot;don't know,&quot; according to the American National Election Study at the University of Michigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For these reasons, independent voters are a hard group to politically corral. Adding to these challenges, research also indicates they make their voting decisions later than other Americans. As the accompanying table indicates, nearly one-third of true independents decide in the last two weeks of the election. Tactically, this means this group stays &quot;in play&quot; longer than other constituencies, a fact with important implications for political campaigns' advertising and outreach strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True political independents are a key swing group in presidential elections. But reaching and persuading them is always a challenge. It's probably less effective appealing to them with messages heavily laden with issue positions, ideological arguments or even contacts early in the campaign. They probably pay more attention to neighbors they trust than an ad they see on television. And sometimes the last voice they hear is the most persuasive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are hurdles faced by both presidential campaigns. But the one that understands these nuances best will not only win a bigger share of the independent vote, but will also be the next occupant of the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media is abuzz with a very creative Paris Hilton energy ad that ridicules Sen. John McCain for exploiting her and Britney Spears with the &quot;celebrity&quot; ad that belittled Sen. Barack Obama's recent foreign trip &quot;McCain takes lead on YouTube hits,&quot; Page 1, Thursday). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her ad, Miss Hilton articulates an energy policy that sounds better than the ones proposed by either presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Hilton would wage two wars simultaneously commencing on her inauguration day - one to conserve energy and the other to increase the supply of energy. On the supply side, offshore/onshore drilling would be conducted under strict environmental standards, and at the same time, Miss Hilton would fund development of newer technologies for such alternate sources as wind, solar, battery, nuclear, natural gas, shale and so on. However, her policy wouldn't include the now famous Obama line &quot;inflating the tires to save energy&quot; on the demand side of the equation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we wage these two wars at once, we can even put the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to use to lower oil prices temporarily and refill it later at lower prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few more of these ingenious ads could easily catapult Paris Hilton into becoming a presidential candidate with a true grasp of real issues. As an independent, I approve of the ad and will vote for her should she decide to run, knowing well that a sunbathing President Hilton on the White House lawns would be a great treat to watch not just for Americans, but the entire world.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consultants with cracker-jack ideas run elections and advise presidents. It's a cold, hard fact of the political business. The incipient reality is that lowered expectations lead to an inability to collect critical information. A zealous focus on voting - whether we rock it, get it or altogether dismiss it - is done in total ignorance of the process beyond that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ugly truths of campaigns and elections are fully exposed. Despite Sen. John McCain's promises, seemingly gratuitous guarantees and platitudes on campaigning above the fray, the real deal remains the big-dollar retainer demons in his political closet. You can't run a &quot;clean&quot; campaign when you barely have a tattered leash on your advisers, the very &quot;peeps&quot; who make your tactical decisions while you can barely elucidate your strategy. These are the cats who run things, upon whose shoulders the burdens of the campaign fall. These are the rascally hacks of Washington who parse polls and make decisions otherwise too uncomfortable or too questionable for an elected official to make. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beltway insiders and stogie-smoking, Blackberry-tapping critters sweating the dog days of August in expensive suits know what's up. Consultants make the final decision on the strange ads we've see of late: campaign idiocy and monkeyshine at the expense of the electorate. Mr. McCain - too heated now and choleric to notice - signs off on the final copy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the uncertainty of economic hard times is of no consequence to the hacks who stayed up all night to come up with the sophomoric comparisons between Mr. Obama and sexually promiscuous Caucasian girls chased by paparazzi. Since many of the billion-plus dollars raked in this year eventually fills their pockets - $5 milk, $4 gas and the knuckle-scrape rough of living paycheck-to-paycheck don't register. They don't care. It's simpleton Washington insider rib-splitting and jokes about serious stuff; pranks rather than policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We suspect that while consultants sketched and sweated over the concept, a few garrulous bigots pushed for images of &quot;colorful&quot; celebrities. &quot;Why not compare him to someone like LeBron James or Jay-Z?&quot; A few may have nearly convinced; until the smartest, perhaps wisest of the crew (the one who didn't like the ad concept in the first place), thought loudly about how obviously racist that would seem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weeks later, television stations liberally play the notorious Britney/Paris &quot;celebrity&quot; ad beyond what the McCain campaign has probably paid for airing it. Reporters, editors and producers all join in, laughing incessantly at the bad joke. What's funny about the lack of funny is that &quot;celebrity&quot; didn't seem much of a problem when Ronald Reagan ran for president or Arnold Schwarzenegger ran for governor. Nobody said much about lackluster Fred Thompson and his quixotic, hopeless primary run. Questions about experience and leadership acumen seemed irrelevant then. Perhaps it's because these men all acted in leadership roles on the screen. Mr. Obama should call his agent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential candidates by virtue of the 24/7 media cycle are celebrities. And national campaigns are really hardcore drills on how well a potential candidate can run a country. The election? It's a popularity contest. Let's not drink the hogwash as if it's not. We prefer the Kool-Aid of common sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One could argue that media reaction to Obama &quot;arrogance&quot; is a funky racial equation of white people who have always been bothered by confident black men. It's not about bringing the man down a notch; it's about bringing the cool pose of his blackness down by several degrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But caricatures are campaign reality - whether that caricature is an editorial cartoon or a dark, seedy Web skit with a James Bond soundtrack. Due to the unprecedented and historic nature of this particular campaign, the role of caricature and cartoon is radically different - based on the legacy of nasty stereotypes and treacherous images of African Americans as buffoonish and &quot;sub-human.&quot; So, no: The New Yorker cover of Barack resplendent in jihad wear and Afro-blasted Michelle brandishing black-power motif with a Kalashnikov wasn't funny. It merely reminded those of us who've been branded with 400 years of &quot;jokes&quot; about how white people sometimes make jokes at black expense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our observation isn't so much an Obama defense as it is a thought on the sociological peculiarities of the campaign trail. Certainly, in his subtle reference to how different he looked from past presidents, Mr. Obama cleverly raised race. Poorly orchestrated? Certainly, because he can't afford the retort of uneasy white voters already nervous about who is he and what his election represents. Race card? We highly doubt it. You can't shake the double-standard contrast when comparing outrage over his race hint and the deft avoidance of commentary on Sen. Hillary Clinton's blatant use of gender to empower women voters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Letterman is doing 'Top Ten' lists about something, it has officially entered the publicconsciousness,&quot; said Dan Schnur, a political analyst with the University of Southern California.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most effective weapon against a political opponent is humor, especially mocking,&quot; said Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh. &quot;When it gets picked up by late-night comedians, it becomes part of the mainstream and reaches even more voters more effectively.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as in campaigns of the recent past, Republicans are seeking to paint their presidential opponent as elitist but also as unfit for the job of commander in chief. Although Democrats view the dog days of summer as downtime - Mr. Obama will take next week off to vacation in Hawaii with friends - the Republican Party is busy defining its opponent and setting out the terms of the debate that will begin in earnest after Labor Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every campaign is won in June, July and August, and that is especially true of presidential campaigns,&quot; Mrs. Marsh said. &quot;You use these months to plant the seeds of doubt about your opponent that will be hammered home in the ads and rhetoric of September and October.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy worked in Republican campaigns against three of the past four Democratic candidates:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Michael Dukakis - The diminutive governor of Massachusetts, also battling a perception that he was weak on national security, orchestrated a ride in a 60-ton M-1 tank, dressed in full battle gear. The helmet looked huge on the candidate, prompting weeks of jokes by Johnny Carson. A poll after the event found 25 percent of those surveyed were less likely to vote for Mr. Dukakis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Vice President Al Gore was mocked for his lack of personality and his flexibility with facts, (he never claimed he invented the Internet, but comedians had a field day anyway).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Leno joked in 2000 that during the debates, &quot;if Bush can't remember a fact or detail, Al Gore will make one up for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Sen. John Kerry, who famously said he voted for a Senate bill before he voted against it, became a caricature of a flip-flopping politician who would say or do anything to win. Mr. Leno said in 2004 that &quot;the presidential election really offers a choice of two well-informed opposing positions on every issue. They both happen to be John Kerry's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long before the &quot;swift boat&quot; ads caught Mr. Kerry off guard in a sweltering August four years ago, President Bush's re-election team embarked on a relentless $80 million advertising campaign that ran from March through May. At the end, Democrats gloated that the offensive failed - their candidate's favorability rating had dipped only slightly. But savvy pollsters noted that Mr. Kerry's negatives had skyrocketed - from the teens to the high 30 percentages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the comedic onslaughts are nothing new for the 71-year-old Mr. McCain - &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; actors told so many jokes about his age that he finally appeared on the show in a fake campaign in which he touted his &quot;oldness&quot; as a prime qualification for president - the barbs are new for Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has long been a media favorite, and cable news networks provided gushing, round-the-clock coverage of his recent European tour, including his Berlin speech to an estimated 200,000 Germans. Media watchdog groups say the first-term senator has garnered far more positive reporting than his opponent, especially during his jaunt abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama hoped to use the trip to shore up his foreign policy credentials, but Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank pulled out a line from his speech - &quot;I have become a symbol of the possibility of America returning to our best traditions&quot; - and wrote a piece titled &quot;President Obama Continues Hectic Victory Tour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A landslide followed. Gerard Baker, a columnist for the British newspaper the Times, mocked Mr. Obama in biblical terms. &quot;And so it was, in the fullness of time, before the harvest month of the appointed year, the Child ventured forth - for the first time - to bring the light unto all the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comedic vein was immediately mined by liberal icons like Mr. Stewart and Stephen Colbert, who plays a character modeled after Fox News' Bill O'Reilly as he mocks Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Colbert on Tuesday made a reference to the Democrat's claim that Americans can save as much gasoline as new offshore drilling would produce simply by properly inflating their tires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What an elitist,&quot; the comedian said as he sipped a Starbucks frappucino in a mock-effeminate pose. &quot;I hear he wants to inflate those tires with arugula.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therein lies the rub: Comedians are not pulling the persona from this air, rather using words, some a year old or more, as they paint what the Obama campaign calls a faulty caricature of their candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 27, 2007, while campaigning in Adel, Iowa, Mr. Obama sought to connect with the regular folk being squeezed by rising prices for groceries. &quot;Anybody gone into Whole Foods lately and see what they charge for arugula?&quot; he asked voters gathered for a rural issues forum (turns out there isn't an outlet of the upscale store in Iowa).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other off-the-cuff (and off-the-record) comments have been more meaty. In a private San Francisco fundraiser, he told wealthy donors that people in small rural towns - flyover country - &quot;get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee created a Web site called &quot;Audacity Watch.&quot; Nearly every day, the RNC adds an item, deeming it audacious when Mr. Obama refers to his campaign plane as &quot;O Force One&quot; or models a round placard posted on his podium after the presidential seal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign put together an ad with Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, which played almost endlessly on news channels and drew millions of hits on YouTube. An Internet ad titled &quot;The One&quot; - the nickname for Mr. Obama among top McCain aides - featured an image of Charleton Heston as Moses parting the Red Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Democrat said the McCain tack is working. &quot;To a certain extent the ads are having some effect,&quot; said Tom Daschle, a former Senate majority leader and an Obama adviser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not every Democrat agrees. &quot;The attacks on Obama have been silly and frivolous and largely without much effect,&quot; said former Clinton pollster Dick Morris. &quot;This early stuff about celebrity and arrogance are just expensive jabs, not the real knockout shots.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Associated Press</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pop culture sure moves quickly. Just last week, Paris Hilton was so 20 minutes ago. And Sen. John McCain was drawing snickers from pop culture aficionados for choosing her and another relative has-been, Britney Spears, in his attack ad against Sen. Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now, with Hilton's cheeky video riposte to the McCain&nbsp;ad thrusting her back into our collective consciousness, she's current again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so the head spins: Does that mean John McCain is now cutting edge?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her video, posted on the comedy site Funny or Die, the hotel heiress says, &quot;Hey, America, I'm Paris Hilton, and I'm a celebrity, too.&quot; Since that &quot;wrinkly white-haired guy&quot; put her in one of his ads, she says, lounging in a leopard-print swimsuit with keyhole cutouts and metallic pumps, &quot;I guess that means I'm running for president.&quot; She fuses McCain's and Obama's energy talking points into her own succinct hybrid proposal, then announces she's off to find a VP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that she had the last word. &quot;Paris Hilton might not be as big a celebrity as Barack Obama, but she obviously has a better energy plan,&quot; McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians have long used pop culture references to bring a little spark to their campaigns, and it's a risky business. When you hit it just right, it can work wonders. But you'd better make sure you're up to date. Otherwise, a campaign can be accused of being, well, so 20 minutes ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is what pop culture scholars and humorists have been saying about whoever dreamed up McCain's Paris-Britney ad, which, you'll recall, juxtaposed images of the two with footage of Obama feted by adoring crowds in Berlin, suggesting Obama's celebrity was of the same inconsequential nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris Hilton and Britney Spears? &quot;Circa 2003!&quot; quipped Daniel Kurtzman, editor of the About.com political humor page. Marty Kaplan, a media analyst and a former Democratic speechwriter, imagined the ad had been dreamed up &quot;by some aging boomer at the campaign, late at night, surrounded by old issues of People.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political satirist Andy Borowitz, meanwhile, could only note that this was the same candidate who calls his opponent &quot;Dr. No&quot; - a reference to Obama's response to McCain's energy proposals. &quot;A 1962 James Bond movie - the kids today oughtta love that!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In seriousness, many have pointed out that McCain's&nbsp;ad, and a second one using Charlton Heston's Moses to mock Obama's soaring rhetoric, amount to a clever trick: turning what are some of Obama's greatest strengths into negatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And whether the presumed Republican nominee will benefit in the polls, he's certainly gotten attention. The Project for Excellence in Journalism, which measures media coverage of the candidates, said he managed to virtually tie Obama in press attention the week of July 28-Aug. 3, for the first time since the kickoff of the general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pop culture references in campaigns haven't always involved celebrities. Walter Mondale in a 1984 debate took the inventive step of channeling a well-known commercial. Of rival Democrat Gary Hart's policies, he asked: &quot;Where's the beef?&quot; It was, of course, the slogan of the classic Wendy's ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But arguably the most famous pop culture reference in a campaign - exquisite in its succinctness - was Richard Nixon's 1968 four-word appearance on &quot;Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In,&quot; intoning the show's catch phrase, &quot;Sock it to me?&quot; (Nixon added the question mark.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He defeated Hubert Humphrey, whom producers apparently couldn't get.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">pop culture</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad Sen. John McCain's campaign created an attack ad likening Sen. Barack Obama's celebrity to that of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responses Pop culture aficionados say the ad is outdated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a video posted on the comedy site Funny or Die, Paris Hilton says, since that &quot;wrinkly white-haired guy&quot; put her in one of his ads, &quot;I guess that means I'm running for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Narrator: He's the original maverick. (Graphic: Really?)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain: The president and I agree on most issues. There was a recent study that showed I voted with the president over 90 percent of the time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Narrator: John McCain supports Bush's tax cuts for millionaires, but nothing for 100 million households. He's for billions in new oil company giveaways while gas prices soar. And for tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas. The original maverick? Or just more of the same?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis:  This Barack Obama&nbsp;ad begins with footage of a previous McCain&nbsp;commercial, in which he declared himself a maverick and took a veiled shot at President Bush by saying, &quot;We're worse off than we were four years ago.&quot; The Democrat's ad uses a 2003 Fox News interview to tie McCain to a president now far more unpopular by using the Arizona Republican's own words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is being highly selective in saying McCain supports tax cuts for millionaires. The senator from Arizona backs an extension of the Bush cuts for all income levels. The charge that he offers nothing to 100 million households -- sourced to a writer for the Nation magazine -- is based on a McCain plan to double the child dependent exemption. But McCain says that not all the childless families who wouldn't be helped are middle class, and that he offers a health-care tax credit for low-income families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is selective also in accusing McCain of backing &quot;oil company giveaways&quot; when such firms would simply benefit from his proposed overall cut in the corporate tax rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain voted against Democratic amendments to discourage moving jobs overseas; these were party-line votes with every Senate Republican in opposition. The &quot;more of the same&quot; tag line tries to cement the image of McCain, who bucked Bush on several issues, as a virtual clone of the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Narrator: Is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family? The real Obama promises higher taxes, more government spending, so: fewer jobs. Renewable energy to transform our economy, create jobs and energy independence? That's John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: This McCain&nbsp;ad again uses &quot;celebrity&quot; as an epithet, continuing the mocking theme of a previous spot likening Obama to Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. The Republican's campaign is trying to turn Obama's popularity against him, suggesting that the much-publicized politician is not the &quot;real&quot; Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is being highly selective in charging Obama with raising taxes, since he would end the Bush tax breaks only for the small fraction of individuals earning more than $200,000 a year and families earning over $250,000. Obama would boost federal spending but argues that investment in such areas as energy would create jobs, not reduce them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing that McCain -- or Obama -- has proposed would make America energy independent for years. While McCain now champions renewable energy, he opposed legislation that would extend a tax credit for producing such energy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tim Pawlenty is an uncommonly forthright man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minnesota governor, who aspires to be John McCain's vice president, said during a radio interview in the spring that his wife enjoys fishing, football and hockey. &quot;Now,&quot; Pawlenty quipped, &quot;if I could only get her to have sex with me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three months after that public pillow talk, Pawlenty is showing similar openness as he campaigns actively, if unofficially, to be McCain's mate. The governor, a regular on the supposed short list of Republican vice presidential prospects, gave a pair of speeches in Washington yesterday -- one to the GOPAC gathering of Republicans and another to the National Press Club -- that amounted to a public audition for a chance to take up residency at the Naval Observatory. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pawlenty advertised himself as a conservative: &quot;I loved Ronald Reagan.&quot; He flaunted his youthful 47 years: &quot;I came of age when he was president, running for president.&quot; He displayed his foreign policy credentials: &quot;I've been to Iraq three times.&quot; He established his economic bona fides: &quot;We closed some big budget deficits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He even presented a ready-to-wear slogan for McCain, as catchy and populist as John Edwards's &quot;two Americas.&quot; &quot;We have to be the party of Sam's Club Republicans, not just country club Republicans,&quot; the would-be No. 2 said over the clink of silver on china at the press club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All in all, a strong audition -- and it had to be to keep up with his rivals. With vice presidential announcements by McCain and Barack Obama just weeks, if not days, away, Republican and Democratic aspirants are aggressively marketing themselves before the television cameras this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Daschle, a possible Obama pick, was vending his wares at least twice in the past week on CNN. Another aspiring Obama mate, Bill Richardson, has been presenting his credentials (&quot;in the year 2000, when I was energy secretary . . .&quot;) on CNN, Fox and MSNBC this week. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a possible McCain partner, was on Fox. Meanwhile, Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana, an Obama hopeful, and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, a McCain suitor, did joint auditions on both MSNBC and CNN yesterday. They debated energy policy and deflected questions about the real reason they were there. &quot;It's good for my ego, but probably not much else,&quot; said Bayh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't talk about that process,&quot; said Crist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're rooting for both of you,&quot; said MSNBC's Joe Scarborough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But nobody has kept pace with Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and a McCain VP hopeful, who has made no fewer than five broadcast appearances in three days, repeatedly describing Obama as &quot;an Internet date.&quot; As for his own ambitions? &quot;I don't expect to be a member of the ticket.&quot; Not that he'd mind, of course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That left Pawlenty with a lot of catching up to do as he arrived for an early-morning speech to GOPAC. He mentioned not only his relative youth and his affection for Reagan, but also his concern that Republican ideas have become &quot;a little stagnant.&quot; And he established himself as an above-the-fray choice for McCain as he praised Obama: &quot;Say what you will about Barack Obama, people gravitate when you have something positive to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor used his downtime after the morning speech to add to his recent round of media interviews. Then he was back on stage at lunchtime, opening his speech to the press club with a tease about the VP selection process. &quot;One of the questions that inevitability will come is, 'When will the decision be made? Who will he pick?' &quot; Pawlenty said. &quot;And I just want to address that right off the top. I don't have any particular insights as to where Brett Favre is going to play next year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pawlenty's style was conversational and fluid, but not captivating. His theme, the &quot;Sam's Club Republicans,&quot; was just another way of talking about Reagan Democrats. Many of his solutions (&quot;school choice&quot;) were Republican boilerplate, and his recommendations -- be &quot;pragmatic,&quot; and &quot;ideas matter&quot; -- were often trite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he made up for that with his generous show of loyalty toward his would-be boss. Iraq? &quot;The surge has worked. I agree with Senator McCain.&quot; McCain's recent turn to negative campaigning? &quot;Unavoidable.&quot; McCain's&nbsp;ad likening Obama to Paris Hilton? &quot;A legitimate line of inquiry.&quot; McCain's life experiences? &quot;Epic. They are legendary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pawlenty performed his audition using the language of the PowerPoint presentation. &quot;We are the party of markets,&quot; he explained, going on to discuss voters as &quot;our potential customers,&quot; the 2006 &quot;loss of market share,&quot; and a &quot;more effective government at a better price,&quot; and, inevitably, the use of &quot;benchmarks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a bonus, Pawlenty checked another box on the McCain VP requirement list: distance from President Bush. He praised &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot; but added: &quot;That has to be more than just a label.&quot; Indirectly, he also scolded Bush for Republicans' &quot;slow&quot; awakening to conservation and their ideological &quot;doldrums.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He got tripped up a bit when asked to square his Sam's Club idea with the &quot;evangelicals and the neoconservatives [who] took over the GOP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The metaphor only goes so far,&quot; he conceded. But he recovered in time to answer a question about the most important qualities in a prospective vice presidential candidate. &quot;Discretion,&quot; Pawlenty said. The audition was over.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">724 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first question I asked John McCain and then Barack Obama was: How do you feel about the tone and direction of the campaign so far?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No surprise. Both men pronounced themselves thoroughly frustrated by the personal bitterness and negativism they have seen in the two months since they learned they would be running against each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very sorry about it,&quot; McCain said in a Saturday interview at his Arlington headquarters. &quot;I think we could have avoided at least some of this if we had agreed to do the town hall meetings&quot; together, as he had suggested, during the summer months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, in a phone interview yesterday  from Elkhart, Ind., argued that &quot;the classic tit-for-tat campaigning&quot; of recent weeks &quot;is part of the politics of the past that we have to move beyond.&quot; Ironically, having turned down McCain's proposal for weekly joint town halls, Obama argued that the formal debates, starting in late September, may refocus the campaign on real issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 4, McCain proposed 10 town-hall-style debates before screened audiences of uncommitted independent voters across the country. Obama countered by offering two such sessions this summer, one on Independence Day and one in August, and the idea died. Three days ago, Obama said he would participate only in the three debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, the first of which is scheduled for Sept. 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the idea of joint town meetings was scrapped, the campaign has featured tough and often negative ads and speeches. They culminated last week in an exchange in which Obama said that McCain and his supporters were calling attention to the Democrat's unusual name and the fact that &quot;he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign in turn accused Obama of playing &quot;the race card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the interviews, both candidates expressed indignation at what was being said about them. &quot;I'm not going to be smeared,&quot; McCain declared. &quot;I went through that once, and I'm not going to do it again. . . . If anybody says I'm a racist . . . I'm not going to stand for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama insisted that he had never made such an accusation. And he condemned McCain for suggesting that &quot;I would rather lose a war to win a political campaign. That is patently offensive. When his campaign ran an ad suggesting that I had refused to visit wounded troops because I couldn't have TV cameras with me, reporters immediately said that was patently false. . . . I'm not going to sit back and let my record be distorted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I asked Obama how he thought the campaign could be returned to the issues, he said he hoped that the two conventions would &quot;offer each party a chance to showcase its best ideas&quot; and that the three scheduled presidential debates then &quot;will allow people to see Senator McCain and myself interact in a way that keeps people more honest because you're standing there face to face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I told Obama that McCain made exactly that point in arguing for the early joint appearances. What McCain actually said was: &quot;When you have to stand on a stage with your opponent, as I've done in other campaigns, you obviously have a tendency to improve the relationship. . . . When you have to spend time with somebody, I think it changes the equation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked Obama if he had any regrets about turning down McCain's early June invitation to start the joint appearances back then. He said, &quot;I think the notion that somehow as a consequence of not having joint appearances, Senator McCain felt obliged to suggest that I'd rather lose a war to win a campaign doesn't automatically follow. I think we each have control over ourselves and our campaigns, and we have to take responsibility for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also noted, &quot;We responded with an offer of doing five debates, rather than the traditional three, which the McCain campaign declined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My general point,&quot; Obama continued, &quot;is that both the conventions and the debates will offer formats for Senator McCain and myself to make our best case to the American people at a time when the American people will be paying attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And ultimately, the best corrective to overly negative campaigns are the American people, who are not interested in a lot of bickering but are interested in who's got the best answers for the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think everybody would agree with that last point.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama released a television advertisement yesterday that questions John McCain's claims to be a &quot;maverick,&quot; and he charged in a campaign appearance that the Republican displays independence only when it suits him politically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama aides said Democratic hand-wringing about polls showing that the presidential race remains tight had nothing to do with the volleys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so-called campaign strategists on cable TV,&quot; spokesman Bill Burton said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ad and the Democrat's rhetoric in Indiana appeared to up the ante in a campaign that took a distinct turn toward the negative last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The price [McCain] paid for his party's nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position,&quot; Obama told a crowd of more than 1,000 at a high school gym in Elkhart. &quot;That doesn't meet my definition of a maverick. You can't be a maverick when politically it's important for you but not a maverick when it doesn't work for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parries come more than a week after his Republican opponent launched a string of increasingly personal attacks on Obama. McCain has said that his rival would lose a war in order to win a campaign, accused him of going to a gym rather than visiting wounded troops, and, while aides asserted that he had &quot;played the race card,&quot; hinted that Obama has a messiah complex and portrayed him as a celebrity comparable to Paris Hilton or Britney Spears. That final line of assault continued yesterday with a new McCain&nbsp;ad, again mocking Obama as &quot;the biggest celebrity in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such attacks have raised worries among Democratic strategists -- haunted by John F. Kerry's 2004 run and Al Gore's razor-thin loss in 2000 -- that Obama has not responded in kind with a parallel assault on McCain's character. Interviews with nearly a dozen Democratic strategists found those concerns to be widespread, although few wished to be quoted by name while Obama's campaign is demanding unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats are worried,&quot; said Tad Devine, a top strategist for Kerry who thinks Obama must stay on the high road. &quot;We've been through two very tough elections at the national level, and it's very easy to lose confidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's latest ad may be his toughest yet, using words and images to link McCain to President Bush and concluding: &quot;The original maverick? Or just more of the same?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Democratic strategists said that it is nothing like the character attacks by McCain, and that the response could be far nastier, perhaps raising McCain's ethical scrape in the Keating Five savings and loan scandal, mocking his family wealth and designer shoes, or highlighting his age. After McCain economic adviser Phil Gramm suggested that the United States has become &quot;a nation of whiners,&quot; Democratic strategists said Obama should have immediately started an ad blitz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If somebody attacks you, you have to frame the attack: 'This is the same old politics, or better yet, the Bush-Rove politics,' &quot; something Obama has done well, said one Democratic strategist. &quot;At the same time you do that, you have to counterattack. You don't want to look like a whiner. You want to look tough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said another Democratic consultant: &quot;There needs to be a negative McCain track beyond the Bush policy stuff. One of the great strengths of the Obama campaign has been to not listen to the D.C. chattering class. They have a plan and they stick to it. But clearly, the D.C. chattering class are all wringing their hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A liberal advertising consultant said: &quot;There's frustration there because they're watching these childish ad campaigns, and they know exactly how to answer it, but they're powerless to do so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powerless, that is, because most of the independent groups that would have taken the lead in such an independent campaign have been sidelined by Obama's insistence that Democratic donors channel their money to him, rather than outside groups. Obama's efforts have succeeded in maintaining message discipline in a campaign predicated on what the senator from Illinois has called a new kind of politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that has hamstrung what would have been one of the three fronts on which Democrats had hoped to wage the 2008 campaign, said Donna Brazile, Gore's 2000 campaign manager. Obama's team was able to push back quickly against McCain's character attacks, she said, and the Democratic National Committee is beginning to engage the Republican National Committee in a more cutting effort, yesterday starting an &quot;Exxon-McCain '08&quot; campaign that portrays the Republican as the running mate of the oil giant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the surrogate groups remain dormant, Brazile said, because of Obama's decision to cut them out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are no independent groups. Everybody's walked off the field,&quot; said Tom Matzzie, who left MoveOn.org to form Progressive Media USA specifically to launch a massive attack against McCain. The group has since disbanded for lack of funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, said Eli Pariser, MoveOn.org's executive director, the best response to McCain's celebrity attack has come from Paris Hilton herself, who released her own ad Tuesday calling McCain &quot;the oldest celebrity in the world, like super old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consultants close to Obama say the Democrat has good reason not to risk his own campaign by following McCain's lead. Because McCain has accepted public financing for the general-election campaign, he must spend all his primary campaign money before the party conventions. Obama is focusing on turning out voters, while airing a mix of positive ads and responses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And more ads may not help, according to a Pew Research Center poll released yesterday. Nearly half of respondents -- including 51 percent of independents -- said they have been hearing too much about Obama lately, and 22 percent said all that news has made them feel less favorable toward him. On the other hand, significantly more Americans view McCain's ads as mostly negative than say the same of Obama's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Obama opted out of public financing and the spending limits that come with it, he will be free to swamp McCain with television spots in the fall. If he needs to become more negative at that point, he can -- knowing that McCain would be hard pressed to reply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokesman Burton said the campaign sees no reason to shift strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a classic Washington story, anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy, data or plan,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor's note: Our Aug. 3 editorial &quot;Campaign is no place for religious bigotry,&quot; about Mitt Romney, John McCain and the evangelical vote, is generating considerable reader response on our Web site. We publish some of these unedited comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hey Wash. Times. Newspaper articles are not a place for Religious Bigotry either - against evangelicals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RedCentral</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney was free to send his delegates anywhere he wanted to after he dropped out just as Huckabee had the right to send his delegates anywhere he wanted when he dropped out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney dropped out when he realized he had no chance and immediately pledged his support to McCain (something he, ironically, has been heavily criticized for doing by Huckabee supporters in comments section over the last few days) while Huckabee stayed in the race far past the date when he was a viable candidate costing McCain additional moneys to campaign against him and, to my knowledge, has been lukewarm, at best, in helping McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I seriously doubt either Huckabee or Romney will be the VP candidate, but, if McCain picked anyone over Huckabee who could blame him? Huckabee has done precious little to support McCain's efforts at getting elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As countless people have stated in these forums over the last few days, the evangelical vote is split. If Huckabee has done little in support of McCain and can't guarantee the evangelical vote, why should McCain pick him for VP?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rose from Ohio</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a black person and a Mormon, I have watched this year's campaign with some bemusement. McCain is already getting the &quot;I won't vote for a black guy vote.&quot; The &quot;I won't vote for a Mormon vote,&quot; while it overlaps somewhat with the other, is much larger. If McCain picks Romney, He will definitely lose. That's the reality of the very bigoted life in these United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an evangelical, I would support Romney or Huckabee as McCain's VP pick. McCain himself is the real problem. I will be voting for him anyway, since I have come to realize that since there are only two choices a stiff necked refusal to accept the lesser of evils will assure that we get the greater of evils. Now , what about the old fashioned bigotry of the WT editorial staff, who profess to know the heats of evangelicals and judge them to be bad?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maxom</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a conservative Presbyterian deeply involved in moving the church of which I am a member from the super liberal PCUSA to the much more conservative EPC, I feel my evangelical credentials are not suspect and I agree with the WT editorial position. Romney is a fine man with a distinguished record in both the private and public sector. His personal morals are consistent with those who call themselves evangelicals. This is not a perfect world and you you will find no perfect candidate. Staying home and allowing Barack Obama (the exact opposite of what evangelicals want) to be elected is what gives evangelicals the reputation of being bull headed and stupid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sjoiii</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who the hell are you to accuse me or anyone else of bigotry? Are you some kind of mind reader? Since when does not being interested in a political candidate put you in the same category as the Ku Klux Klan? Since when does a politician or some Editor have the right to publicly slander you, your religion and your constitutional right to vote for whomever you want for whatever your reason?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has been covered already, even on this very site just last week. Is there no end to your love of fueling the fire? Or is this the only way you get readers to visit your site?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is only a very small bigoted minority of evangelical Christians that are causing trouble by behaving as bullies. I am an evangelical who voted for Romney, as did my Baptist sister and a number of folks I know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, I have encountered many hateful anti-Mormon evangelicals on various blogs. This small rabid bigoted group reminds me of the liberals. Liberals are a small segment of the Democratic party, yet they are bullies that demand that all moderates abide by their agenda. These extreme groups, whether extreme right or extreme left never seem to learn that mainstream society will not vote them into the White House. How many elections have the Dems lost due to nominating liberal candidates?!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This huckabee-loving anti-Mormon group could learn a lot from the Dems as to what happens when a small rabid group tries to dictate how our nation will be governed. It is way past time for the bigots to get a clue!!!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shelbysez</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I live in the bible belt (upstate SC) and there were a lot of evangelical Christians and evangelical leaders for Romney at first but then found out about his record and also did not like his attack ad. They all now say they were wrong for not supporting Huckabee. This fact has been on the news and in the papers. Romney has way less support now then he did when he was running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't blame it on evangelical Christians - they supported him at first but now back Huckabee for VP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">winwinaround</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a Mormon, I can verify that Mormons have never had any qualms whatsoever about voting for an Evangelical. We do disagree on some religious issues, but agree on others. There are some Evangelicals that will be more inclined to emphasize our points of agreement including some fairly significant social beliefs - and there will be some Evangelicals that will want to point out our differences. I do not feel inclined at all to say what Evangelicals should call themselves. Let them call themselves Christians, Followers, Disciples, Theists, whatever they would like. It is how they live their lives that is most important to me. Except for a small minority of bad apples that are present in every religion (including my own), Evangelicals are a good community of people clearly trying to live right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AdrianL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugh, I wish the media would just ignore both Romney and Huckabee. Even though I supported the latter during the primaries, I really hope McCain can get either Condi Rice or Colin Powell on board as VP. Both are strong on defense and very accomplished and well, let's be honest, black. Fight fire with fire, I say.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Stephen Dinan, THE WASHINGTON TIMES</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAGE ONE; A01</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris Hilton may think John McCain is just a &quot;wrinkly white-haired guy,&quot; but the Republican presidential candidate apparently has figured out the younger generation just fine. Over the past two weeks, his &quot;celebrity&quot; attacks have stomped Democratic presidential opponent Sen. Barack Obama in YouTube hits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain has pumped out a series of brutal yet entertaining attack ads and Web videos mocking the press and Mr. Obama, and the combination of wit and insult has pushed his YouTube channel to the sixth most watched on the site this week. Mr. McCain has beat Mr. Obama's channel for seven straight days and 11 of the past 14 days, in a signal he intends to compete for the YouTube vote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is a giant reversal. Mr. Obama had been quadrupling Mr. McCain's YouTube views and beat him every day since February, according to TubeMogul, which tracks online video viewing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to know who he hired. They went from recycling their TV ads to like putting out these witty shorts,&quot; said David Burch, marketing manager for TubeMogul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign said it was simply a decision to have fun with commercials, like the &quot;Celebrity&quot; ad released last week that compared Mr. Obama to Miss Hilton and Britney Spears, and &quot;The One&quot; Web ad that mocks the adulation from Obama supporters and compares the Democrat to Moses as he parts the Red Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The videos were linked on key sites such as the Drudge Report and broke into mainstream coverage through television and celebrity blogs, expanding viewership to people Mr. McCain has never reached before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we knew it would draw some attention. I don't think we knew it would be as big a hit on YouTube,&quot; said spokesman Brian Rogers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the attention it drew was a rebuke from Miss Hilton's mother, a McCain campaign contributor. Even some Republicans said it was beneath Mr. McCain, who had promised a campaign on the issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Hilton responded with her own Web video Tuesday night comparing Mr. McCain to &quot;Star Wars&quot; character Yoda and calling him &quot;old enough to remember when dancing was a sin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While basking in the sun in a bikini, Miss Hilton says that since she's been dragged into the race, she would offer up some ideas of her own to combine both candidates' ideas: &quot;We can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get Detroit making hybrid and electric cars. That way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's actually surreal,&quot; Mr. Rogers said about the attention and the response from Miss Hilton. &quot;I know that Senator McCain watched Paris Hilton and thought it was hilarious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's YouTube channel beat Mr. McCain's every day from February through mid-July, when Mr. McCain's new style began to show. That was when the campaign launched &quot;Obama Love,&quot; mocking press coverage of the Democrat, set to Frankie Valli's &quot;Can't Take My Eyes Off You.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That video was pulled after Warner Music Group lodged a copyright claim, but not before it helped Mr. McCain to several YouTube viewership victories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican followed it up late last month with the celebrity ad featuring Miss Hilton and Miss Spears and announced another commercial Wednesday continuing the celebrity attack, with the announcer wondering: &quot;Is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign has studiously avoided talking about Mr. McCain's celebrity attacks, instead responding to the substance of the attacks included in most ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama himself couldn't resist, telling voters last week that the Spears-Hilton references were demeaning to the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the seriousness of the issues, you'd think we could have a serious debate,&quot; he said in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. &quot;But so far, all we've been hearing about is Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. I mean, I do have to ask my opponent, is that the best you can come up with? Is that really what this election is about? Is that what is worthy of the American people?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, Mr. Obama's YouTube channel still dominates, with 51 million all-time video views. Rep. Ron Paul, Texas Republican, is second with 15.3 million views and Mr. McCain trails in third with 8.3 million views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama folks get it,&quot; said Mr. Burch at TubeMogul. He said they always have new material coming out to keep continually peaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. McCain is catching up, with 4.1 million views this month compared with Mr. Obama's 2 million as of Wednesday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He made a smart move because he jumped out of the political blogosphere and chattering class, and got into the celebrity chattering class, and that's where most of the energy is,&quot; said David All, a Republican strategist who runs Slatecard.com, an online contributions site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. All attributed the change in attitude to the elevation of Steve Schmidt at the McCain campaign. The former Bush White House aide and campaign aide to California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger took over day-to-day operations at the McCain campaign a month ago and brought an aggressiveness that put the campaign beyond the usual political talk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The [Stephen] Colberts, Jon Stewarts, Saturday Night Lives, all of those things do a really great job of helping humanize a really great candidate, a really authentic candidate,&quot; Mr. All said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Trippi, a Democratic consultant credited with bringing campaigning into the Internet age when he managed Howard Dean's 2004 presidential bid, said the ads are the best entry Republicans have made in competing for YouTube attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, they've entered the fray. These are clearly successful - the right take on humor, the right mix,&quot; he said. &quot;Any time you take items out of the pop culture, like Paris Hilton or someone who's in that world, there's a chance it'll go viral.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said Mr. Obama is right not to get baited into talking about the celebrity charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a classic strategy. Push off and get back to your issues. It's not a good idea to dwell on the turf McCain wants you to dwell on,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GEE, I wonder why, if you have a black man running for high public office -- say, Barack Obama or Harold Ford -- the opposition feels compelled to run low-life political ads featuring tacky, sexually provocative white women who have no connection whatsoever to the black male candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spare me any more drivel about the high-mindedness of John McCain. You knew something was up in March when, in his first ad of the general campaign, McCain had himself touted as &quot;the American president Americans have been waiting for.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was nothing subtle about that attempt to position Obama as the Other, a candidate who might technically be American but who remained in some sense foreign, not sufficiently patriotic and certainly not one of us -- the &quot;us&quot; being the genuine red-white-and-blue Americans the ad was aimed at.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, McCain has only upped the ante, smearing Obama every which way from sundown. Last Wednesday, The Washington Post ran an extraordinary front-page article that began: &quot;For four days, Sen. John McCain and his allies have accused Sen. Barack Obama of snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him, despite no evidence that the charge is true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence? McCain needs no evidence. His campaign is about trashing the opposition, Karl Rove-style. Not satisfied with calling his opponent's patriotism into question, McCain added what amounted to a charge of treason, insisting that Obama would actually prefer that the United States lose a war if that would mean that he -- Obama -- would not have to lose an election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now comes the slimy Britney Spears and Paris Hilton ad. The two highly sexualized women (both notorious for displaying themselves to the paparazzi while not wearing underwear) are shown briefly and incongruously at the beginning of a commercial critical of Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee targeted Harold Ford with a similarly disgusting ad in 2006 when Ford, then a congressman, was running a strong race for a U.S. Senate seat in Tennessee. The ad, which the committee described as a parody, showed a scantily clad woman whispering, &quot;Harold, call me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both ads were foul, poisonous and emanated from the upper reaches of the Republican Party. (What a surprise.) Both were designed to exploit the hostility, anxiety and resentment of the many white Americans who are still freakishly hung up on the idea of black men rising above their station and becoming sexually involved with white women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racial fantasy factor in this presidential campaign is out of control. It was at work in that New Yorker cover that caused such a stir. (Obama in Muslim garb with the American flag burning in the fireplace.) It's driving the idea that Obama is somehow presumptuous, too arrogant, too big for his britches -- a man who obviously does not know his place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has to endure these grotesque insults with a smile and heroic levels of equanimity. The reason he has to do this -- the sole reason -- is that he is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So there he was last week speaking evenly, and with a touch of humor, to a nearly all-white audience in Missouri. His goal was to reassure his listeners, to let them know he's not some kind of unpatriotic ogre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama told them: &quot;What they're going to try to do is make you scared of me. You know, he's not patriotic enough. He's got a funny name. You know, he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills, you know. He's risky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The audience seemed to appreciate his comments. Obama was well-received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain didn't appreciate them. RACE CARD! RACE CARD! The McCain camp started bellowing, and it hasn't stopped since. With great glee bursting through their feigned outrage, the campaign's operatives and the candidate himself accused Obama of introducing race into the campaign -- playing the race card, as they put it, from the very bottom of the deck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever you think about Obama, he does not want the race issue to be front and center in this campaign. Every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for McCain. So I guess we understand McCain's motivation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, it's frustrating to watch McCain calling out Obama on race. Obama has spoken more honestly and thoughtfully about race than any other politician in many years. McCain is the head of a party that has viciously exploited race for political gain for decades.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">772 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You could write the formula with mathematical precision. The higher the price of oil and the lower the number of days until the election, the shriller the rhetoric, the grander the promises and the dumber the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exhibit A, campaign 2008, is John McCain. Just a few months ago, McCain had an energy policy that, while hardly perfect, was in the ballpark of reasonable. He had broken with his party on climate change and understood the importance of weaning America from its carbon habit. He proposed a palette of solutions: nuclear power, clean coal, plug-in hybrids, biofuels. You could argue that McCain's plan overemphasized nuclear energy or spent too little on renewable energy, but it was hardly Bush-Cheney revisited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came McCain's reversal on new offshore drilling. This wasn't, in itself, the problem. The moratorium on drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf has been in place for almost three decades. It is more a matter of theology than logic to believe that the combination of improved technology and increased prices does not justify reconsidering the environmental balance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the unthinking zeal of the newly converted, McCain has morphed into a believer in the magical power of drilling. &quot;We have to drill here and drill now,&quot; he has taken to crying on the campaign trail, as if he could get more sweet crude gushing by, say, November. On Monday, McCain, whose 2008 Senate attendance record is rather spotty, demanded that Congress &quot;come back into town&quot; to pass an energy bill. &quot;Let's get this energy crisis solved,&quot; he proclaimed, as if a few weeks might make a difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is the matter of misrepresentation. For all the focus on Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, the real problem with McCain's &quot;celebrity&quot; ad was that it falsely accused Obama of wanting to &quot;raise taxes on electricity.&quot; As FactCheck.org noted, the McCain campaign based this claim on a single interview in which Obama rejected the notion of taxing wind energy, saying that instead &quot;what we ought to tax is dirty energy.&quot; This is, FactCheck concluded, &quot;a feeble peg on which to hang&quot; the claim that Obama wants to raise your electricity bill. In fact, the cap-and-trade program that both candidates support is, in effect, just such a tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's cute campaign trick was to celebrate Barack Obama's 47th birthday by distributing tire pressure gauges labeled &quot;Obama Energy Plan,&quot; mocking the Democrat's suggestion that drivers improve gas mileage by properly inflating their tires. This trivial-sounding move could save millions of barrels of oil annually. The Bush Energy Department urges drivers to do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This brings us to Exhibit B, which is, you may have guessed, Obama. He got the good-policy merit badge for resisting peer pressure (McCain plus Hillary Clinton) for a gas tax holiday. He would spend $150 billion over 10 years, far more than McCain would, to promote alternative sources of energy. So far, so good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Obama campaign has taken a decided turn toward the less responsible in the past week. I'm not talking about his evolution on drilling. However poll-driven, this is eminently sensible: He's not itching for more but willing to consider it in certain areas as part of a broader, bipartisan compromise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same can't be said for his deja-vu-all-over-again proposal to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (see Al Gore 2000, John Kerry 2004), or for his $1,000-per-family &quot;energy rebate,&quot; a whopping $65 billion cost to be paid for with a windfall-profits tax. Just a month ago, Obama was saying that there was no need to tap the reserve and that such a move should be saved for a &quot;genuine emergency.&quot; Oil was more than $140 a barrel then. It's less than $120 a barrel now. What's changed, except for the better? Still, as gimmicks go, tapping the reserve is a more effective one than a gas tax holiday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for a windfall-profits tax, if you want to produce more energy, it hardly makes sense to give oil companies less incentive to make investments. Nor does it make sense to tax companies because market conditions boost their profits -- any more than homeowners and shareholders should be penalized for selling during a boom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, too, has descended to misleading. He accuses McCain of wanting to give $4 billion in tax breaks to oil companies -- without mentioning that this is no special oil-only deal, just part of McCain's proposal for an overall reduction in the corporate tax rate, something Obama has said he'd consider. Does that put him in the pocket of Big Oil, too?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And another question: If this is the state of the discussion in August, what will October bring?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> Paris for President? </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a two-minute video posted last night on the comedy site FunnyorDie.com, hotel heiress Paris Hilton announced her candidacy -- thanks to Sen. John McCain's&nbsp;ad comparing Sen. Barack Obama to her and Britney Spears. Though her parents have contributed to McCain's campaign, Hilton is no McCainiac. But she's not for Obama, either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True to form, she's all about Paris. She wants pop star Rihanna as VP and might paint the White House pink. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, America, I'm Paris Hilton, and I'm a celebrity, too. Only I'm not from the olden days and I'm not promising change like that other guy. I'm just hot,&quot; she says, sitting on a lounge chair and wearing a skimpy one-piece leopard swimsuit. &quot;But then that wrinkly white-haired guy used me in his campaign ad, which I guess means I'm running for president. So thanks for the endorsement, white-haired dude. And I want America to know that, I'm like, totally ready to lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's even got a sober take on energy policy:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, why don't we do a hybrid of both candidates' ideas? We can do limited offshore drilling -- with strict environmental oversight -- while creating tax incentives to get Detroit making hybrid and electric cars. That way, the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in, which will then create new jobs and energy independence. Energy crisis solved!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This might just be Paris's best acting role yet.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">First Lady Tyra? </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new must-print for fashion and celebrity magazines: anything about the Obamas. (Sen. Barack Obama and wife Michelle have mugged for recent issues of People and Us Weekly and for Essence magazine's September issue.) But Harper's Bazaar took a different tack for its September glossy, casting models as the Obamas in an Oval Office photo shoot, with talk show host and former supermodel Tyra Banks posed as Michelle Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michelle is &quot;one hot mama,&quot; Banks, an Obama supporter, told the mag. &quot;With Barack Obama, his becoming president is them becoming president because Michelle was there from the beginning. Without Michelle, he wouldn't be there.&quot; And on her preferred first-lady hairstyle: &quot;My question isn't to flip or not to flip,&quot; Banks says. &quot;Mine would be to weave or not to weave.&quot;<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">More Prying Eyes </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following news this spring that several UCLA Medical Center employees had peeked at confidential medical records of famous patients -- among them Britney Spears, Farrah Fawcett and California first lady Maria Shriver -- a report released Monday revealed that 59 additional employees at the hospital had been snooping through patients' records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Los Angeles Times, the California Department of Public Health report brings the number of workers implicated in the growing scandal to 127, and faults the hospital for not taking steps to maintain patient confidentiality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times reported in March that UCLA had suspended six employees, planned to fire 13 others and disciplined six physicians for looking at the records of Spears, who was hospitalized in the UCLA psychiatric ward in January. And in April, former hospital  administrative specialist Lawanda Jackson was indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly selling information from Fawcett's records to the media, according to the Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 59 employees now linked to the breaches, 24 still worked at the hospital when they were identified. The hospital has proposed firing seven and suspending or otherwise disciplining many others, while three remain under investigation.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">End Quote </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to have three bullheads in there. I originally wanted six, but the guy who has to clean it once a week said that he's not going to get in the tank with six of them, he'll get in with three. Once they get big enough, I'll have to get rid of them. The guy who cleans the tank actually goes and catches the sharks himself, because you know, these sharks you can't just go buy, they're illegal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- From an Aug. 4 entry on Wizards superstar Gilbert Arenas's blog, explaining what's going into the 10,000-gallon shark tank that he knocked out a wall for in his Great Falls basement. Arenas credits &quot;Jaws&quot; with his love of sharks, as well as &quot;when I saw 'Cribs' and Ice T had a shark tank in the back of his place, I was like, 'Oh man! That's what it is!!' &quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEREA, Ohio, Aug. 5</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barack Obama and John McCain used an ongoing debate over energy policy to tack back to core themes of their campaigns Tuesday, with Obama blasting his rival for the presidency as a clone of the current administration and the Republican seeking to revive his reputation as someone willing to buck his party on major issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, campaigning in Ohio, said a McCain administration would be &quot;four more years of oil companies calling the shots.&quot; Arguing he would do more than McCain to reduce gasoline prices, the senator from Illinois repeatedly attempted to connect McCain to President Bush and Vice President Cheney, both former oil company executives, saying &quot;after one president in the pocket of the oil companies -- we can't afford another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember that when George Bush took office, he had an energy policy, he turned to Dick Cheney and he told Cheney, 'Go take care of this.' &quot; Obama told a crowd at a gym in Youngstown, Ohio. &quot;John McCain's taking a page out of the Bush-Cheney playbook.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain countered with a new television ad that will appear in crucial battleground states. The spot declares that &quot;Washington's broken&quot; and &quot;we're worse off than we were four years ago,&quot; paraphrasing a line Ronald Reagan used to criticize Jimmy Carter almost three decades ago. While not criticizing Bush by name, the senator from Arizona pledged to &quot;battle Big Oil&quot; and &quot;make America  prosper again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing in front of a nuclear power facility in Michigan, where he touted his plan to build 45 new plants by 2030, McCain noted that it was Obama, not he, who had voted for Bush's 2005 energy bill, which included major subsidies for oil companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he might be a little bit confused, because when the energy bill came to the floor of the Senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies, I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it,&quot; he said. &quot;People care not only what you say, but how you vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and Democrats in Congress have consistently sought to tie McCain to Bush's fading fortunes, labeling the Republican nominee &quot;McSame&quot; and running ads that feature McCain praising Bush. On Tuesday, Democrats unveiled a Web site called &quot;The Next Cheney,&quot; in which they seek to compare McCain's possible running mates to the current vice president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For McCain, the maneuvering has been more delicate as he tries to distance himself from the unpopular head of his party, while not angering the many conservatives who still back Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican sources said Tuesday that Cheney -- one of the most controversial figures in the Bush administration -- is not scheduled to appear at the Republican National Convention next month, where McCain will be chosen as the new leader of the party. &quot;His schedule hasn't been set for next week, let alone next month,&quot; said Megan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Cheney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's assertion in his new ad, that the state of affairs has grown worse in the past four years, contrasts sharply with his declaration months ago that &quot;Americans overall are better off, because we have had a pretty good, prosperous time, with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the second consecutive day, both candidates focused on their energy plans, as high gas prices continued to be one of the biggest issues of the presidential race. Obama touted his energy proposals as he campaigned in Youngstown and Berea, two working-class towns in eastern Ohio, appearing with Sen. Sherrod Brown and Gov. Ted Strickland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain toured the Enrico Fermi 2 nuclear power plant near Monroe, Mich., as he sought to highlight his support for nuclear power as a key to the country's independence from foreign sources of energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wearing a hard hat with earplugs attached, protective glasses and gloves, McCain toured the plant's control room and turbines, asking questions about safety and training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the visit raised questions about his repeated insistence that nuclear power is free from safety concerns. The first Fermi reactor -- located adjacent to the reactor McCain toured -- suffered a partial meltdown and was mothballed in 1972.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he often does, McCain noted the U.S. Navy's experience with nuclear-powered ships and submarines, and his experience on the first such ship, the USS Enterprise. &quot;I knew it was safe then, and I know it's safe now,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April, he said: &quot;My friends, the United States Navy has sailed ships around the world for more than 50 years with nuclear power plants on them and we've never had a single accident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But last week, the Navy reported that a nuclear-powered sub leaked tiny amounts of radioactive water as it navigated the globe. The Navy said the leak from the USS Houston was negligible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Safety is always a concern when it comes to power sources, but ultimately the perfect shouldn't be the enemy of the good, and nuclear power is an important part of John McCain's 'all of the above' approach to gaining energy independence,&quot; said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain used the appearance at the nuclear plant to assert once again that Obama &quot;says no&quot; to the energy solutions the Republican is pushing, including increased exploration for oil and natural gas off the nation's coastlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact is, we have to drill here and we have to drill now and we have to drill immediately,&quot; McCain said, repeating a now-common refrain. &quot;I believe that it's vital that we move forward with that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Solving our national energy crisis requires an 'all of the above' approach,&quot; McCain said. &quot;Senator Obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants 'doesn't make sense for America.' He also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing. I couldn't disagree more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama aides, on the defensive in recent weeks as the McCain campaign has repeatedly described him as &quot;Dr. No&quot; on energy, emphasized Tuesday that their candidate backs the use of nuclear power, although he has been less bullish on the technology than McCain. Obama has said the security of nuclear fuel and waste must be addressed before an expansion of nuclear power is considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days, Obama has modified his positions on key energy issues, saying he would remove oil from the nation's emergency reserves to reduce gas prices in the short term and could back some offshore oil drilling. But he blasted McCain's focus on drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's what he talked about yesterday, 'I want to drill here. I want to drill now,' &quot; Obama said, quoting McCain talking in South Dakota on Monday. &quot;I don't know where he was standing. I think he was in a building somewhere. This plan will not lower prices today; it won't lower prices during the next administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also cast McCain's recent tactics, such as airing an ad that likened the Democratic nominee to celebrities Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, as part of his move toward Bush's style of politics, which Obama pledges to change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain wants to talk about Paris Hilton and Britney Spears -- that's his idea of a relevant campaign -- but I don't have time to deal with that mess,&quot; Obama said to loud applause at a high school in Youngstown.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumptive Republican nominee John McCain has taken out a $6 million ad buy for airtime during the Beijing Games that open Friday, $1 million more than Democratic rival Barack Obama had previously committed to his own media buy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign declined to comment. But the public file at NBC Universal confirmed the purchase. McCain ads are to run in a variety of time slots, including prime time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broadcast network is airing 3,600 hours of Olympic coverage on NBC, CNBC, MSNBC, USA Network, Oxygen and Telemundo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertising Age, which first reported the buy, said the spending by the two campaigns marked the first substantial buys of national network TV by any presidential candidate in 12 years. More recently, campaigns have targeted their ads to battleground states, in addition to advertising on cable networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign, which has committed to federal funding during the general election, must use the money it has raised for the primaries before McCain officially becomes the party's nominee during the Republican National Convention, which starts Sept. 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growing doubts among white working-class and independent voters blunted the momentum of Sen. Barack Obama's presidential run in recent days, leaving him in a tight contest with Republican candidate Sen. John McCain, pollsters say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His bubble hasn't burst, but it's leaking a little bit,&quot; said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. &quot;It is not massive. It is incremental, but we've seen it across the board in all of these states, that [Mr. McCain] is doing better among white voters, especially white voters without college educations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, Illinois Democrat, led by double digits earlier this summer but now barely edges out the Arizona Republican in most national polls. A Gallup daily tracking poll released Tuesday showed Mr. Obama with a four-point advantage but, for the first time since June, losing the battle for independents 43 percent to 40 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama moved from a fascinating phenomena to a guy who could become president and now he has got to answer the question of is he ready to be president,&quot; said John Zogby, president of the polling firm Zogby International, whose latest poll this week gave Mr. McCain a one-percentage-point lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zogby said racial prejudice is clearly behind some of the defections from Mr. Obama and said Mr. McCain has made gains among conservatives, women and young voters, and now leads among Catholics - a group Mr. Obama struggled to win over in a grueling primary battle against Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After months of glowing press coverage and the chance to define himself, Mr. Obama has faced tougher times in the past few weeks. The McCain campaign has run an ad comparing the Democrat to lightweight celebrities, and pollsters said Mr. McCain has benefited from his proposal to expand offshore oil drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deepening Mr. Obama's woes, the appetite for negative information appears to be large. The Associated Press reported that three new anti-Obama books were among the top 20 best-sellers on Amazon.com's list on Tuesday, despite little critical attention or mainstream media coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seeking to counter some of the loss of support, the Obama campaign announced that it would deploy Mrs. Clinton to Nevada and Florida later this month. She won both Nevada's caucuses and Florida's primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign said the candidate would continue to build support throughout the electorate with plans to address high gas prices and the economic crunch, issues that have burst to the fore the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Obama is going to keep talking about his plan to give middle-class families a $1,000 rebate funded by a windfall profits tax on the oil companies,&quot; Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said, adding that Mr. McCain took $2 million in contributions from the oil industry and proposes lower corporate tax rates that would benefit big oil companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain camp counters that the polls are moving because voters have questions about Mr. Obama's &quot;inexperience&quot; and &quot;failed judgment pocketbook issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain has a record of making reform and fighting Washington's conventional wisdom, which Barack Obama absolutely does not,&quot; said McCain spokesman Tucker Bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all the polls show a dead-even race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AP/Ipsos poll released Tuesday gave Mr. Obama a 47 percent to 41 percent lead, with the margin coming from women, minorities and young voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frank Newport, editor-in-chief of the Gallup Poll, said independent voters are fickle by nature and switch allegiances often during a campaign, but he said Mr. Obama has retained a consistent three-point lead overall throughout the summer and likely will remain that way until the party conventions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like it always comes back to the same pattern,&quot; Mr. Newport said. &quot;I don't say he has lost any support. He has been steady all summer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zogby disagreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to drops in support from Catholics, he noted a dip in support among young voters for Mr. Obama, who throughout the primaries attracted throngs of college-age and other young first-time voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe some young voters started to say, 'Hey, I thought he was different?'[TFI]&quot; Mr. Zogby said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same forces were at work in battleground states, said Mr. Brown, whose organization has been surveying voters in those states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Minnesota, Mr. McCain jumped to a 48 percent to 40 percent lead among independents, after Mr. Obama led in June by 21 points - 54 percent to 33 percent - Mr. McCain also jumped to a lead among independent voters in both Ohio and Florida, and Mr. Obama lost support among independents in Michigan and Colorado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Democrats usually win between 85 percent and 90 percent of black voters, Mr. Brown said Mr. Obama this year can expect to win 95 percent. That means Mr. McCain will need to boost his margins among white voters and win as many Hispanic voters as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given Mr. Obama's expected lead among younger voters, that makes the battleground clear: &quot;non-young, non-black voters,&quot; Mr. Brown said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">LANSING, Mich., Aug. 4</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama called Monday for using oil from the nation's strategic reserves to lower gasoline prices, the second time in less than a week that he has modified a position on energy issues, as he and Sen. John McCain seek to find solutions to a topic that is increasingly dominating the presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech here, Obama outlined a plan to reduce an addiction to foreign oil that he said is  &quot;one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced.&quot; He  repeated his call for a $1,000 &quot;energy rebate&quot; for low- and middle-income families that would be paid for by a windfall-profits tax on oil companies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign did not predict how much releasing reserves would lower gas prices. But it  said prices at the pump went down more than 19 percent within two weeks when President Bill Clinton made such a  move in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His proposal comes a month after Obama said he would consider using oil from the reserves only in a &quot;genuine emergency,&quot; such as &quot;terrorist acts.&quot;  Aides said the plan is  not a reversal because he would replace light crude oil in the reserves with less-expensive heavy crude. They also noted that the  senator from Illinois last week described the country's economic conditions as an &quot;emergency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush administration said it opposed using oil from the reserves when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called for it last month. McCain mocked the idea on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal, along with Obama's comments last week that he would consider expanding offshore drilling as part of a comprehensive energy bill, illustrated how both candidates are trying to find quick fixes to $4-a-gallon gas and other rising energy costs. McCain had also opposed additional offshore drilling until reversing his position in June, and he has called for a suspension of the federal gas tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But their proposals reflect a problem both candidates face: There are few ways to dramatically reduce gas prices, even as voters demand solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama emphasized on Monday that using reserves is  a temporary fix and that drilling is  not &quot;a particularly meaningful short-term or long-term solution.&quot; McCain has said that drilling would have a &quot;psychological&quot; benefit for consumers;  his proposal to suspend the 18-cent-a-gallon federal gas tax was ignored by lawmakers on Capitol Hill and criticized by economists, who said it would not  lead to a noticeable change in prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the stump, McCain talks frequently about electric power, a subject that energy experts say will do little to affect gas prices. His plan to build 45 nuclear power plants, which he will highlight with a visit to a Michigan plant Tuesday, would take decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's aides said Obama's proposal to tap the nation's oil reserves amounts  to his second position on the issue in a month. McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said the idea is &quot;not a substitute for a real plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The strategic oil reserve exists for America's national security strategy, not Barack Obama's election strategy,&quot; Bounds said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a small-business forum near Philadelphia on Monday, McCain called on Obama to insist that Congress return from its  August recess to confront high gas prices and the energy crisis. He urged immediate drilling off the nation's coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to drill here and drill now. Not wait and see if there's areas to explore, not wait and see if there's a package to put together,&quot; he said. &quot;But drill here and drill now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has aired ads attacking Obama's positions on drilling.  On Monday, Obama responded with an ad blasting his GOP rival  for accepting millions in contributions from oil company executives and for advocating a corporate tax cut that would reduce taxes on oil companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech, Obama pledged to eliminate the need for oil from the Middle East and Venezuela within 10 years by growing alternative sources of energy and through conservation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His long-term energy plan includes creating a  million 150-mile-per gallon plug-in hybrid vehicles within six years; requiring that 10 percent of U.S. energy come from renewable resources by the end of his first term; and reducing U.S. demand for electricity by 15 percent by 2030.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said he would give a $7,000 tax credit to those who buy plug-in hybrid cars. They won't be mass-produced until 2010, but  aides said the candidate wants  to encourage carmakers to move toward producing more energy-efficient vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want the fuel-efficient cars of tomorrow to be built -- not in Japan, not in China, but here in the United States of America, here in Michigan,&quot; Obama said to loud applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has said he would invest $2 billion in clean coal technology and has offered a $300 million prize to whoever invents the next-generation electric motor for cars. He would give a $5,000 tax credit to those who buy cars that produce less pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's shifts on offshore drilling and using the petroleum reserve come as polls show that large majorities back increased drilling to reduce gas prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue is complicated for the Democrat, as many environmental groups are eager to see Americans drive less and are sharply opposed to increased drilling. Friends of the Earth, an environmental group that endorsed Obama in May, said in a statement that &quot;it's so disappointing to see Obama now say he would consider expanding offshore drilling, even though he knows it is not a real solution to the energy crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has also suggested Americans could save money on gas by fully inflating their tires -- something that police departments and other government agencies across the country have done to conserve fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign has ridiculed Obama, saying it is a tiny solution to the gas problem. On his plane Monday, McCain's staff handed reporters tire gauges with the words &quot;OBAMA ENERGY PLAN&quot; stamped on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shear was traveling with McCain. Staff writer Juliet Eilperin contributed to this report from Montana.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what might be the fullest realization of Barack Obama's pledge to run hard in parts of the country largely untouched by presidential campaigning, the Democrat's Alaska operation is making plans for organizers to hopscotch the state's vast and sparsely populated interior by bush plane, knocking on doors in  remote outposts for their candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Go around, put up signs, shake some hands, see some of the important people in the village,&quot; said state representative and professional pilot Woodie Salmon (D), describing his own campaign tactics in a legislative district that includes 94 villages, 70 of which can be reached only by air. &quot;Get things stirred up and leave again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative and quirky, Alaska last went for a Democratic presidential candidate 44 years ago. No nominee from either party has even visited since Richard Nixon's journey to glad-hand in Anchorage on the last weekend of the 1960 campaign, a stop that some argue cost him the razor-thin election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who often boasts of having visited the other 49 states, has yet to commit to a stop here. But his vibrant campaign operation here is stoking expectations and mounting the most prodigious presidential effort Alaska has seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the John McCain campaign has yet to open an office anywhere in the state, Obama has dispatched dozens of paid staffers here over the past month; the latest batch arrived over the weekend. It is assigning field coordinators in each of the state's 40 legislative districts and has been buying television ad time since June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The campaign is treating Alaska as a key battleground state,&quot; said Jeff Giertz, the campaign's communications director in Alaska, who arrived in Anchorage from Iowa, the scene of Obama's first victory of the Democratic nominating contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With only three electoral votes, Alaska may seem a low-stakes prize. But by pouring time and money into traditionally Republican Western states such as Montana and Colorado, the Obama campaign is trying to make good on its vow to redraw the electoral map and force the McCain campaign to watch its flanks -- all the while reinforcing Obama's overarching claim of nurturing a politics of inclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a tough state to move, but we're making a play,&quot; Giertz said. &quot;If there's any year where a Democrat can win Alaska, this is the year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public surveys consistently have McCain ahead, but by single-digit margins that reflect the Republican's tepid support here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's really holding his own,&quot; said Andrew Halcro, a former Republican state lawmaker and independent gubernatorial candidate who termed the Obama effort &quot;amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think they could come pretty close,&quot; said David Dittman, the state's leading pollster, who works primarily with Republicans. He added: &quot;I don't think Obama would win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a state where Ross Perot drew 28 percent in 1992 and Ralph Nader banked every tenth vote eight years later, an array of circumstances offers encouragement to the underdog Democrat, starting with McCain's last-place finish in the Republican caucus in February behind Mitt Romney, Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona Republican faces a tough sell here. Though McCain's military credentials resonate with Alaska's veteran and active-duty residents, he is also known here for railing against the &quot;earmark&quot; appropriations that bring Alaskans more federal money per capita than any other state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain's most dubious distinction is as the first GOP candidate in memory to oppose oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The position, which McCain reiterated even while reversing his opposition to off-shore drilling, puts him at odds with the overwhelming majority of Alaskans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a sense of betrayal with McCain in the fact that he doesn't support it,&quot; Dittman said. &quot;There's the sense that he's not any better than a Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this year, being a Democrat may not be such a bad thing. Every Republican on the November ballot can expect to suffer from the corruption scandal that has tarred Alaskan politics. Last week's indictment of Ted Stevens, the U.S. Senate's longest-serving Republican, follows the federal convictions of three state GOP lawmakers in cases that featured surveillance videos starring the oil executive who prosecutors say remodeled Stevens's modest Girdwood home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public revulsion at the continuing torrent of revelations fueled the upset election of Republican Sarah Palin as governor in 2006, on a platform of Alaskan pride and cleaning up government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Obama's message is similar to Sarah's two years ago,&quot; said Halcro, who lost his third-party bid to Palin. &quot;People want to believe that these really complex public policy questions are going to be solved by what I call glittering generalities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alaskans may also appreciate being noticed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've always voted up here. Just nobody's paid much attention,&quot; said Jim Schultz, 71.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snowy-bearded and cheerful, the federal retiree worked the phones in Obama headquarters on a rare sunny evening during a cold and cloudy summer. Across the table sat a beaming Celine Gammond, 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It gives us legitimacy,&quot; she said of the campaign's effort. &quot;It's like we're a real state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The youthful enthusiasm that powers the famous Obama ground operation first became apparent here on caucus night: The 8,800 who jammed into caucus sites represented more than ten times the turnout four years earlier, with 70 percent for the Illinois senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope America doesn't disappoint these young people,&quot; Schultz said. But working the phones reminded him that in the great north, more than the weather can be harsh: &quot;I think what surprises me is the animosity or the rudeness. If they're Republican they say, 'I'm not even going to talk to you.' Or they hang up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, political professionals say the sheer force of effort is bound to produce dividends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They really appreciate that people would come to your town and talk to you. That's a big thing,&quot; said Salmon, who uses his two Cessnas for &quot;campaigning, hunting, and odds and ends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fuel will be expensive, though, especially if the pilot refuels in the bush, where prices reflect the expense of delivering it there by barge or even air. &quot;Arctic villages' last reported gas price was about $10 a gallon, and they live right next to ANWR,&quot; Salmon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McHugh Pierre, spokesman for the Alaska Republican Party, holds out hope that McCain will change his position on drilling in the refuge. He also batted aside japes from his Democratic rivals -- who issued a series of news releases suggesting vacant office space that McCain's campaign might rent -- by suggesting the influx of Obama staffers amounted to carpetbagging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama is trying to take advantage of our situation,&quot; Pierre said. &quot;Obama has a lot of East Coast liberal staffers in Alaska&quot; while McCain, he said, &quot;has a real grass-roots effort, Alaskans talking to Alaskans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think the views or opinions of Alaskans have changed, and the views of the Republican Party still represent the views of most people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ronald Reagan didn't even have an office here,&quot; Pierre said. &quot;This is the normal deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casting about for more low-rated television shows to shill for,  Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican candidate John McCain have shot &quot;funny&quot; campaign ads for this Thursday's season finale of &quot;Last Comic Standing,&quot; NBC announced yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-second-ish &quot;ads&quot; are a real coup for the NBC comic-competition series. This season it's pulling in its smallest audience yet, about 5 million viewers, which is slightly smaller than in that third, rushed season in fall '04 when NBC yanked the low-rated show  and sold the finale to Comedy Central.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of Comedy Central, we're guessing the candidates got sucked into doing this for &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot; after getting good notices for their appearances on, say, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; -- which, they are about to find out, has mostly to do with how good Jon Stewart is at making them look funny and human and all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't believe me? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad opens with the candidate standing behind a  lectern, telling Americans: &quot;Hi, I'm Barack Obama and I'm running for president of the United States. Remember to vote for me in November. And if you don't think I'm funny, you've obviously never seen me bowl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A picture of him bowling appears on-screen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama then turns to someone off-screen and says, &quot;I'm not going to deliver this line any better than that&quot; and walks off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The End.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain&nbsp;ad begins with him behind a lectern,  telling Americans: &quot;I'm John McCain and I approve this message. A president has to be funny. They just have to be.&quot; Photos of a slack-jawed, cowboy-hatted President George W. Bush; a sax-playing President Bill Clinton; and a Bonzo-bedtiming pre-president Ronald Reagan appear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfunny presidents only serve one term if they win an election at all,&quot; McCain continues. &quot;I may not be the last comic standing, but I'm definitely the funniest candidate for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah -- funny-looking!&quot; says an off-camera voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who said that?&quot; barks a faux-angry McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The End.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea got its start at a meeting of the &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot; writers, according to show executive producer David Friedman. Originally the idea was to have the show's five finalists cut their own &quot;campaign&quot; ads, since this is an election year and American viewers also get to vote in re who wins the annual competition series. You know the drill. Anyway, that idea somehow morphed into approaching the two presidential wannabes, both of whom said yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And why not? In June, both men shilled for Lifetime network's &quot;Army Wives&quot; for its second-season debut -- and that show gets even fewer viewers than &quot;Last Comic Standing.&quot; Those plugs were couched as &quot;salutes&quot; to military families, though the network took the bits in which the candidates said they watched the show and spoke the name &quot;Lifetime&quot; and wore them out in promos for Lifetime and the series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his plug, McCain said, &quot; 'Army Wives' has a lot of great twists and turns. I know, because Cindy makes me watch with her and we're looking forward to Season 2,&quot; and so on. Obama told viewers, &quot;I know you all are waiting to see what happens this season on 'Army Wives.' But I just wanted to take a moment to honor the people this show is about,&quot; etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked why he thinks the candidates are showing up to help promote prime-time soaps and reality series, &quot;Last Comic&quot; exec Friedman told The TV Column that while he's the last guy to say that something as important as a presidential election is a popularity contest . . . you know the rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's&nbsp;ad was shot on NBC's lot last month, when he was taping an episode of NBC Universal's syndicated Ellen DeGeneres talk show. Obama's was shot last week at the Omni Shoreham in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friedman says the two candidates' writers worked with the show's writers to come up with the ads, and it was pretty much the same as working with any &quot;celebrity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of celebrities, Friedman says he was not any more surprised that the men who would be president said yes to the pitch for an appearance than he is when anyone agrees to appear on the show. Obama and McCain will be joined on the season finale by Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Jon Lovitz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;American Idol&quot; producer 19 Entertainment issued a statement yesterday emphatically denying reports of the departure of Nigel Lythgoe -- the second most annoying judge on &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; and the &quot;Idol&quot; show runner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Contrary to online rumors, producer Nigel Lythgoe is not leaving 19 Entertainment,&quot; the company said, like it meant it to sting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But  no one was reporting Lythgoe was leaving 19 Entertainment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, they were reporting he was leaving &quot;American Idol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox says so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in: &quot;While we are disappointed that he will no longer be executive producing 'American Idol,' we are pleased to continue working with him on 'So You Think You Can Dance' and look forward to working with him on his new projects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's pretty much all Fox is saying on the subject, except that Lythgoe is &quot;an extraordinarily talented producer whose creative contributions to the No. 1 show on television have been immeasurable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(It's true, last season &quot;Idol&quot; took a bit of a ratings tumble, as did many prime-time series, though most could point to the writers' strike for cause. Not so for reality series. Fox is said to be looking to shake up &quot;Idol,&quot; mulling things like shortening the whole lame-auditions period and spending more time on Hollywood Week, etc.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lythgoe, who is a modest man, did not want to boast about his immeasurable contributions to what is still the country's most popular TV series by several laps:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Due to the huge success of 'So You Think You Can Dance,' my summer will be taken up by travels to South Africa, Australia and Canada to work on local versions of the show,&quot; Lythgoe said in his official statement on the subject of his not leaving 19 Entertainment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lythgoe said he will &quot;step back&quot; from his day-to-day producing work on &quot;Idol&quot; to devote &quot;my time to a new venture with Simon Fuller. . . . He is without doubt a man of vision, and I look forward to partnering with him on new and exciting challenges in all forms of entertainment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lythgoe, who, to his credit, does not emit deafening screams on &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; -- choreographer Mary Murphy does that, making her the hands-down most annoying judge, not just on that show but in the history of TV -- is negotiating a &quot;new deal&quot; with 19 to start a &quot;new joint venture&quot; with Fuller, 19 Entertainment said in its statement -- proving once and for all that Lythgoe is not leaving 19 Entertainment. We hope that ends the rumormongering.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tax cuts help the economy. High taxes hurt the economy. It's that simple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only debate left, it seems, is how to cut taxes. It's always a politically charged dialogue, but it seems everybody agrees on tax cuts for the middle class, who make up the bulk of our population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most taxpayers have received the most recent tax cuts, or tax rebates, in th &quot;Economic Stimulus Package.&quot; These tax cuts cruised through a Democrat-controlled House and Senate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John F. Kennedy cut taxes in the 1960s because they were too high, and the economy was stalling. Ronald Reagan cut taxes in the 1980s because they were too high, and the economy was stalling. In both cases, cutting taxes worked. The economy rebounded. Tax revenues soared. &quot;Reagan-omics&quot; was a success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deficits rose in the 1980s, due much to President Reagan's heavy spending to rebuild and modernize the Army, Navy and Air Force to counter - and ultimately overwhelm and roll back - Soviet expansionism. World War III between two nuclear superpowers was averted. It was a wise investment. After tax cuts in 2003, the economy again grew, jobs were created and revenues rose. Deficits grew, this time due to necessary spending related to Sept. 11, 2001, and Hurricane Katrina, and other spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">See the obvious pattern? But enough of the past; let's look to the future. A brief look to future possible U.S. administrations shows each candidate favors some form of tax cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, of my party, and Sen. Barack Obama across the aisle, both openly express support for tax cuts in one form or another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent public statement by Mr. Obama, a liberal Democrat, boasts &quot;I helped those workers and took their fight to the state Senate, passing tax cuts.&quot; While she was still in the race, Hillary Clinton likewise proudly backed middle class tax cuts. In one televised clip, she explicitly stated &quot;We know you can't solve economic problems with political promises; the stakes are too high.&quot; The ad then flashes her promise of &quot;immediate tax cuts for the middle class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As no surprise, John McCain has stated he would make the 2003 tax cuts permanent, and &quot;reduce taxes on 25 million middle class families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Class warfare targeting the rich is risky business. A federal luxury tax on yachts in 1991 took aim at the wealthy with a 10 percent tax on luxury yachts costing over $100,000. The result? The wealthy simply stopped buying U.S.-made yachts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my district, a boat manufacturer closed its factory in Florida and laid off most of its workers in New Jersey. In all, over 1,400 workers at both plants lost their jobs. These were middle class American workers. Their products, of which about 15 percent were exported, were ruined. Sales fell over 80 percent, from nearly $100 million to $11 million. Yacht builders in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Japan and Hong Kong took up the slack in the yacht market. More than 6,700 jobs were lost across the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are today in a federal deficit for a number of reasons. The White House estimates the deficit will be at least $410 billion. Let me first say that if we raise taxes on businesses and workers, the $410 billion will likely rise, and the economy will almost certainly get worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most notably, the economic downturn began in the first quarter of 2000 when the dot.com bubble burst. Tax cuts and rebates passed earlier in 2001 were being injected into the economy. Our economy was brought to a standstill on Sept. 11. The military response, the rebuilding of New York and saving the airlines imposed a high toll on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though I am retiring from Congress soon, I am glad that all the leading presidential contenders agree that tax cuts are a good thing. I hope our country, policy makers, legislators, economic community, and even the general public will accept the obvious: Tax cuts are healthy for the economy. They can create jobs and new investments, and put more money back into the economy, and back into the pockets of the people who earned it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Low taxes and controlled spending are the best bets for a long-term, healthy economy. Raising taxes is the worst bet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Jim Saxton of New Jersey is ranking Republican on the U.S. House and Senate Joint Economic Committee. He served as chairman 1997-98, 2001-02, 2005-06, and has served in Congress since 1984.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kudos to John McCain. He stood up and refused to accept being labeled a racist lying down. After his third attempt to inject race into the race, Barack Obama was stopped dead in his tracks when he made these remarks last week: &quot;Nobody really thinks that Bush or McCain have a real answer for the challenges we face ... so what they're going to try to do is make you scared of me You know, he's not patriotic enough. He's got a funny name. You know, he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills, you know.&quot; The McCain campaign quickly shot back: &quot;Barack Obama has played the race card, and he played it from the bottom of the deck. It's divisive, negative, shameful and wrong,&quot; McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said. The Illinois senator's supporters insist he was simply reacting to a McCain&nbsp;ad that spoofed Mr. Obama's celebrity status. But Mr. Obama's &quot;initial&quot; response to Mr. McCain's &quot;celebrity&quot; ad was quite admirable as he scoffed (expressing no offense whatsoever) and blew it off as another sorry attempt at humor, then challenged Mr. McCain to focus on the issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The humor quickly faded when Mr. Obama's pride took over and he decided to take his cues from angry liberal bloggers who called the McCain&nbsp;ad racist. Not only was the accusation ridiculous, but it was then repeated over and over again on the airwaves by the liberal status quo, only to be reversed by Mr. Obama himself: &quot;In no way do I think John McCain's campaign was racist.&quot; Mr. Obama had backed himself into a corner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The no-color candidate who didn't want to make race an issue became the center of it. Mr. Obama wrongly assumed that he'd get away with painting Mr. McCain a racist, since Democrats have successfully been able to tag Republicans with that moniker (unchallenged) for years. Ironically, it's the same kind of subtlety Mr. Obama claims exists within many of these Republican ads. The &quot;race card&quot; is similar to the &quot;sex card&quot; played by the Hillary Clinton camp when she lost the nomination to Mr. Obama. Sexism seemed easier to accept rather than acknowledging, she just wasn't that well- liked. Mr. Obama may do well to acknowledge he may not be that experienced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the beginning of his campaign (perhaps acknowledging in some way what was to come), Mr. McCain denounced any attempts by the campaign or Republicans in general to play the race card. He insisted it would not be tolerated. By all accounts he has gone out of his way to repudiate comments that even appear to come close to the edge, which makes Mr. Obama's accusation even more incendiary and cynical. As Pittsburgh Post-Gazette columnist Ruth Ann Dailey points out: &quot;It refutes Mr. Obama's earlier, constant promises to transcend the 'old stuff [that] just divides us.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, it appears Mr. Obama's recent tact is hurting him among the very group of voters he's been trying to court (white middle class, conservative Democrats and &quot;up for grabs&quot; independent voters). This week, Gallup had Mr. McCain closing Mr. Obama's lead, with the two men in a dead heat at 44 percent. And Rasmussen showed Mr. McCain with a slight lead over Mr. Obama. &quot;Scary&quot; or not, Mr. Obama, undecided independent voters don't like race-baiting disguised as cynicism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it fair to say that the race card has been played in previous elections? Yes. By both sides? Yes. But this is a new election, with new candidates who are both seeking &quot;reform&quot; and &quot;change&quot; from the same tired, old politics as usual. Crying wolf when none exists (racism) is the same politics as usual. Democrats have got to get a new line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is apparent that the Obama facade is beginning to crack as this recent expression of frustration reveals, but it begs the question no journalist seems to be willing to ask: What is on or off the table - racially speaking? Can one call Mr. Obama inexperienced without being called a racist? Can his judgment be questioned outside of his race? Can his flimsy record be recounted without the threat of a hate crime charge?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am not so naive as to believe that race doesn't matter to &quot;some&quot; people in this election, but those people are not the majority (which is why Mr. Obama enjoys 80 percent support among Democrats). It is equally fair to point out that a white candidate can attack a black candidate and not be racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is some people (mostly cynics) will see race (or racism) in everything and everyone who isn't black. Anyone who attacks the black candidate will in their eyes be a racist. That is unfortunate, as it is the kind of thinking that keeps us solely focused on the past and unable to move ahead to that &quot;one America&quot; Mr. Obama seems to be leaving behind.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actor Jon Voight denounced Sen. Barack Obama on the op-ed pages of The Washington Times last week, saying that an Obama presidency would let racist radicals &quot;demoralize this country and help create a socialist America.&quot; To paraphrase Oscar-winning Hollywood producer Julia Phillips, he'll never even get a snack in this town again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You'd think an arch conservative working in an overwhelmingly liberal town would think about restraining himself for expediency's sake, if nothing else,&quot; Jeffrey Wells wrote at the blog Hollywood Elsewhere (http://www.hollywood-elsewhere.com). &quot;It's going to be hard henceforth not to think of Voight as some kind of diseased wingnut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's only natural that industry-based Obama supporters will henceforth regard him askance. Honestly? If I were a producer and I had to make a casting decision about hiring Voight or some older actor who hadn't [angered me] with an idiotic Washington Times op-ed piece, I might very well say to myself, 'Voight? Let him eat cake,' &quot; concluded Mr. Wells, one of the country's leading entertainment reporters and Oscar prognosticators. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best reaction came from former Premiere film critic Glenn Kenny (http://somecamerunning.typepad.com): &quot;You've seen both 'The Champ' and 'Table For Five,' and it's only now you have a reason to feel negatively about Voight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a barrage of criticism that involved National Review and Instapundit, Mr. Wells posted again to say he wasn't supporting any blacklist, but that an informal one was likely: &quot;I hope it's not a shock to anyone that people tend to hire according to whims and hunches, likes and dislikes, alliances and contretemps. ... Admit it - it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">feels good to stick it to people you don't like or strongly disagree with&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mickey Kaus at Slate (http://www.slate.com/id/2196224/#voight) noted that Mr. Wells also had provided an &quot;in all fairness&quot; philosophical justification for blacklisting in his own comment field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been said in this town many times that the right has a debt to pay for the blacklisting of lefties in the '50s, and that in all fairness it's probably going to take a long time to make amends. The fact is that the philosophical grandfathers and great-grandfathers of today's right-wingers ruined the lives of many Hollywood screenwriters in the '50s, and so their descendants now have to suffer and make up for that,&quot; Mr. Wells wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial deal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama said John McCain isn't running a racist campaign, merely a &quot;cynical&quot; one, but the liberal netroots don't agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's campaign advert conflating Barack Obama's candidacy and person with Paris Hilton and Britney Spears [contains] something more nefarious&quot; than the obvious point that Mr. Obama is a vapid media starlet, charged Melissa McEwen, best known as one of the two feminist bloggers who lost their jobs with the John Edwards campaign over their vulgar rants against &quot;Christofascists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama, dog whistles the ad, hitting old racists in the sweet spot, could [violate] these white girls,&quot; Miss McEwan wrote at the Guardian blog Comment is Free (http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/america).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the New York Times, columnist Bob Herbert said in a column titled &quot;Running While Black&quot; : &quot;Gee, I wonder why, if you have a black man running for high public office - say, Barack Obama or Harold Ford - the opposition feels compelled to run low-life political ads featuring tacky, sexually provocative white women who have no connection whatsoever to the black male candidates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Cole at Balloon Juice (http://www.balloon-juice.com), said Mr. Herbert &quot;absolutely nails it&quot; and praises the columnist for raising his consciousness. &quot;One of Obama's strengths is that he is not perceived by the wider American public as the aggrieved black man - he is no Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton. By claiming Obama is playing the race card (however absurd the charge), [the McCain team] can turn him into the angry black man. It really is shameless and disgusting, and while I had seen no racial component to the Britney ad earlier, I can understand where Herbert is coming from now. I just didn't see it before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No deliveries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Tom Coburn, Oklahoma Republican and a licensed obstetrician/gynecologist, delivers poor women's babies free of charge at an Oklahoma hospital. And Senate Democrats don't like that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hill reported last week that since the Muskogee Regional Medical Center, where Mr. Coburn volunteers, went from being a public hospital to a private one, Senate Democrats say Mr. Coburn's volunteer activities constitute a &quot;fiduciary relationship.&quot; The reaction in the conservative and Catholic blogospheres was quick and unanimous:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From &quot;Feddie&quot; at Red State (http://www.redstate.com): &quot;Does anyone believe that this complaint would have been filed against Senator Coburn if he had been performing free abortions? Of course not. Heck, were that the case, 'Born Alive' Obama would no doubt ask the good senator from Oklahoma to be his Veep on a proabort 'unity' ticket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Jill Stanek (http://www.jillstanek.com): &quot;Were Tom Coburn aborting babies free instead of delivering them free, there would be no investigation; there would be an awards ceremony. This is ridiculous on so many levels, not the least of which is the Democrats' disregard for the poor, unless they control the dole so as to get the credit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Happy EIB-day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative bloggers and icons lined up all during the week to pay tribute to Rush Limbaugh, whose conservative talk-radio show went national 20 years ago Friday, defining a new national medium and a way for conservatives to get around the liberal-dominated mainstream media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Events (http://www.humanevents.com) had a whole &quot;Rush Week,&quot; featuring articles by brother David Limbaugh, Ted Nugent, Steve Forbes, Ann Coulter, Phyllis Schlafly, Sean Hannity and more. National Review (http://www.nationalreview.com) held a symposium on &quot;What makes Rush Limbaugh special?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Rush were a lib, he'd be feted endlessly by what he has deliciously dubbed the 'drive-by media.' There would be profiles gloating over the pathetic performance of Air America and contrasting liberal radio failures with the amazing longevity of EIB. ... [H]ere's to the next 20 years of excellence in conservative broadcasting,&quot; wrote Michelle Malkin (http://michellemalkin.com).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others remembered their favorite moments. Tygrrrr Express (http://www.tygrrrrexpress.com) cited a prank against Sen. Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, who was soliciting people to call Congress and demand an end to the 1994 baseball strike with two words: &quot;Play ball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Limbaugh recommended that his audience call up Schumer's office and say two words: 'Cut taxes.' ... So many people called up and said, 'Cut taxes,' that the phones and faxes had to be unplugged,&quot; Tygrrrr Express recalled</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Limbaugh site (http://www.rushlimbaugh.com) had up clips and transcripts from such legendary moments as Dan's Bake Sale, the address to the Republican freshman class of 1994, and a call from Charlton Heston, who had expressed a desire before his April death to appear on the 20th anniversary show: &quot;If Moses wants to be on, you put him on.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Al Gore got it right when he said, &quot;I don't remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gore's summary: &quot;Our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse, gasoline prices are increasing dramatically, and so are electricity rates. Jobs are being outsourced. Home mortgages are in trouble. Banks, automobile companies, and other institutions we depend upon are under growing pressure. Distinguished senior business leaders are telling us that this is just the beginning unless we find the courage to make some major changes quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The climate crisis, in particular, is getting a lot worse - much more quickly than predicted,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gore isn't running for anything, and he says he's not interested in returning to politics, which is probably good. Not that it's going out on a limb to describe the myriad problems facing the country. Nearly eight in 10 people think the country is on the wrong track, according to the latest AP-Ipsos poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But politicians shy away from saying the country's problems are so complex and interrelated that they demand a big solution, that people will have to change their ways, and that time's up for the oil industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GORE SAID all three in his energy speech in Washington July 17, when he challenged Americans to produce 100 percent of our electricity needs from renewable energy and carbon-free sources within 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We're borrowing money from China to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet. Every bit of that's got to change,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's hard to disagree. President Bush has said we must end our addiction to oil. But when Al Gore says things like that, he inspires some and infuriates others. Some love the fact that he's willing to propose major change while others think that the former senator, vice president, and presidential candidate should sit down and shut up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There's also the envy factor. How could Al Gore rise from the ashes of the 2000 election to win both the Nobel Prize and an Academy Award? As for his idea to wean the United States off oil, some dismissed it as impractical at best, if not pure fantasy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After Gore's speech, the two men who are actively seeking the presidency took time out from telling us what's wrong with each other to endorse Gore's idea to pursue wind, solar, and biofuels as sources of electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John McCain said if Gore says it's doable, he believes it is. Barack Obama praised Gore's proposal as a strategy that will create millions of new jobs and help the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then it was back to the daily slugfest. What's striking is how little discussion we are having about fixes for the problems we face. It's a presidential election year in which you'd think the contest was to find the candidate with the cleverest ad or the one whose aim is better at lobbing verbal grenades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;OBAMA AND McCain both insist they want change in Washington, but on the campaign trail they rarely offer specifics. Their plans are available online. But what you hear day after day is Obama complaining that McCain is really George W. Bush in disguise, and that McCain is running for a third Bush term with George W. Bush's policies and Karl Rove's politics. Obama calls the Republican economic policies &quot;reckless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What's the bigger risk,&quot; Obama asks, &quot;choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain's new ad claims Obama is &quot;the biggest celebrity in the world. But is he ready to lead?&quot; It's part of McCain's strategy to depict Obama as inexperienced and out of touch with ordinary Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We're hearing little from either campaign about where these men would lead the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interestingly, one of the knocks against Gore and his energy speech was that he was consciously emulating JFK's challenge to put a man on the moon. But if 80 percent of people think the country needs a new direction, what's so bad about that?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RECENTLY THE WEB site The Politico asked Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, why she was blocking attempts to tack offshore drilling amendments onto appropriations bills. &quot;I'm trying to save the planet; I'm trying to save the planet,&quot; she replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm glad to hear it. But I'm still worried about the planet's prospects. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, Pelosi's remark was a happy reminder that environmental policy is no longer in the hands of crazy people. Less than two years ago, Sen. James Inhofe -- a conspiracy theorist who insists that global warming is a &quot;gigantic hoax&quot; perpetrated by the scientific community -- was chairman of the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond that, Pelosi's response shows that she understands the deeper issues behind the energy debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most criticism of John McCain's decision to follow the Bush administration's lead and embrace offshore drilling as the answer to high gas prices has focused on the accusation that it's junk economics -- which it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A McCain campaign ad says that gas prices are high right now because &quot;some in Washington are still saying no to drilling in America.&quot; That's dishonest: The U.S. government's Energy Information Administration says that removing restrictions on offshore drilling wouldn't lead to any additional domestic oil production until 2017, and that even at its peak the extra production would have an &quot;insignificant&quot; impact on oil prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's even more important than McCain's bad economics, however, is what his reversal on this issue -- he was against offshore drilling before he was for it -- says about his priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back when he was cultivating a maverick image, McCain portrayed himself as more environmentally aware than the rest of his party. He even co-sponsored a bill calling for a cap-and-trade system to limit greenhouse gas emissions . But the lure of a bit of political gain, it turns out, was all it took to transform him back into a standard drill-and-burn Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The planet can't afford that kind of cynicism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limits on offshore drilling are only a modest-sized issue. But the skirmish over drilling is the opening stage of a much bigger fight over environmental policy. What's at stake, above all, is the question of whether we'll take action against climate change before it's utterly too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists don't know exactly how much world temperatures will rise if we persist with business as usual. But that uncertainty is actually what makes action so urgent. While there's a chance that we'll act against global warming only to find that the danger was overstated, there's also a chance that we'll fail to act only to find that the results of inaction were catastrophic. Which risk would you rather run?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Weitzman, a Harvard economist , offers some sobering numbers. Surveying a wide range of climate models, he argues that, overall, they suggest about a 5 percent chance that world temperatures will eventually rise by more than 10 degrees Celsius ( or by 18 degrees Fahrenheit). As Weitzman points out, that's enough to &quot;effectively destroy planet Earth as we know it.&quot; It's sheer irresponsibility not to do whatever we can to eliminate that threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's claim that opponents of offshore drilling are responsible for high gas prices is ridiculous -- and to their credit, major news organizations have pointed this out. Yet McCain's gambit seems nonetheless to be working: Public support for ending restrictions on drilling has risen sharply, with roughly half of voters saying that increased offshore drilling would reduce gas prices within a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence my concern: If a completely bogus claim that environmental protection is raising energy prices can get this much political traction, what are the chances of getting serious action against global warming?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only way we're going to get action, I'd suggest, is if those who stand in the way of action come to be perceived as not just wrong but immoral. Incidentally, that's why I was disappointed with Barack Obama's response to McCain's energy posturing -- that it was &quot;the same old politics.&quot; Obama was dismissive when he should have been outraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So as I said, I'm very glad to know that Pelosi is trying to save the planet. I just wish I had more confidence that she's going to succeed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2004 Democratic presidential nominee accused Sen. John McCain's campaign of trying to impugn the character of Sen. Barack Obama in this year's presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're trying to scare you,&quot; Sen. John F. Kerry (Mass.) said on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; &quot;They are engaged in character assassination.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've decided they can't win on the issues, so they've decided to try to destroy his character,&quot; Kerry added, quoting his Senate colleague Russ Feingold (D-Wis.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry's comments alluded to a McCain TV advertisement that debuted last week. The ad, which compared Obama to celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, raised an important point, McCain ally Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.) said on NBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Notwithstanding his celebrity status, is Barack Obama ready to serve?&quot; said Lieberman, the 2000 Democratic vice presidential candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the question was particularly relevant after Obama's trip to Europe, where 200,000 people turned out in Berlin to hear him speak. &quot;We're not deciding who's our favorite celebrity,&quot; Lieberman said. &quot;We're doing something very serious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry countered, &quot;It tries to insinuate that his celebrity is all [Obama] has.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lieberman focused on a statement by Obama last week that caused a stir. The senator from Illinois  said in Missouri that his opponents are going to try to instill worries in voters by emphasizing that Obama is an unfamiliar figure who &quot;doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign quickly accused Obama of playing the race card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're making a personal insult to John McCain,&quot; Lieberman said. &quot;This man does not have a bigoted bone in his body,&quot; he added, noting that McCain  and his wife have adopted a child from Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On ABC's &quot;This Week,&quot; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was pressed on whether she would allow a vote to expand offshore drilling for oil. Last week, she did not allow such a vote before Congress recessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You never say never to anything,&quot; she said. &quot;But from my standpoint . . . I'm not giving the gavel away to a tactic that . . . supports . . . big oil at the cost and the expense of the consumer.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">KANSAS CITY</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the traveling press corps was shipped off to a barbecue restaurant here, John McCain charmed his way through an interview with a local TV reporter. Surae Chinn of KCTV posed such less-than-penetrating questions as &quot;How important is Missouri?&quot; and &quot;Have you chosen a running mate?&quot; and -- addressing the candidate's wife, Cindy  -- &quot;How do you make your marriage work?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments later, though, the Republican candidate seemed to grow annoyed with the Kansas City Star's Steve Kraske, who pressed him on his recent comment that &quot;nothing is off the table&quot; when it comes to strengthening Social Security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Kraske said that McCain presumably wasn't ruling out a payroll tax hike, McCain interrupted: &quot;That's presuming wrong.&quot; When the reporter rephrased the question, McCain said: &quot;If you want to keep asking me over and over again, you're welcome to.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a brief moment of friction that highlighted how the captain of the Straight Talk Express is having a bumpier ride with journalists than when he ran for president eight years ago. The popular image of the campaign -- McCain bantering with national journalists in the back of his bus -- has, in  reality, all but vanished. The traveling press is now routinely stiffed in favor of five-minute sit-downs with local reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the Arizona senator is having trouble making news, or at least news that advances his campaign's goals, and when he does it is often reacting to the media hurricane that surrounds Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2000, when top news executives were clamoring for a chance to ride the fabled bus, McCain would spend hours talking to reporters who would write one story a day. &quot;Now, with each bus trip, everyone's filing a blog report, every little thing is picked up and off it goes,&quot; says Slate correspondent John Dickerson. &quot;It certainly takes him off message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is &quot;pained&quot; at all but ending the sessions, says spokeswoman Nicolle Wallace, a former Bush White House communications director, but &quot;we have to find a balance. He won the primary essentially on a bus with the press. . . . He's intensely loyal to the back-and-forth with the press. It's who he is. It will always be part of our mix.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't   part of the mix last week. National correspondents traveling with the candidate did not get to ask McCain a question for four days, and grew angry when a media availability was scheduled for  late afternoon  Friday in Panama City, Fla. -- too late to do them much good and requiring extra flights for those who had planned to head home for the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the front of McCain's plane was reconfigured with a couch and two captain's chairs to allow for easy conversation, journalists say he has invited them up only once, on a trip to Colombia. On the ground, his availability is sometimes limited to a quick gaggle with a small group of pool reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama doesn't mingle much with his press corps either -- he made an exception on his recent world tour -- but that has never been a core part of his strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is less engaging as a scripted candidate. But his strategists are convinced that the perpetual access was eroding their ability to drive a message, forcing the candidate to play on the media's turf by responding to flap-of-the-day questions, such as top adviser Carly Fiorina's lament that many health plans cover Viagra but not birth control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the aides say McCain would get hammered by the press if they restricted access even further, given his repeated insistence that such a move would destroy his credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many problems are of McCain's own making, it often seems that he can't catch a break. He stood beside an oil pump in a dusty Bakersfield, Calif., field last week, trying to dramatize his support for offshore drilling while painting Obama as &quot;the Doctor No of America's energy future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the clip that played on ABC's &quot;World News&quot; and the cable networks was of McCain, who has a history of skin cancer, explaining to reporters why a mole had been removed from his face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican strategists not affiliated with McCain say his campaign seems to lurch from one tactic to the next and has been largely devoid of new ideas that might draw sustained coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The McCain campaign's challenge in this Obama environment is to be consistent and drive a daily message for more than two days in a row,&quot; says Scott Reed, who managed the 1996 presidential campaign of another septuagenarian senator, Bob Dole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark McKinnon, a McCain adviser who left the campaign after the primaries, says the media are &quot;overhyping&quot; Obama, but that things will even out by the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if McCain should spend so much time responding to Obama, thus letting him set the story line, McKinnon says: &quot;It's hard not to react when there's this blazing comet across the sky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that has eclipsed the Republican's campaign, the staging of McCain's events hasn't helped. When Obama was in Israel, McCain was awkwardly chatting up shoppers in the cheese aisle of a Bethlehem, Pa., supermarket, where at one point several jars of applesauce came tumbling off a shelf. When Obama was drawing a huge crowd in Berlin, McCain was visiting Schmidt's Sausage Haus in Columbus, Ohio, placing an order of chocolate cream puffs to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the stagecraft, there is a sameness to McCain's schedule that works against breaking into the news cycle: town hall meeting, local interviews, fundraiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is clearly energized by the town halls. In Racine, Wis., he was asked about taxes, college aid and whether Brett Favre should leave the Green Bay Packers. McCain's answers were crisp and forceful, but he said nothing he hasn't said dozens of times -- and therefore made no news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such generally friendly questions are now deemed preferable to responding to reporters. After touring a tractor factory Wednesday in Aurora, Colo., McCain kept walking when Associated Press correspondent Beth Fouhy shouted a question at him about the indictment of Republican Sen. Ted Stevens. The press corps had no chance to get a comment on his controversial ad likening Obama to Paris Hilton and Britney Spears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday in Wisconsin, the reporters were itching to ask about the campaign's accusation that Obama was &quot;playing the race card&quot; by suggesting that McCain was trying to marginalize him as someone who didn't look like other presidents on dollar bills. When CNN's John King was interviewing the senator for a profile to run before the Republican convention -- and raised the race-card flap at the end -- aides tried to cut him off. McCain gave a 10-second answer and ended the interview with a quick handshake as King tried to follow up. The aides later chastised King for raising a subject that was not part of the agreed-upon agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the bus ride to the airport, four Milwaukee journalists were invited on the Straight Talk, in keeping with the new policy of generally reserving such trips for local reporters. This time, Fouhy asked the local AP scribe on that bus to question McCain about the race charge, and made sure the senator's defense of the charge hit the national wire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the subsequent flight to Orlando, McCain remained in the front cabin, which was cordoned off by a curtain. The only journalist ushered into his presence was a writer for Marie Claire magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the old days, reporters would have had hours to chew over the latest controversy, and plenty of other subjects, with McCain. But for a campaign struggling to regain control of its message, the old days are definitely gone.</SPAN></P>

I wanted to deny myself the aggravation of reading the political news this morning. I tried to avoid reading the irrational blabber of the presidential candidates. Their irresponsible statements increased my decision not to vote for anyone in the forthcoming election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of the superior intelligence of both candidates, both allow their political manipulator-advisers to stir the election campaign toward scare tactics, racial politics, distrust and anger. Instead of making argumentative remarks, why not discuss openly the economy, the war, education, energy problems and other issues of importance to our country? What we see and read is senseless chatter dominating the news. It is not too late to change the course. Let Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama meet face to face and discuss the real issues facing our country instead of OK'ing the stupid daily commercials on TV, attacking and hurting each other.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyer's remorse?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, many chortled over the appearance of blond starlets Paris Hilton and Britney Spears in a campaign spot for Sen. John McCain, who claimed the ad was intended to deflate the distracting celebrity of Sen. Barack Obama. You know. Just for laughs. No racial stuff. Really.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Hilton's mother is not amused. Kathy Hilton penned a terse reaction at the Huffington Post on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous McCain celebrity ad. I actually have three responses. It is a complete waste of the money John McCain's contributors have donated to his campaign. It is a complete waste of the country's time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs. And it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next President of the United States,&quot; Mrs. Hilton wrote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is - or was - presumably a Republican, and with her husband, donated $4,600 to Mr. McCain's campaign this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona Republican has earned some new critics in the aftermath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Way to go, Johnny. You just [angered] a heavy-duty donor to your party. And by the way, the Hiltons are VERY influential in your party,&quot; noted one annoyed observer at the Huffington Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No word from any of Miss Spears' relatives. Yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the numbers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;celebrity ad&quot; itself is now a celebrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixty-nine percent of the nation's voters say they've seen press coverage of the campaign spot. Of those, just 22 percent say the ad was &quot;racist,&quot; while 63 percent say it was not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most black voters - 58 percent - saw the McCain&nbsp;ad as racist, however. Just 18 percent of white voters and 14 percent of all other voters shared that view, according to a Rasmussen Reports survey of 1,000 voters conducted Aug. 1, with a margin of error of three percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fat chance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has been called too arrogant, too remote and too clever, but last week Sen. Barack Obama was hit below the belt with a cruel new allegation: He may be too skinny to win the White House. Suggestions that Obama's slim physique is a liability in a nation of mostly overweight voters marked a dangerous new turn for the Democratic contender's suddenly vulnerable presidential campaign,&quot; said Tony Allen-Mills of the Sunday Times of London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent news reports have explored the notion that Mr. Obama would lose votes from chubby voters because he was too svelte. Well, there's something to that - 66 percent of us are now overweight or obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Wall Street Journal suggested that Obama might be too thin and too fit to appeal to voters who tend to like candidates with flaws that they can identify with. Several analysts noted that widely circulated pictures of a red-faced Bill Clinton staggering into McDonald's after a short jog did the former president no harm at all; millions of Americans knew just how he felt,&quot; the Times noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's enthusiasm for exercise first raised eyebrows last month, when he stopped three times in one day for workouts at Chicago gyms, prompting an Associated Press reporter to wonder: 'Sometimes it's hard to tell if Barack Obama is running for president or Mr. Universe.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zucker punch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You remember David Zucker, the Hollywood producer of &quot;Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; and other comedic extravaganzas. He is now at work on &quot;An American Carol,&quot; which showcases a character named Michael Malone - a fat filmmaker who wants to ban the Fourth of July. But uh-oh. The fat filmmaker is visited by the ghosts of George Washington, Gen. George S. Patton, and John F. Kennedy, who try to convince him he's wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's unlike anything that has ever come out of Hollywood. It is a frontal attack on the excesses of the American left from several prominent members of a growing class of Hollywood conservatives. Until now, conservatives in Hollywood have always been too few and too worried about a backlash to do anything serious to challenge the left-wing status quo,&quot; writes Stephen Hayes of the Weekly Standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zucker's film, together with a spike in attendance at events put on by 'The Friends of Abe' (Lincoln, not Vigoda) - a group of right-leaning Hollywood types that has been meeting regularly for the past four years - is once again reviving hope that conservatives will have a battalion in this exceedingly influential battleground of the broader culture war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actors Dennis Hopper, Jon Voight and James Woods are in the cast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't have any desire to be taken seriously,&quot; Mr. Zucker said. &quot;But having said that, I really believe this stuff. Why can't I put it out there? And I'm scared to death of Obama. If I didn't do something about it I would feel - my kids would ask: 'What did you do in the war, Daddy?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political currency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama says his claim that Republicans would try to scare Americans by saying he &quot;doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills&quot; was not meant to be an accusation of racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But conservative bloggers are not buying the explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AllahPundit at Hotair.com noted that the Illinois Democrat makes that point repeatedly in his stump speech and often explicitly mentions his race. AllahPundit cited a June speech in Jacksonville, Fla., in which Mr. Obama said of Republicans: &quot;We know what kind of campaign they're going to run. They're going to try to make you afraid. They're going to try to make you afraid of me. He's young and inexperienced, and he's got a funny name. And did I mention, he's black?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other conservatives scorned the explanation - citing Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs. He said that when Mr. Obama noted he doesn't look like the faces on U.S. currency, it simply meant &quot;he didn't get here after spending decades in Washington. There is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmie at the Sundries Shack sarcastically titled his rebuttal &quot;Obama Campaign: He's Not One of Those Washington Insiders Like John McCain, George Washington, or Abe Lincoln,&quot; and dryly observed that Washington &quot;was such a Beltway Insider that he was one of them even before there was a Beltway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or on further consideration, even before there was a Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Would you bring an 8-foot-tall burning torch to a political rally? What about drinking John McCain-brand juice?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those gestures may sound odd today, but burning torches were one of the first examples of American campaign memorabilia in the 1800s. And presidential nominees in the 1960s had their names emblazoned on juice cans, including Barry Goldwater's &quot;gold water&quot; - &quot;the right drink for the conservative taste.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It wasn't all witch-hunting and thirst-quenching; there was plenty of potty humor, too. In fact, early American campaign memorabilia make today's wry slogans on T-shirts look tame. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some trinkets were signs of the times never to be seen again - the McKinley parasol, the Eisenhower cigarette pack and the Kennedy paper dress. Others have evolved. The political button may have gotten its start as coat buttons like the ones made to commemorate Washington's inauguration in 1789, said Sara Henry, deputy director and chief curator of the Museum of the City of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This brass button says 'Long live the president,' and this one has his initials in the middle,&quot; she said, pointing to the encased artifacts. The buttons are part of the exhibit &quot;Campaigning for President: New York and the American Election,&quot; which is open at the museum through Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">***************</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it was not until the middle of the 19th century when all white men got the vote - as opposed to just landowners - that political parties used memorabilia to &quot;sell&quot; candidates to the masses, Henry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tall torches adorned with photos of candidates were passed out during rallies and parades to light the dark streets. Paper lanterns decorated with a candidate's picture, a rare item because most burned, were also used for campaigning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> William Henry Harrison, elected in 1840, is said to be the first candidate to actively campaign for president, said Larry Bird, curator of the Division of Politics and Reform at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. In addition to torch poles topped with his signature log cabin, the campaign made domestic items such as women's brushes and sewing boxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was plenty of negative campaigning, too. One of the earliest examples at the New York exhibit is the Grover Cleveland and Allen Thurman chamber pot from 1888.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You do see a lot of potty humor in American politics,&quot; Henry said. &quot;We haven't included a lot of it in the exhibit because much of it is just so juvenile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> William Jennings Bryan, a candidate known for his long speeches, was frequently represented by a coffin along with the phrase &quot;Talked to death.&quot; And then there's the McKinley doll. The porcelain and cloth doll, when held upright, is William McKinley. When turned upside down, it's an African-American baby, referring to the accusation he fathered an illegitimate black child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1944, a poster impugned vice presidential candidate Harry Truman by drawing him in a Ku Klux Klan outfit. More functional items are the Reagan slippers, the comb to &quot;comb Nixon out of your hair&quot; and the Kerry flip-flops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The post-World War II era was the heyday of memorabilia, Bird said. &quot;I like Ike&quot; nylon stockings were created at a time when women started to expose more of their legs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the '60s came the quirky juices such as Goldwater's and the Lyndon Johnson juice can - &quot;a drink for health care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was political but also social,&quot; Bird said. &quot;That's what's changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When campaigning on television became standard, the focus began to shift. Buttons got bigger, presumably to play to the TV cameras. Candidates spent more money on commercials than tchotchkes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's impossible to know which products from today's campaigns will be collector's items, although society may decide that the Barack Obama thong was a bad idea. But Bird says despite all the changes, the underlying purpose always remains the same: to feel a part of it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There's a need for people who want to participate to have material with which to express themselves,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sophia McCrimmon has backed Sen. Barack Obama since she was little.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to domestic issues, his plans for Iraq and Afghanistan align with hers - all things she talks about when she knocks on doors in Hanover  County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her favorites are undecided voters. Generally, they are more receptive to someone asking what issues concern them when it's coming from a 9-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think he's going to help change the world and I think he's going to make America a better place, and I think he's going to change the war in Iraq,&quot; she said of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sophia discussed her politics over watermelon and a blueberry bagel yesterday morning at a kickoff event for Virginia Women for Obama, Families for Change. The gathering was held in Richmond's Byrd Park; others took place throughout the day in the cities of Charlottesville, Alexandria, Hampton and Fairfax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The campaign hopes the network will assist in mobilizing support around the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Virginia first lady Anne Holton headlined the Richmond gathering, highlighting Obama's stances on several issues of import to women and families, including earned-income tax credits, pay equity and paid sick leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In all of these issues, there's a stark contrast between Senator Obama and his opponent,&quot; she said, referring to Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Holton's husband, Gov. Timothy M. Kaine, is being mentioned as a possible running mate for Obama. Holton politely skirted a question about the buzz yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a mother of three and a former judge, Holton leveled with the crowd of about 100 - a majority of which was female - about the juggling act required to do it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I've never worked in a job where I didn't have a paid sick leave, but that's a privilege,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Across the country, many working in retail and service industries do not get paid sick days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That's criminal that folks have to choose between going to work sick so as to make the money to pay the rent versus being able to take care of themselves,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama would require employers to provide seven paid sick days per year. McCain has said it should &quot;be subject to negotiations between management and labor,&quot; according to The Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In introducing Holton yesterday, Del. Jennifer L. McClellan, D-Richmond, said every issue is a women's issue. She remarked that the Obama campaign has generated more excitement than she has seen before and that it's not just about celebrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She was referring to a television ad the McCain camp released that shows images of Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Obama and asks, &quot;He's the biggest celebrity in the world, but is he ready to lead?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McClellan said of Obama, &quot;I've seen him interact with people. He really connects with people in a way that Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, quite frankly, don't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama has drawn many young voters into the political process, such as Sarah Brooks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He has so much optimism, he's young and it's cool because I'm a young person, too,&quot; said the 21-year-old who hopes to join the Peace Corps soon. &quot;It's neat to be able to relate to someone on that level.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Philadelphia Daily News </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What so engages us about caricatures?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People love to look at them because it's a kind of magic to have a few lines represent someone and people know who it is. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's your process? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm too disorganized to have a process. I do try to get a lot of photographs. Whenever the candidates are on [TV] for a speech, I try to sketch from that -- just so I keep looking at them. . . . Cartoonists are the creators and keepers of our treasured national stereotypes and we have to earn that right. So it's a good idea to keep my eyes open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Your Obama -- difficult?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He's pretty easy. He's got a clearly  shaped face and he's got great eyebrows and a great mouth and he's a lean, skinny guy. He came prepackaged!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And how's your McCain coming along?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oddly -- and I will charitably call him middle-aged -- middle-aged white men are a pain in the neck to draw because they're so pale. When they get white eyebrows and white hair and no discernible features, that gets difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Size up, if you will, the best of the also-rans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I like drawing Hillary. It's not exactly a policy discussion here, but she has great eyebrows, great cheeks and a good face-shape. . . . I also liked Romney. He looks like a 1950s actor in a Sani-Flush ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So anything you won't do, in terms of caricature?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I don't need to make caricatures so ugly that they're warped. . . . I was never fond of that Hillary-as-a-witch kind of thinking. . . . And black faces are still sensitive, but decreasingly so. Cartoonists are drawing an individual face, not a race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a cartoonist, whom would you rather draw for four more years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I pledge to draw the person who the American people choose to give me. I will be happy and grateful for their choice. But I hope whoever it is will not [again cause] me to have to draw zippers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IS BARACK Obama a celebrity lightweight, a self-involved Paris Hilton yearning to live &quot;The Simple Life&quot; in the Oval Office? Is John McCain trying to scare voters about the fact that Mr. Obama, soon to be the first African American nominee, &quot;doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills?&quot; And one more question: How silly were we, just two months ago, in venturing &quot;some hope that the general election can be waged on the elevated plane that both nominees say they want?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the story of Campaign 2008 is written, neither candidate is likely to look back with pride on the final week of July. Mr. McCain is entitled to question his opponent's readiness for the presidency and even to employ a bit of cheeky humor in making his point. He's not entitled to be dishonest, as he was, for example, in the ad suggesting that Mr. Obama preferred to play basketball rather than visit wounded troops on his trip to Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is entitled to inoculate himself against the discomfort and even hostility that are, unfortunately but inevitably, evoked among a minority of Americans by the fact of his race. Indeed, he would be foolish to pretend that race plays no role in this historic campaign. But Mr. Obama is not entitled to pin responsibility for this reaction on the McCain campaign, as he did on Thursday in saying that President Bush and Mr. McCain would try to scare voters: &quot;You know, 'He's not patriotic enough. He's got a funny name.' You know, 'He doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was, no doubt, a calculated element of tactical foul-crying in the McCain campaign's loud and immediate protestations that Mr. Obama had not only &quot;played the race card&quot; but dealt it &quot;from the bottom of the deck.&quot; This assessment was overstated. But just as the Obama campaign is free to do what it can to counteract the complications of running as the first African American nominee, the McCain campaign needs to carve out space to wage a vigorous campaign without fear of being labeled racist at the slightest criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates would do well to keep in mind that voters, worried about gas prices and the economy, health care and Iraq, are likely to run quickly out of patience with some of the juvenile back-and-forth. Voters face a serious choice between two candidates who bring impressive qualities to the race. Those qualities weren't shining through last week.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fallout from the economic downturn spread into new corners of the job market in July, adding to the deep stresses facing American workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unemployment rate jumped yet again as employers slashed jobs for the seventh consecutive month, the Labor Department said yesterday. And  the job losses weren't just in the long-troubled construction and manufacturing sectors. Trucking companies, telecommunications firms and car dealers all eliminated thousands of jobs, too, as the troubles in the nation's economy showed new breadth that undermines any hopes of even a tentative recovery in the second half of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jobless rate rose to 5.7 percent in July, the highest in four years. It is up from 5.5 percent in June and 4.7 percent a year earlier. Employers cut their payrolls by 51,000 net jobs, bringing the total reduction in the nation's job count this year to 463,000. The ranks of the unemployed increased by 285,000 people in the month, continuing a steady deterioration in the job market that began at the end of last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Businesses are looking for ways to cut costs at every turn,&quot; said Robert Dye, a senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group. &quot;They're in no mood to hire, and I don't see that turning around anytime soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been fewer massive layoffs than in the last recession, in 2001. But companies are reducing hours (hours worked dropped 0.4 percent in July), eliminating temporary workers (employment services firms slashed 34,000 jobs in the month), and declining to hire students for summer shifts (the unemployment rate among teenagers was 20.3 percent, up from 15.3 percent in July 2007).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Workers without advanced skills have been hit the hardest. Among people without a high school diploma, the rate has increased to 8.5 percent, from 7.2 percent. The rate among those with a bachelor's degree or more education is 2.4 percent, up only slightly from 2.1 percent a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately it's the lower income households with the less advanced skills who are getting hit with a weak labor market at the same time they are hit with very high gasoline and food prices,&quot; Dye said. &quot;It's a real squeeze.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Adecco Group North America, a nationwide staffing firm, for example, there are thousands of  unfilled positions for engineers and skilled health-care workers, said chief executive Tig  Gilliam. On the other hand, in &quot;manufacturing and construction jobs, almost no matter where you are, there's going to be weakness,&quot; Gilliam said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The losses in those sectors are stark. Manufacturers cut 35,000 net jobs in July, and 383,000 in the last year, with some of the worst declines among makers of automobiles and automotive parts. The construction sector continued its steady bleed, losing another 22,000 positions, for a total of 457,000 in the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residential building has been in steep decline for 18 months, but now commercial construction -- office buildings, retail centers, and the like -- is cutting back, too. Nonresidential specialty trade contractors cut 10,800 jobs in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is less work, and there is more time between jobs,&quot; said Clayton Sinyai, executive director of the Residential Construction Workers Association in Alexandria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retailers cut back, too, responding to strapped American consumers, with the fine print showing how Americans' unwillingness or inability to buy large, expensive items is spreading through the economy. Auto dealers cut 8,400 jobs; building materials stores cut 5,500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High fuel prices walloped trucking companies, leading employment in that sector down by 5,100, and information companies, including publishers and telecom firms, slashed 13,000 jobs. The decline in jobs with employment services was typical for a downturn, said people in that industry. &quot;That's frequently where employers cut first,&quot; Gilliam said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance, while not bleeding jobs, is no longer a source of strength. &quot;The accounting and the finance areas, which for years have been really strong, is the area that has definitely been on the decline over the last 12 months,&quot; said Paul Villella, chief executive of HireStrategy, an employment services firm in Reston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bright spots were few. High oil prices drove new exploration for energy; oil and gas extraction businesses added 10,300 jobs. Government employment rose by 25,000 positions, though many analysts expect that number to come under stress in the months ahead as state and local governments grapple with weaker tax revenue and  cut their budgets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And health care, a stalwart of job creation,  continued adding positions, reflecting perennial shortages of qualified labor. Today there are 1,400 job openings in Inova Health System, Northern Virginia's largest nonprofit hospital chain, said Daniel Nichols, the system's director of recruitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While we do have plenty of nursing positions open -- and we're always looking for nurses -- it takes a lot to run a hospital, from mechanics to food service to health care IT,&quot; Nichols said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the campaign trail, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama responded to the gloomy economic news by calling for a fresh round of $1,000 rebate checks to be sent to taxpayers. The $65 billion cost would be covered through a tax on oil companies' windfall profits. Obama also proposed $50 billion in new federal spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP presidential candidate John McCain, meanwhile, renewed his call for a job-creation plan that includes cutting the corporate income tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington area's job market has held up relatively well as the national picture has deteriorated. The region's unemployment rate was 3.9 percent in June, the lowest among large metropolitan areas, and the region added 25,300 jobs in the past year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Post asked some experts for their take on a turbulent week in politics. The conversation continues on washingtonpost.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ED ROGERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former deputy assistant to President Bush and chairman of the BGR Group</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain's celebrity ad was effective. It wasn't uncontroversial and it didn't please all the political scientists, but it sure got noticed, and it made Barack Obama overreact. Questions about Obama's desire for celebrity status will linger. He now has to be very careful about intersecting with Hollywood, pop culture and entertainment. Lee Atwater said the worst thing you can do in American politics is play to your negative stereotype. Well, Obama's negative stereotype now includes the idea that he may be a little too glitzy. (Speaking of negative stereotypes, when Obama was talking about the pictures of presidents on dollar bills, was he introducing the presumptuous notion that his face belongs on American currency? I wonder whom he thinks he should replace.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are signs that Obama is beginning to believe all the hype.  So, thinking he would have media cooperation, he tried to preemptively accuse McCain of attacking him because of his race. He forced it, and it didn't work. Bottom line: If McCain had the celebrity ad to do over again, would he do it? Answer: Yes. If Obama had it to do over again, would he talk about race and presidents' pictures on the money in our wallets? Answer: No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain broke through this week and helped himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CARTER ESKEW</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief strategist for Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I once asked a famous commercial advertiser why he didn't attack his big rival, a competing laundry detergent -- say that it &quot;ruins your washing machine!&quot; or &quot;causes hives!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His answer: &quot;Because I might gain temporary market advantage, but I'd devalue the whole category. Sooner or later, people would stop buying soap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may be the main difference between political and commercial marketing: The political marketer is all about temporary advantage -- the field of politics be damned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've seen that familiar dynamic this week in the presidential race. John McCain's team has decided, given the gale forces against his candidacy, that he must destroy his opponent. Nine out of 10 political strategists, when faced with his playing field, would probably take this route. Barack Obama is struggling with a more complex strategic question: How does he counter the mud and not tarnish his own brand? A casual attempt this week to flick McCain's charges off his shoulder dragged Obama into a silly and distracting  discussion of race. The ghosts of losers past must haunt his team -- will Obama be Swift-boated if he doesn't strike back hard?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BENJAMIN GINSBERG</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Partner at Patton Boggs and a veteran of three Republican presidential campaigns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the intensity of the subjects -- race, age, hubris and temperament -- this week has the potential to help define the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the short term, the McCain campaign succeeded in changing the subject from  Obama's triumphant overseas tour. But one good week does not mean  victory. Over the next  12 weeks, the McCain campaign needs to reinforce its message, making certain that voters retain the image of Paris-Britney-Obama in one vacuous celebrity breath. They cannot let voters instead remember the Obama counterattack superimposing &quot;old politics&quot;  on McCain's picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The injection of race into the campaign (whether by Obama's unforced error or by McCain's rapid opportunistic response) can be a game changer. The challenge for the McCain campaign (look what happened to Bill Clinton at the hands of the Obama campaign) is to make certain that this is understood as a smart and strategic inoculation, not a cranky response to an agenda that the McCain camp saw slipping out of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WILLIAM A. GALSTON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior fellow at the Brookings Institution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign needs to think harder about how to respond. The remark about presidents' faces on our currency was a sloppy unforced error, as the campaign quickly recognized, but also symptomatic of a larger problem. On the one hand, Barack Obama cannot afford to let potentially damaging charges go unanswered, as Michael Dukakis did in 1988. On the other, if he gets sucked into the daily back-and-forth of negative campaigning, he will erode what has made him distinctive and attractive. Besides, he seems uncomfortable in that role. It's not an easy call, but on balance, he's probably better advised to stay on the high road while leaving it to surrogates and, if necessary, advertising to answer charges. Getting a vice presidential choice into the fray earlier rather than later would be useful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the overriding imperative is to drive home the message that put Ronald Reagan over the top: While I stand for dramatic change, I'm a safe choice for president. There's nothing Obama can do about his youth, his paucity of experience as conventionally defined, his newness on the national stage or the color of his skin. But he can help the people get more comfortable with him, in part by relentlessly talking about people's problems in terms they can understand and in settings that emphasize intimacy rather than distance. The message people hear must be, &quot;John McCain thinks this election is about me; I think it's about you. And in all the respects that matter, I'm one of you.&quot; But that message will be credible only if Obama doesn't convey the impression, which he sometimes does, that he, too, thinks the election is about him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDWARD J. ROLLINS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Head of Ronald Reagan's 1984 reelection campaign and Mike Huckabee's campaign chairman this year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ad man's dream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Obama being compared to the &quot;silly girls,&quot; you also heard he's going to raise your taxes and make us more dependent on foreign oil. That's the good news for those on the McCain team. The bad news is they may be diminishing their own great brand: &quot;Straight Talker, John McCain!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being attacked in the primaries by Mitt Romney's relentless negative ads, John McCain refused to respond in kind. The Manchester Union Leader praised him and said McCain has &quot;conviction&quot; and that &quot;Granite Staters want a candidate who will look them in the eye and tell them the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I get disturbed when I hear McCain operatives say this campaign is all about Obama and that they have to define the Democrat as &quot;not ready to lead.&quot; This race is also about John McCain. Is he ready to lead? Is he willing to have the courage to move the country in a new direction? The first test will be whether he has the courage to run an honest, &quot;uplifting&quot; campaign. Or will we be going to have more &quot;negative tactics&quot; from the Rove junior varsity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to demand that each candidate look us in the eye and tell us how he gets us out of the mess we're in and the direction in which  he will take the country. If they spend  their TV millions doing that, the country will be well served. And, finally, the news media need to be covering the race, not rerunning political commercials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAD DEVINE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Principal consultant to Al Gore in 2000 and adviser to the John Kerry campaign in 2004</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The celebrity ad and the other attacks are the harbingers of what will inevitably be  an incredibly nasty campaign. Will  they work? Perhaps. But I believe that Obama will prove to be a more elusive target than previous Democratic nominees, stretching back to George McGovern, who were subjected to the Republican attack machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's because Obama's narrative is not one of an elitist, and his rise from a single-mother home almost to  the summit of power is obviously the result of talent and hard work, not favoritism and privilege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign still must find a way to talk about race -- the central fact of this election -- without appearing to be injecting it into the political dialogue. And  the campaign needs to resist the suggestion that it should have opened up a horse-race lead in an election  in which no one will soon move the 15 percent who are hanging out as soft or uncommitted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PANAMA CITY, Fla., Aug. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama tried yesterday to step back from a divisive debate over race, with each candidate denying that he was the first to inject the issue into the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, the candidates and campaigns battled throughout the day over the issue and over which side was engaged in &quot;low road&quot; politics, an indication that race is likely to remain a major point of contention in what is becoming an increasingly bitter contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Obama, the argument was an unwelcome distraction that could complicate his efforts to win over voters who may be skeptical of a relative newcomer with an atypical background. It also pulled the focus away from his efforts to stress bread-and-butter economic issues. For McCain, any hint of racist tactics would hurt his efforts with the moderates and independents he needs to win in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday showed how hard it will be for both to avoid the issue now that it has burst into the public sphere. Obama was heckled in St. Petersburg by black nationalists who accused him of not doing enough for the African American community. In Florida's Panhandle, McCain faced a barrage of questions from reporters and asserted that he is not running a negative campaign &quot;in the slightest,&quot; even as his aides launched their latest online attack ad mocking Obama as a candidate with a messiah complex. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it's negative. I think we're drawing differences between us,&quot; McCain said, adding that Obama &quot;brought up the issue of race,&quot; and, &quot;I responded to it. Because I'm disappointed, and I don't want that issue to be part of this campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to questions about his recent attacks against Obama, McCain said he has been waging &quot;a very respectful campaign.&quot;  McCain has compared Obama to celebrities such as Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, said he is willing to lose a war to win a campaign, said he would rather play basketball than visit wounded troops, and, on Thursday, accused him of playing &quot;the race card&quot; and playing it &quot;from the bottom of the deck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who defended himself against tough policy questions from African Americans yesterday at the National Urban League's annual meeting in Orlando, suggested the media should &quot;move on&quot; from the issue of race because Obama had &quot;retracted&quot; his allegations that he and other Republicans were using his appearance to intimidate voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while Obama has toned down some of the language that the McCain campaign criticized, he did not retract his allegations or back away from his contention that Republicans were trying to scare voters about him. Obama and his aides yesterday faulted McCain for not working hard enough to quash state Republican attacks based on race, saying the candidate was merely stating the obvious when he told Missouri voters Wednesday that some of his opponents were insinuating that he does not fit the mold of a traditional presidential candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was in Union, Missouri, which is 98 percent white -- a rural, conservative [community], and what I said was what I think everybody knows, which is that I don't look like I came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates,&quot; Obama told the St. Petersburg Times. &quot;I think that what people are really concerned about, what they're looking for, is fundamental change on the economy, things that are going to help their families live out the American dream. There was nobody there who thought at all that I was trying to inject race in this. What this has become, I think, is a typical pattern from the McCain campaign, whether it's Paris Hilton or Britney or this phony allegation that I wouldn't visit troops. They seem to be focused on a negative campaign; what I think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to American families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign could produce no evidence that McCain's campaign was responsible for any attack that directly cited his race or his name. Rep. Artur Davis (D-Ala.), an Obama adviser, said the candidate probably regretted evoking McCain's name when he talked about Republican scare tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But adviser Anita Dunn said Obama was more than justified in lodging accusations Wednesday that prompted McCain campaign manager Rick Davis to say Obama had &quot;played the race card.&quot; The North Carolina Republican Party has already used inflammatory images of Obama's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., and the Tennessee Republican Party mocked Obama's middle name, Hussein. Although McCain decried those efforts, Dunn said it was hardly the full-throated, angry denunciation McCain has shown himself capable of, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The McCain campaign has clearly made the decision that there really is not a road too low for them to travel,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Democrats complained in the spring that McCain's first general-election television commercial -- which ended with the line, &quot;John McCain: The American president Americans have been waiting for&quot; -- was an attempt to exploit doubts about a candidate with an African name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Race is a central fact in the campaign. I think it's inescapable,&quot; said Tad Devine, a strategist for Sen. John Kerry's campaign in 2004. &quot;It's smart to push back and push back hard. He's got to make sure that people's antennae are up and that the McCain camp cannot be allowed to send messages to people who are receptive to those messages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For their part, Republicans said the back-and-forth had laid bare an effort by Obama to inoculate himself from the scrutiny any candidate should expect. Obama's stature as the presumptive first black nominee of a major party has made McCain and his campaign &quot;rightfully overly sensitive,&quot; said House Republican Conference Chairman Adam Putnam (Fla.), in whose district Obama campaigned yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama has been playing both sides of the race card long before he was the nominee,&quot; Putnam said. &quot;He played it in the primary. He uses the historic nature of his candidacy to his advantage, which he should, but he also works the refs by accusing his opponents of using the race card, which makes them second-guess common campaign themes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain emphasized his commitment to helping African Americans in yesterday's speech before the Urban League. The Arizonan spoke at length about his support for education, lower taxes and oil drilling -- all of which he said would aid the black community -- before taking more than a dozen questions from the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the group's president, Marc Morial, praised McCain for taking questions, the session was awkward at times, especially when the senator defended his opposition to affirmative action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama wrestled with the issue of racial equality yesterday when hecklers confronted him at a town hall meeting in St. Petersburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why is it that that you have not spoken to the issues or spoken on behalf of the African community?&quot; demanded Diop Olugbala, 31, citing the plight of poor blacks targeted by predatory lenders, police brutality and racist attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama defended his record, saying he had spoken out on every issue the hecklers raised, from the shooting of Sean Bell in New York to the prosecution of the &quot;Jena Six&quot; in Louisiana to predatory lending targeted at blacks and Hispanics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That doesn't mean I'm always going to satisfy the way you guys want me to talk, which gives you the option of voting for someone else, which gives you the option of running for office yourself,&quot; Obama replied, amid deafening cheers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the candidates campaigned, their staffs sparred via e-mail and on the Internet. McCain's campaign issued a Web ad called &quot;The One&quot; that insinuated Obama views himself as akin to Jesus and Moses and includes a clip of actor Charlton Heston, as Moses, parting the Red Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan said the ad was one of McCain's &quot;juvenile antics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain told reporters the attack was made in jest. &quot;We were having some fun with our supporters that we sent it out to,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People magazine has won the bidding for the North American rights to publish exclusive photos of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's newborn twins, Vivienne Marcheline and Knox Leon. And the price is astronomical, even if it's going to charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People, along with Hello! magazine, which beat out OK! magazine for British rights, combined to pay $14 million for use of the images, the Associated Press reported yesterday. People paid a measly  $6 million to feature Jennifer Lopez's twins on its March cover, according to Forbes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photos are scheduled to appear in Monday's new issue of People and will debut on People.com tomorrow evening. Getty Images conducted the exclusive photo shoot with Knox, Vivienne, Jolie, Pitt and the couple's other four children, Maddox, Zahara, Pax and Shiloh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jolie and Pitt sold the  rights to photos of their first-born daughter, Shiloh, born in 2006, to Getty Images in exchange for a donation to charity. People paid $4 million for the U.S. rights at the time, and Hello! obtained British rights. Last year, Jolie and Pitt sold images of 3-year-old son Pax to the same magazines, with each contributing a share of the price.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">A New McCain Refrain </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Country music's latest contribution to the 2008 presidential campaign soundtrack? &quot;Raising McCain&quot; by John McCain supporter John Rich, one half of the Nashville duo Big and Rich. The refrain: &quot;We're all just raising McCain.&quot; (Who would have guessed?)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rich, who supported fellow Tennessean Fred Thompson in the Republican primaries this year, planned to debut the song yesterday at the Country First concert in Panama City, Fla., with McCain in attendance. The singer-songwriter finished the tune about a month ago and sent it to the candidate's daughter, Meghan McCain, who passed it to campaign officials. The anthem focuses on the 5 1/2  years McCain spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The entire world is looking for a way to sucker-punch us,&quot; Rich said. &quot;National security is absolutely at the top of the list of issues. That's why I think John McCain is the guy to keep us safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not so fast, though. Rich's partner in song, Kenny &quot;Big Kenny&quot; Alphin, contributed $2,300 to Barack Obama's campaign last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Meghan McCain was spotted recently with Heidi Montag of &quot;The Hills&quot; -- a celebrity! -- at a trendy Santa Monica eatery, the Los Angeles Times reports.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Noted </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&Acirc;&middot; Elizabeth Taylor has been hospitalized in Los Angeles  but is expected to return home, reps for the 76-year-old Oscar-winning actress told the Associated Press on Thursday. &quot;Ms. Taylor is fine,&quot; read a statement released by her publicist, Dick Guttman. &quot;Her hospital visit was precautionary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&Acirc;&middot; Actor Charles Durning received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame -- the 2,336th star -- next to James Cagney's on Thursday. The 85-year-old took part in  World War II's D-Day invasion and earned two Oscar nominations -- for 1982's &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; and 1983's &quot;To Be or Not to Be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&Acirc;&middot; A lawyer for two men arrested on marijuana-possession charges on Snoop Dogg's tour bus said yesterday that the bus did not have expired tags. The Texas troopers who pulled the bus over  examined it for an expired registration sticker. Ethan Calhoun, 27, and Kevin Barkey, 26, were arrested and later freed on $1,500 bond each. Snoop (real name: Cordozar Calvin Broadus Jr.) was not arrested.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain's campaign Friday accused his Democratic rival of having a Messiah complex in a Web video meant to solicit donations, continuing a weeklong drive to define Sen. Barack Obama as an empty pop-culture creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain told reporters his team is &quot;having some fun with supporters&quot; and insisted he's running a &quot;respectful&quot; campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama in his own fundraising pitch said such mockery from the Republican attempts to invalidate &quot;the desire of millions of Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51,000 Americans lost their jobs, a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics,&quot; Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain video weaves together quotes from Mr. Obama describing the importance of his candidacy and uses footage of Charlton Heston as Moses, parting the Red Sea in &quot;The Ten Commandments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It should be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed. They will call him the One,&quot; a narrator says in the ad that was not set to air on any television stations. &quot;He has anointed himself ready to carry the burden of the One.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad closes with, &quot;Barack Obama may be the One, but is he ready to lead?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new spot follows a national television ad that juxtaposed Mr. Obama with lightweight celebrities Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, and a day after the McCain camp accused Mr. Obama of playing the race card when saying his opponent is trying to scare voters because he &quot;doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illinois Democrat denied Friday that his saying that he doesn't look like the figures on U.S. currency - all dead white men - was a reference to race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama himself all week denounced Mr. McCain for offering the &quot;same old politics&quot; and ridiculed his rival pushing trivial ads to distract from offering solutions to the nation's problems. He highlighted that theme in a Thursday night fundraising e-mail to supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his note, Mr. Obama said the Arizona senator has backtracked from his promise to run a &quot;respectful campaign,&quot; and denounced his rival for saying he is &quot;proud&quot; of his Paris Hilton-Britney Spears ad that's &quot;attacking your enthusiasm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, we're facing some serious challenges in this country - our economy is struggling, energy costs are skyrocketing, and families don't have health care. Given the seriousness of these issues, you'd think we'd be having a serious debate,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;But instead, John McCain is running an expensive, negative campaign against us. Each day brings a desperate new set of attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They believe that in this election the same old smears and negative attacks will prevail again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He concludes with &quot;They're wrong,&quot; and says if people donate $5 or more, his campaign can &quot;prove them wrong in a very concrete way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign manager David Plouffe told supporters in his own Web video that more than 100,000 donations flooded the campaign site in one day after the celebrity ad. He said more than one-third were giving money for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the McCain camp highlighted its candidate's movement in the polls this week in a fundraising letter of its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the biggest celebrity in the world, Barack Obama began the week with a nine-point lead in the Gallup Tracking poll,&quot; read the note. &quot;We made up ground and ended the week even - tied in the Gallup Tracking poll.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gallup Poll released Friday, which includes surveys taken from Tuesday to Thursday, has the two men tied at 44 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain Web ad attached to the fundraising note is riddled with partial Obama quotes. In one, Mr. Obama is shown speaking to an adoring crowd the night he clinched the delegates needed for the nomination, saying: &quot;This was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow, and our planet began to heal.&quot; The footage of Mr. Heston in his iconic 1956 role as Moses follows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full remarks that evening in St. Paul, Minn., make clear the Democrat was not saying he personally would be able to &quot;heal&quot; the planet, saying instead that the campaign trail has vindicated his faith in the &quot;capacity&quot; of Americans and the &quot;movement&quot; that was backing him to accomplish that task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we are willing to work for it, and fight for it, and believe in it, then I am absolutely certain that generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick, and good jobs for the jobless,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow, and our planet began to heal. This was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation, and restored our image as the last, best hope on Earth. This was the moment, this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John McCain accused Barack Obama of playing politics with race yesterday, raising the issue after the first black candidate with a serious chance of winning the White House claimed Republicans will try to scare voters by saying he &quot;doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until now, the subject of race has been almost taboo in the campaign, at least in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm disappointed that Senator Obama would say the things he's saying,&quot; McCain told reporters in Racine, Wis. The Arizona senator said he agreed with campaign manager Rick Davis' statement earlier that &quot;Barack Obama has played the race card, and he played it from the bottom of the deck. It's divisive, negative, shameful and wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In turn, Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said, &quot;We weren't suggesting in any way he's using race as an issue&quot; but that McCain &quot;is using the same old low-road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A day earlier, Obama argued that President Bush and McCain have little to offer voters so Republicans will resort to a strategy of fear to keep the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What they're going to try to do is make you scared of me,&quot; Obama said. &quot;You know, he's not patriotic enough, he's got a funny name, you know, he doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills&quot; - white men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama long has talked about his physical appearance in speeches, but McCain advisers argue he crossed a significant line by accusing the GOP of scare tactics and alluding to his own race in the same breath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The back-and-forth was the latest spike in a contest that's grown increasingly negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opening a new front Wednesday, the GOP campaign rolled out a commercial that uses pictures of 20-something stars Britney Spears and Paris Hilton to suggest that Obama is little more than a media darling who is unqualified to be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama's campaign countered with its own ad that called McCain's charges &quot;baloney&quot; and &quot;baseless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Cedar Rapids, Iowa, yesterday, Obama steered clear of race as he chided McCain, saying: &quot;So far, all we've been hearing about is Paris Hilton. I do have to ask my opponent: 'Is that the best you can do? Is that what this election is really all about?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain expressed pride in the ad while campaigning in Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moments later McCain praised his rival when an 18-year-old woman criticized Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I just have to say, Obama terrifies me,&quot; she said. &quot;I just want to say I think you should call him on every shot. Don't let him get away with a single . . . we can't afford it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I respect and admire Senator Obama. We just have stark differences,&quot; McCain replied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day his son was born -- June 29, 2007 --was one of the happiest of Bret Baier's  life. One day later, the Fox News White House correspondent discovered that the baby had five life-threatening congenital heart defects. His father-in-law turned to him and said, &quot;You've found your cause.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Francis Baier is now a bouncing 13-mouth-old with a mighty grateful family:  Children's National Medical Center announced yesterday that Baier, his wife, Amy, and in-laws Paul and Barbara Hills have donated $1 million to the hospital. &quot;It's our family's gift,&quot; Baier told us. &quot;We're fortunate to be in the position to give back to a place that has done so much for us.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his short life,  Paul Baier has had two open-heart surgeries and two angioplasties. The first eight-hour operation, when he was just 12 days old, was performed by world-renowned pediatric cardiologist Richard Jonas, who called it one of the most complicated of his career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Baiers spent more than two months at the center, which persuaded them to make children's heart research and technology the focus of their philanthropy. &quot;One out of 100 kids has some kind of heart defect,&quot; said Baier. Part of the $1 million donation goes to establish a high-tech media room that will allow doctors to consult from all over the world; the balance will support Jonas's research on preventing brain damage during surgery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The baby is now a toddler: walking, running, dunking the roll of toilet paper in the bowl and throwing it at the wall. &quot;He is awesome,&quot; said his dad. &quot;He is all boy. He gets into everything. . . . We are incredibly grateful.&quot;<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM </SPAN><BR></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&Acirc;&middot; If you're going to make fun of a vapid famous-for-being-famous heiress, it's always a good idea to check the donor roster first. The Hilton family looks pretty devoted to John McCain, whose new &quot;Celeb&quot; ad kinda picks on sweet young Paris while mocking Barack Obama, reports our colleague Garance Franke-Ruta. Parents Rick and Kathy Hilton have maxed out with $4,600 in individual contributions to McCain, and granddad William Barron Hilton has given him $2,300 -- plus $35,000 or so to the National Republican Senatorial Committee since 2006. Way to lose your Hilton Honors status!<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">THE SOURCE QUOTE </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you notice,  since  Britney started wearing clothes and behaving; Paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore, thank God; and, evidently, Lindsay Lohan has gone gay, we don't seem to have much of an issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton explaining why he opposes new legislation to penalize celebrity photographers. Bratton interrupted his morning workout and jumped into a live interview on L.A.'s KNBC-TV yesterday to &quot;set the record straight&quot;: The paparazzo frenzy, he said, was primarily caused by recovering bad girls Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Lohan and is under control.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">LOVE, ETC. </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&Acirc;&middot;  Playing hardball: Alex Rodriguez, who  said yesterday that his alleged &quot;extramarital affairs and other marital misconduct&quot; were &quot;immaterial and impertinent&quot; to a divorce settlement. In court documents, the New York Yankee responded to wife Cynthia's divorce petition by admitting that their marriage was &quot;irretrievably broken&quot; but that she was  entitled only to the amount set in their 2002 prenup, plus child support for their two kids. No extra $$$$ for his late-night chats with . . . say, Madonna.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, July 31</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain's campaign accused Sen. Barack Obama of playing the &quot;race card&quot; on Thursday, a day after the Democrat said his opponent and other Republicans would try to scare voters by pointing to Obama's &quot;funny name&quot; and the fact that &quot;he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charge was the first time the campaigns had directly confronted the subject of race. Although both sides have sought to avoid raising the thorny issue, the back-and-forth showed that it was perhaps inevitable the topic would emerge in a campaign in which an African American is headed for a major-party nomination for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exchange was reminiscent of several flare-ups over race during the Democratic primaries, when the Obama campaign complained about comments made by Bill Clinton in support of the candidacy of his wife, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. The former president responded by accusing the Obama campaign of &quot;feeding&quot; the news media to keep the issue of race alive. Obama also tackled the issue in a major speech in Philadelphia to quell controversy over the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr., his former pastor, who accused the U.S. government of conspiring against African Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign's charge comes in a week in which it has launched a series of increasingly harsh attacks against Obama, accusing the Democrat of turning his back on wounded troops and being an arrogant, out-of-touch celebrity who does not appreciate the problems of average Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain aides said they were driven to raise the race issue after three Obama appearances Wednesday in Missouri. In them,  the Democrat took on McCain's recent aggressiveness and alluded to remarks about his name and looks that McCain campaign officials said have never been uttered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama has played the race card, and he played it from the bottom of the deck,&quot; McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said in a statement. &quot;It's divisive, negative, shameful and wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama began his day Wednesday in Springfield, Mo., charging: &quot;Nobody really thinks that Bush or McCain have a real answer for the challenges we face, so what they're going to try to do is make you scared of me. You know, he's not patriotic enough. He's got a funny name. You know, he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills, you know. He's risky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Rolla and then in Union, Obama issued similar lines. &quot;They're going to try to say, 'Well, you know, he's got a funny name, and he doesn't look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five-dollar bills,' and they're going to send out nasty e-mails,&quot; he told an audience in Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E-mails making false charges against Obama have circulated for months, but there is no evidence that McCain's campaign has been behind them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama aides said the candidate's remarks were no different from applause lines he has used for months. At a mid-June fundraiser in Jacksonville, Fla., for instance, Obama said: &quot;They're going to try to make you afraid of me. He's young and inexperienced and he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama did appear to expand upon the theme by linking the attacks to McCain by name. Asked what specifically Obama was referring to, campaign manager David Plouffe avoided the question, saying, &quot;What we're seeing out of the McCain campaign, the Republican Party and some of their allies have been some very aggressive charges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama strategist Robert Gibbs said separately: &quot;Barack Obama in no way believes that the McCain campaign is using race as an issue, but he does believe they're using the same old low-road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign, and those are the issues he'll continue to talk about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain aides acknowledged that Obama has leveled similar accusations for some time, but they said the insinuations that McCain was personally a party to racism required a response. In an e-mail, senior McCain aide Mark Salter wrote that Davis issued the statement to defend McCain &quot;from Obama's repeated suggestion that he's running a racist campaign.&quot; Salter continued: &quot;When he did it the first time yesterday, we let it pass. When he did it again later, specifically linking us to it, we decided to respond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salter added that &quot;there isn't a shred of evidence&quot; that McCain &quot;would tolerate such a thing,&quot; noting that the senator from Arizona had denounced an Ohio radio talk show host who mocked Obama's name and that he criticized an ad by the North Carolina Republican Party highlighting Obama's ties to Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to a question on CNN about whether it was fair to say that Obama was playing the race card, McCain responded: &quot;It is. I'm sorry to say that it is. It's legitimate. And we don't -- there's no place in this campaign for that. There's no place for it, and we shouldn't be doing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also defended the more aggressive strategy at a town hall meeting in Wisconsin, where a young woman asked him why he had launched an ad juxtaposing Obama with Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. &quot;What we are talking about here is substance, and not style,&quot; he said. &quot;Campaigns are tough, but I am proud of the campaign we have run, I'm proud of the issues we have raised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days, McCain has aired advertisements and issued statements labeling his opponent a vapid celebrity akin to Hilton and Spears, accusing him of canceling a visit to wounded veterans because he could not bring along a media entourage, and suggesting he would raise taxes on electricity -- all questionable assertions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Battling what aides called McCain's &quot;gutter distractions,&quot; Obama's team continued to push back Thursday on the stump and launched a Web site called the Low Road Express.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a town hall meeting in Cedar Rapids, though, Obama did seem to pull back slightly from his remarks Wednesday, dropping references to his name and looks. &quot;All they're doing is churning out the same stuff they do every four years. All you have to do is change the name,&quot; Obama told a boisterous crowd. &quot;So when you hear my opponent say he's too risky, what they're really saying is 'We know we don't have any good ideas, but you should be worried about him.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Wilkins, an African American scholar at George Mason University, called Obama's Missouri statements &quot;fair campaigning,&quot; considering McCain's recent attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems to me at this point it would be naive of the Obama campaign not to anticipate efforts to tear at Obama's character the way Bush tore away at John Kerry's character four years ago. So if a fellow can rationally expect a Swift boat full of funny racial angles racing at him, he would only be sane to try to deflect that,&quot; Wilkins said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a celebrity-driven culture that has left little space for John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate has decided to go tabloid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By featuring Paris Hilton and Britney Spears in an attack ad against Barack Obama, the senator from Arizona  has risked charges of silliness to draw attention to his frequently overshadowed campaign. And on one level, it has worked: Television, with its love of pop culture, has replayed the spot hundreds of times, and the NBC, MSNBC and Fox morning shows had aides to McCain and Obama  debating it Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, analysts questioned what message McCain was sending by interspersing footage of his Democratic opponent before a huge crowd in Berlin with that of two socialites famous for their irresponsible antics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't get it,&quot; said Ken Goldstein, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. &quot;Is it valid to go after Barack Obama on inexperience, being a bit glib, perhaps even a bit arrogant for doing the European tour? Absolutely. But you just sound dopey when you put Paris Hilton in an ad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shanto Iyengar, a professor of political science and communications at Stanford University, said McCain needs &quot;to come up with a more affirmative narrative for his candidacy -- Why is he running? What does he stand for? -- before going after Barack Obama.&quot; But he added: &quot;McCain has lost the free media contest over the past couple of weeks; he's desperate to make the news, and controversial attacks are more newsworthy than boilerplate positive ads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial, which calls Obama &quot;the biggest celebrity in the world,&quot; reflects frustration with the sizable imbalance in media coverage, with the senator from Illinois  featured in recent weeks in People, Us Weekly and Rolling Stone and on &quot;Access Hollywood.&quot; Unable to compete on that playing field, McCain operatives have taken to mocking Obama's global fame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said at a town hall meeting here that he is &quot;proud&quot; of the ad as stressing &quot;substance and not style,&quot; and his spokeswoman, Nicolle Wallace, defended it. &quot;The ad is meant to acknowledge reality -- that he is huge, that he is a celebrity,&quot; she said of Obama. &quot;It wasn't meant to be insulting. One of the things we learned from Hillary Clinton running against Obama is that railing against his celebrity, whining about his celebrity, doesn't work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama aides dismiss the latest ad as pointless. &quot;To inject Britney Spears and Paris Hilton into the debate is beneath what America deserves,&quot; spokesman Bill Burton said. &quot;It was a way for them to get attention for yet another inaccurate, misleading negative attack. People are caught up with the gimmick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to earlier negative spots by McCain, the Obama camp rolled out a counterattack ad with the line: &quot;John McCain. Same old politics; same failed policies.&quot; That ad drew on widespread media criticism of the recent McCain&nbsp;commercials, which a New York Times editorial called &quot;low road,&quot; a USA Today editorial dubbed &quot;baloney&quot; and Time described as &quot;baseless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The televised attacks by McCain represent a decision that he must tarnish Obama as an out-of-touch tax-raiser with little sympathy for the military, much as President Bush devoted the bulk of his 2004 advertising to denigrating Democratic nominee John F. Kerry. The McCain camp said it has aired four positive spots for every negative one, beginning in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One McCain&nbsp;ad assailed Obama for deciding against visiting soldiers at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center while he was in Germany, saying that &quot;he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops.&quot; Several news organizations, including The Washington Post, said there was no evidence to support the ad's key allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another ad blamed Obama for &quot;rising prices at the pump,&quot; although he has been a senator for four years and McCain  has said increased energy prices represent a problem that developed over 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the media criticism, the ads have forced Obama to play defense on such issues as his opposition to offshore oil drilling, which McCain opposed in his 2000 campaign but now supports. &quot;Every time they put up a negative ad, we're going to respond with the force of truth,&quot; said Burton, the Obama spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even some McCain allies have winced at the Paris/Britney spot. Republican strategist Dan Schnur, a former McCain adviser, said that &quot;most voters won't see the parallels between a presidential candidate and two party girls. So a legitimate point about inexperience gets lost in the appearance of name-calling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, McCain has succeeded in using meager ad buys to generate free news coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evan Tracey of the Campaign Media Analysis Group said the ad on the canceled troops visit, which dominated cable news for days, has aired just nine times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're running against a rock star and have a huge disadvantage in money, you do the oldest trick in the book,&quot; Goldstein said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's awfully early for John McCain to be running such a desperate, ugly campaign against Barack Obama. But I guess it's useful for Democrats to get a reminder that the Republican Party plays presidential politics by the same moral code that guided the bad-boy Oakland Raiders in their heyday: &quot;Just win, baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest bit of snarling, mean-spirited nonsense to come out of the McCain camp was the accusation, leveled by campaign manager Rick Davis, that Obama had &quot;played the race card.&quot; He did so, apparently, by being black. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, at a campaign stop in Missouri, Obama had predicted that Republicans would try to &quot;make you scared of me. You know, 'He's not patriotic enough, he's got a funny name,' you know, 'he doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills.' &quot; So what does Davis do? He promptly tries to make voters scared of Obama by feigning outrage over the presumptive Democratic nominee's &quot;divisive, negative, shameful and wrong&quot; remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course the McCain campaign isn't really offended that the first black major-party candidate for president in American history might mention this distinction from time to time. The idea is to slow Obama down before he runs away with this thing, and the weapon of choice is handfuls of mud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember St. John the Reformer, who promised a high-minded campaign and said he wouldn't question his opponent's patriotism? Clearly, he's been replaced by an evil twin. The switch seems to have taken place during his opponent's world tour, when Obama's prescriptions for Iraq and Afghanistan began to look prescient -- and McCain's began to look irrelevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain kept saying that Obama &quot;doesn't understand&quot; the war zones -- even though the president of Afghanistan, the prime minister of Iraq and even U.S. military officials on the ground seemed to think Obama understood both situations quite well. McCain then resorted to the outrageous charge that Obama &quot;would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign.&quot; I think that qualifies as an allegation that Obama is &quot;not patriotic enough,&quot; don't you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then the McCain campaign has sharply escalated its rhetorical attacks -- making blatantly false claims, for example, about a canceled visit with injured troops in Germany. The blitz has been successful in one of its aims, which is to drive the news cycle and thus focus attention on McCain. Much less clear is whether voters really want to elect Don Rickles as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The low point so far is McCain's bizarre ad that flashes images of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears before showing Obama in Berlin addressing the multitudes. In what promises to be a major attack theme, the ad derides Obama as &quot;the biggest celebrity in the world&quot; -- an attempt to turn Obama's popularity into some kind of fatal flaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, Davis and campaign senior adviser Steve Schmidt -- a veteran of George W. Bush's 2004 campaign -- kept returning to the word &quot;celebrity&quot; in describing Obama. It's a classic attempt to take a positive and turn it into a negative, as was done with John Kerry's heroic service in Vietnam by the odious Swift boat campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign's excursion into popular culture has been so aggressive that the Obama campaign felt obliged to promptly denounce a new song by Ludacris that criticizes both McCain and Hillary Clinton in crude terms. Never mind that the rapper has no association with Obama's candidacy, and never mind that McCain is probably not intimately familiar with the Ludacris oeuvre. All this gnashing and flailing would be laughable if it weren't so purposeful. The aim is to cast an aura of doubt around Obama -- to portray him as handsome and popular but insubstantial, as a &quot;celebrity&quot; who's not really up to the job. Oh, and not that we would ever mention such a thing, but did you notice that Obama had the audacity to mention that he's African American?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has been quick to respond with new television ads accusing McCain of practicing the &quot;old politics.&quot; Kerry's unhappy experience showed that this kind of define-your-opponent blitzkrieg, however ridiculous the attacks may be, has to be answered immediately -- and in kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negative campaigning is not a pretty thing, and it should be beneath John McCain to stoop so low. But Democrats would be foolish to forget that sometimes it works.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is John McCain losing it?&quot; Wall Street Journal columnist Daniel Henninger writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Sunday, he said on national television that to solve Social Security 'everything's on the table,' which of course means raising payroll taxes. On July 7 in Denver he said: 'Senator Obama will raise your taxes. I won't.' This isn't a flip-flop. It's a sex-change operation,&quot; Mr. Henninger said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He got back to the subject Tuesday in Reno, Nev. Reporters asked about the Sunday tax comments. Mr. McCain replied, 'The worst thing you could do is raise people's payroll taxes, my God!' Then he was asked about working with Democrats to fix Social Security, and he repeated, 'everything has to be on the table.' But how can ...? Oh never mind</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Wednesday] he was in Aurora, Colo., to wit: 'On Social Security, he [Senator Obama] wants to raise Social Security taxes. I am opposed to raising taxes on Social Security. I want to fix the system without raising taxes.' What I'm asking is, does John McCain have the mental focus, the intellectual discipline, to avoid being out-slicked by Barack Obama, if he isn't abandoned by his own voters? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not just taxes. Recently the subject came up of Al Gore's assertion that the U.S. could get its energy solely from renewables in 10 years. Sen. McCain said: 'If the vice president says it's doable, I believe it's doable.' What!!?? In a later interview, Mr. McCain said he hadn't read 'all the specifics' of the Gore plan and now, 'I don't think it's doable without nuclear power.' It just sounds loopy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then this week in San Francisco, in an interview with the Chronicle, Sen. McCain called Nancy Pelosi an 'inspiration to millions of Americans.' Notwithstanding his promises to 'work with the other side,' this is a politically obtuse thing to say in the middle of a campaign. Would Bill Clinton, running for president in 1996 after losing control of the House, have called Newt Gingrich an 'inspiration'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Post-partisan'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many governors endorse one candidate for president and then even before the election leave the door open to working in his opponent's administration? One so far: Arnold Schwarzenegger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former bodybuilder and actor boasts that he's California's first &quot;post-partisan&quot; governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The middle-of-the-road Republican uses his willingness to cross party lines as a way to connect with the state's Democratic-leaning electorate. But the presidential race between Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama is putting this ideological squishiness to the test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Schwarzenegger endorsed Mr. McCain, his friend and fellow Republican, and will appear on the Arizona senator's behalf at the Republican National Convention this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Mr. Schwarzenegger also has made clear that Mr. Obama wouldn't be so bad. He commonly answers questions about global warming and other topics by saying that either candidate will be a big improvement over President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, Mr. Schwarzenegger responded to a hypothetical question by saying he wouldn't rule out a job in an Obama administration. This prompted a furious backlash from conservative bloggers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would take his call now, I will take his call when he's president - any time. Remember, no matter who is president, I don't see this as a political thing. I see this as we always have to help, no matter what the administration is,&quot; he said, though he added that he intends to serve out his last term as governor, which ends in 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Attack' ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The McCain campaign's new television ad comparing Barack Obama to shallow celebrities such as Britney Spears and Paris Hilton so upset the network news operations that they all ran full stories, with ABC and NBC leading with the 'attack ad,'&quot; the Media Research Center's Brent Baker writes at www.mrc.org.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Though all tried to frame their stories as balanced looks at attacks against each other by both campaigns, it was the McCain&nbsp;ad which prompted the stories, the language used painted McCain as the aggressor and Obama as the victim fighting back ('responded,' 'fired back' and 'hitting back') and two of the stories featured condemnations of the McCain&nbsp;ad as 'childish' or 'juvenile,'&quot; Mr. Baker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ABC's Charles Gibson teased: 'McCain says Obama is all star power and no substance. Obama says McCain is using scare tactics. It's getting nasty. And it's only July.' Reporter David Wright, who relayed how 'Obama told an audience in Missouri the Republicans are just trying to scare voters,' concluded with how 'it's getting ugly early, and some Republicans are expressing concern about McCain's tone, in particular one former McCain aide calling the new celebrity ad childish.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On CBS, which put 'Attack Ad' on screen, Katie Couric asserted: 'John McCain sharpened his attack against Barack Obama, trying to turn his popularity against him. And late today, Obama fired back.' For an expert assessment, Chip Reid went to the Politico's David Mark, who declared that the McCain&nbsp;ad 'seems a little juvenile.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those racists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's statement [Wednesday] about Republican scare tactics is merely the latest in a string of statements in which he suggests that certain Americans are intrinsically racist, and those Americans aren't just confined to political opponents,&quot; Peter Kirsanow writes at National Review Online (www.nationalreview.com).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His declaration that his grandmother was a 'typical white person,' was, at the time, derided primarily because it was seen as Obama 'throwing her under the bus' for political expediency. But the statement's premise - that the 'typical' white person is a reflexive racist - is at least as offensive,&quot; Mr. Kirsanow said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Similarly, the commentary surrounding Obama's statement to San Francisco elites about bitter, working-class voters focused largely on the condescension in his claim that such folks 'cling to guns or religion.' Somewhat ignored was the clause 'or antipathy to people who aren't like them.' Again, Obama is branding a huge swath of the American populace in unsavory terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the primaries his campaign lept upon any statement that was even remotely related to color as evidence of racist intent. This is, to say the least, peculiar for someone whose campaign was based in part on racial transcendence. Even more so for someone who doesn't seem to have encountered any pernicious racism or racial barriers in his personal life. His profligate insinuations of racism now are far beyond unseemly. As the possible next president of the United States, he needs to be called on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain accused presidential opponent Barack Obama on Thursday of playing the race card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama ridiculed Mr. McCain for depicting him as a lightweight celebrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day after the release of a McCain&nbsp;ad comparing Mr. Obama to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, both campaigns veered away from the issues and into a squabble over who said what, who intended what and who insinuated the rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks ought to just buckle up their seat belts,&quot; said Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, telling reporters on a conference call that they can expect more. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Plouffe announced a new Web site to catalog what he said were false attacks and distortions from Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours earlier, the McCain campaign said Mr. Obama crossed the line of racial politics. Mr. Obama said Wednesday that President Bush and Mr. McCain attacked him as unworthy of the presidency because, as the Democrat put it, he doesn't &quot;look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poll shows Mr. McCain has made up ground in the past month in three big swing states: Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Quinnipiac University Poll put Mr. Obama ahead 46 percent to 44 percent in Ohio and Florida, and showed Mr. McCain narrowing a 12 percentage point gap in Pennsylvania to seven points, 49 percent to 42 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The $64,000 question is whether Senator John McCain's surge is a result of Senator Obama's much-publicized Middle Eastern and European trip, or just a coincidence that it occurred while Senator Obama was abroad,&quot; said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown said high gas prices have turned voters in favor of expanded offshore oil and gas drilling, a position Mr. McCain has embraced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tail end of the latest McCain&nbsp;ad takes a jab at Mr. Obama for opposing the expansion of oil drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's tone has become harsher after extensive media coverage of Mr. Obama's overseas trip and after changes within the campaign. In early July, Steve Schmidt, a veteran of Republican congressional campaigns and President Bush's 2004 re-election, was promoted to oversee day-to-day operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Schmidt on Wednesday alluded to the new McCain&nbsp;ad when he told reporters that the campaign has identified a central question for voters: &quot;Do the American people want to elect the world's biggest celebrity or do they want to elect an American hero?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since returning from his overseas trip, Mr. Obama has faced a hail of attacks from Mr. McCain. They began with a charge that the Democrat snubbed wounded American troops by canceling a visit to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the large U.S. military hospital in Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign then began airing the ad that associates Mr. Obama with the celebrity culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editorial boards and campaign ad watchdog groups called the commercial misleading, but coverage of the ad reached an incredibly diverse audience, including pop culture Web sites such as MTV and TMZ.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said Thursday that Mr. McCain is demeaning the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far, all we've been hearing about is Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. I mean, I do, I do have to ask my opponent, is that the best you can come up with? Is that really what this election's about? Is that what is worthy of the American people?&quot; he said in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrat sent a fundraising e-mail asking supporters to give money to help counter Mr. McCain's&nbsp;commercial. His campaign also announced a new Web site to catalog Mr. McCain's negative attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Mr. Obama was far more pointed, twice suggesting that Republicans were operating a stealth campaign about race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody really thinks that Bush or McCain have a real answer for the challenges we face, so what they're going to try to do is make you scared of me: You know, he's not patriotic enough. He's got a funny name. You know, he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills, you know. He's risky. That's essentially the argument they're making.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said that amounted to playing &quot;the race card, and he played it from the bottom of the deck.&quot; Mr. McCain concurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I agree with it, and I'm disappointed that Senator Obama would say the things he's saying,&quot; Mr. McCain told reporters in Racine, Wis. He told his town hall audience that he was proud of the celebrity ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his conference call with reporters, Mr. Plouffe was asked twice to point out where Mr. Bush or Mr. McCain had said the Democrat didn't look like American presidents. Mr. Plouffe did not give a direct answer, but said Mr. Obama didn't intend to raise the issue of race.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is not even Jewish, but he speaks fluent chutzpah, the Yiddish word to describe &quot;nerve,&quot; as in, &quot;he's got a lot of nerve.&quot; Chutzpah famously described the plea of the man who killed his parents and begged the court to show mercy on a poor orphan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator himself played the race card this week and accused John McCain of raising the race issue. This follows the contretemps over his written prayer at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, which someone removed from a crevice in the wall and gave to the Israeli newspaper Ma'ariv, which printed it, raising a storm of angry scolding of the newspaper for &quot;sacrilege&quot; and &quot;invasion of privacy&quot; and demands for a criminal investigation of the editor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only now Ma'ariv says that it was the Obama campaign that wanted to get the prayer to several Jerusalem newspapers, and wanted someone, anyone, everyone, to print it. Only Ma'ariv did. It's a nice prayer, covering several points on which Mr. Obama has been criticized, written on the letterhead of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem in a hand that might - or might not - have been Barack Obama's. The campaign won't confirm or deny that it was the work of the messiah from the South Side of Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lord,&quot; the prayer goes, &quot;protect my family and me. Forgive my sins, and help me guard against pride and despair. Give me the wisdom to do what is right and just. And make me an instrument of your will.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collusion with newspapers or not, the Obama campaign moved smartly to collude with everybody else, putting up a campaign commercial on YouTube.com, showing footage of the senator at the wall, a holy shrine of Judaism, then poetically framed against several images of the Cross, wreathed by doves (or maybe pigeons), with the text of the prayer flashed on screen twice before dissolving into frames of the usual admonitions to vote, and repeating the campaign mantra of promising &quot;change to believe in.&quot; All this is accompanied by a slow, tinkling version of &quot;Amazing Grace,&quot; the iconic hymn of evangelical Christianity. (Someone forgot to throw in a Koran.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race and religion were once the twin taboos of political campaigning, no more fit for the stump than for a polite dinner party. But in the wake of the '60s, with conventions, manners and decency in retreat, religion turned out to be good politics. Something to &quot;cling to&quot; (along with guns). The Republicans and the conservatives got there first, with &quot;the Southern strategy&quot; of the Nixon era, followed by the awakening of the Religious Right. The Democrats were content to mock and jeer until it occurred to some of the smarter ones, like Barack Obama, that it was foolish to write off a winning appeal to such a large, law-abiding segment of the American public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A campaign commercial like &quot;Obama's Big Adventure&quot; is something a smart Republican wouldn't touch. The reporters and pundits following the campaign were shocked - shocked! - last spring when Mike Huckabee was filmed against a bookcase whose shelf arrangement reminded those of offended refinement of the Cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Barack Obama thinks he can get by with a lot, and for now he may be right. His injection of race was hardly subtle, though if we lived in more grown-up times his remarks would hardly be worth remarking. &quot;Nobody thinks [George W.] Bush and [John] McCain have a real answer to the challenges we face,&quot; the candidate told a Wednesday audience. &quot;So what they're going to try to do is make you scared of me. You know, 'He's not patriotic enough, he's got a funny name.' You know, 'He doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is nice work, if you can make it work - equating criticism of a black candidate with racism and prejudice. The McCain campaign demurred, not so nicely. &quot;Barack Obama has played the race card, and he played it from the bottom of the deck,&quot; said Rick Davis, the manager of the McCain campaign. &quot;It's divisive, negative, shameful and wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, dear. The Obama campaign was shocked - shocked! - to think that anyone could think the senator's allusion to race was about race. &quot;He was describing that he was new to the political scene,&quot; a spokesman explained. &quot;He was referring to the fact that he didn't come into the race with the history of others. It is not about race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course not. It's about chutzpah.</SPAN></P>

A second Ma'ariv spokesman and the Obama campaign dispute the first Ma'ariv spokesman's account, and the newspaper refuses to comment further. The column also said the Obama campaign posted a video about the candidate's visit to Jerusalem on the Internet site YouTube.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Ted Stevens, Alaska Republican, learned of his federal grand jury indictment charging him with seven felony counts of making false statements &quot;from the CNN news ticker,&quot; a well-placed Republican source on Capitol Hill tells Inside the Beltway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CELEBRITY JINX </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of John McCain's latest television ad attempting to adjoin &quot;celebrity&quot; candidate Barack Obama to the likes of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, Mr. Obama and Democrats vying for the White House before him can't help but enjoy overwhelming support from Hollywood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Mr. Obama doesn't want, or so one leading celebrity insider tells this columnist, is a &quot;Hollywood convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Out here people are talking about, 'Are you going to the convention?' They don't even ask which convention, almost like Minneapolis doesn't even exist,&quot; says Ted Johnson, editor at large of Variety, referring to the Democratic and Republican conventions in Denver and Minneapolis-St. Paul, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Mr. Johnson draws attention to &quot;Hollywood's affinity for Obama and the Democrats&quot; by highlighting $4.4 million in &quot;showbiz sector&quot; contributions so far for Mr. Obama, more than five times Mr. McCain's total of just over $757,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the Variety editor, in an interview heard on Inside the Beltway Radio at washingtontimes.com, points out that &quot;too much glitz&quot; will land any presidential candidate in hot water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just look at what Barack Obama has said as he was on his way back from Europe. He was saying I have to get out there and start talking about economic issues in Ohio, in Iowa, around the 'common people.' So this is a troubling thing for any campaign actually is how do you bring celebrities into the mix?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a temptation there to help you draw crowds and everything, but there's a downside to it. It kind of feeds into the notion that you're somehow elitist, or somehow in this exclusive club that is separated from the common man, so to speak,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, campaign contributions are difficult for any presidential candidate to turn down, and Mr. Johnson says Mr. Obama can expect a star-studded fundraiser this fall for his campaign hosted by &quot;the trio behind DreamWorks&quot; - moviemakers Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no lack of people who want to host a fundraiser for Obama, but the candidate literally has to pick and choose. There's a lot of politics just involved in that decision,&quot; he explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I should say that John McCain actually has been out here quite prominently raising money within the entertainment business,&quot; Mr. Johnson adds. &quot;He has a big supporter, his name is Harry Sloan, he's actually the head of MGM, and he's been with him from the start and has actually had several fundraisers at his home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HILLARY AND HANNAH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ask one well-known Washington pundit and she'll tell you the time is ripe for Barack Obama to bring his old adversary back into the fold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At this point, if Barack Obama really wanted to cause excitement with his vice president pick and do the unexpected ... he will put Hillary Clinton on the ticket as his veep running mate,&quot; Cheri Jacobus opines on the GOPUSA blog</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She explains that if Mr. Obama had chosen Mrs. Clinton from the get-go &quot;it would not have been a positive dynamic. The press would all be quite bored with it by now, and the 'Bill factor' would be front and center throughout the summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if Obama picks her now, the press, Democrats and a host of others will all go crazy and the faux unity of the party will have Democrat conventioneers in Denver fainting like teeny-boppers at a Miley Cyrus [Hannah Montana] concert,&quot; Miss Jacobus says. &quot;Bring on the smelling salts.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In today's self-absorbed, celebrity-drenched American culture, it didn't take long for the likes of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton to clutter the election landscape. Sen. John McCain may believe linking the celebrity style of Sen. Barack Obama with that of useless, overindulged folks will score points; he sadly is &quot;so 20th-century&quot; &quot;McCain&nbsp;ad rips celebrity Obama,&quot; Page 1, Thursday). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are a nation in thrall to 24/7 celebrity sightings and happenings and have become numbed to vital, substantive news. The line is smudged between importance and hype. Celebrities are famous for being famous and reside in a frothy, superficial world. Mr. Obama - definitely a &quot;celebrity,&quot; thanks to his world-tour exposure - hardly inhabits the flummery of a Spears or a Hilton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, Americans are loath to move outside their comfort zones and want to be liked everywhere. Watching the adulation of Mr. Obama abroad was welcome relief from the recent, contemptuous rhetoric of &quot;freedom fries&quot; and &quot;Old Europe.&quot; Most people are fascinated by the famous, so it's doubtful Mr. McCain's swipe at Mr. Obama will carry much weight. Yet I, for one, deplore our plugged-in way of life because it has placed a presidential candidate on the same stage with two silly women of no consequence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">KANSAS CITY, Mo., July 30</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain last week delivered one of his sharpest critiques yet of Sen. Barack Obama's Iraq policies, carefully reading a prepared speech that accused his Democratic rival of failing the commander-in-chief test and promoting ideas that would force American troops to &quot;retreat under fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But just hours after his crisp performance, the Republican presidential candidate blurred his own message with an offhand comment to a television interviewer that Obama's proposal for a 16-month time frame for removing combat troops from Iraq might be a &quot;pretty good timetable.&quot; That seemed to run counter to his attempts to cast Obama as naive on foreign policy, and it sent his aides scrambling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Election Day nears, McCain's campaign is adopting the aggressive, take-no-prisoners style of Karl Rove, the GOP operative who engineered victories for President Bush. The campaign continued the attack Wednesday with a sarcastic television ad deriding Obama as a &quot;celebrity,&quot; part of an intensifying effort to cast him as an elitist. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the sharp-edged approach is being orchestrated for an unpredictable candidate who often chafes at delivering the campaign's message of the day. It is that freewheeling style that has made him popular with voters and cemented his reputation for candor and straight talk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who was most comfortable as an underdog in the unscripted environment of the New Hampshire primary, makes his advisers cringe as he delivers the attack line -- and then keeps talking. In that respect, he is no Bush, his handlers say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is a presidential campaign that sometimes rolls between serious policy discussions about the nation's future and gotcha politics aimed at undermining his opponent's character. McCain himself is often caught in the middle, proclaiming his commitment to the former while participating in the latter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For weeks, McCain's staff has been criticized for running a campaign that has no clear message. The decision by the senator from Arizona to have former Bush strategist Steve Schmidt run daily operations was described as a way to get control of the message. But some Republicans outside the campaign believe that not much has changed since then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the candidate,&quot; said one GOP strategist with close ties to the campaign, who added that efforts to identify a theme for each week quickly unravel as McCain veers off message in his public comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a town hall meeting in Pennsylvania last week, McCain stood before a banner that proclaimed &quot;Energy Solutions&quot; and &quot;The Lexington Project&quot; -- the moniker his campaign coined for an energy proposal featuring a combination of conservation efforts, expanded offshore drilling and nuclear power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain rambled quickly through the details and showed little appreciation for the art of &quot;branding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I call it the Lexington Project, my friends, but you can call it anything you want,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several weeks ago senior aide Mark Salter said McCain would stop kicking off town hall meetings with news &quot;ripped from the day's headlines&quot; and would instead deliver a formal introduction on a single theme. That effort lasted just a few weeks: In his opening remarks at Tuesday's town hall, McCain hopscotched from the war to pork-barrel spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign's focus on expanding its war chest sometimes compromises its ability to deliver a coherent message, since McCain's schedule is often dictated by the sites of fundraising events rather than an overarching theme. This week, for example, the presumptive GOP nominee has traveled from central California to San Francisco to Reno to Denver to Kansas City, holding as many fundraisers as public events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assault on Obama's capacity to lead continued Wednesday with the release of McCain's latest commercial, &quot;Celeb,&quot; which compares Obama's ability to attract adoring fans to that of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a news conference with reporters, campaign manager Rick Davis said the ad draws a distinction between Obama's popularity and McCain's appeal, which Davis said stems not from &quot;celebrity&quot; but from &quot;actually having a political movement based on ideas and solutions for the American public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schmidt joined the conference call midway through to hammer the point. &quot;There's no dispute that he's become the biggest celebrity in the world,&quot; Schmidt said of Obama. &quot;The question that we are posing to the American people is this: Is he ready to lead yet?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ad relies mainly on atmospherics, but it also delivers a harsh assessment of Obama's record, declaring that the Democrat &quot;says he'll raise taxes on electricity.&quot; In fact, Obama opposes a &quot;carbon tax,&quot; though he does favor a &quot;cap and trade&quot; plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions, which McCain also supports. The assertion is based on a comment that Obama made to a San Antonio paper in February: &quot;What we ought to tax is dirty energy, like coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign responded to McCain's attacks Wednesday with an ad describing them as &quot;the politics of the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the stump in Missouri, Obama also said: &quot;You know, I don't pay attention to John McCain's ads. Although I do notice that he doesn't seem to have anything to say very positive about himself. He seems to only be talking about me. You need to ask John McCain what he's for, not just what he's against.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But sometimes McCain is not his best spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a town hall meeting Tuesday, a GOP voter posed a question McCain has heard everywhere from Sparks, Nev., to Dayton, Ohio: Why should Republicans support him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think I speak for a lot of conservatives when I say I'm not very excited about this election,&quot; the questioner said, noting that he differs with McCain on issues including &quot;amnesty&quot; for illegal immigrants and the senator's support for &quot;the global warming crowd's agenda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But rather than rattle off his most conservative positions -- his opposition to abortion and support for the war -- he launched into a long explanation of his role in a compromise on judges, something that conservatives often criticize him for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He sparked applause from the Republican audience by mentioning his support for conservative Supreme Court Justices John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr., but he then noted that he had backed liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain finished off what was supposed to be an explanation of why conservatives should back him with a pledge to push for a cleaner planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've stood up against my party many times,&quot; he said, &quot;because I've done what I thought was right.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kate Hudson's relationship with Lance Armstrong is all cycled out, the New York Daily News reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oscar-nominated actress, 29, and the Tour de France champ, 36, were spotted together in May. Despite dating for just a few months, their relationship seemed to move at warp speed. The couple introduced each other to their respective families soon after they began dating, the Daily News notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, while they were often photographed together, they never publicly commented on the nature of their relationship. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former lovebirds finally decided to end things at the three-day Lance Armstrong Livestrong Summit in Columbus, Ohio, during the weekend, an unnamed friend of the couple told US Weekly magazine. Mr. Armstrong's publicist had no comment Wednesday, and Miss Hudson's rep was unavailable, the newspaper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops: Jerry packin' heat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say they confiscated a gun belonging to Jerry Lewis that was found in the 82-year-old entertainer's carry-on bag as he prepared to fly to Detroit from Las Vegas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Las Vegas policeman Bill Cassell said Tuesday that the comic legend was cited Friday for carrying an unloaded concealed weapon at the Las Vegas airport. Mr. Lewis' manager, Claudia Marghilano, says the handgun is a hollowed-out prop gun that he sometimes twirls during his show. She told Associated Press the gun couldn't fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Marghilano says Mr. Lewis didn't know the gun was in the bag along with other props. However, Officer Cassell says if the gun were merely a prop, &quot;it wouldn't be a weapon and we couldn't cite him for carrying a weapon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. O. is best-dressed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Score one for Michelle Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first-lady fashion fight continues as the Democratic White House wannabe got the vote from Vanity Fair magazine, which put her on its global best-dressed list for the second year in a row, the New York Daily News reported Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Obama was praised for her simple, chic style and was called &quot;our commander in sheath.&quot; Left off the coveted roster was Cindy McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. McCain made news while getting a private peek at Oscar de la Renta's fancy fall line. Yet Mrs. Obama, who has her own favorite high-end designers, has made sure to advertise her everywoman frugality every chance she gets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women across the country bought the pitch - and the dress - when Mrs. Obama announced she was wearing a $150 White House Black Market frock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victoria's secret</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A regally large pair of bloomers that belonged to Queen Victoria sold for nine times their estimate at an auction Wednesday in Britain, Agence France-Presse reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dating from the 1890s, the 50-inch-waist knickers, as the Brits call them, sold for $8,914 but had been expected to fetch just $990. The queen's 66-inch-bust chemise sold for $7,924, and her nightdress fetched $10,895 at the sale. The bloomers, which were sold by a British family, were bought by an anonymous Canadian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victoria was on the throne from 1837 to 1901, the longest reign in British history.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britney, Paris and ... Barack?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen John McCain on Wednesday charged that his Democratic presidential opponent, Sen. Barack Obama, is more Cosmo than he is commander in chief, running a stark, harsh and groundbreaking ad that matches him with clips of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do the American people want to elect the world's biggest celebrity or do they want to elect an American hero?&quot; McCain campaign coordinator Steve Schmidt told reporters yesterday in announcing the ad, which he said goes straight to the heart of questions that have been raised about Mr. Obama's campaign in recent weeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad begins with pictures of Mr. Obama's speech in Germany last week, interspersed with pictures of Miss Spears and Miss Hilton, then back to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama receiving the adulation of the 200,000-strong crowd in Berlin. The screen flashes the message &quot;Obama: Is he ready to lead?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign called the ad a debasement of serious politics and a continuation of negative attacks and vowed not to play to Republican charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't pay attention to John McCain's ads, although I do notice he doesn't seem to have anything very positive to say about himself,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;He seems to only be talking about me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said the ad breaks political ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know of an ad that's made this kind of attack in the past about a presidential candidate,&quot; she said, pointing to its use of celebrity status as a way of attacking someone as inexperienced or uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Jamieson said the ad is risky for Mr. McCain because it requires viewers first to associate Mr. Obama's trip with the sort of celebrity culture that Miss Hilton and Miss Spears represent and second to reject his campaign as devoid of substance. But she said the ad is certain to cut through the rest of the pack of political ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has attention value. If you want to break through the clutter, put Britney Spears and Paris Hilton in a political ad,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an ad released Wednesday evening, the Obama campaign accused Mr. McCain of taking &quot;the low road&quot; and distorting Mr. Obama's record while &quot;practicing the politics of the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama had more celebrity-related woes Wednesday, when his campaign disavowed &quot;Politics as Usual,&quot; a new song by rap star Ludacris, which says an Obama presidency is destiny, uses an expletive to describe Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, calls President Bush &quot;mentally handicapped&quot; and says Mr. McCain doesn't belong in &quot;any chair unless he's paralyzed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign spokesman Bill Burton said the song was &quot;not only outrageously offensive&quot; to those whom Ludacris attacked, but &quot;is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear. While Ludacris is a talented individual, he should be ashamed of these lyrics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pointed personal commercials such as the Hilton-Spears comparison usually are sponsored by outside groups. Mr. McCain, though, made these charges himself, and his campaign team continues the hit on the &quot;celebrity&quot; angle in other ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like most celebrities, [Mr. Obama] reacts to fair criticism with a mix of fussiness and hysteria,&quot; a spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has been lampooned in the press for saturation coverage of his recent trip to the Middle East and Europe, and the fawning reactions he has received from audiences both in the U.S. and overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain folks say Mr. Obama brought the scrutiny upon himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not our campaign that's trying to make him into an international celebrity; it's his campaign,&quot; said McCain campaign manager Rick Davis. Asked whether they intended the comparison to the two celebrities, who are usually portrayed as frivolous and draw negative coverage, Mr. Davis said it was &quot;apples to apples.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is the cover story of the current issue of People magazine, and his eight-page spread in the magazine is immediately followed by a story detailing Lindsay Lohan's relationship with her new girlfriend, Samantha Ronson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. McCain has been dragged into the celebrity culture himself. A surprise endorsement from MTV reality show actress Heidi Montag earlier this year morphed into a much-publicized meeting between Miss Montag and Mr. McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, earlier this month.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For four days, Sen. John McCain and his allies have accused Sen. Barack Obama of snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him, despite no evidence that the charge is true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks are part of a newly aggressive McCain operation whose aim is to portray the Democratic presidential candidate as a craven politician more interested in his image than in ailing soldiers, a senior McCain adviser said. They come despite repeated pledges by the Republican  that he will never question his rival's patriotism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The essence of McCain's allegation is that Obama planned to take a media entourage, including television cameras, to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center  in Germany during his week-long foreign trip, and that he canceled the visit when he learned he could not do so. &quot;I know that, according to reports, that he wanted to bring media people and cameras and his campaign staffers,&quot; McCain said Monday night on CNN's &quot;Larry King Live.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has denied that was the reason he called off  the visit. In fact, there is no evidence that he planned to take anyone to the American hospital other than a military adviser, whose status as a campaign staff member sparked last-minute concern among Pentagon officials that the visit would be an improper political event. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Absolutely, unequivocally wrong,&quot; Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said in an e-mail after McCain's comments to Larry King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite serious and repeated queries about the charge over several days, McCain and his allies continued yesterday to question Obama's patriotism by focusing attention on the canceled hospital visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign released a statement from retired Sgt. Maj. Craig Layton, who worked as a commander at the hospital, who said: &quot;If Senator Obama isn't comfortable meeting wounded American troops without his entourage, perhaps he does not have the experience necessary to serve as commander in chief.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's advisers said they do not intend to back down from the charge, believing it an effective way to create a &quot;narrative&quot; about what they say is Obama's indifference toward the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said again yesterday that the Republican's  version of events is correct, and that Obama canceled the visit because he was not allowed to take reporters and cameras into the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is safe to say that, according to press reports, Barack Obama avoided, skipped, canceled the visit because of those reasons,&quot; he said. &quot;We're not making a leap here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked repeatedly for the &quot;reports,&quot; Bounds provided three examples, none of which alleged  that Obama had wanted to  take members of the media to the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign has produced a television commercial that  says that while in Germany, Obama &quot;made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops. Seems the Pentagon wouldn't allow him to bring cameras.&quot; The commercial shows Obama shooting a basketball -- an event that happened earlier in the trip on a stopover in Kuwait, where the Democrat spoke to troops in a gym before grabbing a ball and taking a single shot. The military released the video footage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reconstruction of the circumstances surrounding Obama's decision not to visit Landstuhl, based on firsthand reporting from the trip, shows that his campaign never contemplated taking the media with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first indication reporters got that Obama was planning, or had planned, to visit the  hospital came last Thursday morning, shortly after the entourage arrived in Berlin. On the seats of the media bus were schedules for his stop in Germany and the final entry -- a Friday-morning departure -- indicated that the senator's plane would fly from Berlin to Ramstein Air Base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a reporter asked spokeswoman Linda Douglass that morning about the trip to Ramstein, she said that the trip had been considered but that Obama was not going to go. At that point, the campaign provided no other information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that night, after Obama gave a speech in Berlin, a campaign source spoke about the canceled stop on the condition of anonymity.  The official said that the trip was canceled after the Pentagon informed a campaign official that the visit would be considered a campaign event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overnight, the Obama team  issued two statements, one from senior campaign official Robert Gibbs and the other from retired Air Force Maj. Gen. J. Scott Gration, an Obama foreign policy adviser who was on the trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gibbs's statement said the hospital visit, which had been on the internal schedule for several weeks, was canceled because Obama decided it would be inappropriate to go there as part of a trip paid for by his campaign. Gration said the Pentagon had told the campaign that the visit would be seen as a political trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those two statements, while not inconsistent, did not clarify whether the visit was canceled in reaction to Pentagon concerns or because of worries about appearances. They also opened Obama's camp to charges that it was offering slightly different reasons at different times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gibbs said yesterday that the campaign had planned to inform the traveling media members sometime on the morning of the flight to Ramstein that Obama was intending to visit the hospital but had made no plans to take reporters, including even the small, protective press pool that now accompanies him  most places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporters, he said, probably would have been able to get off the plane but not leave an air base facility close by. &quot;We had made absolutely no arrangements to transport the press to the hospital,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday afternoon, en route from Berlin to Paris, Gibbs briefed reporters traveling with Obama. He noted that the candidate  had visited wounded soldiers several weeks earlier at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in the District and at a combat support hospital while in Iraq earlier in the week -- both times without reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, a reporter asked, &quot;Why not just say it is never inappropriate to visit men and women in service?&quot; -- a key McCain charge -- &quot;What is your response to that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gibbs replied: &quot;It is entirely likely that someone would have attacked us for having gone. And it is entirely likely -- and it has come about -- that people have attacked us for not going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday in London, Obama addressed the controversy during a news conference. He said Pentagon concerns about Gration's status triggered the decision not to visit Landstuhl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We got notice that [Gration] would be treated as a campaign person, and it would therefore be perceived as political because he had endorsed my candidacy but he wasn't on the Senate staff,&quot; Obama said. &quot;That triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political, and the last thing that I want to do is have injured soldiers and the staff at these wonderful institutions having to sort through whether this is political or not, or get caught in the crossfire between campaigns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's explanation, which came after more than a day of controversy, was the clearest in noting that it was Pentagon concerns about Gration accompanying him to the hospital that forced Obama to reconsider and, ultimately, cancel the visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gibbs was asked yesterday  about the continuing allegations from McCain that the real reason was a desire to bring a media entourage to the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's completely untrue, and I think, honestly, they know it's untrue,&quot; Gibbs said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his most direct challenge yet of his Democratic presidential rival's Iraq policy, Sen. John McCain suggested yesterday that Sen. Barack Obama had crafted a war strategy designed to further his own political advancement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also intimated that Obama skipped a visit of wounded U.S. troops in Germany last week because it would not generate sufficient publicity for his campaign, a charge that the Republican made the centerpiece of a new television ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's call for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq, McCain said, &quot;was political&quot; and was made &quot;in order to help him get the nomination of his party.&quot; In a different interview, McCain said that &quot;Senator Obama just views this war as another political issue with which he can change positions.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's comments came days after he said in New Hampshire, &quot;It seems to me that Obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign.&quot; They appear to reflect the campaign's belief that it can make inroads with voters by keeping the focus on foreign policy issues after Obama's return from a week-long trip to Afghanistan, Iraq, the Middle East and Western Europe. The moves puzzled some GOP strategists, who said McCain would be better off touting a more positive message, and the senator from Arizona drew a strong rebuke from a longtime ally, Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.), who traveled with Obama last week to Afghanistan and Iraq as part of a congressional delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think John is treading on some very thin ground here when he impugns motives and when we start to get into 'You're less patriotic than me. I'm more patriotic,' &quot; Hagel said on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation.&quot; &quot;I admire and respect John McCain very much. . . . John's better than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said that McCain is  not living up to the standards he set out at the outset of the general-election campaign, when he repeatedly called for a &quot;civil&quot; and &quot;respectful&quot; debate. &quot;John McCain is an honorable man running an increasingly dishonorable campaign,&quot; Vietor said. &quot;I think a lot of people are wondering what happened to the civil campaign John McCain said he was going to run.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, a supporter of the war in Iraq who later criticized the way it was waged and supported sending more troops there, said he based his own approach to the war on principle, while Obama developed a strategy aimed at appealing to voters. &quot;I say that it was very clear that a decision had to be made, and I made it when it wasn't popular. He made a decision which was popular with his base. And that is a fundamental difference,&quot; McCain said in a taped interview on ABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He took his argument a step further on CNN, saying that Obama's support for a withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq within 16 months would squander the efforts of Americans who died fighting the war there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not prepared to see the sacrifice of so many brave young Americans lost because Senator Obama just views this war as another political issue with which he can change positions,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's new ad questions why Obama decided to exercise during a stopover in Germany late last week rather than visit wounded soldiers. In the ad, a narrator says that Obama &quot;made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops.&quot; The ad continues: &quot;Seems the Pentagon wouldn't allow him to bring cameras. John McCain is always there for our troops. McCain -- country first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and his aides -- who provided different explanations for the event in recent days -- said they had been trying to arrange a private visit to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center but canceled it upon learning that the military regarded one of Obama's military advisers as a campaign staffer. Obama said the distinction &quot;triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political&quot; and therefore the campaign called off the visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hagel said the ad is  not &quot;appropriate,&quot; adding that if Obama had gone ahead with the visit he would have laid himself open to another line of criticism. &quot;It would be totally inappropriate for him on a campaign trip to go to a military hospital and use those soldiers as props,&quot; Hagel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign has continued to press the point, however, circulating ahead of ABC's broadcast a partial transcript of its interview. In it, the presumptive GOP nominee remarked: &quot;I think people make a judgment by what we do and what we don't do. He certainly found time to do other things. . . . If I had been told by the Pentagon that I couldn't visit those troops, and I was there and wanted to be there, I guarantee you, there would have been a seismic event.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One GOP strategist with close ties to McCain's campaign said the new line of attack reflected the operation's &quot;schizophrenic&quot; nature. He said that tendency was also on display last week, as McCain spoke at length about media coverage of Obama rather than sticking with his plan to focus on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They couldn't help themselves,&quot; the strategist said, adding that the ad over the hospital visit is &quot;churlish and unlike McCain, and hardly will resonate with the swing voters who are going to decide this election.&quot; The strategist continued: &quot;They're doing it because the candidate, and the campaign, is not happy with where they are and they're lashing out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If McCain hopes to win the election, the strategist added, &quot;he needs to be a happy warrior.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">806 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain said his Democratic presidential opponent, Sen. Barack Obama, has played politics with the Iraq war, choosing his positions in order to win a political campaign rather than do what is needed to win the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 100 days to go before the Nov. 4 election, and after Mr. Obama's weeklong trip to the Middle East and Europe, Mr. McCain sharpened his tone in an attempt to puncture a hole in Mr. Obama's message that he is a different type of politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Obama doesn't understand. He doesn't understand what's at stake here and he chose to take a political path that would have helped him get the nomination of his party,&quot; the Arizona Republican said in an interview taped Saturday and broadcast Sunday on ABC's &quot;This Week.&quot; &quot;I took a path that I knew was unpopular because I knew we had to win in Iraq.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fresh off his trip, Mr. Obama defended his stance to an audience of minority journalists in Chicago, telling them he stands by his opposition to the surge of forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't know what would have happened had we followed my plan to begin a phased withdrawal to put pressure on the Maliki government to start negotiating more effectively with some of these other parties,&quot; the Illinois Democrat said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On NBC's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; Mr. Obama said the troop surge in Iraq has worked but he still doesn't think it was the right decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our military is stretched extraordinarily because of trying to fight two wars at the same time, and so my job, as the next commander in chief, is going to be to make a decision what is the right war to fight and how do we fight it. And I think that we should have been focused on Afghanistan from the start,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns are taking stock of the political playing field. With the Beijing Olympics likely to absorb most attention in the middle of August, the window is narrowing to make much news before the national party conventions. Mr. Obama will accept his party's presidential nomination in Denver at the end of August, and Mr. McCain is to become the Republican nominee in St. Paul, Minn., in early September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters in Europe on Saturday, Mr. Obama said polls might show his support dropping because he was out of the country for a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the recent focus on international issues, he said, the economy remains the top election issue. He told the Associated Press on Sunday that he will work on another economic stimulus package to have ready if he takes office in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his ABC interview, Mr. McCain suggested that Mr. Obama balked at a visit with wounded U.S. troops in Germany because he couldn't bring the press with him to capture the event. The McCain campaign makes a similar implication in an advertisement that was put on the Internet and began running Saturday night in Colorado, Pennsylvania and the District.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has defended his decision not to visit the wounded troops, saying he didn't want to turn it into a campaign event, that he often visits troops at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and that he made similar visits in Iraq and Afghanistan last week. He also said the Pentagon discouraged the visit in Germany, although Pentagon officials rejected that charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The important thing is that, if I had been told by the Pentagon that I couldn't visit those troops, and I was there and wanted to be there, I guarantee you, there would have been a seismic event,&quot; Mr. McCain told ABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a Republican who accompanied Mr. Obama on his overseas trip before the visit to Germany, called the McCain&nbsp;ad inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Certainly he would have been criticized by the McCain people and the press and probably should have been if on a political trip in Europe paid for by political funds - not the taxpayers - to go, essentially, then and be accused of using our wounded men and women as props for his campaign,&quot; Mr. Hagel told CBS' &quot;Face the Nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Mr. Hagel said he would consider joining the Obama ticket if offered the vice-presidential nomination, although he said Sunday he didn't expect such an invitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On ABC, Mr. McCain defended a remark in a recent interview in which he appeared to embrace a timetable for withdrawing U.S. forces from Iraq. He first said he &quot;didn't use the word timetable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When his quote was read back to him, he changed his explanation: &quot;Oh, well, look. Anything is a good timetable that is dictated by conditions on the ground. Anything is good,&quot; he said. &quot;But the timetable is dictated, not by an artificial date, but by the conditions on the ground, the conditions of security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has criticized Mr. Obama for demanding such a timetable. Mr. Obama, in an interview with Newsweek published Saturday, said the way he will determine what forces are left in Iraq will be &quot;entirely conditions-based.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama's summer saturation ad campaign in key battleground states has not increased the Illinois Democrat's poll numbers, according to senior strategists for Sen. John McCain's campaign and recent independent polling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the race has further tightened in some of the pivotal states that are among the Obama campaign's biggest ad buys - states that both candidates need to reach the winning number of 270 electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign, flush with cash, is spending record amounts of money on big media buys in states like Virginia, Georgia, Florida, Colorado and Michigan, but the latest polls show that, if anything, the polling in these states has either changed little or the Arizona Republican has narrowed the gap in them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain strategists told The Washington Times that they have been closely monitoring the large amounts of cash that Mr. Obama is spending on TV ads in these and a dozen other competitive states to see whether they were moving the Illinois senator's numbers in the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far we're not seeing any evidence that they have had any measurable impact,&quot; said a top McCain campaign official on the condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign officials say their own polls show that for all his spending, &quot;Obama's numbers haven't budged a bit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, a Quinnipiac University poll of likely voters in four of these states, taken July 14 to 22, showed Mr. McCain has picked up support &quot;in almost every group in every state, especially among independent voters and men,&quot; the polling group reported last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Colorado, a usually Republican Western state that has turned into a tossup, Mr. McCain now leads his opponent by 45 percent to 44 percent, compared with a 49 percent to 44 percent Obama lead last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats are targeting a half-dozen traditionally Republican states in the West, including New Mexico, Nevada and Colorado, with the latter one of their chief targets because it has been trending Democratic in recent elections. The Obama campaign has been saturating the state with ads in the past month, but apparently with little to show for it, they told the Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Michigan, a Democrat-leaning industrial state whose 17 electoral votes are pivotal to Mr. Obama's electoral strategy, his six-percentage-point lead (48 percent to 42 percent) in Quinnipiac's June poll has shrunk, though by a statistically insignificant amount, to a four-point lead (46 percent to 42 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's polling numbers there have surprised Republican strategists because the state is in a deep recession with an 8.5 percent unemployment rate, and general Republican fortunes there are in the basement. It had been considered a solid state for Democrats - the last Republican nominee to carry it was George H.W. Bush in 1988 - but most election analysts now place it securely in the tossup column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Minnesota, another Midwest battleground that Democrats usually carry, the race has turned into a dead heat in the Quinnipiac poll, with Mr. Obama clinging to a two-percentage-point lead (46 percent to 44 percent), compared to a seemingly prohibitive 17-point lead in the same survey in June (54 percent to 37 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other polls in the state are all over the map, though, with Rasmussen's July poll giving Mr. Obama a 13-point lead and Survey USA's June poll having the race statistically tied - Mr. Obama holding an insignificant one-point lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Wisconsin, while Mr. Obama maintains a comfortable 11-point lead in the Quinnipiac survey, that's still down a little from the 13-point lead he had in the same survey in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama's post-primary bubble hasn't burst, but it is leaking a bit,&quot; said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been a good month for John McCain. His movement in these key states, not large except for Minnesota, jibes with the tightening we are seeing in the national polls,&quot; Mr. Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A national Fox News poll last week showed the race in a statistical tie, with Mr. Obama holding the slimmest of leads: 41 percent to 40 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps no battleground state has received more attention from the Obama campaign than Virginia, a state where Democrats hold the governorship and are poised to pick up a second U.S. Senate seat in November. For weeks, the state's TV markets have been saturated with Obama campaign ads on a daily basis, but the race remains in a statistical dead heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Real Clear Politics Web site, which monitors all the major election polls, showed the presidential race statistically tied in every poll taken in Virginia since the beginning of June, with neither man having a lead of more than two percentage points in any survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the race stood last week, the electoral count analysis by the Cook Political Report had Mr. McCain leading Mr. Obama by 240 electoral votes to 219, with 79 electoral votes in the tossup column.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON, July 26</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By almost every measure, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's overseas tour that concluded here Saturday was a clear success, with meticulously planned and deftly executed events designed to beam back images to the United States of a politician comfortable on the world stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What isn't measurable is whether it worked. Will a week of one-on-one meetings with foreign officials, cheering crowds, favorable and voluminous media coverage on both sides of the Atlantic and plain good fortune on the debate over getting out of Iraq overcome the doubts he faces at home about his readiness to be president? And if it doesn't, what will?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Obama moved from Iraq and Afghanistan to Jordan and Israel and then to three European capitals before flying back to Chicago on Saturday night, strategists back home measured the political fallout for the senator from Illinois and for the presumptive Republican nominee John McCain on an almost hourly basis. Their consensus was that the week turned into a near-rout for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Weaver, who once was McCain's top political strategist, said his old boss made a big mistake by virtually daring Obama to go to Iraq and Afghanistan, only to see Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki generally embrace the Democrat's plan for withdrawing combat forces when he went there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain lost the week badly, let's be honest,&quot; Weaver said in a message on Friday. &quot;John [McCain] is still in striking distance, thanks to his own character, biography and memories of the McCain of previous election cycles. But he cannot afford another week like this one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alex Castellanos, another Republican strategist, agreed that Obama had acquitted himself well overseas. &quot; 'Barack goes global' is working,&quot; he noted. But he sounded a cautionary note, nonetheless. Obama, unlike McCain, he said, remains a work in progress who is still trying to answer the question, &quot;Who is this guy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think voters see this difference between the two men,&quot; he said in a message. &quot;John McCain is complete. Barack Obama is completing himself. The question is, will he finish that job by November?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama himself foresees no quick payoff from his foreign trip. Aboard his campaign charter, as he prepared to leave Paris for London on Friday afternoon, he talked about what he had seen and how he thought it might play at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure there's any short-term [political gain], and I know that seems strange since obviously we put a lot of work into it,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think that we'll see a bump in the polls. I think we might even lose some points. People back home are worried about gas prices; they're worried about jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's assessment is that the payoff from one of the most ambitious foreign trips ever undertaken by a presumptive nominee could come much later. &quot;The value to me of this trip is, hopefully, it gives voters a sense that I can in fact -- and do -- operate effectively on the international stage,&quot; he said. &quot;That may not be decisive for the average voter right now, given our economic troubles, but it's knowledge they can store in the back of their minds for when they go into the polling place later.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the mismatch between the Obama and McCain campaigns over the past week, the other question for Obama is why the race for president remains as relatively close as it does. Obama said he believes that is because voters still have enough questions to keep them from committing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the pace he kept up all week, Obama was thoroughly familiar with the results of a new NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll, which showed him leading McCain 47 percent to 41 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The point is, with change comes some risk, and I combine two things,&quot; he said. One is a shift in policies, the other a biography he said will take people time to process. &quot;They're going to keep their powder dry and get as much information as they can the next three months,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain advisers complained through much of the week about what they labeled &quot;a premature victory lap,&quot; and McCain made a joke of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At his closing news conference in London, Obama pushed back against suggestions that there was something inappropriate about his week abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is hard for me to understand Senator McCain's argument,&quot; he said. &quot;He was telling me I was supposed to take this trip. . . . John McCain has visited every one of these countries, post-primary, that I have. He has given speeches in Canada, in Colombia, Mexico, he made visits. And so it doesn't strike me that we have done anything different than the McCain campaign has done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difference, of course, was the scale and ambition of Obama's tour. He flew in a chartered plane with the words &quot;Change We Can Believe In&quot; on the fuselage and with a sizable press corps. He traveled with a retinue of senior foreign policy advisers, who were veterans of the Clinton administration, as well as his top political advisers. McCain had nothing in comparison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a sheer logistical challenge, what Obama attempted was unprecedented, a presidential-style trip without the resources and clout of the White House. But the result was a series of meetings with foreign leaders who seemed to go out of their way to court their guest, as well as stunning visual images, from a news conference on a hillside in Jordan, with the ruins of the Temple of Hercules in one direction and the city of Amman as a backdrop, to the sea of humanity -- estimated at 200,000 -- that turned out in Berlin on Thursday night for Obama's only major public event of the trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy highlight was Iraq and Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's embrace of a timetable for withdrawal akin to Obama's 16-month plan. The visual highlight was Berlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The speech in Berlin and that stirring picture of the crowd lined up a mile long will be the enduring image or memory of this trip,&quot; Democratic strategist Dan Gerstein said. &quot;That said, 'America is back' -- or more accurately, 'America will be back' -- in world esteem more than any nifty turn of phrase Obama and his excellent speechwriters could have ever come up with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Republican strategist Alex Vogel called the Obama strategy &quot;the hope of audacity&quot; and said it may not work. &quot;Taking a page from the Clinton campaign's inevitability strategy, the Obama folks are hoping that voters will substitute symbolism for experience,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message Obama hoped to send was that, after eight years of President Bush and rising anti-American sentiment in many countries, the United States could have a president the rest of the world admires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I thought was useful was to give the American people some sense of how I was approaching these issues, but also to give them a sense that the world can be responsive to this approach and that it will make a difference,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[French President Nicolas] Sarkozy is much more likely to be able to provide more troop support in Afghanistan if his voters are favorably disposed towards us,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a Democrat who supported another candidate during the nomination battle had a more skeptical assessment of all the imagery. He argued that the Obama team is mistaken in believing that meetings with foreign leaders will help overcome a relatively thin r&Atilde;&copy;sum&Atilde;&copy; in foreign affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not whether he has experience or is presidential; it's whether voters can relate to him, given his unusual background and his often seeming arrogance. Talking to Germans and having Sarkozy embrace you make this problem worse, not better. If I were the RNC [Republican National Committee], I'd use the German-language Obama flier in an ad to make him appear more foreign, more distant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trip went smoothly save for one flap with the Pentagon over a planned visit by Obama to the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. Pentagon officials raised concerns about campaign aspects of the visit, and Obama's team scrubbed it, then tried to explain what they had been told that forced them to back away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking for an opening, McCain accused Obama in a new ad of &quot;going to the gym&quot; while in Germany instead of visiting the wounded  troops, and of doing so because the hospitals would not let television cameras film the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said in an interview to be aired Sunday morning on ABC's &quot;This Week&quot; program that &quot;if I had been told by the Pentagon that I couldn't visit those troops, and I was there and wanted to be there, I guarantee you, there would have been a seismic event,&quot; according to the Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Substantively, the trip left questions for Obama. He struggled to square his opposition to the troop buildup in Iraq with the successes he witnessed and talked about. Obama initially said the buildup might even increase violence. Now that it has helped produce the opposite, McCain, rather than Obama, can claim he had superior judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His willingness to pledge to make the Middle East one of his administration's top priorities leaves open how he can fulfill that promise, given the urgency he would face as president to deal with the economy and with all the potential complications of drawing down U.S. forces in Iraq and augmenting them in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went to countries to offer reassurances, but as he noted Saturday morning at his news conference, in answer to a question about British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's political troubles, the realities of governing are different. &quot;I will tell you that you are always more popular before you are actually in charge of things,&quot; he said. &quot;And then, you know, once you are responsible, then you are going to make some people unhappy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign assailed his Democratic rival Saturday for scrapping a stop at a U.S. military hospital in Germany during his nine-day foreign tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain himself criticized Sen. Barack Obama for canceling the planned trip to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, and his campaign quickly released an advertisement placing the reversal as the Democratic candidate's latest snub of the U.S. military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama team has said it canceled the visit after being told by the U.S. military that it was too political, an explanation Mr. McCain scoffed at in an interview with ABC News set to air Sunday on &quot;This Week.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had been told by the Pentagon that I couldn't visit those troops, and I was there and wanted to be there, I guarantee you, there would have been a seismic event,&quot; he told ABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor denounced the McCain team's actions as the work of &quot;an honorable man who is running an increasingly dishonorable campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Saturday, Mr. Obama spoke for the first time about his canceled trip, which was to have taken in Ramstein Air Base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama told reporters here that while he wasn't sure of every detail, it was not intended as a slight and said he began having second thoughts about the trip after he learned he could not bring along a campaign adviser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were treating it in the same way we treat a visit to Walter Reed, which I was able to do a few weeks ago without any fanfare whatsoever. I was going to be accompanied by one of my advisers, a former military officer, and we got notice that he would be treated as a campaign person, and it would, therefore, be perceived as political because he had endorsed my candidacy, but he wasn't on the Senate staff,&quot; Mr. Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than trigger &quot;a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political,&quot; Mr. Obama said he phoned some of the troops instead. He spent some of his time in Germany working out at a gym.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. McCain pointed out that Mr. Obama still could have visited Landstuhl and implied that the Illinois senator really just wanted to be photographed with wounded troops rather than be with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know of no Pentagon regulation that would have prevented him from going there - without the media and the press and all of the associated people. Nothing that I know of would have kept him from visiting those wounded troops,&quot; Mr. McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted his own visits to Landstuhl and said, &quot;I think people make a judgment by what we do and what we don't do. He certainly found time to do other things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Vietor called the criticism &quot;disingenuous,&quot; saying &quot;Senator McCain knows full well that Senator Obama strongly supports and honors our troops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama &quot;has visited wounded soldiers at Walter Reed numerous times,&quot; Mr. Vietor said. &quot;This politicization of our soldiers is exactly what Senator Obama sought to avoid, and it's not worthy of Senator McCain or the 'civil' campaign he claimed he would run.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign also distributed a statement by Sen. Jack Reed, in which the Rhode Island Democrat, who was with Mr. Obama for troop visits last week in Iraq and Afghanistan, said the Democratic candidate had then &quot;expressed his gratitude for their service without press or fanfare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his London press conference, Mr. Obama said he canceled the Landstuhl visit because he didn't want to put the military in the position of having to judge whether his visit met the Pentagon's rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last thing that I want to do is have injured soldiers and the staff at these wonderful institutions having to sort through whether this is political or not,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans weren't buying any of it, and party operatives and McCain aides fanned the flames Saturday by e-mailing reporters multiple times about the issue, even before the candidate's ABC interview was released and before the new &quot;Troops&quot; ad hit the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad criticizes Mr. Obama for not visiting Iraq for years and for voting against war-funding bills, before noting the Landstuhl cancellation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And now, he made time to go to the gym, but canceled a visit with wounded troops. Seems the Pentagon wouldn't allow him to bring cameras,&quot; the narrator says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain team did not provide details about their ad buy beyond saying it would &quot;run in key states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican National Committee operatives also pounced on what they called Mr. Obama's &quot;ever-evolving&quot; reasons for the cancellation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama team had said Friday that the Pentagon discouraged the candidate from coming, a charge the military immediately denied. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said Mr. Obama is &quot;certainly welcome to visit a military medical facility any time he wants to,&quot; as long as he followed the protocols for an incumbent senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A military official told NBC on Friday that the campaign was told Mr. Obama &quot;could only bring two or three of his Senate staff members, no campaign officials or workers.&quot; In addition, &quot;Obama could not bring any media. Only military photographers would be permitted to record Obama's visit.&quot; But the official said that on those terms, which are routinely applied to all lawmakers' visits to U.S. military hospitals worldwide, &quot;he was more than welcome. We were all ready for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flap plays into a common theme of Republican criticism of Mr. Obama's trip overseas; namely, that it showed him to be someone who feels more at home with Europeans than with American troops stationed abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement distributed by the McCain campaign Saturday, retired Lt. Col. Joe Repya said that &quot;visits with world leaders and speeches to cheering Europeans shouldn't be a substitute for comforting injured American heroes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama made a promise to visit the hospitals, but &quot;broke that commitment, instead flitting from one European capital to the next,&quot; he said. &quot;For a young man so apt at playing president, Barack Obama badly misjudged the important demands of the office he seeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans also criticized Mr. Obama for calling himself a &quot;citizen of the world&quot; in his speech in Berlin and said his prediction he would win the election and be working with the foreign leaders in the future was presumptuous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excited Europeans at every stop didn't help the matter as some even started referring to the candidate as &quot;President Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Axelrod could not have scripted a better week for his candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama was pressured by his Republican rival to visit two war zones, and he traveled to eight countries amid fears he would make some crippling foreign-policy gaffe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, European leaders fawned over the Democratic presidential candidate, who was greeted by excited fans everywhere and attracted record crowds in Berlin. He got an added boost from key Iraqi officials and even his opponent as they embraced a timetable for troop withdrawal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were few errors or dust-ups over the nine-day trip as Sen. John McCain and Republican operatives back home hammered Mr. Obama for seeming to take a &quot;premature victory lap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is hard for me to understand Senator McCain's argument. He was telling me I was supposed to take this trip,&quot; Mr. Obama told reporters during a press conference Saturday in front of 10 Downing Street after a meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrat said &quot;we had it planned&quot; before his rival made the trip suggestion, and noted that Mr. McCain, since wrapping up his party nomination in February, has visited &quot;every one of these countries ... that I have,&quot; and also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has given speeches in Canada, Colombia and Mexico</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It doesn't strike me that we have done anything different than the McCain campaign has done, which is to recognize that part of the job of the next president, commander in chief is to forge effective relationships with our allies,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator complained in his weekly radio address about all the press attention Mr. Obama received - a week of multiple network-anchor interviews that ends with his taped &quot;Meet the Press&quot; appearance Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week, the presidential contest was a long-distance affair, with my opponent touring various continents and arriving yesterday in Paris,&quot; Mr. McCain said, rattling off the places where he campaigned in the meantime: Maine, upstate New York, New Hampshire, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Colorado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With all the breathless coverage from abroad, and with Senator Obama now addressing his speeches to 'the people of the world,' I'm starting to feel a little left out. Maybe you are, too,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the McCain radio address criticized Mr. Obama for being in France, Mr. McCain suggested at the same time that the French could be a model of energy independence for the United States to emulate and implicitly slammed Mr. Obama for his unease with expanding U.S. use of nuclear power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wonder if he noticed while he was in France that they draw 80 percent of their electricity from nuclear energy,&quot; he said. &quot;Nations from Europe to Asia are expanding their use of this clean, proven and stable source of energy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Saturday morning press availability and meetings were Mr. Obama's last duties before heading back across the Atlantic after a trip filled with flattering footage that Mr. Axelrod, a chief Obama adviser, would not rule out using in some campaign commercials before the Nov. 4 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British tabloids and TV stations mocked his visit - and the hundreds of thousands who attended the Berlin speech Thursday evening - as suffering from &quot;Obamania,&quot; but that didn't stop them from joining in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can we get a wave?&quot; photographers shouted at the senator from Illinois as they clicked their shutters hundreds of times for the perfect shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A German tabloid reporter wrote an exclamation-point laden story about how her heart pounded when Mr. Obama happened to be pumping iron in her hotel gym in Berlin - something McCain operatives mocked in their daily update e-mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama - who retains a slim national lead over Mr. McCain while some battleground states are tightening - said he would not be surprised if more than a week away from the United States might spark &quot;a little bit of a dip&quot; in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not sure that there is going to be some immediate political impact&quot; to the trip, he said. &quot;People are worried about gas prices and home foreclosures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said the trip was important to ensure the U.S. has strong partners abroad and &quot;to highlight or amplify how the international situation affects our economy back home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also hopefully to give people at home, but also leaders abroad, some sense of where an Obama administration might take our foreign policy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before leaving London on Saturday, Mr. Obama held private meetings with former Prime Minister Tony Blair and with David Cameron, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, who aims to fill Mr. Brown's shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Cameron told reporters Mr. Obama could win an election in Britain: &quot;Oh, I think he would probably beat me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pool reporters present for the beginning of the private meeting to take photos heard a telling exchange between the two men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You need to be able to keep your head together,&quot; Mr. Cameron said, asking if the candidate would get any rest soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama responded he'd be taking a week of vacation next month and said a former Clinton official recommended that if elected, &quot;the most important thing you need to do is to have big chunks of time during the day when all you're doing is thinking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you don't do that, &quot;you start making mistakes, or you lose the big picture,&quot; Mr. Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Cameron agreed, &quot;That is exactly what politics is all about. The judgment you bring to make decisions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's exactly right. And the truth is that we've got a bunch of smart people, I think, who know 10 times more than we do about the specifics of the topic, and so if what you're trying to do is micromanage and solve everything, then you end up being a dilettante, but you have to have enough knowledge to make good judgments about the choices that are presented to you,&quot; Mr. Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no time for quiet moments over the past week, as Mr. Obama and a cadre of advisers and a plane full of press hopped around countries and got little sleep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He began the trip with a private congressional delegation to Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan, and then held meetings with leaders in Jordan, Israel, Germany, France and Britain. At each he discussed global challenges such as international business markets, terrorism, loose nuclear weapons and climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also talked about the delicate situation in Israel, meeting with officials from both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This was the riskiest portion of his trip, and he seemed to navigate the waters with success and without causing any controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Berlin, Chancellor Angela Merkel said the Democrat's speech there was a &quot;positive signal&quot; for Europe and also joked she &quot;wouldn't resist&quot; a back rub from the Democrat should he win the election, a nod to one she received from President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He won warm reviews abroad for a speech to more than 200,000 people at Berlin's Victory Column, where he called for renewed international partnership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Internet-organized group aggressively questioned the intentions of the Berlin crowd, since two live bands offered entertainment before the speech, but the Obama team had not advertised any music, and the crowd remained after the music concluded to hear him speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French President Nicolas Sarkozy demonstrated overt affection for the Democratic candidate and said he was popular in his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the week's best development for the Obama campaign came from Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who told a German magazine just before the candidate's Iraq visit that he liked the 16-month withdrawal timetable proposed by the Democrat. His office later tried to pull back from the comments, saying the translation was wrong, but newspapers obtained the audiotape and confirmed his statement was clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other foreign leaders have been expressing support for a timeline, and the White House and Iraqi leaders recently agreed on a more general &quot;time horizon&quot; for bringing troops home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats gleefully sent reporters a Friday CNN transcript where Mr. McCain - while outlining the importance of conditions on the ground - said &quot;I think it's a pretty good timetable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He caught himself and used the administration's term of &quot;horizons&quot; for withdrawal, rather than a &quot;timetable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This success is ... incredibly impressive, but very fragile,&quot; he said &quot;If we reverse this, by setting a date for withdrawal, all of the hard-won victory can be reversed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said Saturday that he was &quot;pleased&quot; to see support from Mr. McCain and Iraqi officials for a timetable, and said it is &quot;a good thing&quot; Mr. McCain agrees with him that more troops are needed in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The point I have made throughout the course of this trip is that a lot of these foreign-policy issues have been seen through a prism of politics and ideology for too long,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;Part of the reason I think you are seeing some convergence is that reality is asserting itself. And you can't argue with facts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, meanwhile, pushed his line that Mr. Obama has flip-flopped from opposing the surge of troops to Iraq to now saying it helped reduce violence there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressed by a British reporter to weigh in with advice for Mr. Brown's political troubles, Mr. Obama demurred and offered a glimpse of his amusement of the constant ups and downs in the campaign cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will tell you that you're always more popular before you're actually in charge of things. And then, you know, once you're responsible, then you are going to make some people unhappy, and that's just the nature of politics,&quot; he said with a wide grin. &quot;Even during the course of this campaign, there have been months where I am a genius, and there are months where I am an idiot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BERLIN </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama presented himself Thursday to Europeans as a &quot;citizen&quot; of both the U.S. and the world and spoke repeatedly of the things that &quot;we&quot; must do on terrorism, the environment and other global issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His speech in front of the historic Victory Column in Tiergarten was filled with references to politics, from acknowledging American shortcomings to urging Germany to recommit to NATO success in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I speak to you not as a candidate for president, but as ... a proud citizen of the United States and a fellow citizen of the world,&quot; the presumptive Democratic nominee told at least 200,000 people gathered not far from where the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berlin Wall once divided the city Mr. Obama declared the importance of trans-Atlantic partnership in a setting that portrayed him as an American superstar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the 20th century taught us that we share a common destiny, the 21st has revealed a world more intertwined than at any time in human history,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thousands there - many waving American flags - cheered his call for people worldwide to &quot;tear down&quot; new walls dividing countries, religions and races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just like crowds at his American rallies, these fans erupted in chants of &quot;Obama, Obama,&quot; and &quot;Yes, we can.&quot; One person led the crowd in a chorus of the &quot;Obamagirl&quot; song, getting dozens to sing along that &quot;I've got a crush on Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was to be his only public event during a weeklong tour of the Middle East and Europe that has taken him to the war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan and to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials estimated that the crowd was one of the largest in Berlin's history; the range was from 200,000 from the campaign to as many as a half-million from the German Embassy in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign carefully crafted the event, which was helped by perfect weather, and said the footage might be seen in a political ad. Obama fans distributed a photo of the massive crowd next to a photo of a remarkably similar crowd at the 1963 March on Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama told his own story and about his Kenyan father's arrival on American shores because of the nation's ideals &quot;that speak to aspirations shared by all people: that we can live free from fear and free from want; that we can speak our minds and assemble with whomever we choose and worship as we please.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know my country has not perfected itself,&quot; he said. &quot;We've made our share of mistakes, and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions. ... I know that for more than two centuries, we have strived, at great cost and great sacrifice, to form a more perfect union; to seek, with other nations, a more hopeful world&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign of Mr. Obama's Republican rival, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, responded with a tersely worded e-mail to reporters deriding the Democrat's visit to Germany and calling it a &quot;premature victory lap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, &quot;John McCain continued to make his case to the American citizens who will decide this election,&quot; spokesman Tucker Bounds said, mocking Mr. Obama's proclamation to be a citizen of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama offered eloquent praise for this country, but the contrast is clear. John McCain has dedicated his life to serving, improving and protecting America. Barack Obama spent an afternoon talking about it,&quot; Mr. Bounds said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain stumped for votes at a German restaurant in Columbus, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd love to give a speech in Germany, but I'd much prefer to do it as president of the United States rather than as a candidate for president,&quot; Mr. McCain told reporters after a meal of bratwurst with local business leaders at Schmidt's Sausage Haus und Restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Thursday that Mr. Obama's trip and his remarks abroad will have no impact on the Bush administration's foreign policy during its final months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody knows that we are in a presidential campaign, so this a part of America's democratic process,&quot; she told reporters during a trip to Singapore and Australia. President Bush &quot;has said, and we continue to act on the basis, as do our foreign partners, that this government remains in power until January 2009.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Thursday, Mr. Obama met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, opposition leader Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and the mayor of Berlin in meetings closed to the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama senior strategist Robert Gibbs said the senator had a &quot;warm and productive conversation&quot; with Mrs. Merkel, a talk that ranged in topic from Afghanistan to climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech later, he made no new policy announcements, offering only broad plans for securing loose nuclear weapons and saying both the United States and Germany &quot;have a stake in seeing that NATO's first mission beyond Europe's borders [in Afghanistan] is a success.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, &quot;America cannot do this alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reception from the Berlin crowd was as rapturous as the campaign could have hoped. During the speech, one fan held a sign reading, &quot;Barack for Kanzler,&quot; the German word for &quot;chancellor,&quot; and dozens of Europeans in the crowd said they cannot wait to see Mr. Bush leave office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 700 Berlin police officers reportedly were assigned to the event, which also needed a larger-than-usual force of Secret Service agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A German man was ejected for holding an umbrella adorned with signs reading &quot;McCain,&quot; telling people, &quot;I am pro-America,&quot; before being removed by security officials. In another security breach, some Obama supporters overwhelmed the police after one person created a distraction by leaping over a barrier. As officers ran after him, about 50 fans rushed closer to the stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama lauded Berlin for standing strong for freedom and for its rich history and said it's a place that proves &quot;there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one,&quot; a line that inspired the speech's title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He worked to illustrate the global nature of problems anywhere, saying that the Sept. 11 terror attacks against the United States were plotted in several places and killed people &quot;from all over the globe on American soil&quot; and that carbon emissions from cars in Boston and Beijing are melting the Arctic ice cap, shrinking coastlines and creating droughts all over the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though Mr. Obama voted for a border wall between the United States and Mexico, he said there is a danger in allowing new walls &quot;to divide us from one another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The walls between old allies on either side of the Atlantic cannot stand. The walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand,&quot; he said. &quot;The walls between races and tribes; natives and immigrants; Christians and Muslims and Jews cannot stand. These now are the walls we must tear down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like he does in American campaign speeches, Mr. Obama said change in the form of &quot;true partnership&quot; and &quot;true progress&quot; will take both hard work and sacrifice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They require allies who will listen to each other, learn from each other and, most of all, trust each other,&quot; he said. &quot;That is why America cannot turn inward ... Europe cannot turn inward&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He received raucous applause for saying the future meant &quot;finally bringing this war to a close&quot; in Iraq, but the loudest cheers erupted when he talked about climate change and railed against genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For hours before Mr. Obama arrived, attendees listened to live reggae, drank beer and munched on bratwurst and steak sandwiches. Many in the crowd sported black and white Obama T-shirts with the slogan, &quot;I want you to stop climate change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said the crowd was among the biggest ever assembled to hear a speaker in Berlin and certainly the biggest since a half-million Germans assembled to hear President Kennedy give his &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot; speech in 1963. The &quot;tear down this wall&quot; speech from President Reagan in 1987 attracted 40,000, one German newspaper estimated. About 350,000 people attended a 1948 speech by Berlin Mayor Ernst Reuter, whom Mr. Obama quoted Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business student Timothy Cooper of Berlin waved an American flag and wore Obama badges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm for Obama because he grew up with difficult circumstances but still made it to the top, and if he is able to do it, he can inspire us to achieve the same,&quot; he said. &quot;He has a very international background, which gives him the ability to unite people and understand a lot of views that McCain cannot.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The national presidential conventions are coming so late that the vice presidential choices may not be known in time to comply with Virginia law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Acting on a request from the Republican National Committee, the State Board of Elections took steps yesterday to rectify this. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Current law says the chairmen of the state's two major political parties must file a certification of the people expected to be nominated for president and vice president at the two national conventions 74 days before the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That would be Aug. 22. The Democratic National Convention in Denver is Aug. 25-Aug. 28, while the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis is Sept. 1-4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While political observers expect Barack Obama and John McCain to name their running mates before Aug. 22, there is no guarantee they will do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The State Board of Elections approved a rules change yesterday that would allow the state party chairmen to state that the vice presidential candidate was &quot;unknown&quot; as of Aug. 22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> James Alcorn, an election specialist with the State Board, explained that the first notice from the state party chairmen was more of &quot;a heads-up&quot; anyway. The second notice must be given by Sept. 5, 60 days before the Nov. 4 election. The vice presidential candidates will have been nominated by then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nancy Rodrigues, secretary of the election board, criticized both parties yesterday for scheduling the conventions so late - a month after the nominating conventions four years ago. The first day of the Republican convention in St. Paul, Minn., will be on Labor Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said ballots will have to be printed for 134 Virginia localities, with about 1,000 different arrangements. In addition to the presidential race, there are contests for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives as well as local elections, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Absentee ballots must be on hand 45 days before the election, she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Democratic National Convention will be in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political commentator Larry Sabato said the Democrats scheduled the late August convention to push the Republicans into Labor Day. By tradition, the party of the president goes last.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama touts that &quot;he grew up without a father&quot; and was &quot;raised by his mother with the support of his grandparents&quot; in his first Spanish-language radio ad of the general election campaign, released Wednesday and designed to portray him as sharing the same experiences as Hispanic voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What this ad shows is Barack Obama not only has stood with us, whether it's immigration reform or veterans, but he is one of us,&quot; said Rep. Xavier Becerra, California Democrat, who spearheaded House efforts on immigration this year. &quot;His values are our values; his experience is our experience.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The radio ad, for which the Obama team provided an English translation, is the latest entrant in what may be the hottest political advertising war right now - the battle between Mr. Obama and his Republican opponent John McCain for Hispanic voters' support in November's presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Obama's first foray was biographical, Mr. McCain has run Spanish-language radio and TV ads highlighting his military service, his time as a prisoner of war and his commitment to work beyond party labels. Another ad featuring Frank Gamboa, his Naval Academy roommate, accuses Mr. Obama of only recently discovering the importance of the Hispanic vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Rogers, a McCain campaign spokesman, said the Republican is making a personal appeal to Hispanic voters, having attended three major Hispanic leadership gatherings over the last month, and said his ads reflect that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain appeals to Hispanics by talking to the issues they care about, and those issues span from low-tax, small-government policies that drive our small businesses and entrepreneurs, that are the lifeblood of our economy,&quot; he said. &quot;Those small business owners, a lot of them are Hispanics. They care about a whole wide range of issues from values issues, on life, on protecting marriage ... to free trade, which is important to small-business owners and a lot of the states in which Hispanics are disproportionately reflected, like Florida&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Becerra, meanwhile, said Mr. Obama's biographical approach is likely to score well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator McCain's&nbsp;ad speaks to Latinos. I think Senator Obama's&nbsp;ad is part of us, and it speaks with us, because he talks about from birth to the present, how Barack's experiences have been our experiences,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far the two campaigns have targeted the same four states with their Spanish-language ads: New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada and Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's become almost axiomatic among campaign consultants that if Democrat Al Gore had put more effort into Hispanic vote outreach in Florida in the 2000 presidential race, he would have won the presidency. Many Democrats also blame 2004 nominee Sen. John Kerry for repeating some of Mr. Gore's mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this year, both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama have shown they are willing to spend to woo Spanish-speaking voters, said Adam J. Segal, director of Johns Hopkins University's Hispanic Voter Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the ads, it's primarily about biography and introducing the candidates to the largest possible Hispanic audience using the dominant themes of having been senators, and McCain having a strong representation of having been in the military and as a POW, and Obama as a community organizer and activist, having a successful career and then transitioning into public service,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the key question is whether Mr. McCain will use Spanish-language ads to go negative on Mr. Obama, as President Bush did against Mr. Kerry in the 2004 election on issues such as abortion and gay marriage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Song of Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Drudge Report ran a juicy item about the fact that only one reporter showed up to cover Republican John McCain at a campaign stop in New Hampshire the other day,&quot; Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lonely print reporter from the Manchester Union Leader stood on the tarmac, waiting for McCain's plane to land. McCain, obviously upset at being dissed by yet another meager media throng, didn't stop to chat,&quot; Mr. Kass said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; 'Did you ever notice that when John McCain is on TV he's always grumpy?' asked a colleague in the cafeteria who whispered, lest others denounce him for Barackian Thought Crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; 'McCain's always made to look old and angry, a curmudgeon. And Barack Obama? He's always seen as presidential, cool, smiling, shaking hands,' whispered the guy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe this phenomenon is called liberal bias. And the country has caught on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since I mentioned it a few days ago, newspapers, Web sites, radio and TV news have been full of stories about media bias and outraged denials, recrimination and guilt. Always the guilt. Obama's people know we're guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guilt is what McCain is playing on, too, trying to shame journalists with a new video with dueling soundtracks about the Media Love that Dares Speak Barack, featuring MSNBC host Chris Matthews shrieking that when he hears Obama talk, a tingle runs down his leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Predictably, McCain blew it by selecting lame songs for his video. He should have used 'Barry Angel' sung to the old dusty 'Johnny Angel' or my personal favorite, 'Oh-Bama' sung to the 1958 hit, 'Oh, Donna,' back in the Route 66 days when McCain was young and not so old.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two elections</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you want to start worrying about the presidential election this year, you can look at the comparison between 1996 and 2008,&quot; the New Republic's John B. Judis writes in a blog at www.tnr.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is a similar candidate to Bob Dole - a war hero, running on his experience, but also somewhat past his political prime. The Democrats had the advantage of incumbency in 1996, but of course Bill Clinton had been rebuked by voters in 1994. In July 1996, Democrats only enjoyed a 5.1 percent advantage in generic congressional polls. Yet in late July, Clinton was ahead of Dole in one Harris poll by 22 percent and in a Gallup poll by 17 percent. Although Dole would close the gap during the convention and the last weeks of the campaign - when the Clinton campaign scandals broke - the election was all but over,&quot; Mr. Judis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 2008, McCain is running about as inept a campaign as Dole. And Democrats enjoy an average lead of 11.6 percent in generic Congress polls. In addition, the Republican administration is wildly unpopular; the economy is in a tailspin; and the Iraqi president has endorsed Barack Obama's withdrawal plan. Yet Obama is only running an average of 4.5 percent ahead of McCain in the polls ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By all odds, a Democratic nominee should be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">running 10-15 percent ahead at this time My explanation is the same tired one. Obama remains the 'mysterious stranger' rather than the 'American Adam' to too many voters who are put off rather than attracted by his race and exotic background.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a vise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Former Vice President Al Gore recently took his climate-change show on the road for the benefit of liberal bloggers, Sunday morning TV aficionados and other innocent bystanders,&quot; the Wall Street Journal's Collin Levy writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This week he laid out his demand for a miraculous transformation in U.S. energy use over a mere 10 years. As for drilling for more oil? 'Absurd,' the Nobel Laureate scoffed. 'When you're in a hole, stop digging.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The same might be said for Mr. Gore. For while his message hasn't changed, the political realities of the energy debate have. Suddenly, Mr. Gore's inconvenient speechifying only tightens the vise Democrats find themselves in over drilling,&quot; the writer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters' pocketbooks are now involved, making them more skeptical about climate change - and about the utility of any policies aimed at influencing climate change. The environmental movement is facing a critical moment. Democrats who support the greenies in their most ambitious goals, and scariest pseudo-scientific rhetoric, suddenly seem woefully out of touch with American voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two attacks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain attacked Barack Obama both at home and abroad this week. One attack was smart. One wasn't,&quot; John Dickerson writes at www.slate.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Iraq, McCain pressed Obama over his opposition to the troop surge - the strategy that has reduced violence in Iraq and led to modest political gains for the al-Maliki government. This was smart. The topic is on McCain's issue turf, potentially puts his opponent at odds with the American generals who executed the surge, and makes Obama look like a hidebound pol who won't absorb new facts that contradict his predetermined conclusions,&quot; Mr. Dickerson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain's dumb attack came in a television ad that blamed Barack Obama for high oil prices. You might have thought the cause of the oil-price hike was war, SUVs, OPEC, speculation, and global demand for oil. Nope - it's Obama. By this standard, he should also answer for the Starbucks closings and the dent in my Honda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear old Dad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the battle between John McCain and Barack Obama for Hispanic votes heats up, it raises the question of what relates better, an immigrant father or an absentee father? For Obama, the answer is an absentee father,&quot; reporter Stephen Dinan writes in a blog at www.washingtontimes.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wednesday morning Obama's campaign e-mailed reporters the script for his first Spanish-language radio ad of the general election, designed to portray him as sharing the same experiences as many Latino voters, and it included these lines:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; 'His father was an immigrant. His mother from a humble, middle class family. Through student loans and hard work, he graduated from college. Obama never pulled people down as he made his way up ...'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But about an hour later the campaign sent out what it said was the final script, which changed those lines to read:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; 'He grew up without a father - raised by his mother with the support of his grandparents. Through student loans and hard work, he graduated from college. Obama never forgot his roots ... '</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On a conference call with reporters, the Obama campaign said the first version was a draft.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is only a candidate, but don't tell that to the Germans, some of whom have leapfrogged that whole election thing and already are calling him &quot;President Obama&quot; in advance of his visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For that matter, his own campaign could use a reminder. For the second time in as many days, reporters traveling with Mr. Obama on his overseas trip corrected campaign staffers for saying White House practices also govern his campaign in dealing with the press, or in delivering speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the King of Jordan gave the senator from Illinois special treatment - personally driving the presumed Democratic nominee to the airport in his Mercedes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meantime, Mr. Obama has met with top U.S. military commanders and engaged in negotiations with foreign leaders, prompting strong criticism from a former White House adviser who accused him of crossing the line by talking about his conversations with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a long tradition in this country that we only have one president at a time. He's the commander in chief and the negotiator in chief. I cannot remember a campaign in which a rival seeking the presidency has been in a position negotiating a war that's under way with another party outside the country,&quot; David Gergen, who has served four presidents in both parties during his career, said on CNN Monday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The freshman senator has run into similar self-perception troubles before for a faux presidential seal on his speaking podium and for considering an address at Berlin's iconic Brandenburg Gate, where President Kennedy delivered his &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot; speech during the Cold War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German Chancellor Angela Merkel opposed Mr. Obama's site selection, calling it &quot;inappropriate&quot; for politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Mr. Obama will speak Thursday at Berlin's Victory Column, a far less lofty site commemorating Austria's defeat in the Austro-Prussian War, in an event that is expected to draw thousands and provide footage for the campaign's TV ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was all too much for Republicans, who stepped up the pace of their regular &quot;Audacity Watch&quot; e-mail blast to reporters. In the past few days, the Republican National Committee has balked at the ad team's coverage of the speech and become riled when Mr. Obama presented himself as qualified not only to win the presidential race Nov. 4 but also re-election in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On CBS' &quot;Face the Nation,&quot; Mr. Obama said the objective of his trip was &quot;to have substantive discussions with people like [Afghan] President Karzai or [Iraqi] Prime Minister Maliki or [French] President Sarkozy or others who I expect to be dealing with over the next eight to 10 years.&quot; That comment, and another in which he said he &quot;never&quot; has doubts, became fodder for another &quot;Audacity Watch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RNC also has targeted his quips about dismantling the White House bowling alley in favor of a basketball court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Days after securing the nomination and losing nine of the last 14 primaries, and 151 days before the general election, Barack Obama is speaking as if he has been elected and re-elected,&quot; RNC spokesman Danny Diaz said last month after Mr. Obama suggested he would be ending his second term during the 2016 Summer Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's Republican rival, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, says even the press is fawning over the Democrat as if he has been elected, releasing a harsh new ad Tuesday using favorable quotes reporters have given as evidence they are in &quot;love&quot; with Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Hampshire Union Leader reported Tuesday that just one reporter met the Republican at the airport when he landed for a campaign event, but Mr. Obama travels with a press corps that takes up two buses. More reporters travel with Mr. Obama than with the sitting president, and so many scribes wanted a ticket across the Atlantic with the Democratic candidate that the campaign had to turn down about 150 requests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain&nbsp;ad infuriated some reporters, who said their words were twisted. It was released as a record 1,300 press credential requests flooded the Chicago headquarters for Thursday's Obama speech in Berlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Berlin hotel staffer told a reporter Tuesday she was &quot;very excited&quot; that &quot;President Obama&quot; would be speaking just down the street, and mentioned her parents' emotions of love for the United States when Mr. Kennedy spoke there in the 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the site of the upcoming speech, a security officer explained that he and others had blocked off traffic &quot;because the president from America is coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The role of president and presidential candidate was further blurred Tuesday when a senior campaign official on the trip, who spoke to reporters on background, denied that Mr. Obama's address in Berlin had any political overtones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not going to be a political speech. When the president of the United States goes and gives a speech, it is not a political speech or a political rally,&quot; the senior adviser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he is not a president of the United States,&quot; a reporter told the adviser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is going to talk about the issues as an individual ... not as a candidate, but as an individual, as a senator,&quot; Mr Obama's aide replied. The adviser insisted that the Berlin speech &quot;is not for campaign purposes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, after the briefing, campaign media adviser David Axelrod said in a statement that the aide's description of the Berlin rally was inaccurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The answer is that, of course, any event outside of a [congressional delegation trip] is a campaign event. But it is not a political rally. He will not engage his American political opponents. It is a speech to our allies and the people of Europe,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, Politico reported that an Obama staffer and former Clinton White House official told reporters that he never, in his four years in the White House, had gone on the record for a briefing. Politico reported that several reporters retorted that they weren't in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee was having a field day with these stories Tuesday, sending out press releases with the headline, &quot;Senior Obama foreign policy adviser: Obama is president of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mr. Obama's upcoming speech in Berlin &quot;is not political, why shoot footage for campaign ads?&quot; the RNC said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign's efforts to elevate the candidate, who has served 3 1/2 years in the U.S. Senate, has come under increasing criticism from pundits who say his fame does not live up to his accomplishments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Americans are beginning to notice Obama's elevated opinion of himself. There's nothing new about narcissism in politics. Every senator looks in the mirror and sees a president,&quot; Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nonetheless, has there ever been a presidential nominee with a wider gap between his estimation of himself and the sum total of his lifetime achievements?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, Los Angeles Times reporter Peter Nicholas wrote a story saying, &quot;He's not president yet, but Barack Obama has already given some thought to White House decor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked at a town hall meeting in Fargo, N.D., whether he had any decorating plans for the Lincoln Bedroom, he recalled a visit to the White House soon after he came to the Senate and seeing &quot;this flat-screen TV in there. That didn't seem to be appropriate. So I might take out the TV, I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did we enter a time warp and somehow miss the general election? Or are the numbers so overwhelmingly in Sen. Barack Obama's favor that he might be thinking that he was in the time warp and already won the presidency of the United States? Time warps belong in science fiction and, of course neither is true. Nevertheless, what we are witnessing in the Democratic presidential candidate's astonishing tour of the Middle East and Europe is an unprecedented foreign victory lap that, at the very least, violates the spirit of the U.S. Constitution. The country really can have only one president at a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having stopped in Afghanistan and Iraq over the weekend, where he met with President Hamid Karzai and Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, Mr. Obama issued policy pronouncements. He promised the Afghans more U.S. troops, and he seemed to have agreed with the Iraqi prime minister about a 16-month timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, paving the way for said redeployment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain correctly pointed out that Mr. Obama's presence in Iraq has a certain paradox: &quot;It is based on conditions on the ground and that we have to maintain the progress we have. The major point here is that Senator Obama could not have gone to Iraq as he did because he opposed the surge. It was the surge that succeeded. It was the surge that is winning this war. He opposed it. He said it would not succeed.&quot; But never mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said in an interview that the purpose of his trip was to get acquainted with foreign leaders that he fully expected to deal with in the next 8-10 years. So, Mr. Obama believes he has not just won the November election, but the 2012 election and possibly been appointed secretary of state in the Hillary Clinton administration following his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course in Europe, no one will mind very much if Mr. Obama was elected king by the Americans and threw the entire Constitution out the window. The level of adulation exceeds even that which attended the candidacy of Sen. John Kerry. A recent British poll suggested that 53 percent of Europeans favor Mr. Obama for president while only 11 percent would like to see Mr. McCain in the White House. With stops in Germany, France and Britain, he will be soaking up the adulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Europe, Mr. Obama is not just viewed as the potential first black American president, but also as the anti-George Bush, the man who will slay the U.S. president that Europeans have despised most in human memory and whose policies they expect Mr. Obama will reverse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, no European country has ever allowed an ethnic minority to hold a position so powerful, and is hardly likely to do so in the foreseeable future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, Mr. Bush will have to leave the White House because of the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, put in place after Franklin Roosevelt's four terms, which limits American president's to two terms. But it is not likely anyone in Europe knows or even cares. Now, some Europeans have caught on to the multifaceted policy approach of the Democratic candidate, and therefore encountered disillusionment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Germany, the government registered disapproval at the Obama campaign's plans to tape a campaign commercial in front of the Brandenburg Gate, and as the CSIS trans-Atlantic media blog recently reported, the senator's changing positions on the Second Amendment and the death penalty have given some European editorial writers cause to suspect that he is just another American opportunist on the road to the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More typical, though, is the overwhelming popular adulation for a Democratic candidate, about whom Europeans know little (this could be said of many Americans as well). Few know that Mr. Obama was the head of the Senate Subcommittee on Europe for two years without ever holding a hearing on Europe, or know that he is asking Europeans to contribute more forces to Afghanistan; or that his positions on trade are likely to cause severe disruptions in the World Trade Organization negotiations, which will affecting relations between the United States and Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, as in the 2000 election, most Europeans will conclude that the Democratic candidate has already won and be grievously disappointed and indignant if Mr. McCain wins in November. One gets a sense depressing sense of deja vu all over again.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presidential rivals John McCain and Barack Obama are clashing over Iraq in a duel for the veterans' vote in defense-rich Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At news conferences across the state, both campaigns yesterday announced endorsements from retired military officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Virginia Veterans for McCain is led by Paul Galanti of Richmond, a Navy aviator held prisoner in North Vietnam with McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thomas Beres of Leesburg, an Air Force pilot who fought in the first Iraq war, is the head of Virginia Veterans for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Virginia Beach, retired Navy Adm. Hank Griffin, a McCain backer, said Obama &quot;would weaken our security and put peace further out of reach&quot; in Iraq and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Retired Army Brig. Gen. David McGinnis of Williamsburg, an Obama ally, said in Arlington County that McCain would keep U.S. forces in Iraq indefinitely. &quot;His plan is George Bush's plan,&quot; said McGinnis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exchange is another sign that Virginia, which usually tips Republican in presidential years, may be in play in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state is home to major defense installations, including the Pentagon and the Norfolk Naval Base, and has among the highest concentrations of military veterans in the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About 800,000 veterans live in Virginia. Veterans account for 18 percent to 27 percent of the populations of six Virginia cities with 100,000 or more residents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Obama campaign also attacked McCain for a new television commercial - pegged to Obama's trip to Afghanistan and Iraq - that says the Democrat, who opposed the war, is changing his positions &quot;to help himself to become president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The candidates also clashed over gas prices. With a recent poll showing that 73 percent of Americans favor offshore drilling, McCain started a new television ad blaming Obama for rising prices at the pump. The commercial is running in 11 battleground states but in Virginia is aimed at the Democratic-leaning suburbs of Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Republican candidates across the country are blaming Democratic opposition to drilling for the higher fuel prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The GOP U.S. Senate nominee in Virginia, former Gov. Jim Gilmore, spent most of an hourlong debate Saturday trying to link his Democratic foe, former Gov. Mark R. Warner, to higher prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The McCain&nbsp;commercial asks, &quot;Who can you thank for rising prices at the pump?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A crowd in the background chants, &quot;Obama, Obama, Obama!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama opposes drilling offshore and in an Alaska wildlife refuge. McCain is against drilling in Alaska but supports state-approved coastal exploration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some analysts say that even if drilling is allowed, it will be five to 10 years before oil can be produced. Gilmore said Saturday that easing restrictions on drilling will drive down prices pushed up by energy speculation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama this month ran a commercial calling McCain &quot;part of the problem&quot; of high gas prices.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ad: (Narrator) Gas prices -- $4, $5, no end in sight, because some in Washington are still saying no to drilling in America. No to independence from foreign oil. Who can you thank for rising prices at the pump? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Chant) Obama!&nbsp;Obama!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Narrator) One man knows we must now drill more in America and rescue our family budgets. Don't hope for more energy, vote for it. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: John McCain may try in this ad to blame rising gas prices on Barack Obama, but after 7 1/2  years of the Bush administration, that's a stretch. McCain himself said last week that America's &quot;dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been 30 years in the making&quot;; Obama has been in Washington for less than four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a bit audacious for McCain to charge that &quot;some in Washington&quot; still oppose offshore oil drilling, since that was his position, most notably in his 2000 presidential campaign, until he reversed himself last month and called for a lifting of the 27-year federal ban on such energy exploration. (He still opposes drilling in Alaskan wildlife refuges.) Nor is there any evidence that Obama opposes &quot;independence from foreign oil,&quot; although his energy plan is very different. The senator from Illinois has called McCain's plan for a temporary gas-tax holiday a gimmick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drilling off the coasts would increase U.S. oil production but would have no short-term impact on gas prices. While some analysts disagree, an Energy Department report last year said production would not start until 2017 and have no &quot;significant&quot; effect on prices or supplies until 2030.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By picturing Obama next to a gas pump, using audio of his supporters chanting, and invoking the Democrat's signature word &quot;hope,&quot; McCain is trying to present himself as a hardheaded realist who would boost production. That argument may have some appeal at a time of public frustration with energy prices, but less so in such states as Florida and California, which would bear the environmental impact of renewed drilling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">T. Boone Pickens has played a lot of odd roles over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was the geologist who made most of his early money by snapping up the stock of big, undervalued oil and gas companies, a practice known as &quot;drilling on Wall Street.&quot; The wealthy corporate raider who said he was defending the rights of ordinary shareholders. And, recently, the influential TV commentator on oil prices who places enormous and mostly lucrative bets on where those prices are going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps the strangest role the 80-year-old, Oklahoma-born Pickens has fashioned for himself is his current one: the billionaire speculator as energy wise man, an oil-and-gas magnate as champion of wind power, and a lifetime Republican who has become a fellow traveler among environmentally minded Democrats -- even though he helped finance the &quot;Swift boat&quot; ads that savaged the campaign of the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, Sen. John F. Kerry (Mass.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), a vociferous critic of speculators, who he says are inflating the price of oil, last week called Pickens &quot;my political friend.&quot; The Sierra Club's executive director recently flew in Pickens's private plane. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) invited him to speak to the Democratic caucus tonight. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pickens has lubricated his latest transformation with a $58 million ad campaign to rally support for building enough wind turbines to provide 20 percent of America's energy. He says that would free up enough natural gas to replace most of the oil imports that Pickens says will otherwise &quot;break&quot; the U.S. economy, while endangering national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like I'm in the Niagara River in a boat and I don't have a motor and I don't have an oar and I'm getting pretty close to the falls,&quot; Pickens said yesterday during a visit to The Washington Post. &quot;I'm drifting, drifting, drifting, and it's gone on for 40 years as far as energy is concerned. . . . We're dead in the water if we don't do anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pickens said he launched his campaign, known as &quot;the Pickens plan,&quot; because &quot;this is the last chance for me. I'm 80, and I have the money to do this.&quot; He said: &quot;It's not anything for Boone Pickens to make money. I got plenty of money.&quot; Besides, he said, his estate will go to charity. Instead, he said, he wants to &quot;elevate the debate&quot; because the presidential candidates &quot;do not have much of an energy plan for the short term, and the short term has to be addressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ads, Pickens says: &quot;I've been an oilman my whole life, but this is one emergency we can't drill our way out of. And I have a plan. In the coming weeks, I'm going to share the details of that plan to use American technology and alternative energy to slash our dependency and break foreign oil's stranglehold on us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This isn't the ad campaign some GOP operatives wanted Pickens to underwrite. Republicans were counting on him to play a central role in the presidential campaign, hoping he would pour millions of dollars into  ads attacking Democratic candidate Sen. Barack Obama (Ill.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, as Pickens recalled, he was sitting in a Dallas conference room in May with other wealthy Republicans discussing plans for financing an ad campaign to support Arizona Sen. John McCain's bid for president, when it hit him -- ending the nation's dependence on foreign oil was more important than who reaches the White House in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that he is running a different kind of ad campaign, he has received some kind words from Democrats. &quot;He's making us think different about an energy policy that's been stuck in neutral for seven years,&quot; said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rahm Emanuel (Ill.), who is introducing a bill with tax credits for natural gas fuel pumps and cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need good ideas, like those offered by T. Boone Pickens and others,&quot; Reid said at a meeting last week. &quot;As most know, T. Boone Pickens is an oilman and a staunch conservative. But T. Boone Pickens realizes the enormity of our energy crisis. That is a pretty good model for the kind of bipartisanship it will take to solve this problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; Al Gore drew some distinctions between his plan and Pickens's vision for U.S. energy but added: &quot;I don't see him as a competitor on this. There are really a lot of common features in what he's saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, by contrast, made a slightly sulky reference to the oil magnate while talking about the importance of renewable energy during a town-hall meeting last week in Warren, Mich. &quot;I'm glad Mr. Pickens is spending some of his money to advertise and have his face on television here,&quot; McCain said. &quot;Good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pickens wouldn't be Pickens if he didn't have some money at stake. He has plans for a $10 billion, 4,000-megawatt wind farm that would be the world's biggest. He has contracted to buy $2 billion in wind turbines from General Electric. Acquaintances disagree about whether it's a case of Pickens putting his money where his mouth is or putting his mouth where his money is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he will go ahead with or without government help, but the government could certainly help. If Congress extends the production tax credit for wind, that would be worth hundreds of millions or more to his project over a period of years. Pickens also said he is planning to buy right of way for a 250-mile power line to carry half of the wind farm's power to the Texas electricity grid. There, it would meet a new line financed by Texas. He would still need an interstate line to carry the rest of the wind farm's power to other markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Pickens has long advocated natural gas vehicles. He invested in a company that went public as Clean Energy, a firm that provides the fuel for natural-gas-fired vehicle fleets. There are only 142,000 natural-gas-fueled vehicles in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Pickens insisted, &quot;I'm not here trying to get anything for myself.&quot; He runs a hedge fund, BP Capital, that has made far more money than anything he did as an oil executive. It manages $7 billion in assets, about half or more of which is his own. He has already given away $700 million, he said, including $165 million to his alma mater, Oklahoma State University and $50 million to each of two Texas medical centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, he said, this is about the nation's interest. &quot;If $7 trillion go out of this country in 10 years, you can quit talking about health care,&quot; he said. &quot;You're going to be broke.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as a new poll showed most voters think the news media is biased in favor of Democrat Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the New York Times spurred criticism by refusing to publish an op-ed article on the Iraq war by Republican rival Sen. John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times said Mr. McCain's piece was not up to snuff, unlike one it ran July 14 by Mr. Obama of Illinois that presented a 16-month pullout timetable for Iraq, and the newspaper suggested how it should be rewritten. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama piece worked for me because it offered new information (it appeared before his speech),&quot; David Shipley, editor of the Times' Op- Ed page, said in an e-mail to the McCain campaign. &quot;While Senator Obama discussed Senator McCain, he also went into detail about his own plans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds said Mr. McCain shouldn't be punished for being consistent with his positions, and the Republican Party said the critique smacked of censorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flap erupted as a new Rasmussen Reports survey showed nearly 60 percent of voters say Mr. Obama gets better treatment from journalists. Nearly half of voters - 49 percent - said reporters would help Mr. Obama, compared with 14 percent who said Mr. McCain benefited from friendly coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rasmussen survey suggested the perceived trend is intensifying, with those seeing a pro-Obama slant jumping 5 percentage points from last month while views regarding Mr. McCain stayed the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Shipley in the e-mail, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Times, said the newspaper would be eager to publish an essay by Mr. McCain that &quot;mirrored&quot; Mr. Obama's piece and articulated in concrete terms how Mr. McCain defines victory in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would also have to lay out a clear plan for achieving victory - with troops levels, timetables and measures for compelling the Iraqis to cooperate. And it would need to describe the senator's Afghanistan strategy, spelling out how it meshes with his Iraq plan,&quot; Mr. Shipley wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican National Committee spokeswoman Amber Wilkerson said Mr. McCain's strategy for victory in Iraq is not based on New York Times' requests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unlike Barack Obama, Senator McCain will continue to advocate a winning strategy war based on conditions on the ground, not an arbitrary timetable for withdrawal,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times did not respond to requests to further explain the rejection of Mr. McCain's piece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper weathered criticism in September 2007 for running a full-page ad disparaging Army Gen. David H. Petraeus' testimony about progress in Iraq and charging the liberal group MoveOn.org a reduced price for the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other research supports an Obama obsession in the news media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tyndall Report, which monitors the content of network newscasts, found that Mr. Obama warranted 114 minutes of coverage in the past six weeks. Mr. McCain had 48 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Project for Excellence in Journalism offered similar findings. Of 342 print and broadcast stories on the presidential campaign last week, Mr. Obama was &quot;a significant presence&quot; in 77 percent of them, compared with 48 percent that had more emphasis on Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, high-profile anchors are lined up for exclusives whenever Mr. Obama disembarks from his new campaign jet. Katie Couric of CBS News will interview the White House hopeful Tuesday in Jordan, and it will be ABC's Charles Gibson's turn in Israel on Wednesday. On Thursday, NBC's Brian Williams will chat up Mr. Obama in Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's Obama's magical media tour,&quot; said Brent Baker, an analyst with the conservative Media Research Center, who also noted that networks billed Mr. Obama's overseas visit as &quot;captivating&quot; and &quot;history-making,&quot; among other things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The press does not have a sterling reputation. The Rasmussen survey found that 71 percent of the respondents said reporters &quot;try to help the candidate they want to win,&quot; while 16 percent offered &quot;unbiased&quot; coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forty-five percent said reporters would &quot;hide information&quot; that could hurt the candidate they favored; 30 percent said the press would not hide the information, and a quarter were not sure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such impressions come with a price, though. Asked who they trusted for campaign news, 29 percent said &quot;news reporters,&quot; while 43 percent said &quot;family and friends.&quot; More than a quarter were not sure whom they trusted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey of 1,000 likely voters was conducted July 19 and has a margin of error of three percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans also seem cynical about the upcoming political conventions as well. Half of the respondents in a Washington Times-Fox 5-Rasmussen Reports survey said the gatherings were a &quot;waste of time and money,&quot; while 36 percent said they presented &quot;an opportunity for voters to get to know the candidates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among Republicans, 58 percent said the conventions were a waste, compared with 38 percent of Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey of 1,000 adults was conducted July 15-18, also with a margin of error of three percentage points.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush's single largest request for funds and &quot;most important initiative&quot; in the fiscal 2009 intelligence budget is for the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, a little publicized but massive program whose details &quot;remain vague and thus open to question,&quot; according to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A highly classified, multiyear, multibillion-dollar project, CNCI -- or &quot;Cyber Initiative&quot; -- is designed to develop a plan to secure government computer systems against foreign and domestic intruders and prepare for future threats. Any initial plan can later be expanded to cover sensitive civilian systems to protect financial, commercial and other vital infrastructure data. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is no longer sufficient for the U.S. Government to discover cyber intrusions in its networks, clean up the damage, and take legal or political steps to deter further intrusions,&quot; Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell noted in a February 2008 threat assessment. &quot;We must take proactive measures to detect and prevent intrusions from whatever source, as they happen, and before they can do significant damage.&quot; His conclusions echoed those of a 2007 interagency review that led to CNCI's creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During debate on the intelligence authorization bill last week, Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.), a member of the House intelligence committee and chairman of the Homeland Security subcommittee on emerging threats, described cybersecurity as &quot;a real and growing threat that the federal government has been slow in addressing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without specifying funding figures, which are classified, Langevin said the panel approved 90 percent of the funds requested for CNCI but warned that the committee &quot;does not intend to write the administration a blank check.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee's report recognized that as the initiative develops, &quot;it will be imperative that the government also take into account the interests and concerns of private citizens, the U.S. information technology industry, and other elements of the private sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a public-private partnership will be &quot;unlike any model that currently exists,&quot; said the committee, which recommended a White House study leading toward establishment of an oversight panel of lawmakers, executive branch officials and private-sector representatives. The panel would review the intelligence community's development of the initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee said it expects the policy debates over the initiative to extend into the next administration, and major presidential candidates have addressed the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same day the intelligence bill passed the House, Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) told an audience that, &quot;as president, I'll make cybersecurity the top priority that it should be in the 21st century.&quot; He  vowed to appoint a national cyber adviser to coordinate policy to secure information -- &quot;from the networks that power the federal government, to the networks that you use in your personal lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a July 1 speech, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) addressed cybersecurity, as well. &quot;To protect our energy supply, air and rail transport, banking and financial services, we need to invest far more in the federal task of cyber security,&quot; he said. Neither Obama nor McCain mentioned the cybersecurity initiative underway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National security and intelligence reporter Walter Pincus pores over the speeches, reports, transcripts and other documents that flood Washington and every week uncovers the fine print that rarely makes headlines -- but should. If you have any items that fit the bill, please send them to fineprint@washpost.com</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gasoline prices are flattening consumer wallets and hobbling our economy, while the Democrats sit back and play politics with the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter surveys show the economy and gas prices top the list of the most critical issues facing our country. A Washington Post/ABC News poll reported last week that 85 percent of voters polled said gas prices will be either extremely or very important to their vote in this year's elections. And with good reason: Americans are getting walloped with huge gas bills, while utilities, buckling under ever-higher energy prices, are raising electricity rates to historic levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other industries are getting hit, too. Airlines are cutting back on flights and services as higher fuel costs eat into declining revenues. Increased trucking costs are driving up the price of nearly everything that's shipped. Tighter budgets mean consumers are cutting back on discretionary spending. Retail sales barely budged last month, even despite government tax rebates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the answer to rising oil prices is to boost domestic production. President Bush has been pressing that solution almost weekly, but to no avail among Democrats on Capitol Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Bush and the Republicans have kept up a steady drumbeat for sharply increased oil production, the Democratic majority has sat on its hands, refusing to deal with the crisis. The reason: Barack Obama and the Democrats in Congress are dead set against offshore drilling. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid are more than happy to let Mr. Bush and the Republicans suffer the political consequences. &quot;They're running out the clock until November, to the detriment of all of us and our economy, because they think it will help them at the ballot box,&quot; said a Republican leadership official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Mr. Bush lifted the executive ban on drilling for oil on the Outer Continental Shelf imposed by his father. The next step must be to end the ban by statute, but Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Reid apparently have no intention of acting on any energy bill, no matter how critical the situation becomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response in Democratic cloakrooms seems to be &quot;let Bush and Republicans turn slowly, slowly in the wind&quot; - an apt turn of phrase that fits into the Democrats' rigid energy orthodoxy, which supports biofuel, solar and wind, spurns oil production at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama and Pelosi Democrats are captives of their global-warming special interests, who are dead-set against drilling. Mr. Obama never mentions oil except when he attacks Mr. Bush and the Republicans as captives of the oil lobby. He is all solar panels, witchgrass and windmills. The specious argument against drilling asserts that it would have no effect on the supply or price of oil for years. Well, we may not see the full result of cancer research for many years, but that didn't mean we should have given up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last decade, Republicans sent President Clinton a bill to drill for more domestic oil to make us less dependent on foreign product. We would be producing a lot more oil, and prices would be lower if it had become law, but Mr. Clinton vetoed it, and that's why we are in the mess we're in now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, it's another left-wing lie that passing a drilling bill now would have no effect on today's oil prices. Just the act of declaring a pro-production oil and gas policy would &quot;send a message to the market and result in lower prices for oil and gas,&quot; John McCain is telling voters on the stump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International oil traders bet on what the world's supplies will be in the future because supply determines price. Increasing oil exploration and production will drive future prices down. We saw an example of that this last week when crude oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell sharply by about $11 a barrel in two days after the Energy Department reported that commercial petroleum stocks rose the previous week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans instinctively understand this common-sense axiom of supply and demand economics. That's why polls show more than 70 percent of us support drilling for oil in wilderness areas and beneath our oceans. But our patience is coming to an end with the Obama Democrats, who say no to more oil drilling, no to more refineries and no to nuclear power. Last week, the Gallup Poll said the Democratic Congress' approval rating has sunk to 14 percent. It has dropped below 20 percent only six times in the last 34 years and the Pelosi Congress accounts for four of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conventional wisdom says Democrats will likely make major gains in Congress in November, but they may not do as well as expected if the voters blame them for inaction on the biggest economic issue in the country. The GOP will be hammering them on this for the rest of the election cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a way to start digging ourselves out of this deep energy hole, and that is at the ballot box. Remember that the next time you fill up your tank.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post needs to tell us more than we know about John McCain and Barack Obama: what they stand for, what voters are thinking about them and what each is likely to do if elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Post reporters are good at the daily political stories and at covering the latest gaffes, and chief political reporter Dan Balz is the best at seeing through and beyond what is happening today. But what I'm more concerned about is something I've harped on repeatedly -- more biography and more substantial issues coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Readers submit complaints and advice daily, wanting The Post to be fair to their preferred candidates, though that often means: Tilt toward my guy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Readers backing Barack Obama think the press loves John McCain. Reporters enjoy mixing it up with McCain, something Obama doesn't do as much. But that doesn't mean they're cutting McCain slack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Readers who support McCain are right to say that Obama has gotten more coverage, mainly because McCain is so much better known than Obama, the phenom; in addition, the long primary campaign brought Obama heightened visibility. The Project for Excellence in Journalism has documented the coverage disparity in the past five weeks among national news media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A frustrated reader, Michael Gabel of Cheverly, wrote last week to complain that while The Post had written about Obama's mortgage, nothing had been written recently about McCain's many homes (that's right), his first marriage (that's right) and that property taxes had not been paid until recently on a condominium in La Jolla, Calif., owned by a trust controlled by his wife, Cindy  (an Associated Press story about this appeared on washingtonpost.com).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal Web sites were critical of a   Washington Post-ABC News poll question they said favored McCain on Iraq. The question: &quot;Obama has proposed a timetable to withdraw most U.S. forces from Iraq within 16 months of his taking office. McCain has opposed a specific timetable and said events should dictate when troops are withdrawn. Which approach do you prefer -- a timetable or no timetable?&quot; The question didn't seem unfair to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My monitoring of political stories since Nov. 12, done with my assistant Jean Hwang, shows that almost twice as many &quot;horse race&quot; stories (675) have been written as stories on issues (295) and biographical background (99). Part of that reflects the long primary campaign and the number of candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horse-race stories aren't all bad. It's important to know what is happening in the campaigns; that's often reported in The Trail blog. I've read elsewhere that relations are still rocky and uncertain between supporters of Obama and Hillary Clinton, but I haven't seen that story in The Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times' &quot;The Long Run&quot; delved deeply and early into candidates' backgrounds. The Post has not done nearly as much. For instance, McCain has been a smart aleck since high school. How would  that persona affect the way he would operate as president? Obama had an exotic childhood. How did growing up in Hawaii and Indonesia shape him as an adult?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Hamilton, The Post's assistant managing editor for politics, said, &quot;We have every intention of telling the life stories of Obama and McCain, but at a time when readers are most focused on the election. And the same goes for exploring the issues that are driving this campaign.&quot; He said that two fine writers, Michael Leahy on McCain and David Maraniss on Obama, have been assigned to do biographies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidates' policy speeches often end up being covered in short stories without detail or context as to whether what is being proposed might work. The policy papers should be dissected. A good start were recent pieces on Social Security and quoting fiscal experts as saying that it will be tough for the new president to launch  any  initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You have to look beyond the paper's news pages for analysis. When McCain said that he would balance the budget by 2013, the plan wasn't critically examined except in an editorial; the Ideas Primary editorials have provided much-needed insight into the issues. Much of The Post's accountability coverage is done in Michael Dobbs's  Fact Checker,  which unfortunately is seldom in the paper. Neither is media writer Howard Kurtz's Ad Watch. If you're not looking online for Post coverage, you're missing some of the best stuff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters want to know, especially in a troubled economy, about their pocketbooks. I admired a Wall Street Journal story and another on National Public Radio that reported how Obama and McCain might be expected to change tax policy. The Post needs to do these kinds of stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their voting records should be explored extensively. Is Obama really relentlessly liberal? Is McCain really so conservative? Are both  posing as centrists? While The Post has written about who advises the two candidates, I want to know what the advice is and whether it is being taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Huff of Bealeton, Va., wrote recently and got it just right: &quot;I really hope The Post's coverage of the election doesn't sink into a quagmire of process, politics and inside-the-Beltway chess games at the expense of issues that really affect our lives. . . . If all the news outlets want to talk solely about insider issues, that's all we'll know about. But if the focus is kept as keen as a laser beam on the critical issues of our times, then that's what the campaign will be about. That's what it has to be about. If The Post's staffers are true watchdogs of government, then that is the job that should be done. That's what we pay for with our subscription. Please tell your writers not to blow it this time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Risk Aversion; <BR>U.S. financial stability is in doubt. The candidates should tell us what they'd do about it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YOU KNOW the financial system is in trouble when Washington has to insist that it's not. Last week, President Bush found himself obliged to remind people that their bank deposits were federally insured. After a hearing Tuesday on bailing out mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) announced that &quot;the Fannie and Freddie situation is actually a lot better than certainly the fear would have indicated.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do they protest too much? Certainly, last week's turbulence shows that the financial stability of the United States is in doubt -- and that political leadership can help restore it. At some point, however, government must move beyond reassuring words and episodic bailouts and address the fundamental problem: The financial system has taken on more risk than its capital base will support. In the long run, the United States needs to modernize financial regulation so that unsustainable risks are not only swiftly corrected but prevented. There is no more important economic issue facing the country; financial crises, including a Fannie-Freddie crunch, may occupy the next president's first 100 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama and John McCain have made plenty of promises about jobs, taxes and the housing market. But on the big picture they've had less to say. In March, Mr. Obama gave a thoughtful speech in which he argued for regulating financial institutions based on their actual function in the economy, not on whether they are labeled investment banks or commercial banks. Equally wisely, he proposed linking government bailouts with tighter government regulation for the recipients. Less convincingly, he called for a commission to warn about broad risks to the financial system. It's unclear whether the panel would have any power, or simply duplicate the many fine reports on systemic risk already produced by think tanks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain also last addressed financial stability in the early spring, speaking with a stronger free-market accent and in even less detail than did Mr. Obama. He was right to say that &quot;government assistance to the banking system should be based solely on preventing systemic risk that would endanger the entire financial system and the economy.&quot; But that does not necessarily rule out very many bailouts, all of which tend to be justified on that basis. He would encourage increased capital in financial institutions &quot;by removing regulatory, accounting and tax impediments to raising capital&quot; and suggested that current &quot;mark to market&quot; accounting rules might be &quot;exacerbating the credit crunch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither candidate has addressed the growing role of the Federal Reserve in financial oversight. Are these prospective presidents comfortable with the Fed as a guarantor against &quot;systemic risk,&quot; as some have suggested? Or would that conflict with the Fed's inflation-fighting mission and draw it into political battles? Both campaigns told us these were legitimate questions; neither would answer them. Even on the prospect of a massive taxpayer bailout for Fannie and Freddie, the candidates are reticent. Mr. Obama has said that he might be for it, if it protects taxpayers and does not bail out shareholders and management. Mr. McCain, who has supported reining in government-sponsored enterprises as a senator, says about the same. The voters are entitled to a much more robust debate on the country's financial stability, and sooner rather than later.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ad: Barack Obama never held a single Senate hearing on Afghanistan. He hasn't been to Iraq in years. He voted against funding our troops. Positions that helped him win his nomination. Now Obama is changing to help himself become president. John McCain has always supported our troops and the surge that's working. McCain. Country first. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: This McCain&nbsp;commercial tries to paint Obama as inexperienced and anti-military, in part by taking a protest vote out of context. Obama has frequently voted to finance the war but was one of 14 Senate Democrats to oppose a war-funding bill last year -- after Republicans removed troop withdrawal deadlines -- saying he did not want to be &quot;validating the same failed policy in Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is accurate in saying that Obama, who has spent most of the past two years campaigning, has not held a hearing on Afghanistan in the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee he chairs. His only visit to Iraq was in 2006, and the ad is timed to cast doubt on his trip there next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has been criticized for saying recently that he would &quot;refine my policies&quot; for a 16-month withdrawal from Iraq, although he maintains that his position is unchanged. The ad puts up what appear to be news headlines -- &quot;Obama's Disingenuous 'Change' Agenda,&quot; &quot;Obama the Candidate of 'Change My Mind' &quot; -- that are actually from opinion pieces in the New York Post and Atlanta Journal-Constitution, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tagline -- &quot;country first&quot; -- is a not-so-subtle attempt to suggest that the former Navy aviator, pictured against American flag images, is more patriotic than Obama, who did not serve in the military and spent part of his childhood in Indonesia.</SPAN></P>

Barack Obama of failing to do his duty as chairman of a subcommittee charged with oversight over NATO, which leads war operations in Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama never held a single Senate hearing on Afghanistan,&quot; the ad's announcer says, adding that Mr. Obama is now changing positions on the success of the military surge in Iraq &quot;to help himself become president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign called the ad &quot;patently misleading&quot; and said it tarred Mr. McCain's calls for a campaign based on issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given his calls for a civil campaign, it's disappointing that Senator McCain has slipped so easily into the same, tired campaign tactics that have become so familiar to the American people,&quot; said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign said the 30-second ad will run on national cable TV stations and in key battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad charges that in order to win the Democratic nomination Mr. Obama voted against funding the troops and didn't go to Iraq for two years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Sen. Phil Gramm on Friday stepped down as a co-chairman of Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign, saying he had become too much of a distraction after calling America a &quot;nation of whiners&quot; in an interview with The Washington Times last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is clear to me that Democrats want to attack me rather than debate Senator McCain on important economic issues facing the country,&quot; Mr. Gramm, a former Republicansenator from Texas, said in a statement released by the McCain campaign Friday night. &quot;That kind of distraction hurts not only Senator McCain's ability to present concrete programs to deal with the country's problems, it hurts the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To end this distraction and get on with the real debate, I hereby step down as co-chair of the McCain Campaign and join the growing number of rank-and-file McCain supporters,&quot; Mr. Gramm said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not clear whether he would still offer unofficial advice to the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gramm, who is vice chairman of Swiss bank UBS, last week told The Times that the fundamentals of the economy are good and the problems Americans were experiencing were only in their heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've heard of mental depression; this is a mental recession,&quot; he said, noting that growth has held up at about 1 percent despite all the publicity over losing jobs to India, China, illegal immigration, housing and credit problems and record oil prices. &quot;We may have a recession; we haven't had one yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have sort of become a nation of whiners,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remarks became a target for criticism by Sen. Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, and his party, which argued the comments were indicative of a &quot;Bush-Gramm-McCain&quot; mindset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question for John McCain isn't whether Phil Gramm will continue as chairman of his campaign, but whether he will continue to keep the economic plan that Gramm authored and that represents a continuation of the polices that have failed American families for the last eight years,&quot; Obama campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan said Friday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain repudiated the comments and joked that Mr. Gramm had talked himself out of a position as Treasury secretary and into a job as ambassador to Belarus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the economy shaping up as a major campaign issue, Democrats hammered away, and early Friday a report by columnist Robert Novak that Mr. Gramm was back in good graces with the campaign set off another round of criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator McCain's economic plan gives nearly $4 billion in tax breaks to the oil companies but doesn't provide any tax relief to more than 100 million middle-class families. But that shouldn't come as a surprise since today we learned that Phil Gramm will continue to advise Senator McCain on economic policy despite calling Americans struggling in this economy 'whiners,'&quot; Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said Friday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gramm has been a key surrogate for Mr. McCain, including standing in for him at the Iowa caucuses in January and lending his strong conservative credentials to Mr. McCain's bid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Stephen Dinan, THE WASHINGTON TIMES</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAGE ONE; A01</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1067 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times it appears Sen. John McCain's Straight Talk Express should stop and ask for directions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From signature issues such as immigration and climate change to tax cuts, the presumed Republican presidential nominee sometimes just seems lost as to his own record and his stance on hot-button social issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr. McCain said he opposed child adoptions to gay and lesbian couples, his campaign clarified that he wasn't making policy and would leave the issue to the states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past week, the candidate was unable to say whether he thought health care plans that cover drugs to treat impotency also should cover contraceptives. Mr. McCain voted against such a proposal in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a candidate who delights in telling audiences that it's time for &quot;a little straight talk,&quot; he has given his opponents chances to question that reputation. The Planned Parenthood Action Fund on Wednesday announced a TV ad campaign showing Mr. McCain's eight-second pause and his fumble for an answer to the question on coverage for birth control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem, said Michael McKenna, a Republican strategist who works on climate change issues, is that Mr. McCain's campaign doesn't prepare him well and that he stakes out positions for political reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doesn't mean he understands it; it means he has the instinct that 'I don't want to be there, I want to triangulate off those guys,' &quot; Mr. McKenna said. &quot;He finds out where the conservatives are and he moves away from them, and only when he is compelled to, by facts or political exigencies, does he recalibrate. The campaign and the Senate office is, in a lot of cases, left standing there saying, 'OK, what target are we shooting at here?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twice this year, Mr. McCain has said he doesn't support &quot;mandatory&quot; caps on greenhouse gas emissions, even though that is the crux of his proposal to address climate change. He often uses his proposal as a chief example to differentiate himself from President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McKenna said it's impossible to have a cap-and-trade program without mandatory caps. By embracing targets rather than mandatory caps, he said, &quot;it sounds like something Bush could have said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would be willing to bet you every dollar I'm going to make this year he could not describe the important parts of his cap-and-trade proposal,&quot; Mr. McKenna said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On immigration, Mr. McCain misrepresented his own record on the most important vote of the past 40 years. He told the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials that he supported the 1986 amnesty. Mr. McCain voted against that bill, telling the Arizona Republic in his hometown that it was racist and would lead to employer discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican's reversal on President Bush's tax cuts is well-documented. He was one of only two Republican senators to vote against the 2001 cuts and one of only three to oppose the 2003 cuts. On the campaign trail, Mr. McCain says he wanted to see more spending reductions and now supports making most of the Bush tax cuts permanent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He didn't mention spending at all during his floor speech in 2001. Instead, he adopted Democrats' argument that the plan would aid the wealthy &quot;at the expense of middle-class Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the liberal interest groups, the Obama campaign argues some of the incidents aren't mistakes but attempts to obfuscate his record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a brief response to questions about his varying stances on his record Mr. McCain's campaign said he has taken principled positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's record of working across the aisle and putting his country first over partisanship is demonstrated - Barack Obama can say no such thing,&quot; said spokesman Tucker Bounds. &quot;Voters know that John McCain has an independent record, and that Barack Obama's record is a combination of his imagination and ambition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, the campaign released a 7-minute Web video documenting &quot;a timeline of Barack Obama's political positioning on the most critical national security issue America faces today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video was timed to coincide with Mr. Obama's upcoming trip to Iraq and other foreign countries. The McCain campaign said the video exposed Mr. Obama's evolution from opposing the military surge strategy in Iraq to embracing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rather than admit his mistake, Barack Obama is now trying to pretend that he was for the surge all along,&quot; said McCain campaign manager Rick Davis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's campaign responds that Mr. McCain frequently commits gaffes and has been caught using different rhetoric for different audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, a Republican Hispanic activist who attended a closed-door meeting said Mr. McCain was giving Hispanics a different message than the security-first rhetoric he was using on the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, Mr. Obama's campaign said Mr. McCain was telling the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People that he would increase funding for federal education programs, even though he has told other audiences that he would freeze most domestic spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days, he has referred to Czechoslovakia, even though that nation split into the Czech and Slovak republics in 1993. Gay rights groups bashed his comments to the New York Times, reported Sunday, about his stance on adoption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign then clarified that Mr. McCain would leave the issue to states. Only Florida bans same-sex couples from adopting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's not a detail person,&quot; said Donald J. Devine, a former Reagan administration official who is editor of Conservative Battleline. &quot;He's not a liar. I think he just can't believe that he would ever do anything wrong. He would think that would be some kind of moral failing, and he just figures there's got to be something that isn't right with what the other person said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ray Dearin, a professor of English at Iowa State University who has studied political rhetoric, said it's unlikely the gaffes push Mr. McCain off message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Dearin, who was elected an alternate delegate to the Republican nominating convention, said the mandatory caps issue is &quot;somewhat esoteric to most voters&quot; and using &quot;Czechoslovakia&quot; isn't a serious error: &quot;Ninety percent of Americans still call it that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Mr. McCain might be vulnerable on his history of votes on tax cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The failure to vote for the Bush tax cuts will still linger in the minds of some GOP voters. His position against repealing them will help with the base, though he probably is vulnerable on the 'straight talk' issue,&quot; Mr. Dearin said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> AN INDIANA ROUNDTABLE </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">In a Red State, Obama Tackles Issues of National Security </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WEST LAFAYTETTE, Ind. -- Barack Obama promoted his proposals to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to countries unfriendly to the United States and to address other security threats at a campaign event in this traditionally Republican state. The Democratic candidate is targeting GOP strongholds early in the general-election battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a few days before a planned trip abroad to highlight his foreign policy credentials, Obama led a roundtable discussion that included Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana and former Georgia senator Sam Nunn on the campus of Purdue University. Nunn has long worked on nonproliferation issues, and Bayh has served for years on the Senate Armed Services Committee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator from Illinois called for a renewed effort to secure nuclear weapons materials over the next four years from places such as the former Soviet Union. He also proposed convening a U.N. summit on the spread of nuclear terrorism and vowed to aim for a &quot;nuclear-free world&quot; by stopping the development of nuclear weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also suggested appointing a &quot;national cyber-adviser&quot; who would report to the president on computer security issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've had the debate about terrorism dominate so much of our politics over the last eight years, and rightfully so,&quot; he said. &quot;What this panel emphasizes is -- because a small group of individuals has the capacity to create great havoc -- it is important we don't approach this as an either-or proposition but a 'both'-'and' proposition. Yes, we must hunt down terrorists, but we also have to deal with the weapons they might use and take them out of circulation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign last week started running an ad touting his work on nuclear nonproliferation issues that noted his alliance in this cause with Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), a popular politician in his home state. The commercial is running in the 18 states that the Obama campaign is now targeting with advertising, which include traditional swing states such as Ohio but also Indiana, Montana, Alaska and North Dakota, which have long voted Republican in presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign also plans to start running another ad touting his national security credentials Thursday on national cable channels. &quot;Forty years ago it was missile silos and the Cold War. Today it's cyber-attacks, loose nukes, oil money funding terrorism,&quot; the ad's announcer says. &quot;Barack Obama understands our changing world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --  Perry Bacon J r. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">'I NEED YOUR GOODWILL' </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">Before the NAACP, McCain Talks Education </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CINCINNATI -- John McCain called for wide-ranging education reforms Wednesday in a speech before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a group that he said &quot;means more to me than any other,&quot; despite his history of opposition to many of its policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who has received a grade of F from the NAACP for his votes in each of the past four Congresses, acknowledged that he may not win the votes of the group's members in his race against Obama. McCain apologized for skipping the NAACP's convention last year, saying he &quot;was a bit distracted at the time dealing with what reporters uncharitably described as an implosion in my campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accompanied by former Maryland lieutenant governor Michael Steele, who is black, McCain said: &quot;I am a candidate for president who seeks your vote and hopes to earn it. But whether or not I win your support, I need your goodwill and counsel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain faces an uphill battle in winning over black voters, given that he faces the first-ever African American nominee from a major political party. In a Washington Post-ABC poll released this week, black registered voters backed Obama over McCain by 94 percent to 2 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican candidate focused his remarks on the issue of education, saying he would push for federal vouchers for private schools, greater leeway in teaching certification and an expansion of charter schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know better than I do how different the challenges are today for those who champion the cause of equal opportunity in America. Equal access to public education has been gained. But what is the value of access to a failing school?&quot; he said, prompting applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain suggested that by changing the way schools pay teachers, they could promote greater academic achievement. &quot;We will pay bonuses to teachers who take on the challenge of working in our most troubled schools, because we need their fine minds and good hearts to help turn those schools around,&quot; he said. &quot;We will award bonuses as well to our highest-achieving teachers. And no longer will we measure teacher achievement by conformity to process. We will measure it by the success of their students.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while he has blasted Obama several times this week for his stance on immigration and the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, McCain lavished praise upon his rival this morning. &quot;Don't tell him I said this, but he is an impressive fellow in many ways,&quot; McCain said. &quot;He has inspired a great many Americans, some of whom had wrongly believed that a political campaign could hold no purpose or meaning for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a little more than 100 days remaining until the Nov. 4 election, Republican U.S. Senate candidate James S. Gilmore III is struggling to keep pace with his Democratic opponent Mark R. Warner in the money race, and the presidential candidates are stepping up their spending in Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In campaign finance reports released Tuesday, Gilmore had $117,000 in the bank as he prepared to enter the next phase of the campaign, including a debate with Warner this weekend at the Homestead Resort in the western part of the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warner, who like Gilmore is a former governor, has $5.1 million in the bank, giving him a commanding advantage in his ability to reach out to voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warner launched his second major advertising blitz of the campaign Tuesday, releasing a 30-second TV spot focusing on his plans for reducing gas prices and reforming the nation's energy policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gilmore has yet to air a TV ad, instead using his resources to send out targeted &quot;robocalls&quot; to voters to try to get out his message about the need to drill for more oil in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like everything else. You would like to have more money to spend than you have, but I think the key for us is we've got enough money to deliver our message when the voters are listening, and that really isn't . . . until October,&quot; M. Boyd Marcus, a Gilmore strategist, said, commenting on Warner's 44-to-1 money advantage. &quot;People are maybe paying some attention to the presidential race, but they are not paying much attention to anything else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Virginia possibly up for grabs in the presidential race, Sens. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) have started investing in TV ads in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama released a 30-second TV ad Tuesday that will air statewide. In it, he talks about his vision for protecting national security and his efforts in the Senate to try to keep nuclear weapons out of terrorists' hands. Since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee, Obama has aired three ads in Virginia, including in the expensive Washington media market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain went up with his first Virginia ad last week, a one-minute biographical spot that has been airing in the Washington area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the presidential contest appears competitive in Virginia into the fall, political analysts say, Obama and McCain could each spend well more than $10 million in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of this week, McCain will have regional offices in Fairfax, Richmond, Fredericksburg and Virginia Beach. The Obama campaign, which has dozens of paid staffers working in the state, plans to announce a major expansion of its Virginia effort Wednesday, according to Democratic officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both political parties also are expected to pour money into Virginia, which hasn't supported a Democratic presidential nominee since 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to federal finance reports, the Virginia Democratic Party has a 9-to-1 advantage over the state Republican Party in money that can be used to try to influence the outcome of the presidential, Senate and congressional races. Virginia Democrats, who are trying to raise at least $3 million for their coordinated campaign, have $841,000 in their federal account, compared with the state GOP's $92,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going to be using our resources to reach out to voters to make sure we elect Democrats up and down the ticket, from Obama to Warner to our congressional candidates,&quot; said Levar Stoney, executive director of the Virginia Democratic Party, which has opened 10 regional offices focused on this fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP officials said the Republican National Committee, which has $53 million in the bank, can transfer money to the Virginia state party at any time to offset the Democrats' early money advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are confident that Virginia will have more than enough resources to help lead John McCain to victory in November,&quot; said Katie K. Wright, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, who noted that the Democratic National Committee has $4 million in the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebecca Fisher, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said the committee has not decided whether it plans to spend money to try to boost Gilmore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Northern Virginia's 11th Congressional District, GOP nominee Keith S. Fimian has an early fundraising advantage over Democratic candidate Gerald E. Connolly, the chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. Fimian, a wealthy businessman, said he has about $1 million in the bank for his race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Connolly, who just finished a costly battle for the nomination against former U.S. representative Leslie L. Byrne, has $271,000 on hand. But Connolly, whose fundraising is expected to pick up over the summer, will probably be able to count on help from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, DCCC officials said they had reserved $1.3 million in airtime in the Washington media market to run ads this fall aimed at the 11th District, which includes most of Fairfax and part of Prince William County.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush lifted nearly two decades of executive orders banning drilling for oil and natural gas off the country's shoreline on Monday while challenging Congress to open up more areas for exploration to address soaring energy prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats in Congress, joined by environmentalists, criticized the step and ridiculed it as ineffectual, while most Republicans and industry representatives applauded it as long overdue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lifting of the moratorium - first announced by Bush's father, President George H.W. Bush, in 1990 and extended by President Clinton - will have no real impact, because a congressional moratorium on drilling enacted in 1982 and renewed annually remains in force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress banned exploration and drilling on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts and most of the eastern Gulf of Mexico to protect U.S. beaches and fisheries from pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, there appeared to be no consensus for Congress to lift the ban in tandem with Bush's action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For years, my administration has been calling on Congress to expand domestic oil production,&quot; Bush said in a brief Rose Garden appearance. &quot;Unfortunately, Democrats on Capitol Hill have rejected virtually every proposal, and now Americans are paying at the pump.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush's critics reacted furiously, restating support for alternative legislative proposals, including releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., denounced the president's decision as &quot;a political stunt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the speaker of the House, derided &quot;the oilman in the White House&quot; and said the plan would not address the immediate spike in energy prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bush plan is a hoax,&quot; Pelosi said in a statement. &quot;It will neither reduce gas prices nor increase energy independence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A June 26-29 CNN-Opinion Research Corp. poll found that 73 percent of people surveyed favored more drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1982, the ban on offshore oil and gas leases on the outer continental shelf - vast areas three miles to 200 miles offshore - has been renewed by Republican and Democratic presidents and Democratic and Republican Congresses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the price of oil has quickly changed the political contours of the debate. When Bush first called on Congress to join him in lifting the ban last month, oil was trading at $130 a barrel; on Monday it reached $145.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. George V. Voinovich, R-Ohio, said that if the United States had opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling a decade ago as part of a comprehensive energy plan, &quot;we wouldn't be in this predicament today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now the chickens have come home to roost,&quot; he said. &quot;We can afford to wait no longer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats accused the White House of exploiting the issue for political purposes and said the administration could take steps to accelerate exploration of tracts already available to oil companies if it was serious about increasing domestic production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., the majority leader, faces an increasing uneasiness among his colleagues, who have signaled receptiveness to allowing more drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bipartisan group of senators is trying to develop a compromise energy plan, and the leaders of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee have scheduled a workshop for Thursday where lawmakers and other experts will offer ideas on how to respond to the climb in oil prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House, for its part, signaled little interest in other measures that would stop short of expanding offshore drilling and supporting production in Alaska and new technologies to extract oil from shale. Opening the outer continental shelf, Bush said, could eventually produce nearly 10 years' worth of the amount of oil the United States now produces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even if Congress lifted its ban on expanded drilling, analysts say consumers wouldn't see much change in their energy bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. government's Energy Information Administration reported last year that crude oil production would be 7 percent higher by 2030 if the ban were lifted on the offshore areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its report also said, &quot;Because oil prices are determined on the international market, however, any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has only 2 percent of world oil reserves but uses 25 percent of the oil. Also, oil produced in the United States is sold on the international market, not reserved for domestic use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This story was compiled from reports by The New York Times and McClatchy News Service.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">drilling ban</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lifting of the executive moratorium by President Bush will have no real impact because a congressional ban on drilling remains in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to analysts, even if Congress lifted its ban, consumers wouldn't see much change in their energy bills. opinions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain, the likely Republican presidential nominee, had previously expressed support for opening the continental shelf for exploration and production. The campaign of Sen. Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, responded that Americans needed to concentrate on conservation and alternative sources of energy, not simply opening new oil fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Virginia Sens. John Warner, a Republican, and Jim Webb, a Democrat, proposed ending the ban on offshore drilling for natural gas, but not for oil. Webb called the initiative &quot;a preliminary step toward exploration and development of one of our domestic energy sources,&quot; adding that &quot;all options need to be on the table&quot; to meet U.S. energy needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Thelma Drake, R-2nd District, also has supported lifting the moratorium. &quot;We have got to be energy-secure and energy-independent,&quot; and offshore resources are critical to freeing the nation from its reliance on foreign oil, she has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Randy Forbes, R-4th District, has voted in favor of lifting the congressional moratorium, while Rep. Bobby Scott, D-3rd District, is opposed to offshore drilling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox will tackle the comedy-series crisis by taking meetings with sitcom writers at their homes, or in restaurants of their choosing, to make them more comfortable, the head of Fox Entertainment told TV critics at Thank God I'm Working Summer TV Press Tour 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And one of the stars already has been recast on J.J. Abrams's new Fox drama series, &quot;Fringe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the slings and arrows of TV critics bounced right off Karl Rove (who appears to lack nerve endings) during a Fox News Channel Q&amp;A session. But they appeared to land on Chris Wallace, who was rattled by the questions and comments directed at on-air talent and a network exec.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About the sorry state of comedy series on network TV, Fox Entertainment division chief Kevin Reilly said: &quot;I can't even go to the platitude of 'it's cyclical, it's going to come back.' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of confidence has left the creative space on a day-to-day basis. I see really talented people coming in, very skittish, not knowing what to pitch and what will sell. I see executives trying to figure out where is that nerve to hit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The solution? &quot;We're not going to take most of our [comedy] pitches in our office,&quot; Reilly said. &quot;We're going to go out and meet the writers on their own turf. And that could be a restaurant, that could be -- if they want to do it in their house, we'll do it in their house. Anything that gets it out of a sterile environment and try something different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reilly said he's heartened by the whole Sarah Silverman-having-sex-with-Matt Damon/Jimmy Kimmel-having-sex-with-Ben Affleck dueling-video thing, and all the stuff comedy writers put on YouTube and other Web sites during the writers' strike. It appears comedy writers still know funny and now all they have to do is figure out how to shove an ad break in every seven minutes and, presto, you've got a sitcom revival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To that end, Fox is going to throw some money at comedy writers to go out and shoot something before they even come in to pitch it -- or, more accurately, meet Fox suits in their family room to pitch it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Go shoot something and then put it in the machine, even if it's not for air -- we've got to do anything to mix it up,&quot; explained Reilly, who said he had high hopes for one of his midseason comedies, &quot;Boldly Go Nowhere.&quot; He described it as &quot; 'The Office' in space -- petty jealousies and incompetencies on a long-term mission to wherever they're going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to the &quot;Fringe&quot; recasting: We're speaking, of course, of the cow that, some critics believe, steals at least one scene in the pilot. (You can see a bootlegged version online, though it's not the finished product.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cow had to be recast when the sci-fi-ish show moved from Vancouver, B.C., where the pilot was shot, to New York. The cow was not permitted to travel, the show's producer told TV critics, without elaboration. But pilot director Jeff Pinkner told critics they've had conversations about using makeup on the new cow if viewers notice its spots aren't in the same place in the second episode. You can just imagine the mythological implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former White House adviser Rove seemed unfazed by critics' questions in re whether having someone with his &quot;political baggage&quot; hurts the credibility of Fox News Channel, for which he is a contributor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress subpoenaed Rove in May to get him to talk about whether he had a part in prosecutors' decision to pursue cases against Democrats, or in the firing of federal prosecutors considered disloyal to the Bush administration, the Associated Press reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rove told TV critics that in letters to the House Judiciary Committee, &quot;my lawyer has offered for me to go up to visit with members of Congress, visit with the staff or respond to written questions without foreclosing any future action by Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox News Executive Vice President John Moody answered the question by saying the situation is between Rove and Congress and does not involve the cable news channel. At which point Rove sprang into action, insisting it's not personal at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not between me and Congress. I've not asserted any personal privilege -- this is between the White House and Congress,&quot; he said. It's about &quot;the ability of the president to receive advice from senior advisers and for those senior advisers not to be at the beck and call of Congress for testimony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rove and Howard Wolfson, Sen. Hillary Clinton's former campaign strategist, came to the press tour to talk about Fox's election coverage. But they never seemed to get around to that. Mostly they defended just being there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolfson acknowledged he wants Barack Obama to become the next president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rove said he's not formally working with Sen. John McCain's campaign but that he has frequent contact with those who are. Moody jumped in and said Rove wouldn't get information any quicker than the channel's correspondents covering the presidential race anyway. Critics seemed to buy that one, but when he said, &quot;I don't think Karl would cross the ethical line like that,&quot; it set off guffawing in the Beverly Hills hotel ballroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moody was asked about the reference by one air-talent, a while ago, to a possible &quot;terrorist fist jab&quot; between Democratic contender Barack Obama and his wife. Moody said he wished that had not happened, calling it &quot;regrettable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wallace, who was on the panel, got kind of knicker-knotted by the end of the session, which was surprising, given the general softball-ness of the questioning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think sometimes there's a double standard here,&quot; Wallace vented. &quot;I think that MSNBC and its coverage of this campaign went so far over the line in terms of being in the tank for Barack Obama it lost a lot of credibility.&quot; He noted Keith Olbermann's involvement in that competing cable network's election news coverage; Olbermann is also &quot;delivering 10-minute screeds against President Bush, telling him to shut the hell up and Hillary Clinton to get out of the campaign,&quot; he said. &quot;The fact is that there was something of a firewall&quot; on FNC, and a reason why &quot;Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity don't anchor the election coverage at Fox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our feeling is the opinion-makers should deliver their opinions and the journalists should cover the news.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The solid Republican South is looking a little less solid lately, with several battleground states giving the Democrats a rare chance to crack open the Republican Party's electoral lock on the politically conservative region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political analysts expect Republican Sen. John McCain to sweep most, if not all, of the 11 Southern states that made up the Old Confederacy. However, some say Democratic Sen. Barack Obama has a shot at scoring upsets in three or four states where the freshman senator is heavily focusing most of his resources and where the presidential race appears close: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush swept all 11 states in the South in 2000 and 2004, reaping its 153 electoral votes. If Mr. McCain were to repeat Mr. Bush's performance, Mr. Obama would need to win 70 percent of the remaining electoral votes to get the 270 required to clinch the election - a steep climb that would be almost impossible to reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four target states on the Obama campaign's radar screen would put 70 electoral votes into his column, significantly reducing his electoral challenge in the rest of the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are the Southern states where Obama has a chance, but I think John McCain will win the rest of the Deep South&quot; said Merle Black, a noted political science professor at Georgia's Emory University who has published numerous studies about Southern political trends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing to look at in these Southern states that have voted GOP in the past is that many of them have the highest black voting population[s] in America, and that is the foundation upon which Obama is building an attempt to reshape the battlegrounds in some of them,&quot; said Matthew Towery, who heads the Atlanta-based InsiderAdvantage poll, which specializes in the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So he has a chance in Virginia for sure, North Carolina is a possibility, and Georgia would be seen as an upset. If the Obama campaign could put together any combinations of those states, his strategy is to replace the electoral votes that could conceivably be lost in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts before him and even former Vice President Al Gore largely wrote off the South with the exception of Florida. Mr. Obama, however, has moved a large campaign ground force and major TV ad buys into those four states, where his campaign strategy is to significantly boost turnout among blacks and younger voters and increase his appeal among white voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many analysts, though, question whether younger voters, with notoriously low turnout rates, will turn out this time in significant enough numbers and whether Mr. Obama can overcome Mr. McCain's substantial double-digit advantage among white voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His ground troops are part of a voter-registration army of hundreds of volunteers who are working nearly full time for six weeks this summer registering blacks, Latinos and Hispanics and younger voters, who have been heavily drawn to his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In North Carolina, for example, which Mr. Bush carried by more than 435,000 votes in 2004, the Illinois Democrat has a paid staff of nine and more than 150 mostly full-time volunteers who are registering voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A survey by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic group, reported at the end of last month that Mr. Obama trailed his Republican rival by just four points (41 percent to 45 percent) in the state, with Libertarian candidate Bob Barr at 5 percent. However, though Mr. Obama has a 76 percent to 15 percent lead among blacks, Mr. McCain was leading him by 53 percent to 32 percent among white voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Georgia, which has one of the largest black voter populations in the country, the race was even tighter: Mr. McCain holds a slim two-point lead (46 percent to 44 percent), according to an InsiderAdvantage poll on July 2. Mr. Barr drew 4 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obama campaign is saturating television in the state, clearly believing that the 15 electoral votes in Georgia are up for grabs,&quot; PPP pollsters said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet some analysts say Georgia remains a difficult challenge for the Democrats because of a number of factors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For Obama to win Georgia, several things have to happen,&quot; Mr. Black said. &quot;He has to have a huge turnout of African-Americans. In July, just 28.1 percent of registered voters were African-Americans. That is not up a lot from 2004, when they made up 27.4 percent. It could be up a little, but they are talking about registering 100,000 voters a month&quot; - a difficult challenge at best, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then he needs McCain to run a lot weaker among white voters than Bush did. Bush won 76 percent of the white vote in 2004, Kerry got 23 percent. McCain's not at Bush level, I don't think. Bob Barr, a former congressman from there, has the potential to hurt McCain in Georgia among whites, but I think there is a real limit to Barr's support. He doesn't have much money and will not be part of the debate,&quot; Mr. Black said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I still think McCain is the favorite to win Georgia. I don't think there is any question that he is going to get a majority of the white votes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas F. Schaller, a University of Maryland political science professor who has published a study of Southern voting trends, concluded earlier this month in a New York Times column that &quot;Mr. Obama can write off Georgia and North Carolina&quot; because even a larger black vote would not be enough to offset Mr. McCain's advantage among white voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia is a different case entirely, and Mr. Obama could carry it, analysts say. A SurveyUSA poll late last month showed the race there in a statistical tie, with Mr. Obama holding a two-point edge, 49 percent to 47 percent in recent polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state, because of an influx of non-Southern voters in the past decade or more, has been trending Democratic, though it has remained in the Republican column in presidential races. Mr. Bush carried the state by more than 262,000 votes in the last election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, boasting $95 million in cash on hand, has been saturating the state, especially Democratic-leaning Northern Virginia, with TV ads. The presumptive Democratic nominee does best among voters between the ages of 35 and 49, where he holds a 12-point lead, but Mr. McCain has an 18-point lead among voters older than 65 and has a 13-point lead among white voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Virginia is very competitive right now and Obama has a shot at it,&quot; Mr. Black said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida remains the fourth battleground in the South where the Obama campaign is investing significant resources. Polls show the race there in a statistical tie, with Mr. McCain holding a 2.2 percent edge last week - though analysts say Mr. McCain retains the advantage there because of the state's large military and older population and its Republican majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The conventional wisdom is that Florida will not be as strong a state for Obama as it was for Kerry or for Gore. So Obama's strategy has been to basically nail down Virginia, make North Carolina competitive where you have a high black voting-age population, and really push hard in Georgia,&quot; Mr. Towery said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns acknowledge the challenges they face in the general election and say they are taking nothing for granted in the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whether you live in the Northeast or in Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia or Florida, the majority of this country is not pleased with how Washington works, and they want change. We are serious about playing in the South; we mean business,&quot; said Obama spokesman Nick Shapiro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama has talked a lot about competing down there, but we are under no illusions and taking nothing for granted. We're building organizations in all the [Southern] states, and we'll be campaigning throughout them in places like Virginia and Florida. We're going to fight for every vote,&quot; said McCain spokesman Brian Rogers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14.The American Civil Liberties Union will announce today at the National Press Club that the U.S. government's terrorist watch list has added its 1 millionth name. The estimate stems from a Justice Department inspector general's report last year that put the watch list roster -- four years after its creation -- at more than 720,000 in April 2007, and growing by 20,000 records a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list is used by the Transportation Security Administration in determining who may be blocked from flying on commercial airlines or who must undergo additional screening before boarding a plane. Critics such as the ACLU have accused federal officials of ignoring systemic problems with the list and say these errors mean far too many travelers are unfairly subjected to increased scrutiny by virtue of an incorrect listing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16.U.S. trade with Africa will be discussed through Wednesday as officials and business executives come to Washington to take part in the seventh annual AGOA Forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sessions are a legacy of the 2000 trade deal known as the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Currently, 41 sub-Saharan nations are eligible for trade benefits under the act, the State Department says, and more than 98 percent of imports from AGOA countries entered the United States duty-free in 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's forum, &quot;Mobilizing Private Investment for Trade and Growth,&quot; will bring together not only senior administration officials and African government ministers, but also U.S. and African civil society and business stakeholders to discuss the African business climate and access to capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Total trade between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa reached $81 billion last year, with most of that coming from AGOA countries. But oil accounts for too much of the imports to the United States, critics say, and forum participants will discuss ways to improve the flow of agricultural products, which has been hampered by the need to meet U.S. standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16.The NAACP convention continues through Thursday in Cincinnati, with both presumptive major-party presidential nominees scheduled to appear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama, the first African American to head a major-party presidential ticket, will address the conference tonight, following a &quot;Youth Public Mass Meeting&quot; on the state of young black America and its views on the 2008 elections. Sen. John McCain is expected to address a special plenary session Wednesday that will focus on the 40th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's appearance offers the opportunity to distance himself from President Bush, who in 2004 snubbed the convention, becoming the first sitting president since Herbert Hoover to do so, according to news reports at the time. Bush's snub led Kweisi Mfume, then the president of the civil rights group, to roundly castigate the president; his comments helped spark an IRS investigation of the organization's nonprofit status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17.On Thursday, the third annual liberal blogger convention formerly known as Yearly Kos, and now called Netroots Nation, will kick off in Austin. Last year's convention in Chicago featured a presidential candidate forum that marked the emergence of lobbying as a major concern in the pre-primary period. The issue of candidates and committees taking money from or employing lobbyists has remained a significant point of contention in the year since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, fewer sparks but more attendees are expected at the sprawling conference, which will draw Democratic and independent political technologists and activists to the Lone Star State's liberal capital.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN DIEGO, July 13</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sens. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) are aggressively courting Latino voters in the early stages of their election contest, as the presumptive Republican nominee looks to hold on to  Latino-heavy states, such as New Mexico, that Obama hopes to turn blue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Make no mistake about it: The Latino community holds this election in its hands,&quot; Obama said Sunday at a conference of the National Council of La Raza, one of the nation's largest Latino civil rights groups. &quot;Some of the closest contests this November are going to be in states like Florida, Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico -- states with large Latino populations.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men face very different tasks. Obama is seeking to solidify his standing among a group that has historically leaned Democratic, whereas McCain is working to convince Latinos that he deserves their support, based on his stance on immigration and experience as a border-state lawmaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain will address La Raza on Monday, the third time in as many weeks the candidates will have courted Latino activists. They spoke last Tuesday in Washington at a conference of the League of United Latin American Citizens, and last month to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, McCain's campaign began running ads appealing to Latinos in Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada, key states that backed President Bush in 2004 but which Obama hopes to pick off with a strong Latino turnout. The Democrat is running ads in those states as well, but none yet with Latino themes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you have any doubt about whether you can make a difference, just remember how, back in 2004, 40,000 registered Latino voters in New Mexico didn't turn out on Election Day,&quot; Obama said Sunday in San Diego. He noted that Democratic candidate John F. Kerry &quot;lost that state by fewer than 6,000 votes -- 6,000 votes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite becoming the nation's largest minority group over the past decade, Hispanics lag behind other groups in voting. According to the Census Bureau, 58 percent of eligible Hispanics were registered to vote in 2004, compared with 75 percent of non-Hispanic whites and 69 percent of blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent Gallup poll showed Obama leading McCain by 30 percentage points among Latinos, a larger margin than Kerry's 20 points over Bush in 2004 exit polls. But Obama lost badly to Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.) among Hispanics in Democratic primaries and told reporters Saturday night on the way to San Diego, &quot;I'm not as well known in that community as I would like to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech on Sunday, Obama cast his positions on spending more federal money to expand health care, create jobs and improve education as important for the Latino community as well as other Americans, and discussed his support for creating a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. His aides said they plan to start running ads on Spanish-language radio stations next week in key states and will keep them going through November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's aides acknowledge that he is trailing Obama among Latino voters, but they view this effort as crucial to making inroads so that he can hold on to states such as Florida and Colorado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a news conference with reporters Sunday, former U.S. treasurer Rosario Marin, a McCain supporter, said she is confident some independent and Democratic Latinos will back the Republican once they learn more about his record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ones that know what the senator has done in this regard, they're very supportive of him,&quot; Marin said, referring to his work on immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's first televised ad in the general election -- named after his military identification number 624787 -- featured a Spanish-language narrator who testified to his courage as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial, which ran in New Mexico, featured archival footage of McCain -- with much of his body wrapped in a cast -- being interviewed by a captor. The campaign has run several other ads in which McCain praises Latinos for having entrepreneurial spirit and for being willing to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan with only green cards. During one of his speeches, the camera pans to Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.), an opponent of illegal immigration, who looks on sulkily as McCain extols Hispanics' contributions to U.S. society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want you the next time you're down in Washington, D.C., to go to the Vietnam War Memorial and look at the names engraved in black granite. You'll find a whole lot of Hispanic names,&quot; McCain says in a new spot airing in Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada. &quot;When you go to Iraq or Afghanistan today, you're going to see a whole lot of people who are of Hispanic background.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign has directed its appeals to Latinos to reflect that its members span the political spectrum. A radio ad running in Florida woos conservative Cubans with a testimonial from a former prisoner of Fidel Castro, and a Nevada radio commercial features an announcer who notes that when Latinos go shopping in the supermarket or fill up their gas tank, &quot;We're not Republicans, Democrats or independents -- we're Hispanics, and we're suffering together in these uncertain economic times. We need someone with a good economic plan. This someone is John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, McCain is to embark on a one-week &quot;opportunity&quot; tour in which he will talk about &quot;bolstering the opportunities across the country for people of all constituencies,&quot; an aide said. He will conduct several interviews with Hispanic media outlets, and he will have breakfast Tuesday with Latino small-business owners in Albuquerque.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain's aides remain frustrated that his work on immigration has not translated to greater popularity among Latinos. Conservative media outlets and pundits sharply criticized McCain for the immigration bill he co-authored with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain's decision to &quot;secure our borders first&quot; before pushing for comprehensive immigration-law change, a position he adopted after coming under fire from fellow Republicans during the primaries, has alienated some Hispanics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also has touted his work on last year's immigration bill: Although not a key player like McCain, he participated in the process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conventional wisdom is that Hollywood has never before been so gaga over any candidate as she is now for Democratic Sen. Barack Obama. In addition to raking in Oprah-level campaign cash, Mr. Obama is making Sen. John McCain, despite the Republican's comedic turns on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and in &quot;The Wedding Crashers,&quot; look like an out-of-it grandfather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it is true that the ratio of Obama-to-McCain bumper stickers in West L.A. is about 250-to-1, there are untold closet Republicans in the entertainment industry who dare not advertise their beliefs in movie studio parking lots. (Unfortunately, car keying is a tactic wielded liberally by the self-described &quot;tolerant.&quot; )</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in this land of superficiality and augmented assets, the inconvenient truth is that, in Hollywood, absolute conformity to the Democratic Party is a well-constructed facade. The environment is not so much unfavorable to the Grand Old Party as it is utterly totalitarian. There's simply no lifestyle choice that receives a worse response at dinner parties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convicted murderer? Has anyone optioned the rights to your story?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Avowed Marxist? Viva la revolucion!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientologist? Do you take Visa or Mastercard?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syphilitic drug abuser? Let's talk!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative? You should go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only proclaiming one's self a practicing Christian is met with greater disdain - making Christian Republicans the gold standard in Hollywood pariah status. Fortunately, their Savior - that dude from Mel Gibson's highest-grossing blockbuster that was shunned by the major studios - wrote the script on how to live with an unpopular point of view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the communist-sympathizing Jane Fonda aerobicized her way into the mainstream of Hollywood politics, and about the time that John Wayne died, most Republicans in Hollywood began to shut their mouths. Other Republicans attempt to win over the bullies by referring to themselves as &quot;moderate,&quot; &quot;libertarian &quot; &quot; independent &quot; &quot; classical liberal &quot; &quot; pragmatis &quot; or &quot; JFK Democrat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tandem of social and vocational ostracism usually shuts down even the strongest voices. Yet recently during the &quot;Iron Man&quot; media blitz, a New York Times profile on Robert Downey Jr. featured the following quote buried in the 23rd paragraph: &quot;I have a really interesting political point of view, and it's not always something I say too loud at dinner tables here, but you can't go from a $2,000-a-night suite at La Mirage to a penitentiary and really understand it and come out a liberal. You can't. I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone else, but it was very, very, very educational for me and has informed my proclivities and politics ever since.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes we can!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe the cryptic Mr. Downey now considers himself a French separatist? Or perhaps a Zapatista? The Hollywood dinner party test strongly hints that the talented actor has lurched rightward during his long road to recovery. Playwright David Mamet recently expressed a similar Road to Da Masses conversion. &quot;I took the liberal view for many decades,&quot; Mr. Mamet bravely wrote in a Village Voice op-ed, &quot;but I believe I have changed my mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Si se puede!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two entertainment icons go against the political grain during ascendant Obama times, yet there's nary a peep from the media heralding their journeys. And their peers ignore the rejection of their faith for fear of creating sequels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Downey and Mr. Mamet have reached points high enough in the food chain where they won't always be disinvited from macrobiotic power lunches. They join an elite brunch that includes Adam Sandler, Kelsey Grammer and Patricia Heaton who also brazenly wear the Scarlet &quot;R&quot; in the middle of the school cafeteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Crichton - who, to the chagrin of Al Gore, exposes &quot;environmentalism as a religion&quot; - and comic genius Dennis Miller show that there are cracks in the wall artificially separating Hollywood from much of America. This stealth contrarian trend (featuring high-end talent with iconoclastic reputations) could gain steam in an election featuring a &quot;maverick&quot; like Mr. McCain, who gives nervous showbiz conservatives far greater career cover than toxic avenger George W. Bush ever did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked recently what it was like to work with &quot;Republican&quot; Clint Eastwood (the question speaks volumes), Angelina Jolie, a &quot;surge&quot; supporter who also wants to produce Ayn Rand's &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; surprised Entertainment Weekly with her answer: &quot;Actually, we don't disagree as much as you'd think. I think people assume I'm a Democrat. But I'm registered independent and I'm still undecided. So I'm looking at McCain as well as Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You hedge, girl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation in Los Angeles is fundamentally different from that in Washington, D.C., where members of both parties openly embrace their party affiliation (for now). Republicans in the federal government accept that they are the freaks and geeks. Democrats, the &quot;cool kids,&quot; have their status affirmed by frequent jaunts to town by Hollywood's &quot;Creative Coalition&quot; - bestowing upon our congressman, Henry A. Waxman, a status he certainly didn't hold in 11th grade. Only a Democrat can recount sipping a latte with Christine Lahti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York while the liberal mind-set dominates - especially in the media - there are enough dominant industries (i.e. Wall Street) in which free marketers flourish. So the outnumbered and the outshouted experience in Manhattan is tempered by pockets of confident oppositionism, which explains the rise of Rudy Giuliani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Los Angeles is a one-company town. And because of bullying (or what Democrats would call blacklisting or &quot;political discrimination,&quot; if the shoe were on the other foot), Hollywood has become a one-party town. History will show this dynamic hurt both the creative and the political processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the absence of checks and balances, we end up with a system that creates a mainstream film about Ronald Reagan - written, produced and directed by narcissistic and myopic partisans who only viewed the Gipper through the lens of AIDS activism. Like anyone would watch an epic movie about America's victory in the Cold War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver Stone - a left-wing conspiracy theorist - gets to take a cinematic stab at George W. Bush before he even leaves office. Thankfully, he assures us he will treat the subject evenhandedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every big-screen cartoon warns toddlers of anthropogenic global warming or the wrongs of corporate America. It's almost like they conceived a process to scientifically extract the joys from childhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are tons of movies on Nazi Germany. But why the dearth of stories on the rise and fall of the Iron Curtain? Are there no stories of tragedy and triumph in the 100 million or so dead, or those who came out alive?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All historical political episodes are seen through the eyes of Democrat protagonists and Republicans are cast as the villains. If only the GOP could outsource its PR burden to the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). Those guys sure know how to erase negative stereotypes from the big screen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a dozen box office failures vilify the troops without a single counterperspective seeing the light of day. Yet one positive Iraq war film, &quot;Brothers at War,&quot; dares to tell the story of a noble and patriotic American family - but it can't find a distributor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The litany of negative consequences to the ideological rigidity of modern Hollywood is virtually limitless. The lack of tension between competing ideas has made the arts increasingly tedious and rendered the celebrities woefully uninteresting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's worse, when Mr. Obama can come to town to cherry-pick untold millions in donations - and Mr. McCain is shunned because a simple FEC search of his artsy donors could ruin a phalanx of careers (not to mention many Lexus paint jobs) - then something's desperately wrong.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month after the primaries have officially ended, gone are the television-ad blitzes about who is the best Democrat or Republican to be in the race for the White House to be replaced by messages explaining who is the best person to live there. Barack Obama starts out of the gate with two national ad buys, one describing his love for America and the values he has learned from his white grandparents and mother, with pictures to boot. Another details some key policies he has helped enact in the U.S. Senate and Illinois Senate that were discovered later to have little to do with him. This included welfare to work, a policy he supported reluctantly after opposing it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama appears to be trying to reach the political center of America with both his policy record and &quot;Country I Love&quot; ads. Many Republicans have urged John McCain to hit back, calling on him to take Mr. Obama to task for his &quot;inaccuracies&quot; and misstatements about his record and policy positions. There is an opportunity for Mr. McCain to hammer Mr. Obama over his claims to have &quot;slashed the [welfare] rolls by 80 percent,&quot; &quot;passed tax cuts for worker &quot; and &quot; extended healthcare for wounded troops who had been neglected.&quot; But to date he has not done so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Mr. McCain's own ads is strong and does hit Mr. Obama on some key points: &quot;John McCain doesn't always tell us what we hope to hear. Beautiful words cannot make our lives better, but a man who has always put his country and her people before self before politics can. Don't hope for a better life, vote for one - McCain.&quot; It's a great ad. The problem is we have heard it before, just not from Mr. McCain. We wrote in early June about Mr. McCain's strategy to mimic Hillary Clinton's attacks on Mr. Obama's rhetoric and his oratorical skills, arguing that they are nothing but smoke and mirrors and do not constitute reasons to vote for him. It did not work for Mrs. Clinton, so why do the McCain&nbsp;ad makers think it is going to work for their candidate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is it won't. Ronald Reagan's trickle-down theories and many of the other policies he espoused in the 1980 presidential race were derided by is opponents, including George H. W. Bush, as just a lot of &quot;voodoo&quot; talk. But they were pretty good talk, and at the end of the day it was Mr. Reagan's ability to inspire and bring hope to people with is words that led him to one of the largest margins of victory in electoral history. Attacking an opponent's rhetoric does not win elections. But being able to articulate your policy positions and demonstrate how they are superior to those of your opponent can be a formula for victory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain and Barack Obama are offering voters very different views of America's energy future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama envisions the federal government funding alternative energy development and mandating lower fuel consumption. McCain sees a less direct federal role, relying on government incentives and market forces to boost energy supplies and promote efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both candidates are similar in one respect: They pledge a comprehensive overhaul of energy policy. But they offer sharply divergent paths that analysts often find confounding and impractical. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They both have ambitious goals, but less-than-ambitious means,&quot; said Bruce Bullock, the director of Southern Methodist University's Maguire Energy Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richard Kearney, the director of the School of Public and International Affairs at North Carolina State University, put it more starkly: &quot;They're just throwing stuff against a wall and seeing what sticks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Experts agreed that neither candidate's plan is likely to lower energy prices anytime soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There's no silver bullet that will bring prices down,&quot; Bullock said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Voters will have a particularly tough task sorting out all the ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If I were a voter and didn't know much about energy, I would think that nothing the candidates are saying, at first glance, sounds wrong,&quot; said Robert Kaufmann, the director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Studies at Boston University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, voters should understand &quot;there is no singular answer. Markets are too complex and our energy needs are too great,&quot; added Philip Sharp, the president of Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan research group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To sort out the energy plans, experts said, voters need to consider these questions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Will either plan help the United States reduce its dependence on oil?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States consumes about 20.6 million barrels of oil a day. About 60 percent is imported. That's well above the 35.8 percent that was imported in 1975, when President Gerald Ford, and later President Jimmy Carter, put their political weight behind comprehensive energy legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama aims to reduce oil consumption by at least 35 percent by 2030; among his ideas to curb demand is to increase fleet fuel economy 49 miles per gallon in 18 years. McCain doesn't set specific goals for consumption or auto standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Auto fleet-average mileage standards are scheduled under current law to increase from today's 27.5 miles per gallon to 35 mpg by 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain focuses on increasing oil supplies, emphasizing that his plan to end the 27-year-old moratorium on drilling off most U.S. coastal waters will free up &quot;enormous energy reserves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Can the government set energy policy on a radically different course?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain and Obama say that's their goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain would use the cap and trade system as a way to promote alternative fuels. Funds would help develop cleaner energy technologies, including nuclear power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama, who also supports a form of cap and trade, would spend $150 billion over 10 years to help develop biofuels, &quot;commercial-scale renewable energy,&quot; plug-in hybrids, low-emission coal plants and other sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Can the program be sold to the public?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The biggest energy-policy problem the new president will have is likely to be political. Massive energy programs can be a tough sell, particularly to a public that wants price relief now, and with a strong array of special interests ready to pounce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet President Carter did it in the late 1970s. It took all four years of his term, but he got about three-fourths of what he first proposed, and from the start he made it clear that his energy program was his top domestic priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Views on energy '08</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where the presidential candidates stand:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dependence on foreign oil imports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Cap and trade program to help cut dependence; send correct signals to market to move beyond fossil fuel dependence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama : Reduce oil consumption by at least 35% by 2030 via fuel efficiency, biofuels, investing in new vehicle technologies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology investment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Revise federal research funding, bureaucracy to develop new emission reduction technologies; streamline process to deploy new technology</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: $150 billion over 10 years to fund transition to digital electricity grid, low-emission coal plants, other projects</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nuclear fuel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: 45 new power plants by 2030; loan guarantees for new construction; supports Yucca Mtn. nuclear waste facility</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama Must address security of nuclear fuel and waste, waste storage, proliferation, public's right to know before building new power plants; against Yucca Mtn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renewable fuel standards</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Eliminate mandates, subsidies for corn-based ethanol that thwart market-based solutions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: 60 billion gal. of advanced biofuels by 2030; 2 billion gal. of cellulosic ethanol by 2013</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vehicle fuel efficiency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Supports CAFE standards; penalties must compel production of fuel-efficient cars</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama ; Double fuel economy standards within 18 years; retool tax credits, loan guarantees so fuel-efficient cars can be built in U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building efficiency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Favors tax incentives for energy-efficient buildings, appliances</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: All new buildings must be carbon neutral or produce zero emissions by 2030</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid a presidential campaign dominated by debate about the economy and the war in Iraq, an advertising campaign scheduled to debut in Northern Virginia and elsewhere tomorrow is seeking to spotlight challenges facing  U.S. schools. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 30-second television spot shows a blond-haired boy raising the flags of dozens of countries, including Finland and South Korea and Japan, onto one flagpole as ominous orchestral music plays in the background. In a voiceover, actress Jamie Lee Curtis says: &quot;This boy's future isn't looking so good. The schools in every one of these countries are outperforming ours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the final shot, an overcast sky looms behind the flagpole and the Stars and Stripes ripples at the bottom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $5 million &quot;One Nation Left Behind&quot; campaign is being launched by Strong American Schools, a nonpartisan organization formed a little more than a year ago to boost political discourse about education -- a topic that has received sporadic attention from the two major presumptive presidential candidates, Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Barack Obama (D-Ill.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group has received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other philanthropic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flag-waving theme is meant to foreshadow the Beijing Olympics, where Americans will be focused on winning, said Marc Lampkin, executive director of the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If China and India were running away&quot; with the medals, &quot;we would be outraged.&quot; The campaign aims to create a similar fervor around what he described as a crisis in education and the ability of the United States to compete internationally in business and technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial shows how the United States stacks up against 30 other industrialized countries, based on the 2006 Program for International Student Assessment, an exam that ranked U.S. students 25th in math and 21st in science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts question the significance of international results, saying a nation's education system should be judged on other measures. But Strong American Schools points to such test results and high U.S. high school dropout rates as evidence of a problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It advocates more uniform and rigorous academic standards, more time for students in school, and differential pay to help recruit and retain quality teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization said the campaign will start tomorrow  in seven battleground states and will use radio, print and online ads as well as television ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northern Virginia was selected because it is emerging as a key campaign region for Obama and McCain and because its population is politically engaged. But the area has well-funded and well-regarded schools, so an educational crisis might not be readily apparent to some.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Wolfe, director of the Academy of Science in Loudoun County, a magnet school formed in 2005, said he applauds efforts to improve public schools but thinks there are some positive trends in math and science education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His school has hosted delegations from six countries who want to know how U.S. students learn to innovate and think creatively, skills that help give the United States an edge in technology and business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a math and science educator, I'm more interested in how they think, not how they perform on a standardized test,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CARBON DIOXIDE and other greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change are a danger to public health and welfare. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Stephen L. Johnson could have come to that conclusion. The science certainly would have been on his side. But Mr. Johnson opted to ignore the urgings of EPA experts when he announced Friday that the agency would seek public comment on the threat posed by global warming, thus pushing regulation of greenhouse gases to the next administration. This move makes President Bush's signing of the Group of Eight declaration on climate change on Tuesday look like an empty gesture. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We agree that the Clean Air Act doesn't provide the ideal way to regulate greenhouse gasses and wasn't designed for that purpose. But the Bush administration has only itself to blame for this regulatory mess. Rather than go to Congress with a rational plan for a cap-and-trade system to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, it played games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. In addition, the court said that the agency must determine whether those emissions endanger public health and welfare by contributing to climate change. If they do, the EPA must devise standards to regulate them. If not, the court required the agency to ground its explanation in science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what got the White House spooked: If the EPA classified carbon dioxide from motor vehicles as a pollutant that threatens public health or welfare, then the agency would have to regulate greenhouse gases from all other sources as well. Sections 108, 109 and 111 of the Clean Air Act deal with regulating emissions from stationary sources, such as residential and commercial buildings, establishing national ambient air quality standards and setting source performance standards, respectively. Each of these complicated regulations has its own complex implementation process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ever since the Supreme Court's ruling, the administration, using the limited discretion granted by the high court, has punted on meaningful decision-making. Mr. Johnson initially said that an endangerment finding would be made by the end of 2007.  Because Friday's newly announced process for public input will last 120 days, Mr. Johnson has effectively kicked a final decision to the next administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Barack Obama (D-Ill.), the presumptive Republican and Democratic presidential nominees, both recognize climate change as a threat to the nation's  security and way of life. No matter which man is elected, the see-no-evil approach of the Bush administration will come to a merciful end.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Monroe had one, and so should we.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That seems to be the theory behind the rampant and premature speculation among national security wonks about what kind of new doctrine President      Obama or President McCain would use to guide U.S. foreign policy. But let's not get carried away thinking about what a McCain or Obama doctrine might be. In today's complex world, a president doesn't need to have a one-size-fits-all template for handling foreign affairs. In fact, the next president would be better off without one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Cold War, Americans grew accustomed to presidents having big, broad doctrines to organize their thinking. Sometimes these were tailored to particular places, such as Jimmy Carter's vow to protect U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf, by force if necessary, after the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Other doctrines were more sweeping, such as Harry S. Truman's determination to support free peoples against communist usurpers or Ronald Reagan's pledge to assist anticommunist insurgencies worldwide. All these principles were proclaimed within the context of Washington's overarching Cold War strategy to contain Soviet communism, famously articulated in 1947 by the legendary diplomat George F. Kennan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the almost 20 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, foreign policy experts have all aspired to be the next Kennan. But that communal nostalgia for the supposed simplicity of the Cold War and elegance of Kennan's containment doctrine is misplaced. A single template was one thing during the long twilight struggle against a single heavyweight rival. But since the collapse of communism, the effort to impose one grand theory on global politics has proven deeply frustrating -- and foolish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton was desperate to outline what he called a &quot;theory of the case,&quot; a simple notion to help the American people make sense of a rapidly changing world. He constantly complained to his aides about their failure to come up with anything. In speech after speech, he and his advisers tried out many slogans, including &quot;democratic enlargement,&quot; the &quot;age of hope&quot; and the &quot;third way.&quot; None ever took hold, and at least one Clinton speechwriter, Robert Boorstin, told us that he found the whole effort to come up with a new bumper sticker &quot;a waste of time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, the Clinton team came to embrace the view that deeds mattered more than words. During the 1999 war over Kosovo, Clinton officials rebuffed pressures from the media and the foreign policy cognoscenti to couch the conflict in terms of a new foreign policy doctrine -- which senior administration aides referred to dismissively as the D-word. &quot;We tried to establish common law rather than canon law,&quot; then-national security adviser Sandy Berger told us. &quot;We set out to build a new role for the U.S. in the world by experience rather than doctrine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results were rather good -- the United States entered the 21st century with significant global support and respect -- but some conservatives argued that avoiding doctrinal vision showed indecision and weakness. When George W. Bush took office more than seven years ago, his new administration believed that Clinton's failure to define a clear foreign policy framework had helped squander U.S. influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush team set out to speak explicitly about doctrine, emphasizing U.S. dominance of the world system, a willingness to go it alone and an insistence that Washington was entitled to take preemptive action to fight emerging threats. The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, offered Bush a historic pretext for articulating this set of ideas, which were trumpeted in the administration's now infamous 2002 National Security Strategy. Influential commentators and historians (such as Yale's John Lewis Gaddis) swooned, calling the Bush doctrine a major innovation in national security thinking. Many liberals were cowed, believing that opposing it would seem weak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, however, the Bush doctrine is in tatters: Reeling from Iraq, abandoned even by many conservatives, the administration is adopting 11th-hour positions that are far from doctrinaire on issues including China, Iran and North Korea. The new policies are more ad hoc, embracing multilateral approaches and tailoring solutions to specific challenges -- something suspiciously like the Clinton approach Bush used to sneer at.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the Bush doctrine's encapsulating phrase, the &quot;war on terror,&quot; has lost support. Some of Washington's closest allies reject the premise that the animating feature of world politics today is a war on radical Islam. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has banished the phrase from his lexicon, and retired and active-duty military leaders have warned that casting the fight against al-Qaeda as a war implies, wrongly, that force alone can vanquish global jihadism. Strikingly, several former top Bush officials, including former defense secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and former secretary of state Colin L. Powell, have joined the chorus. &quot;I don't think I would have called it a 'war on terror,' &quot; Rumsfeld admitted as he left the Pentagon in 2006. And Powell told us that &quot;war on terror&quot; is &quot;a bad phrase. It's a criminal problem. This is not the Soviets coming back. . . . Let's not hyperventilate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter who is elected in November, the next president will unceremoniously jettison the Bush doctrine. (McCain is hawkish, not suicidal.) But he will be prodded by advisers and provoked by pundits to replace it with a new one. Policy wonks will destroy scores of trees, consume untold megabytes and crowd the airwaves trying to do so. Our advice to Obama and McCain: Change the channel. The last thing the American people need is another bumper sticker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Bush has so painfully demonstrated, the quest to define a simple, Kennan-esque concept to guide U.S. foreign policy is fruitless, overrated and even dangerous in the complex world of the 21st century. The search for the single simple rubric has helped leave the country in deep trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solving problems is more important than laying out all-encompassing ideological pronouncements. The world we live in is too diverse for anything else. The United States faces a range of difficult challenges, including Islamist extremism, a surly Russia, the rise of China and India, the quest for energy security and the fight against global warming -- all while trying to make sense of globalization. No single doctrine can hope to address these myriad problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The person who best understood the dangers of trying to cram a teeming world into a lone phrase was the very man whom so many foreign policy thinkers have tried to emulate, the late George Kennan. During the Cold War, Kennan grew deeply frustrated by the ways in which containment was used to justify policies that he believed were ill-advised. In the early 1990s, members of the Clinton team met with Kennan in hopes that the sage of strategy could help them come up with a concept to replace the one he had coined. The old diplomat's wise advice: Don't try to boil things down to a bumper sticker. Instead, he said, try for a &quot;thoughtful paragraph or two.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Returning from vacation, I found many complaints from readers -- more than 1,700 comments online -- who saw unfairness and negativity in a July 2 story on Page A3 by national reporter Joe Stephens on a discounted mortgage rate for Sen. Barack Obama's home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C.C. Benedict of the District said it was an &quot;incredibly irresponsible story from any reasonable perspective. The fact is the rate was completely in line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephens reported from documents off Obama's Web site that Obama and his wife, Michelle, locked in an interest rate of 5.625 percent on a $1.32 million, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage from Northern Trust of Chicago when they bought their $1.65 million Chicago home. He paid no discount points or origination fee. The deal offered the Obamas saved them about $300 a month on their mortgage payment. The average interest rate in Chicago on smaller mortgages in June 2005 was between 5.93 and 6 percent, the story said, and it noted that modest adjustments in mortgage rates are common when financial institutions compete for a borrower's business. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Readers also objected to the story's prominent mention of controversial mortgage loans given two other senators and a prominent Obama supporter by the troubled Countrywide Financial Corp. James Duemer of Potsdam, N.Y., said that &quot;the inclusion of information in the story about Countrywide is irrelevant: the Obamas got their loan from Northern Trust. The rhetorical purpose of the details about Countrywide is to create an appearance that the Obamas got a special deal because Mr. Obama is a senator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the seven financial and mortgage experts I talked to, three were former reporters. The reporters thought the rate was low enough to merit a story. Financial experts who weren't journalists thought the rate was normal and something that any other wealthy, smart borrower might have gotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, was quoted in Stephens's story as saying that Obama &quot;did better than average. It's a good deal.&quot; Gumbinger also told me that the rate &quot;was not out of the boundaries&quot; of what other borrowers were offered. &quot;Frankly, any reasonably savvy borrower should have been able to do better than average. That context was missing&quot; from the story, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story quoted an Obama spokesman as saying that the rate was lower because of a competing offer. It is common for borrowers to shop for the best rate. The story noted that the Obamas had enjoyed a surge in income. This came through higher-paying jobs for both and a $2.27 million book deal for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northern Trust Vice President John O'Connell said in an interview, &quot;This was not a unique situation -- it is common and consistent business policy which shows no favoritism toward politicians, celebrities or any public figures. His rate was based on the fact this is a client who could potentially bring us more personal business.&quot; The Obamas since have invested about $3 million with Northern Trust, the Obama spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Connell said that Northern Trust's rate on this type of mortgage at the time was 5.81 percent and that a discount of 0.125 percent was available to clients or prospective clients based on the potential for more personal business; 0.060 percent was subtracted from the rate because it was a competitive bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Bauer, the Obama campaign's general counsel, is familiar with the mortgage and reviewed the loan with bank officials. He said that the story &quot;tilted over, to any reader, into a story of preferential treatment, not justified by the facts. The fact that Obama is a U.S. senator is immaterial.&quot; After reviewing the loan file from an ethics point of view, he said, &quot;it was a walkaway, a piece of cake.&quot; To Bauer, the rate Obama got wasn't as relevant as whether another borrower in the same circumstances would have received the same treatment and gotten a loan at the same rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then why hadn't the Obama campaign complained about the story? Bauer, an expert on ethics and campaign finance, said a Columbia Journalism Review critique of the story was so good that &quot;we didn't have a whole lot to add.&quot; CJR's Campaign Desk blog said that there &quot;there doesn't seem to be much of a story here&quot; and that the story raised more questions than it answered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher Cruise of Silver Spring, a national trainer of mortgage brokers and loan officers, thought the story was &quot;fair, broad and deep.&quot; A former reporter, Cruise suggested that Obama should not have bargained for a lower rate if for no other reason than to avoid the appearance of preferential treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holden Lewis, a reporter who covers mortgages for Bankrate.com, said, &quot;I realize that the story annoyed some people, but this was a case of an enterprising reporter asking a question that had to be asked and who got it answered thoroughly. I wish I had written the story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would he have done anything differently with the story? &quot;I would have stressed that the mortgage rate was normal for someone who has $3 million invested with the brokerage lending the money. The money they invested was more than the mortgage, so they are incredibly good credit risks.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guy Cecala, owner of Inside Mortgage Finance newsletters in Bethesda, said the rate was not typical for most lenders to offer good customers. &quot;It certainly raises eyebrows and suggests that Obama got the deal because he was a U.S. senator,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think you will find that Northern Trust handed out any other 5.625 percent, 30-year fixed-rate loans that day or week.&quot; Cecala said he had negotiated hard with banks himself for several loans and the most he had ever gotten was an eighth of a percentage point discount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Connell said information about the other loans given that week is not easily available. He said Cecala's statement does not reflect an understanding of Northern Trust's business. &quot;Our core business is wealth management, and mortgages are one of many services we provide to our clients,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jill Hoogendyk, president and owner of HomePoint Mortgage Co. in Phoenix, said, &quot;It's nothing for one borrower to get a quarter percentage point lower than another borrower on any given day. The industry is set up in such a way that owners have that kind of flexibility. If you have a high-net-worth customer, it makes perfect sense to develop a business relationship that would bring in more business to the bank&quot; by giving a break on a rate. &quot;There's nothing unethical or scary or anything else about it. It's good business. If you take away the fact that he's a U.S. senator, no one would have a problem with that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked the advice of my longtime financial adviser and CPA, Stephen B. Smith of Williams-Keepers in Columbia, Mo., only because Smith is about the most Republican Republican I know when it comes to financial matters. And he's no Obama fan. After reading the article, he said: &quot;No story. It's a very normal mortgage gotten by normal people, not even a sweetheart deal. The story quotes average rates. Averages have a range in this context. The rate charged is probably within the range of others in the sample who had no reason to get a favor. That is not a rate to shock the conscience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several other readers brought up the &quot;average&quot; rate. Sarah Zielinski of the District wrote: &quot;When banks are making loans, they are giving people with better credit a better rate and those with worse credit a higher rate. Yes, some people are probably getting special consideration and others, definitely, were getting scammed. But with no other evidence than a slightly better rate for the senator -- who I would not be surprised to discover has a good credit rating -- the article's premise seems unfounded and useless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post has teams of reporters on each candidate. Stephens, who came from the investigative unit, has been assigned to report on Obama; another reporter, Kimberley Kindy, is doing the same on McCain. There are some facts that Stephens did not have for the story, such as Obama's credit score; he said he is continuing to report on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Stephens, &quot;given the Countrywide controversy and the Senate's prohibition on accepting gifts of any size, it was a no-brainer to ask the presidential candidates whether they had home loans and whether their lenders had given them discounts. In Obama's case, the answers were yes, he had a million-dollar mortgage, and yes, he received a discount. That was worth getting on the public record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Readers deserve to know everything pertinent The Post can find out about Barack Obama and John McCain's finances. In that context and in the context of the home mortgage crisis, the story had news value. McCain doesn't have any mortgages, due to his wife's wealth; that's not uncommon for rich people, I'm told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the story had a negative cast to it. It also lacked the important context that other wealthy and savvy borrowers could have done as well under similar circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the themes that will definitely be established is you cannot expect to get to the White House and ignore this community,&quot; said Clarissa Martinez De Castro, NCLR's director of immigration and national campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said her group hopes to lower the nonparticipation rate and turn out 10 million Hispanic voters for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, 6.7 million Hispanics, or 47.6 percent of those of voting age and holding citizenship, cast ballots. The voting rate was far below the 60 percent of eligible blacks and 64.1 percent of all eligible Americans. Although the Hispanic population is larger, nearly twice as many black voters turned out as Hispanics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sign that the presidential candidates expect this to be the year Hispanics live up to their potential, both of the major parties' presumptive nominees are completing the Hispanic triumvirate - speeches to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO), the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and, this week, to NCLR. Sen. Barack Obama, Illinois Democrat, speaks Sunday, and Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican, speaks Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, NCLR President Janet Murguia challenged both presidential candidates to take a stand against &quot;inaccurate and inflammatory language&quot; she said those in both parties are using on the immigration issue, adding that &quot;hate has hijacked the immigration debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As examples, she pointed to a leaflet from the Missouri State Democratic Committee that accused a Republican candidate of allowing 5 million illegal immigrants into the country and to a commercial being run by a Republican congressional candidate in Alabama using images of brown hands in handcuffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our political leaders can stop it,&quot; she said. &quot;They should stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama lay claim to leadership on a broad immigration bill that includes a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants - an issue that is helping drive Hispanic voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like NCLR, Mr. Obama sees Hispanics as a treasure trove of untapped votes, and he issued a challenge at LULAC last week for them to live up to their potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I truly believe that if we can register more Latinos, young and old, rich and poor, and turn them out to vote in the fall, then not only will we change the political map, and not only will I win the presidency, but you will finally have a government that represents all Americans,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said registered Hispanics could have erased the margins of victory for Republicans in New Mexico, Florida, Colorado and Nevada in recent elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So while I know how powerful a community you are, I also know how powerful you could be on November 4th if you translate your numbers into votes,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, in the opening keynote speech to NCLR on Saturday, encouraged Hispanics to back Mr. Obama in a minority alliance reminiscent of that between Martin Luther King and Hispanic labor activist Cesar Chavez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can reach the mountaintop, we can break another barrier that will say to every American and everyone around the world that this is a place that judges you on the content of your character, not the color of your skin,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said electing Mr. Obama would prove the country is living up to its Founding Fathers' vision, though he confused the founding documents, placing the &quot;all men are created equal&quot; line in the Declaration of Independence as being &quot;in the same Constitution, [that] said that a black man was three-fifths of a human being.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, meanwhile, has gathered some of the key advertising and outreach players who helped President Bush win 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2004, and Mr. McCain's Spanish-language ad strategy has been a dominant theme of his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain was among the first Republicans to identify Hispanics as a critical voting bloc, delivering speeches decades ago about the importance of courting those voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Martinez De Castro said NCLR's goal for increasing Hispanic participation is not partisan and not about just one election. She said the organization is trying to get Hispanics invested in the political process, and at that point it will be up to the political parties to talk about the issues important to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Parties need to do their jobs. If there are voters out there, parties need to figure out how they're going to connect,&quot; she said. &quot;We are trying to make sure our folks are on the rolls so they get reached out to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the dramatic increase in citizenship applications over the past year is evidence that today's immigrants, like previous waves, have the same goal of full participation in American society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday's citizenship drive is just one piece of a grand strategy. Other efforts include joint pushes by the NALEO Educational Fund, Univision and other organizations to push eligible Hispanics to apply for citizenship. Univision ran a program about completing the application process, Spanish-language newspapers included application materials in their editions and NALEO ran a call-in hot line to answer questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organizers claim more than 1 million citizenship applications have been filed as a result of their efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday's workshop included volunteers who pre-screened applicants and made sure they had the correct documents, and lawyers who could advise them of potential problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The volunteers signed confidentiality statements so applicants could be more forthcoming in revealing their status and potential legal disqualifications such as criminal records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Applicants left with a completed application that they could send to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NCLR staffers said 35 percent to 40 percent typically turn out to be eligible and follow through on filing their applications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain and Barack Obama are accelerating their bid for the Hispanic vote. This week, they both delivered a speech to the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). They will also both speak to the National Council of La Raza (NCLR) on Sunday and Monday. The candidates have similar views on immigration reform.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, Mr. Obama, who has less of a track record in addressing Latino issues, is currently more bold in courting this constituency. Ironically, Mr. McCain, who has long and diligently served the Hispanic community, is more awkward in his appeal. He must continue to insist on border security and to reveal how a conservative agenda benefits all Americans, including Hispanics - but he must also manifest his previous work on behalf of Hispanics. Both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama have stated that they will secure the border, establish temporary worker programs and create a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. In his speech to LULAC, Mr. Obama was direct, warm and made specific references to Latino concerns regarding health care and education. He also demonstrated great sympathy for their economic needs: &quot;When Hispanics lose their jobs faster than almost anybody else, or work jobs that pay less, and come with fewer benefits than almost anybody else that isn't a Hispanic-American problem, that's an American problem.&quot; Mr. Obama pledged to make immigration reform his top priority in the first year of his desired presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, Mr. McCain is walking a tightrope as he courts the Hispanic vote. In his speech to LULAC, he detailed his agenda for the economy, health care, trade and energy. Mr. McCain applauded Hispanic contributions to American society - especially their military contributions. This is part of the Arizona senator's efforts - also evidenced in his latest campaign ad - to emphasize how Latinos and Republicans share a similar patriotic zeal and regard for national security. In his speech to LULAC, Mr. McCain also referenced his previous work on immigration reform - but he did so mostly in an apologetic manner, citing the failure to pass immigration reform. Mr. McCain reaffirmed his commitment to secure America's borders and tepidly stated that Americans have &quot;economic and humanitarian responsibilities&quot; - but he did not elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To his detriment, Mr. McCain treads too carefully in courting Hispanics, for fear of alienating the anti-illegal immigration voters. He does not want to upset the 62 percent of Republicans who, according to a May 2008 Pew Research poll, state that immigration is &quot;very important&quot; in how they vote. However, Mr. McCain's Hispanic strategy may be too tepid. A June NBC/Wall Street Journal poll revealed that 62 percent of Hispanics will vote for Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While upholding his law and order stance that appeals to the conservative base, Mr. McCain should also be bolder in touting his track record with Hispanics. Mr. Obama, who has done far less in courting Latinos during his political career, is poised to win the majority of a swing bloc of voters - because, despite his lack of substance, he has mastered the art of symbolism.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A12</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">458 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CARBON DIOXIDE and other greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change are a danger to public health and welfare. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Stephen L. Johnson could have come to that conclusion. The science certainly would have been on his side. But Mr. Johnson opted to ignore the urgings of EPA experts when he announced yesterday that the agency would seek public comment on the threat posed by global warming, thus pushing regulation of greenhouse gases to the next administration. This move makes President Bush's signing of the Group of Eight declaration on climate change on Tuesday look like an empty gesture. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We agree that the Clean Air Act doesn't provide the ideal way to regulate greenhouse gasses and wasn't designed for that purpose. But the Bush administration has only itself to blame for this regulatory mess. Rather than go to Congress with a rational plan for a cap-and-trade system to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, it played games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. In addition, the court said that the agency must determine whether those emissions endanger public health and welfare by contributing to climate change. If they do, the EPA must devise standards to regulate them. If not, the court required the agency to ground its explanation in science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what got the White House spooked: If the EPA classified carbon dioxide from motor vehicles as a pollutant that threatens public health or welfare, then the agency would have to regulate greenhouse gases from all other sources as well. Sections 108, 109 and 111 of the Clean Air Act deal with regulating emissions from stationary sources, such as residential and commercial buildings, establishing national ambient air quality standards and setting source performance standards, respectively. Each of these complicated regulations has its own complex implementation process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ever since the Supreme Court's ruling, the administration, using the limited discretion granted by the high court, has punted on meaningful decision-making. Mr. Johnson initially said that an endangerment finding would be made by the end of 2007.  Because yesterday's newly announced process for public input will last 120 days, Mr. Johnson has effectively kicked a final decision to the next administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Barack Obama (D-Ill.), the presumptive Republican and Democratic presidential nominees, both recognize climate change as a threat to the nation's  security and way of life. No matter which man is elected, the see-no-evil approach of the Bush administration will come to a merciful end.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps you saw the notice that the Chris Rock show tonight is rated PG-13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps you were shocked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Don't worry. So was Rock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I know nothing of that,&quot; the 43-year-old comedian said on the phone from his home in New Jersey. &quot;I don't know why the [heck] somebody would advertise a PG-13 show. That's borderline retarded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So don't worry, Rock is going to be Rock: profane, blunt and controversial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Bush has [bleeped] it up so bad, he's made it hard for a white man to run for president,&quot; he says in his current show. &quot;Wasn't McCain too old 10 years ago?&quot; And because he doesn't think Barack Obama can win, Rock recommends that he marry a white woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even so, Rock bristles when his politics are referred to as radical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think I'm a pretty mainstream comedian. When they have a comedian function, it's me and Jerry [Seinfeld] and Ray Romano. How radical can I be?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rock's trip to Richmond comes in the middle of a yearlong tour, from September to September. It's much longer than his usual tours, which last three to four months, and which he embarks on every three or four years. This time, the tour is longer for two reasons: daughters Lola, 6, and Zahra, 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's weird,&quot; he said. &quot;When you've got kids, you think you don't have money, 'cause you don't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When he is touring, he is on the road for three or four days a week and then home for four or three days. His daughters sometimes travel with him, especially now that they have summer vacation (the older will be entering first grade, and the younger is heading into her last year in preschool).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They save you from your miserable self. It's true. It's the best way to sum it up. You've got to analyze every move you make. There's nothing like kids to get you out of you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rock said he never particularly sought fame or success but just fell into it when he was discovered in comedy clubs and brought on to join the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1990. If he had never been offered the &quot;SNL&quot; gig, he wouldn't have been upset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'd work at UPS or FedEx or whatever,&quot; he said. &quot;I'd be one of the funnier guys at FedEx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Hey, if you'd have offered me a job paying $8 an hour in 1985, I would have never told jokes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1985 is when he first became a comedian. A high school dropout, he had been working as a busboy and dishwasher at a Red Lobster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was making $3.35 an hour then, so my idea of a good job was $10 an hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And does he ever go back to that Red Lobster?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's weird. I'm allergic to shrimp now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier in his career, Rock compared his comedy to that of George Carlin, who died last month. While looking back on Carlin this week, it wasn't the comedy that stood out in Rock's mind, but the man himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He was a great guy. I used to love him ... I just loved him because he always talked to you as an equal. He was 70 years old, and he would talk to you like you actually did the same thing for a living, and everyone doesn't do that. A lot of guys talk down to you. George was always right there with you and was interested in what was going on in your life and what you thought was funny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The average guys - I'm not going to say any names - they just tell you stories all day about things that happened four years ago. George was really about now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama spoke to a crowd of voters yesterday in Fairfax, and his Republican rival, Sen. John McCain, held a teleconference with Northern Virginia voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Julie Strasberg had her way, it would have been Hillary Rodham Clinton, not Obama, speaking to a large crowd of female voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strasberg backed Clinton until she ended her bid last month to become the first female president. But while some of Clinton's legions of female supporters have been reluctant to switch allegiance, Strasberg is not among them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He's speaking out for issues that are near and dear to women's hearts,&quot; said Strasberg, 43, a lifelong Democrat and freelance editor from Fairfax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Obama looks to the general election, he is reaching out to women, many of whom supported the woman he bested in the bitter Democratic primary fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We take for granted that women are the backbone of our family,&quot; Obama told a crowd of about 2,800 supporters - both men and women -at Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the speech, he detailed several proposals aimed at making life easier for working women and families, including the expansion of child-care tax credits and increased investment in early childhood education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also said he would expand family- and medical-leave programs and require employers to offer seven days of paid sick leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Virginia has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, Obama and McCain are investing time and money in the state. Polls show a tight race for Virginia's 13 electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In June, Obama kicked off his general-election campaign in Bristol and Prince William County, a sign he was placing great importance on the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's wonderful to be back in Virginia,&quot; Obama said yesterday. &quot;We did well in the primaries in Virginia, and we're going to do well in the general election in Virginia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain's campaign also targeted women and Northern Virginia voters yesterday, holding a news conference in Fairfax to defend his record on women's issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Susan Allen, a former first lady of Virginia, called McCain an experienced leader who understands the economic challenges Americans face.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama shrugged off a crude comment aimed at him by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, accepting an apology for a remark Jackson made as he contended that Obama wasn't speaking to issues important to the black community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unaware that his microphone was on during a break for a Fox News program last Sunday, Jackson used a slang reference about wanting to neuter Obama. When he learned Wednesday that the Fox News program &quot;The O'Reilly Factor&quot; would air his comments that night, Jackson apologized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During a break Sunday from taping &quot;Fox &amp; Friends,&quot; a fellow guest asked Jackson about speeches on morality Obama has given at black churches. Jackson said at a news conference Wednesday he responded that Obama's speeches can come off as speaking down to blacks and that there were other important issues to be addressed, such as unemployment, the mortgage crisis, and the number of blacks in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain rejects Gramm: Republican John McCain distanced himself from an economic adviser who dubbed the United States &quot;a nation of whiners&quot; in a &quot;mental recession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I strongly disagree&quot; with Phil Gramm's remarks, McCain told reporters in Belleville, Mich. &quot;Phil Gramm does not speak for me. I speak for me.&quot; The Arizona senator said a person who just lost a job &quot;isn't suffering from a mental recession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;America is in great difficulty. And we are experiencing enormous economic challenges as well as others,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gramm, a former Texas senator who is a vice chairman of the Swiss bank UBS, made the remarks in an interview with The Washington Times. Gramm has a doctorate in economics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You've heard of mental depression; this is a mental recession,&quot; Gramm said. He noted that growth has held up at about 1 percent despite publicity over losing jobs to India and China; illegal immigration; housing and credit problems; and oil prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have sort of become a nation of whiners,&quot; Gramm said. &quot;You just hear this constant whining, complaining about a loss of competitiveness, America in decline&quot; despite a major export boom that is the primary reason that growth continues in the economy, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Virginia, Obama seized on the comments as he tried to paint McCain as out of touch: &quot;America already has one Dr. Phil. We don't need another one when it comes to the economy.&quot; He drew cheers and laughter with that comment, a reference to television psychologist &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; McGraw - and boos and hisses when he read Gramm's quotes to his audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain responded to Obama's criticism, saying that the Democrat opposes offshore drilling and nuclear power to try to solve energy woes. &quot;You talk about Dr. Phil - he is Dr. No on energy,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain fundraising: McCain raised more than $22 million in June, his best fundraising performance of the year. He ended the month with nearly $27 million on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The campaign's fundraising has given McCain the ability to spend more on television advertising than Democratic rival Obama in key battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama has not revealed his June fundraising.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jul. 11--Perhaps you saw the notice that the Chris Rock show tonight is rated PG-13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps you were shocked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't worry. So was Rock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know nothing of that,&quot; the 43-year-old comedian said on the phone from his home in New Jersey. &quot;I don't know why the [heck] somebody would advertise a PG-13 show. That's borderline retarded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So don't worry, Rock is going to be Rock: profane, blunt and controversial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bush has [bleeped] it up so bad, he's made it hard for a white man to run for president,&quot; he says in his current show. &quot;Wasn't McCain too old 10 years ago?&quot; And because he doesn't think Barack Obama can win, Rock recommends that he marry a white woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, Rock bristles when his politics are referred to as radical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think I'm a pretty mainstream comedian. When they have a comedian function, it's me and Jerry [Seinfeld] and Ray Romano. How radical can I be?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rock's trip to Richmond comes in the middle of a yearlong tour, from September to September. It's much longer than his usual tours, which last three to four months, and which he embarks on every three or four years. This time, the tour is longer for two reasons: daughters Lola, 6, and Zahra, 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's weird,&quot; he said. &quot;When you've got kids, you think you don't have money,'cause you don't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he is touring, he is on the road for three or four days a week and then home for four or three days. His daughters sometimes travel with him, especially now that they have summer vacation (the older will be entering first grade, and the younger is heading into her last year in preschool).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They save you from your miserable self. It's true. It's the best way to sum it up. You've got to analyze every move you make. There's nothing like kids to get you out of you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rock said he never particularly sought fame or success but just fell into it when he was discovered in comedy clubs and brought on to join the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1990. If he had never been offered the &quot;SNL&quot; gig, he wouldn't have been upset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd work at UPS or FedEx or whatever,&quot; he said. &quot;I'd be one of the funnier guys at FedEx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, if you'd have offered me a job paying $8 an hour in 1985, I would have never told jokes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1985 is when he first became a comedian. A high school dropout, he had been working as a busboy and dishwasher at a Red Lobster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was making $3.35 an hour then, so my idea of a good job was $10 an hour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And does he ever go back to that Red Lobster?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's weird. I'm allergic to shrimp now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in his career, Rock compared his comedy to that of George Carlin, who died last month. While looking back on Carlin this week, it wasn't the comedy that stood out in Rock's mind, but the man himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was a great guy. I used to love him . . . I just loved him because he always talked to you as an equal. He was 70 years old, and he would talk to you like you actually did the same thing for a living, and everyone doesn't do that. A lot of guys talk down to you. George was always right there with you and was interested in what was going on in your life and what you thought was funny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The average guys -- I'm not going to say any names -- they just tell you stories all day about things that happened four years ago. George was really about now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Julie Strasberg had her way, it would have been Hillary Rodham Clinton, not Obama, speaking to a large crowd of female voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strasberg backed Clinton until she ended her bid last month to become the first female president. But while some of Clinton's legions of female supporters have been reluctant to switch allegiance, Strasberg is not among them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's speaking out for issues that are near and dear to women's hearts,&quot; said Strasberg, 43, a lifelong Democrat and freelance editor from Fairfax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Obama looks to the general election, he is reaching out to women, many of whom supported the woman he bested in the bitter Democratic primary fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We take for granted that women are the backbone of our family,&quot; Obama told a crowd of about 2,800 supporters -- both men and women --at Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the speech, he detailed several proposals aimed at making life easier for working women and families, including the expansion of child-care tax credits and increased investment in early childhood education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said he would expand familyand medical-leave programs and require employers to offer seven days of paid sick leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Virginia has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, Obama and McCain are investing time and money in the state. Polls show a tight race for Virginia's 13 electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, Obama kicked off his general-election campaign in Bristol and Prince William County, a sign he was placing great importance on the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's wonderful to be back in Virginia,&quot; Obama said yesterday. &quot;We did well in the primaries in Virginia, and we're going to do well in the general election in Virginia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, Obama criticized McCain for not doing enough to develop policies that support women and families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's become very clear that he will not bring change, and I will,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign also targeted women and Northern Virginia voters yesterday, holding a news conference in Fairfax to defend his record on women's issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan Allen, a former first lady of Virginia, called McCain an experienced leader who understands the economic challenges Americans face.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Virginian-Pilot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAIRFAX</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama looked Thursday to exploit the gender gap that has become critical to Democratic political success since the 1990s: wooing female voters in a key Virginia battleground and casting his Republican presidential rival as indifferent to the faltering national economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours after reports that former Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, a key adviser to GOP candidate Sen. John McCain, called Americans &quot;a nation of whiners&quot; concerning the economy, Obama struck back with gusto. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;doesn't seem to see the problem,&quot; the Democrat said to roars of approval from 2,500 supporters at a Fairfax County school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This economic downturn is not in your head,&quot; he added. &quot;When people are out there losing their homes and property values are declining, that's not just a figment of your imagination. And it isn't whining to ask government to come in and give families some relief.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions about Gramm's remarks dogged McCain on Thursday as he insisted he doesn't share Gramm's views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a 25-minute speech and a town hall forum that followed it in Fairfax, Obama hailed women as &quot;the backbone of our middle class&quot; and accused McCain of opposing legislative efforts to help women pursue claims of workplace discrimination .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a Supreme Court decision last spring on pay discrimination, Obama supported and McCain voted against a bill designed to make it easier for women to sue their employers in such cases. McCain said then that he supports &quot;pay equity&quot; but that the bill &quot;opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also called for guaranteed sick leave and expanded family leave benefits for male and female workers, beefed-up early childhood education programs, and annual increases in the federal minimum wage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said the federal government can provide that aid without increasing the federal deficit, in part by rolling back tax cuts approved early in the Bush administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His plan will increase tax bills only for families bringing home more than $250,000 annually, he said .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have been working hard to cast Obama as a tax-loving big spender. Hours after his Fairfax rally, Susan Allen, the wife of former Gov. and U.S. Sen. George Allen, issued a statement asserting that &quot;the promises Barack Obama is making today in Virginia are promises he can only keep by raising our taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A radio commercial playing on Washington area stations before Obama's appearance Thursday featured a teacher who accused Obama of voting &quot;to raise taxes on folks earning as little as $32,000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FactCheck.org, a nonpartisan watchdog group, has challenged that claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama voted in March for a budget resolution that urged a return to tax brackets that were in effect before 2001, the group said, but that resolution would only have affected single taxpayers earning more than $41,500 and couples bringing in more than $83,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Register 100 Virginia voters, presumably those who will vote Democratic, and win a chance to get face time with Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sort of campaign activity is rarely seen before Labor Day in Virginia and never in presidential elections. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with Virginia in the new role of swing state, it's a sign of changing times that Obama and Republican John McCain are fighting it out in Virginia's July heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only are were both presidential campaigns airing more television ads before Independence Day than they usually run in the Old Dominion in October, they're already at the point of running point-counterpoint attack radio ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, Virginians have seen more of Obama and McCain than they saw of major party candidates in any race in at least a generation. Both of them made a pitch Thursday in the state's richest trove of swing voters, the Washington, D.C. suburbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the anonymous but crucial work of door-to-door voter contact enjoys more panache this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richmond Mayor Doug Wilder, who became the nation's first elected black governor in 1990, inaugurated the Democratic voter registration effort Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama goal is to register 151,000 new voters by the Oct. 6 deadline. It's a follow-up on the 23,500 new registrations in the two weeks before the deadline for the February primary, most of them young first-time voters smitten with Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incentive for volunteers to hit the streets in the summer swelter to register voters is the chance to meet the Democratic nominee. Sign up 100 or more for Obama's campaign and you're eligible for a lottery to select five volunteers who get to schmooze with the Illinois senator, said campaign spokesman Kevin Griffis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans know the value of door-knocking. Legions of organized loyalists walking neighborhoods were been important in keeping Virginia voting Republican in every presidential race since 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've always done what they're doing, but I guess not with all the advertising and glitz,&quot; said Del. Chris Saxman, R-Staunton and one of four Virginia co-chairmen for McCain's campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of this goes on anyway. Maybe it just seems new because we're getting presidential campaign visits when previously we had not,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Obama have ads dueling on statewide television. They've largely been ads in which each candidate defines himself on his own terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's already bare-knuckle on the radio. A Republican National Committee radio ad accuses Obama of supporting a bill to boost taxes on people who make as little as $32,000 a year. An Obama campaign rebuttal ad cries foul and and ties McCain to unpopular GOP icons: &quot;Bush, McCain, Karl Rove that's how those guys work,&quot; a woman mews in the 60-second radio spot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hampton Roads voters, particularly veterans, are being targeted by a pair of television ad campaigns designed to rekindle the national debate over the future of the U.S. mission in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vets for Freedom, a 2-year-old group that claims membership of 25,000 veterans nationwide, on Wednesday launched a five-state, $1.5 million ad effort that attacks the positions taken by Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama on the Iraq war. It argues that the next president should &quot;finish the job&quot; in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AFL-CIO, the organized labor powerhouse that has been a player in national political campaigns for decades, said Wednesday it will begin airing an ad in Virginia and five other states today that attacks Republican candidate Sen. John McCain's support for the Bush administration's war policies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-second television spot produced by Vets for Freedom is the forerunner of what the group expects to be a national campaign that will cost in excess of $10 million, said Pete Hegseth, the group's chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the effort, including promotions on talk-radio programs, mailings and grassroots organizing, will be focused in 12 states, Hegseth said, particularly areas with large numbers of veterans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Virginia, the group's current ad is running in Hampton Roads and the Washington suburbs. The group is spending only $76,000 on air time in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vets for Freedom's efforts are being fueled by donations from thousands of people nationwide, Hegseth said. He said the group will not release donors' names nor the size of their donations. The group is registered under a section of federal tax law that allows it to advertise and organize on behalf of particular policies while maintaining the confidentiality of its donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donations to political campaigns or political action committees, by contrast, generally must be reported and are limited by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to have to print out names of thousands of Americans for everyone to dish through. ... We've been very straightforward with our donors - that if they give, their names aren't disclosed,&quot; Hegseth said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Weissman, associate director of the Campaign Finance Institute at George Washington University, said a growing number of issue activists are using the tax provision to shield their donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups risk losing their tax-exempt status if they engage in advocacy on behalf of or against a specific candidate, Weissman said. But if the groups direct their advocacy to particular policies, donors &quot;can influence an election without anyone knowing who is doing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groups including Planned Parenthood and the National Rifle Association have used the tax provision for years, Weissman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Vets for Freedom commercial does not mention any candidate, but its upbeat view of the security situation in Iraq closely tracks that of Republicans such as U.S. Rep. Thelma Drake of Norfolk, who is being challenged this fall by Democrat Glenn Nye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial features veterans proclaiming the success of the troop surge into Iraq that began last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Casualties are at an all-time low. Al-Qaida in Iraq is decimated. ... We changed strategy in Iraq and the surge worked. Now that's change we can believe in,&quot; the vets argue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad's punch line is an echo of Obama's campaign slogan. Its use seems likely to rekindle questions about Vets for Freedom's connections to the McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Hegseth stressed the group's non partisanship and noted that its political action arm has endorsed several Democrats, he has acknowledged in the past that its pro-surge views parallel McCain's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vets for Freedom also operates a political action committee that attacked Obama directly this spring over his failure to visit Iraq since January 2006, before the surge began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama opposed the surge and has promised to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq within 16 months of his election. Hegseth stressed repeatedly Wednesday that Vets for Freedom opposes such timelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of McCain's most prominent supporters and occasional surrogates, Sens. Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., gave up positions on Vets for Freedom's advisory board last month because their involvement violated the McCain campaign's conflict-of-interest guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Vets for Freedom ads avoid mentioning Obama, the AFL-CIO, which operates under different legal restrictions, has endorsed the Democrat and goes after McCain aggressively in its new commercial. The union has pledged to spend up to $50&nbsp;million to aid Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every vet respects John McCain's war record,&quot; Navy vet Jim Wasser says in the ad. &quot;It's his record in the Senate that I have a problem with.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) once said economics was not his strong suit -- and yesterday Social Security became a problem for the presumptive Republican nominee as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In remarks at a town hall meeting in Denver on Monday, McCain laid out what he likes to call &quot;a little straight talk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Americans have got to understand that we are paying present-day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in America today. And that's a disgrace. It's an absolute disgrace, and it's got to be fixed,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaction to McCain's statement was slow to build, but fiery when at last it came yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I don't understand is why reporters don't ask: If Senator McCain doesn't want payroll taxes to fund Social Security (as has long been the case), then how does he propose to pay for it?&quot; Reed Hundt, former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and a supporter of Barack Obama, said on the Talking Points Memo blog. And the Democratic National Committee convened a conference call with a union leader and liberal economist to blast McCain's comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain sought to clarify his remarks yesterday afternoon on the Straight Talk Express. Young people, he said, &quot;are paying so much that they are paying into a system that they won't receive benefits from on its present track that it's on -- that's the point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Social Security trustees &quot;have clearly stated it's going to go bankrupt,&quot; he said, adding that this is what he meant when he called the system a disgrace. &quot;I don't think that's right,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think it's fair, and I think it's terrible to ask people to pay in to a system that they won't receive benefits from. That's why we have to fix it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Jonathan Weisman and Michael D. Shear <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">MCCAIN'S SENATE RECORD TARGETED </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">New Battleground Ads From AFL-CIO </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AFL-CIO will launch television ads today in six battleground states that take aim at separating John McCain's military service from his Senate record. The commercials' release is timed to coincide with the launch of the AFL-CIO Veterans Council -- a group designed to communicate with the more than 2 million union veterans and those serving in the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every vet respects John McCain's war record,&quot; Jim Wasser, a Navy veteran who saw combat in Vietnam, says in one of the spots. &quot;It's his record in the Senate that I have a problem with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wasser goes on to detail McCain's support for spending $10 billion a month in Iraq, &quot;just like Bush,&quot; and adds that he sided with the president &quot;against increasing health benefits for veterans.&quot; As Wasser utters those words, a picture of a person who lost both legs is shown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People should let John McCain know,&quot; Wasser says at the ad's end. &quot;His agenda is not what we need. Not now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads will run on stations in Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin for the next three weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our nation's veterans deserve much better than the failed Bush economy has given them,&quot; AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said of the new ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AFL-CIO would not disclose the amount being spent on the buy, only that it is a &quot;significant targeted buy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain began a television advertisement in Virginia and nine other battleground states yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ad refers to McCain's captivity in North Vietnam for 5 1/2 years during the Vietnam War. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also shows the Arizona Republican on Capitol Hill and describes him as a maverick who put the country before his political party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesman for McCain's Democratic rival, Sen. Barack Obama, said the ad shows McCain is worried about carrying Virginia, which hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 44 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trey Walker, regional campaign manager for McCain, said, &quot;Senator McCain always intended to run a very strong campaign in Virginia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest poll showed Obama with a slight lead in Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama has run two TV ads in Virginia already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four years ago, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry advertised in Virginia early but pulled out of the state in early October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Bush, who did not spend any money on media in Virginia, won the state by almost 8 percentage points in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the McCain campaign declined to divulge its media strategy, Democrats monitoring ad buys said the McCain ad is running on broadcast TV in the Richmond, Roanoke, Norfolk and Tri-Cities areas. It also is on national cable TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ad also is running in Iowa, Michigan, Colorado, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All are expected to be closely contested states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its closing line: &quot;Don't 'hope' for a better life. Vote for one. McCain&quot; is an indirect dig at one of Obama's central campaign themes - that he offers the hope of change.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also shows the Arizona Republican on Capitol Hill and describes him as a maverick who put the country before his political party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for McCain's Democratic rival, Sen. Barack Obama, said the ad shows McCain is worried about carrying Virginia, which hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 44 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trey Walker, regional campaign manager for McCain, said, &quot;Senator McCain always intended to run a very strong campaign in Virginia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest poll showed Obama with a slight lead in Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has run two TV ads in Virginia already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry advertised in Virginia early but pulled out of the state in early October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush, who did not spend any money on media in Virginia, won the state by almost 8 percentage points in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the McCain campaign declined to divulge its media strategy, Democrats monitoring ad buys said the McCain&nbsp;ad is running on broadcast TV in the Richmond, Roanoke, Norfolk and Tri-Cities areas. It also is on national cable TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad also is running in Iowa, Michigan, Colorado, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All are expected to be closely contested states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its closing line: &quot;Don't 'hope' for a better life. Vote for one. McCain&quot; is an indirect dig at one of Obama's central campaign themes -- that he offers the hope of change.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">POWDER SPRINGS, Ga., July 8</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Sen. Barack Obama on Tuesday dismissed criticism that he is abandoning his principles to move toward the political center, saying he has been consistent in embracing moderate views on several issues, especially his belief that pulling U.S. troops out of Iraq must be done &quot;carefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama addressed what he called &quot;this whole notion that I am shifting to the center, or that I am flip-flopping,&quot; with a firm denial that he has tilted his emphasis away from swiftly bringing the war to an end. &quot;Don't be confused: I am going to bring the Iraq war to a close when I am president of the United States of America,&quot; Obama said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remarks came as both candidates scrambled to clarify their visions for Iraq in the face of changing events on the ground. Sen. John McCain, who has repeatedly derided calls for a timetable for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, suddenly found himself confronted with the American-backed Iraqi leadership raising the prospect of exactly that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time, Iraqi President Nouri al-Maliki said Monday in a statement that the two countries should consider deciding the future of U.S. troops with &quot;a memorandum of understanding to put a timetable on their withdrawal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, McCain's top foreign policy adviser declined to criticize Maliki, and his campaign sought to portray those comments as consistent with the Republican nominee's long-standing position. &quot;Senator McCain has always said that conditions on the ground -- including the security threats posed by extremists and terrorists, and the ability of Iraqi forces to meet those threats -- would be key determinants in U.S. force levels,&quot; senior adviser Randy Scheunemann said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain continued to express confidence that any withdrawal would come after victory in Iraq. Campaigning in Pittsburgh on Tuesday, he told reporters he is &quot;confident&quot; that Maliki's decision-making &quot;will be directly related to the situation on the ground, just as they have always said. And since we are succeeding and then I am convinced, as I have said before, we can withdraw and withdraw with honor, not according to a set timetable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their party nominations in hand, Obama and McCain have calibrated their firm stands on Iraq to adapt to changing events on the ground, namely a post-&quot;surge&quot; reduction in violence, to target a more centrist audience. Obama plans to visit Baghdad in the weeks ahead, and will be eager to demonstrate a facility with the complexities there without succumbing to the &quot;flip-flop&quot; charge that dogged Democratic nominee Sen. John F. Kerry four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maliki's comments suggest that there are trapdoors for McCain on Iraq as well. In speeches, town hall meetings, interviews and campaign commercials, he has said a timetable would provide terrorists the knowledge of how long they have to wait until U.S. troops are gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has repeatedly said that setting a date for withdrawal would lead to &quot;chaos, genocide and we will be back with greater sacrifice.&quot; And he accused both Obama and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of endangering Americans by advocating a specific timetable for withdrawal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be an unconscionable act of betrayal, a stain on our character as a great nation, if we were to walk away from the Iraqi people and consign them to the horrendous violence, ethnic cleansing and possibly genocide that would follow a reckless, irresponsible and premature withdrawal,&quot; he said in a California speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama made his remarks in response to a question at a town hall meeting from a self-declared &quot;reformed Republican&quot; who sympathetically encouraged the senator to set the record straight on his Iraq position. Obama spent most of last week explaining his remark that he would &quot;continue to refine&quot; his Iraq proposals -- which was widely interpreted as a softening of his promise to end the war and as a general-election shift to the center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, egged on by a raucous audience, said on Tuesday that he has always held centrist views -- not only on Iraq but also on faith and what he called &quot;personal responsibility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people who say this apparently haven't been listening to me,&quot; he said. &quot;And, I have to say, some of them are my friends on the left and some of the media. I am somebody who is no doubt progressive.&quot; He listed issues in which he views himself as progressive -- on providing universal health-care coverage, increased teacher pay -- then said that on other matters, he believes in thinking more creatively about nongovernmental solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Iraq, Obama declared unequivocally his commitment to withdrawal. And he said that he has always advocated caution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have also consistently said, once we were in, we had to be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in, because once you get in you've got to make sure our troops are safe,&quot; he said. &quot;You've got to make sure the country doesn't collapse, so what I've called for is a phased withdrawal, a phased redeployment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He continued: &quot;Now, assuming that I take office in January, then that means that we would still have our troops there for about two more years from now. There's nothing rushed about that. . . . When I hear John McCain saying we can't surrender, we can't wave the white flag -- nobody's talking about surrender. We're talking about common sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said: &quot;I am going to bring this war to an end.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using the now-famous footage of Sen. John McCain hugging President Bush, Sen. Barack Obama launched new ads in four battleground states, arguing that the Arizona Republican represents more of the same on energy policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On gas prices, John McCain is part of the problem,&quot; says the ad's narrator, adding that McCain voted with the current president 95 percent of the time -- echoing an attack used to great effect against Republican incumbents during the 2006 midterm elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, according to the ad, will &quot;make energy independence an urgent priority&quot; with a &quot;real plan&quot; and &quot;new energy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad is a response to a commercial begun this week by the Republican National Committee's independent expenditure arm that casts Obama as a rubber stamp for the Democratic party line on energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He just says no to lower gas taxes. . . . No to nuclear. . . . No to more production,&quot; the narrator says before concluding: &quot;No new solutions. Barack Obama: Just the party line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both ads are running in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama today launched the first attack ad from either campaign in this election, which follows a string of calculating position changes proving that Barack Obama's commitment to a new type of politics is officially over,&quot; McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who know them say they once shared a genuine affection for each other, born in large part from their shared experiences serving in the Vietnam War and their work together in the early 1990s on a Senate committee investigating the fate of prisoners of war and of those missing in action during the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was not a light, collegial Senate friendship,&quot; said a friend of Sen. John F. Kerry, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss Kerry and his relationship with Sen. John McCain. Kerry and McCain &quot;went through the wringer together. . . . They talked openly about having healed the old wounds and the old divisions about Vietnam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago, Kerry considered offering the Republican the opportunity to be his vice presidential running mate on the Democratic ticket. But since then, their relationship has gradually deteriorated, and on Sunday, it reached a new low. Appearing on a news show, the senator from Massachusetts lambasted the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for what he called a lack of judgment about the war in Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;has proven that he has been wrong about every judgment he's made about the war,&quot; Kerry said, adding: &quot;Wrong about the Iraqis paying for the reconstruction, wrong about whether or not the oil would pay for it, wrong about Sunni and Shia violence through the years, wrong about the willingness of the Iraqis to stand up for themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry insists that the senator from Arizona is &quot;my friend and will always be my friend&quot; but says that the person he considered for vice president in 2004 was a &quot;very different John McCain.&quot; Kerry cites McCain's policy shifts on tax cuts, the treatment of detainees and the regulation of greenhouse-gas emissions, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, through his aides, let it be known that he has no interest in talking about his relationship with Kerry. But Mark Salter, McCain's longtime chief of staff, rejected the idea of any tension between the two men. &quot;If Senator Kerry is saying there was some kind of falling-out,&quot; he said, &quot;he's inventing an excuse to justify the difference in their behavior to each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one time the relationship was unusual for two senators from opposing parties. When Kerry faced an extremely tough reelection race in 1996 against Republican Gov. William F. Weld, McCain opted not to campaign against his Democratic friend. Four years later, when McCain was running for president, Kerry returned the favor by organizing Senate combat veterans to defend McCain from criticism of his record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, many Democratic insiders thought a Kerry-McCain ticket would be a slam-dunk winner. And yet even as Kerry, a decorated Navy combat veteran, and McCain, a former Navy pilot and prisoner of war, seemed on the verge of making that happen, a rupture occurred and set the stage for everything that followed. But exactly what happened remains a matter of debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the Kerry perspective, McCain had expressed genuine interest in the vice presidential nomination and then pulled away without warning, and while doing so leaked the story to the media to &quot;put McCain in the best possible light,&quot; a Kerry friend recounted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the McCain perspective, Kerry was overly optimistic about the possibility of McCain joining him on the Democratic ticket. &quot;Kerry convinced himself that he could convince McCain to be on the ticket,&quot; said one GOP strategist familiar with the discussions. &quot;When that didn't happen, he took it really personally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry insists that the miscommunication about his conversations with McCain was the fault of staff members and not the two senators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought it was unfortunate that some people in his staff saw fit to leak someone's point of view which did not accurately reflect our personal conversations,&quot; Kerry said. &quot;We never got to a serious point. We moved on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the vice presidential offer/non-offer strained Kerry and McCain's relationship, the ad that the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ran during the 2004 campaign attacking Kerry's military record threatened to end it entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain quickly spoke out against the ad, calling it &quot;dishonest&quot; and &quot;dishonorable&quot; and comparing it to the criticism of his military service during the 2000 presidential primaries. But he did not allow Kerry to use his image in rebuttal ads -- a decision that many Kerry supporters viewed as insufficient payback for Kerry's support of McCain in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain pretty thoroughly revealed his character when he refused to defend his Vietnam 'brother' from the slimy Swift boaters,&quot; said Jim Jordan, who managed Kerry's presidential bid for much of 2003. &quot;McCain's second campaign for the Republican nomination and his support for more U.S. troops in Iraq added to the strain. As the senator from Arizona grew more and more strident about increasing troop levels and about the danger of setting timetables for the withdrawal of U.S. forces, Kerry emerged as a leading voice in favor of beginning a drawdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In describing his differences with McCain over the handling of Iraq, Kerry repeatedly invokes Sens. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) and James Webb (D-Va.) -- two other senators who served in Vietnam and see the current conflict far more like Kerry does than McCain does. &quot;They oppose him on the war and think he's dead wrong,&quot; Kerry said. &quot;They oppose his judgment on the GI Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Kerry insisted that he and McCain still share the &quot;bond of service that never goes away,&quot; it is clear that he thinks McCain has made a colossal misjudgment about Iraq -- a decision that has distanced him from the other senators who have served in the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Kerry's willingness to serve as the lead attack dog for Sen. Barack Obama, McCain's Democratic rival for the presidency, against McCain's policies on Iraq and national security is the clearest sign yet that the close kinship that once existed between the two men is gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry described McCain as &quot;unbelievably out of touch&quot; and &quot;confused&quot; after the Republican said, &quot;That's not too important,&quot; in response to a question about when U.S. troops might return from Iraq. In late June, when retired Army Col. George &quot;Bud&quot; Day, who was involved in the Swift boat group's effort, was part of a conference call defending McCain's military record, Kerry called on McCain to condemn the remarks and cut ties with Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Reilly, a longtime Democratic pollster and Kerry adviser, insisted that the same traits that drew Kerry and McCain together -- shared service and commitment to country -- are what have driven a wedge between them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will always be a bond there, because they're veterans and because they went through the POW investigation together, but the same intensity of their feelings as veterans which brought them together has pushed them apart on two big policy areas this election,&quot; Reilly said. &quot;They took away very different lessons.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The waiters were still clearing the breakfast dishes yesterday when John McCain's most prominent adviser raised the subject of erection enhancement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief who is now the Republican National Committee's &quot;Victory Chairman,&quot; was discussing consumer-driven health insurance at a breakfast with reporters when she proposed &quot;a real, live example which I've been hearing a lot about from women: There are many health insurance plans that will cover Viagra but won't cover birth-control medication. Those women would like a choice.&quot; For effect, the woman frequently mentioned as a possible McCain running mate repeated: &quot;Those women would like a choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silence filled the meeting room at the St. Regis Hotel. &quot;I don't know where I go after that,&quot; said the moderator, Dave Cook of the Christian Science Monitor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fiorina's brazen breakfast talk demonstrated why she'd be such a risky running mate for McCain -- and yet also, potentially, the most rewarding of his options. She's the most prominent and visible of the women believed to be under consideration for the vice presidency, and her attributes are many: a woman who could appeal to disaffected Hillary Clinton supporters; a corporate hotshot to balance the &quot;economy-is-not-my-strong-suit&quot; McCain; and an outsider untainted by President Bush, Washington and politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, she's unvetted and untested, as her breakfast conversation demonstrated anew (religious conservatives frown on Viagra-and-contraceptives talk) that she's new to the game. Her controversial tenure at HP, which fired her in 2005, could also be mined by foes. &quot;Too risky,&quot; political handicapper Stu Rothenberg judged in Roll Call last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, it could come down to whether McCain, now trailing Barack Obama by half a dozen points in the polls, decides he needs to roll the dice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fiorina, for her part, couldn't be any more plain about her vice presidential ambitions without taking out an ad. &quot;I've been advocating on his behalf for about a year,&quot; she told the 30 reporters at the breakfast after USA Today's Susan Page asked the running-mate question. &quot;I've spent the last three-plus years getting involved in a variety of issues in a variety of government departments, whether it's the Defense Department or the Central Intelligence Agency or the State Department. . . . There are things that government can borrow and learn from business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another reporter, who must have been in the men's room for the answer to Page's question, asked Fiorina if she would consider the vice presidency. &quot;One of the great things about my life right now is I have lots of options and lots of opportunities,&quot; she said, &quot;and I have learned that if you're open to options and opportunities, the future tends to take care of itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barely an answer went by without a reference to her past in the executive suite. McCain's staff shake-up? &quot;As someone who's managed a lot of people, one of the most important jobs you have is to put the right players on the field in the right positions,&quot; she said. Obama's superior fundraising? &quot;I'm a business person. Trends matter to me, and the trendline for Barack Obama is down.&quot; McCain's plan to control big executive payouts? &quot;I voluntarily gave up the contract that I was given when I arrived at Hewlett-Packard so my pay could be put to a shareholder vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are delicate matters for Fiorina. When she was forced out at HP, it was because her acquisition of Compaq was going badly and the company's stock price had fallen. Fiorina still managed to leave with an eight-figure severance package. That, and the job cuts she  ordered, wouldn't look good in a political ad. But now HP has passed Dell as the No. 1 laptop maker, and the Compaq merger has become a success. Fiorina has published her memoirs, appeared opposite both Bob Schieffer and George Stephanopoulos, and convinced  the conservative magazine Human Events that having her as the vice presidential nominee could be &quot;a significant step in the right direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fiorina arrived early for her breakfast meeting with reporters, giving Lynn Sweet of the Chicago Sun-Times the chance to get some laptop advice. Tall and fashionable in a jacket popping with green and yellow spheres, Fiorina wore a heavy Gothic cross on a long chain around her neck. Moderator Cook cited her various credentials: first woman to lead a Fortune 20 company, degrees from Stanford and MIT, and junior high in London at the &quot;Channing School for Select Young Ladies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former chief executive seemed comfortable at the boardroom-type table, resting her cheek on her fist as she listened to questions and leaning forward, elbows on table, to answer. Like McCain, she broke from Republican orthodoxy, talking up the need to fight climate change and asserting that Bush was &quot;wrong&quot; about Iraq before McCain talked him into the surge. Best of all, Fiorina seemed always to have a bit of corporate jargon to fill any hole reporters found in McCain's candidacy. On his multiple staff restructurings: &quot;Like a start-up company becoming a multimillion-dollar corporation, you have to add new skills and capabilities.&quot; On McCain's budget plan: &quot;Business does that all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aspiring politician was easily tripped up while challenging Obama's tax plan and defending McCain's health-care policy. The questions about her political ambitions caused her to fiddle with her watchband and utter a forced chuckle. Then there was the Viagra moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these were minor defects for this product of the &quot;Channing School for Select Young Ladies.&quot; In her marketing campaign for a spot on McCain's ticket, Fiorina is meeting benchmarks, her processes are within tolerance, and her business plan remains on course.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> GOP ATTACK ADS </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">Republicans Look for Edge On Environmental Issues </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Republican National Committee began running ads over the weekend that question Sen. Barack Obama's commitment to energy reform, the first major ad buy by either party in the presidential race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Record gas prices, a climate in crisis,&quot; says the ad's narrator. &quot;John McCain says solve it now.&quot; The spot then details McCain's &quot;balanced&quot; plan on energy and notes that the senator from Arizona is &quot;pushing his own party to face climate change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, it accuses, says nothing but no when it comes to addressing the energy problems the country is facing. &quot;He just says no to lower gas taxes . . . no to nuclear . . . no to more production,&quot; says the narrator before concluding: &quot;No new solutions. Barack Obama: Just the party line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads are running in four key battleground states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio. They were produced by a newly formed independent-expenditure arm of the RNC run by Brad Todd, a GOP media consultant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advertising effort is an attempt to exploit a rare -- and significant -- financial edge for Republicans. At the end of May, the RNC had $53.5 million in the bank while the Democratic National Committee had just $3.9 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Obama opting out of public financing for the general election and his team taking over the DNC, that financial gap won't exist for long, so Republicans are exploiting it as quickly as they can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial Obama response? A stunned skepticism. &quot;What we need to solve our energy crisis is an honest debate about the choices before us, not more attack ads that mislead voters about the facts,&quot; said Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Chris Cillizza <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">NO LONGER A FAN </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">Kerry Critical of McCain's Calls on the War in Iraq </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) might have flirted in 2004 with the idea of enlisting his Republican colleague John McCain as his running mate, but he sounded distinctly less enthusiastic about the senator yesterday on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry, who is a strong supporter of Sen. Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said that McCain &quot;has proven that he has been wrong about every judgment he's made about the war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wrong about the Iraqis paying for the reconstruction, wrong about whether or not the oil would pay for it, wrong about Sunni and Shia violence through the years, wrong about the willingness of the Iraqis to stand up for themselves,&quot; Kerry added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said that Kerry was ignoring the facts on the ground in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The truth is Barack Obama buckled to liberal supporters and opposed the McCain-backed 'surge' strategy that's working today, and despite our troops' gains in Iraq, he still maintains his partisan commitment to begin immediate withdrawal of American forces if he's elected,&quot; Bounds wrote in an e-mail. &quot;Only John Kerry would think that demonstrates good judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans are starting a TV offensive in battleground states to say Sen. Barack Obama is ignoring energy solutions, as both presidential candidates prepare for a weeklong campaign focus on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee is airing an ad that says the party's presumptive nominee, Sen. John McCain, has a &quot;balanced plan&quot; to address record-high gas prices and environmental concerns and that the senator from Arizona is &quot;pushing his own party to face climate change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Barack Obama? For conservation, but he just says no to lower gas taxes. No to nuclear. No to more production. No new solutions,&quot; a narrator says. &quot;Barack Obama: just the party line.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spot will run in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Both parties have identified these states as critical battlegrounds for the Nov. 4 general election, and both candidates have made multiple visits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RNC plans to spend about $3 million onthe ad, its first that targets Mr. Obama, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Obama campaign spokesman labeled the ad an &quot;attack&quot; and said the energy crisis can be solved only through honest debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a real choice in this election between John McCain's promise to continue the Bush approach of trying to drill our way out of our energy crisis - which even he admits won't lower prices this summer - or Barack Obama's plan to provide meaningful short-term relief for our families and to make a historic investment in alternative energy development that will create millions of new jobs, keep the cost of energy affordable and secure our energy independence once and for all,&quot; Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican ad accuses Mr. Obama of saying &quot;no to nuclear,&quot; though the senator from Illinois has been criticized by environmentalists for his qualified past support for nuclear power. Mr. Obama has panned Mr. McCain's proposal for 45 new nuclear reactors by 2030.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RNC cites a December campaign stop in Newton, Iowa, where Mr. Obama told voters, &quot;I am not a nuclear energy proponent.&quot; A recent McCain Web ad used a longer version of the same remark while arguing that Mr. Obama says &quot;no&quot; to &quot;clean, safe nuclear energy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both ads omit the context of the remark, which Mr. Obama made in response to a young caucus participant who told the Democrat that she was &quot;still concerned&quot; about his support for nuclear power given its safety risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I start off with the premise that nuclear energy is not optimal. I am not a nuclear energy proponent,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;I have not ruled out nuclear as part of that package but only so far as it is clean and safe. I have the same attitude with respect to coal. We've got to try everything to see what works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said that until the nation can solve safety and storage issues and &quot;can produce clean, safe energy without enormous subsidies from the U.S. government, I don't think that's the best option. I am much more interested in solar and wind and biodiesel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a meeting with Democratic governors last month, Mr. Obama said nuclear power is not a &quot;panacea&quot; for the energy crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain also said his energy policy would include a mix of alternative sources along with offshore oil drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic National Committee, lagging the RNC in fundraising, has been producing Web ads targeting Mr. McCain on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest, titled &quot;Jobs First,&quot; attempts to link Mr. McCain with President Bush. It features both the president and Mr. McCain saying the &quot;fundamentals&quot; of the nation's economy &quot;are strong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign issued a memo arguing that the two Republicans make similar points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Mr. McCain will hold a town hall meeting in Denver on job creation while Mr. Obama campaigns in Charlotte, N.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest of the week, Mr. Obama will make stops in Georgia, Ohio and Virginia as part of a weeklong economic focus in states that Mr. Bush carried in 2004.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With campaign staffs on the ground and television commercials under way, the presumptive major-party presidential nominees have begun to discuss issues that may be of particular interest to Virginia voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Richmond Times-Dispatch asked Richmond-area residents what issues they wanted the candidates to focus on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Answers included high gas prices, the war in Iraq and the economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taking note of the high gasoline prices, Republican John McCain has changed his position and now wants to allow oil companies to drill off the nation's coasts, if the affected states approve. Federal officials estimate as much as 3 billion barrels of oil lie underground 50 miles off the coasts of Virginia, Delaware and North Carolina. There is a federal moratorium on drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have trillions of dollars worth of oil and gas reserves in the U.S. at a time we are exporting hundreds of billions of dollars a year overseas to buy energy,&quot; the Arizona senator says on his Web site, www.JohnMcCain.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On www.BarackObama.com, the Democratic senator from Illinois says this is &quot;a gimmick&quot; that will &quot;grow our addiction further.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has proposed higher fuel standards for cars and investing $150 billion over the next 10 years in alternative sources of energy, such as wind power, solar power and advanced biofuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He wants to tax excess profits of oil companies and use the money to help families pay their energy bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain also wants to invest in alternative-energy sources and proposes building 45 nuclear power plants. He opposes subsidies for corn-based ethanol and tariffs on imported ethanol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two candidates remain divided on the Iraq war. Although he says mistakes have been made in the implementation of the war, McCain has been in favor of the war. He was one of the foremost proponents of the military surge. The surge is working and Obama should acknowledge this, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama opposed the Iraq war from the beginning but was not in the U.S. Senate when the war began and did not have to vote on the military action. He has called for withdrawing American troops, a brigade or two a month, within 16 months. He would not build permanent bases in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain has said troops may have to be kept in Iraq for years. There should be only limited withdrawals until the country is stabilized, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both senators voted for the recent legislation extending the GI Bill to veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, although McCain initially had reservations because he thought it would encourage personnel to leave the military service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Virginia has one of the largest military presences in the country. Both candidates want to expand the size of the military but do not specify by how much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here's how the two candidates stand on other issues:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The economy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Virginia's economy, buoyed by defense spending, has remained better than the national economy. The unemployment rate is one of the lowest in the nation. There have been about 4,800 foreclosures, well below the national average.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama: He wants to cut income taxes by $1,000 for working families to offset the Social Security tax. He wants another economic stimulus package, with new tax relief of $300 per family. He would establish a $10 billion foreclosure-prevention fund to help homeowners facing the loss of their homes. He would eliminate the income tax for all seniors making less than $50,000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain: He would double the personal tax exemption for each dependent from $3,500 to $7,000. He wants to extend President Bush's tax cuts, which are scheduled to expire in 2010. He would create a new mortgage plan to allow hard-pressed homeowners to retire the existing loan and replace it with a loan guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration. He would reduce the federal corporate income tax from 35 percent to 25 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Education</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama: He wants to expand preschool and Head Start funding and reform No Child Left Behind by fully funding the program. In higher education, he would create the opportunity tax credit to ensure that the first $4,000 of a college education is free for most Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain: He believes parents should be allowed to choose where their children go to school. He thinks all federal financial support should be predicated on providing parents the ability to move their children from failing schools. He does not address higher education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Earmarks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama: He believes in full disclosure of earmarks. In his first three years in the Senate he proposed $740 million in earmarks, of which about one-third were approved. The biggest program was $10 million for a military arsenal at Rock Island, Ill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain: He has never sought earmarks and would veto them if elected.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With campaign staffs on the ground and television commercials under way, the presumptive major-party presidential nominees have begun to discuss issues that may be of particular interest to Virginia voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Richmond Times-Dispatch asked Richmond-area residents what issues they wanted the candidates to focus on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answers included high gas prices, the war in Iraq and the economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking note of the high gasoline prices, Republican John McCain has changed his position and now wants to allow oil companies to drill off the nation's coasts, if the affected states approve. Federal officials estimate as much as 3 billion barrels of oil lie underground 50 miles off the coasts of Virginia, Delaware and North Carolina. There is a federal moratorium on drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have trillions of dollars worth of oil and gas reserves in the U.S. at a time we are exporting hundreds of billions of dollars a year overseas to buy energy,&quot; the Arizona senator says on his Web site, www.JohnMcCain.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On www.BarackObama.com, the Democratic senator from Illinois says this is &quot;a gimmick&quot; that will &quot;grow our addiction further.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has proposed higher fuel standards for cars and investing $150 billion over the next 10 years in alternative sources of energy, such as wind power, solar power and advanced biofuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wants to tax excess profits of oil companies and use the money to help families pay their energy bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also wants to invest in alternative-energy sources and proposes building 45 nuclear power plants. He opposes subsidies for corn-based ethanol and tariffs on imported ethanol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two candidates remain divided on the Iraq war. Although he says mistakes have been made in the implementation of the war, McCain has been in favor of the war. He was one of the foremost proponents of the military surge. The surge is working and Obama should acknowledge this, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama opposed the Iraq war from the beginning but was not in the U.S. Senate when the war began and did not have to vote on the military action. He has called for withdrawing American troops, a brigade or two a month, within 16 months. He would not build permanent bases in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has said troops may have to be kept in Iraq for years. There should be only limited withdrawals until the country is stabilized, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both senators voted for the recent legislation extending the GI Bill to veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, although McCain initially had reservations because he thought it would encourage personnel to leave the military service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia has one of the largest military presences in the country. Both candidates want to expand the size of the military but do not specify by how much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's how the two candidates stand on other issues:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--The economy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia's economy, buoyed by defense spending, has remained better than the national economy. The unemployment rate is one of the lowest in the nation. There have been about 4,800 foreclosures, well below the national average.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: He wants to cut income taxes by $1,000 for working families to offset the Social Security tax. He wants another economic stimulus package, with new tax relief of $300 per family. He would establish a $10 billion foreclosure-prevention fund to help homeowners facing the loss of their homes. He would eliminate the income tax for all seniors making less than $50,000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: He would double the personal tax exemption for each dependent from $3,500 to $7,000. He wants to extend President Bush's tax cuts, which are scheduled to expire in 2010. He would create a new mortgage plan to allow hard-pressed homeowners to retire the existing loan and replace it with a loan guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration. He would reduce the federal corporate income tax from 35 percent to 25 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--Education</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: He wants to expand preschool and Head Start funding and reform No Child Left Behind by fully funding the program. In higher education, he would create the opportunity tax credit to ensure that the first $4,000 of a college education is free for most Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: He believes parents should be allowed to choose where their children go to school. He thinks all federal financial support should be predicated on providing parents the ability to move their children from failing schools. He does not address higher education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--Earmarks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: He believes in full disclosure of earmarks. In his first three years in the Senate he proposed $740 million in earmarks, of which about one-third were approved. The biggest program was $10 million for a military arsenal at Rock Island, Ill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: He has never sought earmarks and would veto them if elected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential candidate needed to prove beyond a doubt that he loved his country and could appeal to a wide range of skeptical voters. So he wrapped himself in red, white and blue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, not Sen. Barack Obama, who took to a flag-adorned stage to orate on patriotism last week. The candidate in question was William McKinley, whose campaign manager, Mark Hanna, draped the Civil War veteran in the Stars and Stripes during the presidential election of 1896. In McKinley's contest against Democrat William Jennings Bryan, the Republicans handed out hundreds of thousands of flags at rallies across the country. Hanna's &quot;Patriotic Heroes Battalion,&quot; a group led by revered Civil War generals, toured the Midwest and West aboard a train bedecked with oceans of bunting. At countless stops, campaign workers unfurled the Stars and Stripes on two 30-foot, collapsible flagpoles that sat atop one of the train's flatcars. It was a veritable Patriotism Express. And it worked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American flag has been used by virtually every candidate in every presidential election since then. But the tactic was relatively novel in McKinley's day; before 1861, it was almost unheard of for individual Americans to fly the flag. Today, wherever we see a would-be officeholder, we also see a sea of flags, as well as audiences sporting T-shirts, baseball caps, earrings and halter tops in red, white and blue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flag is everywhere -- everywhere it was never really supposed to be. It's difficult to believe that our founding fathers envisioned the flag being reproduced on any commercial product, much less a beer cozy, a beach towel or a grill-ready apron. Even the lapel pin, a small piece of patriotic accessorizing that has been granted outsize importance in the current presidential campaign, can technically be interpreted as a violation of the United States Flag Code -- the oft-misquoted, mostly misunderstood and sometimes confusing series of detailed guidelines for the proper use of the American flag. (It frowns on any item of commercial merchandise upon which is &quot;printed, painted, attached, or otherwise placed&quot; a representation of the flag.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what exactly does this overabundance of flag-embossed merchandise mean -- for our campaigns and our culture? There is something off-kilter about revering the ideals that our flag embodies, attempting to ban its destruction, then using it as a political club or sitting down in a flag-patterned lawn chair, tucking into red-white-and-blue-frosted cupcakes and dabbing our mouths with a Stars and Stripes napkin. Does the flag embody American idealism, American cynicism or American comfort? Which values, precisely, have captured our flag?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The history of the cultural meaning of the American flag doesn't do much to answer this sticky question. The first flag-protection laws in the early 1890s tried to stem the burgeoning use of the flag's image in advertising and on countless commercial products. But those measures also served to outlaw what could only be described as well-meaning patriotic displays -- not a good thing. On the other hand, there's something disingenuous and patronizing about using displays of huge flags to lure in customers at car dealerships, and advertisers' propensity for creating flag-bedecked newspaper ads every Presidents' Day, Memorial Day, Fourth of July and Veterans Day -- not to mention their ubiquity as campaign-stop backdrops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Flag Code was supposed to prevent this patriotism-drenched hucksterism. It was drawn up at the first National Flag Conference in Washington in 1923, a meeting convened by the American Legion to take the dozens of different flag codes used by the military services, veterans' groups, patriotic societies and others and come up with one national code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been part of the U.S. Code, the official document that contains the codified general and permanent laws of the United States, since 1942. But the Flag Code is not enforced, and it's not enforceable. It's simply a set of guidelines that carries no penalties for noncompliance; it doesn't even have enforcement provisions. Think of it as a sort of federally mandated Miss Manners manifesto. It tells U.S. civilians (the military branches have their own flag codes) what to do -- and not to do -- with our national emblem. You won't get arrested if you run afoul of it, and it's difficult to believe that the code was written to discourage patriotic Americans from displaying representations of the flag on their clothing. This inherent dichotomy in the Flag Code is, at the very least, confusing. At worst, it sends the wrong message to those who proudly wear flag apparel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you think what we do with the flag these days is bad, you should have been around in the 1800s. With no laws governing the use of the flag's image or any accepted rules of flag etiquette -- and with a boost from advances in color printing and mass production -- late-19th-century marketers and advertisers routinely printed flag images on their products and advertisements. And they had no qualms whatsoever about stamping their messages directly on the banner itself. Politicians also took liberties with the flag, beginning in the mid-1840s, including plastering candidates' names and messages across the stripes and among the stars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rampant use of the star-spangled banner for commercial purposes didn't sit well with veterans, patriotic organizations and some members of Congress. The first attempt to deal with the misuse of the flag's image in commercial products came in the late 1880s with what was known as the flag-protection movement. It was led by the Grand Army of the Republic (the powerful Union Civil War veterans' organization), the fledgling Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution and a newly formed nonprofit lobbying group, the American Flag Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beginning in the mid-1890s, these groups launched a nationwide campaign to lobby  state and federal governments for flag-protection laws. The first such legislation was aimed solely at reining in the commercial use of the flag's image, and by 1932, flag-protection laws were on the books in all 48 states. Beyond commercial use, politics began to creep in to how the United States regulated the flag. During the domestically repressive World War I years, many states added new flag-desecration language and increased the penalties in their flag-protection laws. Much later, during a different time of war, Congress got around to passing the first federal flag-protection act in 1968. It came in reaction to acts of flag burning and other types of flag desecration by anti-Vietnam War protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in 1989, the Supreme Court declared that law, and all the state flag-protection laws, unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds. That led to the movement to get around the high court by adopting a constitutional amendment to protect the flag. Legislation has come to the floors of the House and Senate regularly since 1990 but has failed to get the required two-thirds majority for the first step of adopting what would be the 28th Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Flag Code remains. And so does the ubiquitous use of the banner's image on a multitude of commercial products, including lapel pins. The controversy  during the Democratic primary contest over Obama's only occasional use of the pin -- which many politicians have routinely worn since 9/11 -- is an instructive example of the role of flag-waving patriotism in politics today, as well as the peculiarity of the Flag Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was grilled about his failure to regularly sport a flag pin by Charles Gibson of ABC News during an April debate. Advisers to Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and John McCain agreed that it could become &quot;a major vulnerability if you're the candidate in November,&quot; Gibson said. &quot;How do you convince Democrats that this would not be a vulnerability?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama came back with a spirited defense of his love of country and his patriotism. He called the lapel-pin question a distraction from the serious issues facing the country. But although the focus on that particular piece of the senator's attire ebbed as he wrapped up the Democratic nomination, rumors questioning the first African American presidential nominee's patriotism have continued to dog his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lapel-pin flap is little more than a political ploy. Does anyone seriously believe that a popular U.S. Senator from the Midwest does not love his country because he doesn't (or didn't) wear a flag pin every time he puts on a suit? But since this non-issue involves the American flag, it receives loads of media attention and resonates with those who want to believe the worst about Obama. Accusations about his lapel-pin usage and his patriotism were big factors behind the wide-ranging and historically grounded speech Obama made last week in Independence, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Left mostly unremarked, though, is the fact that the senator's lapel now regularly features a flag pin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should it? Title IV, Chapter 1, Section 8 of the code states: &quot;The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery.&quot; But it then goes on to add: &quot;The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. Therefore, the lapel flag pin being a replica, should be worn on the left lapel near the heart.&quot; So the code is against the use of the flag on commercial products but also tells us where to wear our flag lapel pins -- which, last time I checked, are commercial products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No wonder we're all confused. Those contradictory words come from a document written in 1923 by a group of people who loved this country and thought that prohibiting the commercial use of the flag's image would help protect the banner itself. But things are murkier today. The Flag Code is on the books but often ignored. Political discourse on what it means to love one's country takes place on stages nearly blindingly laden with large flags. The debate about patriotism isn't about the flag -- except that it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the U.S. Flag Code, it's time for Congress to amend it. Let the code bless flag lapel pins and every other flag-bedecked item that allows Americans to express their patriotism -- even if the items are made in China. But that's another story.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain is getting battleground-state help this week from Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who will appear in a television commercial aimed at convincing the public that the United States is winning the Iraq war and should stay to finish the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Produced by Vets for Freedom, an organization of veterans of the two wars, the ad will run in Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia, and on cable nationwide. The group, with about 20,000 members, will spend $1.5 million on what it says is the first of many spots during the next month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As an organization, we have four months here,&quot; said the group's chairman, Pete Hegseth, an Iraq veteran. &quot;A window of opportunity of heightened awareness. We think it's crucial that the success our troops have made on the battlefield is relayed to the American public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad features eight veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan and the mother of a soldier in Iraq. &quot;We changed strategy in Iraq,&quot; one of the soldiers says in the ad. &quot;And the surge worked. Now that's change we can believe in. We need to finish the job. . . . No matter who is president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hegseth says his group is not operating on behalf of McCain and notes that federal law prohibits the organization from coordinating the ad with his campaign. The states were chosen, he said, not because they are crucial swing states for McCain, but rather because the heightened interest in those states will give it a larger audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to tap into that heightened awareness,&quot; he said, noting that his organization has supported several Democratic candidates in the past year or so. &quot;It's not an attack on anybody. We're not taking on any presidential candidates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he conceded that the message in the ad is almost identical to McCain's on the stump: The troop buildup worked; let's continue the war until we win. He said McCain has been the &quot;strongest advocate&quot; for the veterans of the two wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would hope that success in Iraq could benefit everybody,&quot; he said.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">MELDING POT </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clinton and Obama worlds continue to collide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patti Solis Doyle, fired as Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign manager, started her job last week as chief of staff to Obama's yet-to-be-named vice presidential pick. And Neera Tanden, Clinton's policy czar, is joining the Obama campaign as the head of domestic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the presumptive nominee hopes to snag John Podesta, Bill Clinton's former White House chief of staff and founding head of the Center for American Progress. According to several Obama sources, the campaign wants Podesta to run the transition operation if Obama wins in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Podesta kept a low profile during the primary season, although he was a staunch Clinton supporter. He is one of the most seasoned Democratic operatives in Washington, a quintessential insider with a rare grasp of both politics and policy. Before his White House years, when he weathered the impeachment scandal and many other crises, Podesta served as a staff counsel in the Senate, and one of his bosses was then-Sen. Tom Daschle, now a key member of Obama's inner circle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His brother Tony Podesta is one of those high-powered Washington lobbyists that Obama likes to criticize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other former Clinton advisers making the shift: former White House economic adviser Gene Sperling; trade specialist and former European Union ambassador Stuart Eizenstat; and former secretary of state Madeleine Albright.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">TURNING BLUE </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hunting for evidence that a Democratic wave may be building in congressional races? Look no further than the latest edition of the Cook Political Report, the nonpartisan newsletter that tracks House and Senate contests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its issue released last week, CPR shifted its competitiveness ratings for 28 House races -- and 27 of them shifted in favor of Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-one of those contests were moved from &quot;Solid Republican&quot; to &quot;Likely Republican,&quot; meaning that more and more seemingly &quot;safe&quot; GOP seats aren't quite safe anymore under the current political circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While it's not likely that a majority of the races moved from 'Solid' to 'Likely' Republican will become competitive by November, the poor national climate for the GOP and the [Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's] unprecedented financial edge makes even very difficult districts for Democrats worth keeping tabs on,&quot; the report counsels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the contests shifting in favor of Democrats are in states that will be competitive in the presidential race, as well. The revised ratings include four races in Florida, four in Pennsylvania, two in Virginia and one apiece in Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nevada and Ohio. (Pennsylvania had the only race that shifted away from Democrats: the reelection bid of Rep. Paul Kanjorski (D) in the 11th District).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before these latest ratings shifts, the Cook Report was predicting a Democratic gain of &quot;10 to 20 seats.&quot; With more districts now coming into play, Republicans may count themselves lucky if that prediction proves to be accurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TWO DAYS: Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama address the League of United Latin American Citizens in Washington. The Hispanic vote is widely seen by both candidates as a critical part of their winning coalition in the fall.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employers cut 62,000 jobs in June, marking the sixth consecutive month that the nation has shed jobs, according to a government report released yesterday, deepening concern that the struggling U.S. economy could turn worse before it gets better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The collapse in the real estate and mortgage industries, coupled with the specter of inflation fueled by the rising price of oil and other commodities, has crimped employers and left top policymakers and private analysts convinced that the economy is in for a prolonged period of sluggishness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not in a traditional recession dynamic where jobs get cut aggressively,&quot; said Bruce Kasman, chief economist for J.P. Morgan Chase. Still, he said, &quot;things may be starting to get worse, not better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of immediate concern to many economists is how the nation will emerge from the economic slowdown even as it faces inflationary pressures brought on by record-high oil and commodity prices. The price of a barrel of oil pushed near $146 before falling back yesterday, and it has increased about 50 percent since the start of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrapping up a European tour, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said high oil prices &quot;are a strong headwind, and at this level, they have got a high risk that they are going to prolong the slowdown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't believe this situation avails itself of quick fixes,&quot; Paulson said from London in comments reported by the Associated Press. He noted that, with the global appetite for oil steadily rising and production and refining capacity increasing less quickly, &quot;there are questions in the short term about the ability to meet the demand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Labor reported that the economy has lost about 438,000 jobs since the beginning of the year -- a figure that includes revisions for April and May to reflect an additional 52,000 jobs lost in those months. The unemployment rate, which is affected by the number of people seeking work and other factors, was at 5.5 percent, unchanged from a month earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The job losses were led by cuts in construction, financial services and manufacturing. Temporary and other employment agencies also experienced steep job cuts, which some economists saw as further evidence that the bleak employment picture will not improve anytime soon. There were also some cuts in retailing, which combined with the other reductions overwhelmed modest employment increases in leisure and hospitality, health care, mining, and government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate report, the Labor Department said the number of people applying for unemployment insurance jumped by 16,000, to 404,000, the highest level since late March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were 8.5 million unemployed people as of June, up from 7 million a year earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy has entered a slow-motion recession,&quot; said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. &quot;It is not seeing the dramatic plunges in jobs that characterized prior recessions, but the collapse of the housing bubble is slowly sinking more and more sectors of the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said that average hourly wages crept up 0.3 percent from a month earlier, to $18.01, but that tiny bounty has been more than offset by higher food and energy prices. The report also said that 5.4 million Americans -- about 3 percent of the labor force -- were working part time either because their hours had been cut or because they could not find full-time employment, a figure unchanged from May but up 1.1 million from a year earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jobs news, while sobering, was in line with the expectations of many economists, and the stock market closed yesterday with mixed results. The Dow Jones industrial average -- which was up 0.65 percent yesterday, at 11,288.54 -- is down about 20 percent from its October record, the threshold decline for a bear market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sign that concern about inflation is beginning to take precedence over the tepid economy, the European Central Bank yesterday raised its key lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.25 percent. At its most recent meeting, the Federal Reserve halted its series of interest rate cuts, leaving rates stable with a statement that cited the &quot;upside risks of inflation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, the two presidential candidates traded comments on the jobs data. Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) said: &quot;Our economy has now shed 438,000 jobs over the past six months, while workers' wages fail to keep pace with the skyrocketing cost of gas, groceries and health care. The American people are paying the price for the failed economic policies of the past eight years, and we can't afford four more years of more of the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said that the numbers reflect the economic struggles faced by everyday Americans. &quot;To get our economy back on track, we must enact a jobs-first economic plan that supports job creation, provide immediate tax relief for families, enact a plan to help those facing foreclosure, lower health care costs, invest in innovation, move toward strategic energy independence and open more foreign markets to our goods,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House released a statement saying that even if employment is declining, the economy has managed to continue expanding -- albeit at an anemic rate. Gross domestic product grew by a 1 percent annual rate during the first three months of this year, and the White House predicted that growth could be stronger in the second quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are no doubt in a period of slow growth. It is growth nonetheless, but it's very slow and it's had an impact on employment,&quot; said White House Press Secretary Dana Perino.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressional Democrats said the jobs reports illustrates the need for more aggressive action by the federal government to prod economic growth by completing work on a pending legislation to bring relief for many homeowners facing foreclosure and by having a second federal tax rebate, to complement the $168 billion plan launched in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, asked: &quot;When will the administration realize the economic pain many Americans are suffering, and when will they understand that focused government activities like a housing relief bill and a second stimulus package could help alleviate that pain?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soaring gasoline prices, tumbling stocks, the war, the nukes, the bickering between political parties as trouble looms. It is not the most serene Fourth of July on record, certainly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, despite collective and persistent anxieties, the nation's patriotism remains very much intact. Alive and well, in fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans are the most patriotic people on the planet, according to researchers at the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center who quantified and compared the national sense of pride in 34 countries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is at the head of the list, followed by Venezuela, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, the Philippines and Israel rounding out the top 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was no random gauge of passing sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondents were asked to rate exactly how proud they were of their nation in 10 areas, including politics, history, diversity and culture. The U.S. was ranked highest overall, particularly in pride in democracy, economy, political influence, science and the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other research has plumbed the country's patriotic souls as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rasmussen Reports found that three-quarters of 1,000 likely voters polled on June 27 said they were proud of U.S. history. There is a partisan divide of note here, though. The survey found that among Republicans, 91 percent were proud of the past. The number was 64 percent among Democrats. About 72 percent of Republicans, compared with 29 percent of Democrats, said the U.S. was &quot;a land of liberty and justice for all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, three-quarters overall say American children should be expected to recite the Pledge of Allegiance in school each morning. The figure was 89 percent for Republicans and 62 percent for Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two-thirds of the respondents agreed that in terms of human rights, the U.S. was a &quot;positive role model for the rest of the world.&quot; With a certain Yankee cheekiness, two-thirds also agreed that &quot;the world would be a better place if more countries were like the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patriotism has become a piquant presidential campaign issue in recent weeks as Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain seek to position themselves as the most star-spangled candidate. Mr. McCain has the definitive edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey of 906 registered voters released Wednesday found that 90 percent of the respondents said the Arizona Republican was patriotic while a quarter felt that the Illinois Democrat was not patriotic enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's likely the issue will not have a significant impact this fall,&quot; said CNN analyst Alexander Mooney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans themselves have strong opinions about what constitutes patriotism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A USA Today/Gallup Poll released Thursday found that &quot;voting in elections&quot; garnered the most acclaim as a patriotic act, cited as either very or moderately patriotic by 95 percent of the respondents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serving in the military was in second place, cited by 87 percent. &quot;Supporting U.S. policies around the world&quot; was next (82 percent), followed by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance (77 percent), protesting policies we oppose (76 percent) and wearing a flag pin (59 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While Republicans are among the most likely of all groups to say serving in the military reveals a great deal about one's patriotism, more than half of both Democrats and independents agree,&quot; said Gallup analyst Lymari Morales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans also tend to place more value on saying the Pledge of Allegiance and wearing an American flag pin, while independents align more closely with Democrats, who are generally less likely to place a high value on each action,&quot; she noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll of 781 adults was conducted June 15 to June 19 and had a margin of error of four percentage points.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain on Thursday finished a three-day presidential campaign trip to Latin America to mine the politics of free trade and foreign policy, but Republicans say the real vote mother lode may lie in the politics of a country he didn't visit - Venezuela, and its combative president, Hugo Chavez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans think U.S. Hispanic voters' antipathy to Mr. Chavez, particularly in Florida, can be connected to Sen. Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, who has promised to meet directly with Mr. Chavez. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you add [Mr. Obama's] comments on Chavez, visiting with [Fidel] Castro and against the free-trade agreement with Colombia - probably the most damaging - the rest of the pro-Hispanic rhetoric hits a skeptical audience,&quot; said former Florida Republican Party Chairman Al Cardenas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hispanic vote is expected to be critical in the November election, and Mr. McCain has made a full-court press, running a series of Spanish-language Web, radio and television ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Web ad released Thursday, Frank Gamboa, a retired captain and Mr. McCain's roommate at the U.S. Naval Academy, says in Spanish that Mr. Obama &quot;has just discovered the importance of the Hispanic vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Mr. McCain's three-day trip to Latin America involved meetings with leaders of two key U.S. allies: Mexican President Felipe Calderon and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe. The trip also produced key images such as photos of Mr. McCain visiting the Basilica of Guadalupe, an important pilgrimage site for Mexican Catholics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats accused Mr. McCain of taking politics overseas by criticizing Mr. Obama in an interview from Mexico City. They pointed out that the senator from Arizona was out of the country campaigning for free trade as a Labor Department report released Thursday showed a net loss of jobs in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic National Committee called it &quot;an out of touch moment for the ages,&quot; arguing that &quot;scores of American jobs have fled&quot; to Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign said voters want the new foreign policy engagement that the senator from Illinois has promised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question in this election is whether we continue the policies of the last eight years that have allowed Chavez to expand his influence in a vital region, or whether we turn the page on this failed approach. Senator Obama will use all the elements of our power to promote democracy and opportunity in the region,&quot; said Obama campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on Thursday, Mr. McCain told NBC News that campaign staff changes this week are minor. Steve Schmidt, the man he put in charge of day-to-day operations, released a memo saying the campaign will become more centralized by hiring key personnel to work at its national headquarters in Arlington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the fight for Hispanic votes, those on both sides say Mr. McCain will need to equal the 40 percent President Bush won in his 2004 re-election bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has been plagued by praise from enemy foreign leaders, including Cuba's communist dictatorship. Mr. McCain may have been helped by attacks from leaders including Mr. Chavez, who called the Republican &quot;a man of war&quot; and put him on par with Mr. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview last month with Jorge Ramos of Univision, Mr. Obama said Mr. Chavez should be handled carefully, but with direct diplomacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, I believe he is a threat, however, a manageable threat,&quot; Mr. Obama said, according to a translation by WatchingAmerica.com, a Web site that translates world news reports about the U.S. Mr. Obama said Mr. Chavez could have been involved in supporting a Marxist insurgency in Colombia, and said the right solution is to have the United Nations or Organization of American States impose sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans involved in the presidential campaign have taken notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have clearly identified this as being a major vulnerability for the Obama campaign,&quot; said one operative who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about campaign strategy. &quot;Hispanics, particularly those located in South Florida, recognize that any kind of negotiations with individuals like Hugo Chavez, who is fueling hatred of our country and terrorism south of the border, is unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama will have a near-impossible time explaining this to Hispanic voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans say the anti-Chavez strategy is tried and true - in Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that country's 2006 presidential election Mr. Calderon repeatedly tied his opponent, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, to Mr. Chavez. Mexico's elections regulator ruled that the ads were too aggressive and had to be taken off the air, but analysts said the association helped flip the election. Mr. Calderon won by a slim margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats ridiculed Republicans for looking to the Mexican election for inspiration, saying they should be looking instead to solve American voters' issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Cardenas said the sailing isn't smooth for Mr. McCain, either, saying &quot;the GOP has a strong head wind there as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Cardenas, who was born in Cuba, said it will be &quot;interesting to see not just polling numbers but the turnout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the Republican Party's &quot;best gains have been with Hispanic evangelicals who do vote in high numbers and Hispanic military families and small business groups.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Nov. 4 turnout is low, Mr. McCain and other Republican candidates generally will do well with Hispanics, Mr. Cardenas predicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the turnout is high, then Obama should have the advantage,&quot; he said. &quot;We will see.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatives are pushing the amendment in light of the California Supreme Court decision overturning the state's ban on same-sex marriage. Republican candidate John McCain backs the proposed amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama aides emphasized that he has opposed similar state bans in the past. They said Obama does not support gay marriage but believes that federal and state constitutional amendments banning it can also threaten rights that couples have under civil unions and domestic partnerships, which Obama does back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama quietly made his stance known in the letter to the Toklas club, a California gay rights group. His position comes as a shift for Democrats, as 2004 presidential nominee John Kerry backed amendments to ban gay marriage in some of the states in which he campaigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --  Perry Bacon Jr. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">MICHELLE OBAMA IS BETTER-KNOWN </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">Cindy McCain Still a Mystery to Many </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public opinion polls about potential first ladies often produce one of two results: overwhelmingly positive ratings or big numbers in the &quot;no opinion&quot; column. New CNN-Opinion Research Corp. and Associated Press-Yahoo polls -- as well as last month's Washington Post-ABC News survey -- show a mix of both outcomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest Post-ABC News poll, nearly eight in 10 adults had already formed an opinion about Michelle Obama. Positive views of her (48 percent favorable) outweighed negative ones (29 percent). A CNN poll out yesterday found a similar split, with 51 percent holding favorable views and 28 percent unfavorable ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But fewer in the Post-ABC News and CNN polls had formed an opinion on Cindy McCain (about four of 10 in each poll), and in both, more held favorable views (39 percent in both polls) than unfavorable ones (about a quarter). The AP-Yahoo poll, conducted online, found an even larger disparity in awareness of the two potential first ladies, with more than half not yet having formed an opinion of Cindy McCain, while just about a third were undecided on Michelle Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results for McCain are more consistent with historical views of a non-incumbent potential first lady than are Obama's. Teresa Heinz Kerry in 2004, Laura Bush in 2000, Elizabeth Dole in 1996 and Hillary Clinton in 1992 all fit a pattern similar to what is seen for McCain today. Michelle Obama's results, somewhat surprisingly, look a bit more like those of an incumbent first lady, perhaps because of her visibility during the extended Democratic nomination fight. Obama's ratings are close to those of Tipper Gore in 2000 or Laura Bush in 2004, though with greater unfavorable ratings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Christina Bellantoni, THE WASHINGTON TIMES</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAGE ONE; EXCLUSIVE; A01</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">889 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton has scrubbed all negative ads from her campaign Web site and YouTube page, leaving visitors with only the warm and fuzzy moments from her bid for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gone are the attack ads accusing Sen. Barack Obama of insulting Pennsylvanians, ducking debates and making misleading assertions about gas prices. In their place are some of the campaign's best and most positive ads and multiple &quot;Hillary I Know&quot; testimonials that have a shelf life should the former first lady ever run again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whitewashing took place quietly in the past few days as Mr. Obama cut his former rival a check to help relieve her campaign debt and as the Clinton family moved to fully embrace Mr. Obama as the presumptive Democratic nominee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's no longer campaigning for president,&quot; said Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee. &quot;She's focused on her work in the Senate, campaigning for Senator Obama and other Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Elleithee said the videos probably are archived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also missing are the dozens of speeches and hundreds of press releases running back to Mrs. Clinton's January 2007 campaign announcement. Many offered reporters details about important endorsements or the scripts of TV ads, but dozens were dedicated to countering the senator from Illinois.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Misleading attack: Sen. Obama flubs in Ohio,&quot; one release read. Another blared, in capital letters, &quot;NAFTA-gate: False denials from the Obama campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also gone are campaign memos, such as Mark Penn's Feb. 2 &quot;Hillary is the Democrat to beat McCain,&quot; or the May 19 missive by Clinton communications director Howard Wolfson complaining that Mr. Obama was about to declare that he had won a majority of delegates: &quot;Mission Accomplished? Not so fast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only releases left at HillaryClinton.com are a statement about the death of NBC's Tim Russert and the text of Mrs. Clinton's June 9 speech suspending her campaign after Mr. Obama earned enough delegates to lock up the nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The separate &quot;Fact Hub&quot; Web site that rebuked the Obama campaign has gone dead, along with &quot;Attack Timeline&quot; that detailed every nasty remark by Mr. Obama or his surrogates during the long primary battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, the Obama Fact Check page on his campaign site still offers rebuttals to Clinton attacks dating back to its creation in fall 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HillaryHub, a site showcasing positive press coverage, also has been removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hillary TV page that once featured fundraising appeals and dozens of ads - including those with Bill Clinton on a treadmill and the former first couple in a &quot;Sopranos&quot; spoof - now offers just five videos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one, she heartily endorses Mr. Obama's candidacy. In another, she thanks supporters and tells them, &quot;I could not have made this part of the journey without you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The site still has her Pennsylvania spot titled &quot;Scranton,&quot; which features black and white photos of Mrs. Clinton as a girl, and the &quot;Dreams&quot; ad in which the senator from New York shows photographs of her parents, talks about the values they instilled in her and promises, &quot;I carry with me not just their dreams but the dreams of people like them all across our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final video shows Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton meeting the campaign's 1 millionth supporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several upbeat videos also have vanished from the site and YouTube page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters trying to view the Chelsea Clinton Mother's Day tribute are directed to an error page that informs them: &quot;We've recently updated our site and we welcome you to explore the new content from the navigation above.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although cleaning up a campaign site for the sake of party unity isn't unusual, the YouTube scrubbing is. Other failed White House hopefuls have left their free campaign &quot;channels&quot; - created before last summer's YouTube debates - intact, and ads for Republican Fred Thompson and Democrat Joseph R. Biden Jr. are still posted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Clinton YouTube page is missing hundreds of videos, positive and negative alike. Her victory speeches, a showcase of enthusiastic young volunteers and her pledges to keep fighting through the primary season are history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet nothing is ever truly gone in the YouTube age because Internet surfers have spliced, diced and saved every campaign ad of the cycle. Cable networks still can replay the ads, but any blogger who tries to link to the Clinton versions will get an error message: &quot;We're sorry, this video is no longer available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still intact on the Hillary Hub YouTube page are remnants of some of the nastier moments of the campaign, including Mr. Wolfson's insistence that he would not accept Mr. Obama's delegate math unless the Florida and Michigan votes were fully counted, and a Clinton surrogate in North Carolina responding to Mr. Obama's comments about &quot;bitter&quot; rural Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on that page is a clip called, &quot;Confronted w/ facts Obama experiences technical difficulties,&quot; that shows a news report critical of Mr. Obama on the health care issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HillaryClinton.com page is no longer funded by the presidential campaign, and a new disclaimer notes that &quot;Friends of Hillary,&quot; Mrs. Clinton's Senate re-election committee, is paying for the site. She is not up for re-election until 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton will be fundraising for Democratic candidates until the November election using her HillPAC political action committee. Its Web site, HillPac.com, was reactivated this week.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tired of high gasoline prices and rising food costs? Well, here's a solution. Let's shoot the speculators. A chorus of politicians, including John McCain and Barack Obama, blames these financial slimeballs for piling into commodities markets and pushing prices to artificial and unconscionable levels. Gosh, if only it were that simple. Speculator-bashing is another exercise in scapegoating and grandstanding. Leading politicians either don't understand what's happening or don't want to acknowledge their own complicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Granted, raw materials prices have exploded across the board. From 2002 to 2007, oil rose 177 percent, corn 70 percent, copper 360 percent and aluminum 95 percent. But that's just the point. Did &quot;speculators&quot; really cause all those increases? If so, why did some prices go up more than others? And what about steel? It rose 117 percent -- and has increased further in 2008 -- even though it isn't traded on commodities futures markets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A better explanation is basic supply and demand. Despite the U.S. slowdown, the world economy has boomed. Since 2002, annual growth has averaged 4.6 percent, the highest sustained rate since the 1960s, says economist Michael Mussa of the Peterson Institute. By their nature, raw materials (food, energy, minerals) sustain the broader economy. They're not just frills. When unexpectedly high demand strains existing production, prices rise sharply as buyers scramble for scarce supplies. That's what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one foresaw that China would grow at a 10 percent annual rate for over a decade. Commodity producers just didn't invest enough,&quot; says analyst Joel Crane of Deutsche Bank. In industry after industry, global buying has bumped up against production limits. In 1999, surplus world oil capacity totaled 5 million barrels a day (mbd) on global consumption of 76 mbd, reckons the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Now, the surplus is about 2 million barrels per day -- and much of that is high-sulfur oil not prized by refiners -- on consumption of 86 mbd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or take nonferrous metals, such as copper and aluminum. &quot;You had a long period of underinvestment in these industries,&quot; says economist John Mothersole of Global Insight. For some metals, the collapse of the Soviet Union threw added production -- previously destined for tanks, planes and ships -- onto world markets. Prices plunged as surpluses grew. But Mothersole says &quot;the accelerating growth in India and China eliminated the overhang.&quot; China now accounts for up to 80 percent of the world's annual increased use of some metals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commodity price increases vary because markets vary. Rice isn't zinc. No surprise. But &quot;speculators&quot; played little role in these price run-ups. Who are these offensive souls? Well, they often don't fit the stereotype of sleazy high rollers: Many manage pension funds or university and foundation endowments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their trading might drive up prices if they were investing in stocks or real estate. But commodity investing is different. Investors generally don't buy the physical goods, whether oil or corn. Instead, they trade &quot;futures contracts,&quot; which are bets on  what prices will be in, say, six months. For every trader betting on higher prices, another is betting on lower prices. These trades are matched. In the stock market, all investors (buyers and sellers) can profit in a rising market, and all can lose in a falling market. In futures markets, one trader's gain is another's loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Futures contracts enable commercial consumers and producers of commodities to hedge. Airlines can lock in fuel prices by buying oil futures; farmers can lock in selling prices for their grain by selling grain futures. The markets work because numerous financial players -- &quot;speculators&quot; in it for the money -- can take the other side of hedgers' trades. But the frantic trading doesn't directly affect the physical supplies of raw materials. In theory, high futures prices might reduce physical supplies by inspiring hoarding. But that's not happening now. Inventories are modest. World wheat stocks, compared with consumption, are near historic lows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, the giant mining company Rio Tinto disclosed an average 85 percent price increase in iron ore for its Chinese customers. That affirmed that physical supply and demand -- not financial shenanigans -- is setting prices: Iron ore isn't traded on futures markets. The crucial question is whether these price increases will continue or ease as demand abates and investments in new capacity expand supply. Prices for some commodities (lead, nickel) have receded. Could oil be next?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians promise to tighten regulation of futures markets, but futures markets aren't the main problem. Scarcities are. Government subsidies for corn-based ethanol have increased food prices by diverting more grain into biofuels. A third of this year's U.S. corn crop could go to ethanol. Restrictions on oil drilling in the United States have limited global production and put upward pressure on prices. If politicians wish to point fingers of blame, they should start with themselves.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New media - videos, text messaging, social networking and blogging - is revolutionizing the way candidates run campaigns, and helped presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama redefine the role of a supporter from someone who votes, and perhaps donates, to a virtual campaign employee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visitors to BarackObama.com, after creating an account with their e-mail address and ZIP code, can sign up to receive 25 phone numbers of supporters to call, complete with a detailed script. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They gave their volunteers their contact list, which is a very innovative thing to do because all the conventional wisdom would be that you control your list because you don't want it to get leaked to the other team,&quot; said Peter Levine, director of the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at the University of Maryland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The use of technology to advance a campaign is not a new concept - candidates have had Web sites for years - but it has morphed from an afterthought into a cornerstone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's one of the reasons we're watching a guy who's relatively inexperienced called Barack Obama actually on his way to becoming president,&quot; said Peter Leyden, director of the New Politics Institute, a liberal think tank focused on the use of technology in politics. &quot;If you didn't have these new tools, if you didn't have the fundraising tools, the organizational tools or the new media tools, he would not be where he is today. No question about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, while online video existed during the most recent 2004 presidential campaign, YouTube wasn't even founded until 2005. Now, Mr. Obama's speech on race relations has garnered more than 4.5 million views on the Google Inc.-owned site - and that's only counting the number of times the entire 37-minute clip is played.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumptive Republican nominee Arizona Sen. John McCain has his own YouTube channel - as did former Democratic opponent New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton - and, despite some aesthetic differences, the functionality of the two campaigns' official Web sites are virtually identical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visitors are greeted by pictures of each man looking confidentially out into the distance.The landing pages on both have an &quot;Action Center&quot; with links to social networking hubs, voter registration information, phone banking instructions and forms recruiting friends. Visitors to both are never more than two clicks away from making a donation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the successful use of technology in a campaign is more than just building a good Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The easiest part is to get the technology working, to get a Web site up or get a way to distribute money through the Web or use video,&quot; Mr. Leyden said. &quot;The most difficult thing I've found is changing the mindset of the candidates themselves, the campaign, the consultants that are working with the campaign. Until you actually make the mental shift you really are not going to be able to take advantage of the power of the tools.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By all accounts, Mr. Obama appears to have made the mental shift. His staff includes New Media Director Joe Rospars, who was a strategist with former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean's 2004 campaign - widely viewed as the first successful use of Internet organizing - and Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, who leads the campaign's social networking efforts. The campaign has carefully woven Mr. Obama's messages of &quot;hope&quot; and &quot;change&quot; into all aspects of his social media strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, supporters can sign up for Obama Mobile by texting &quot;Hope&quot; to 62262.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The use of text messaging is especially critical, analysts say, as the general population abandons land line telephones, which are listed in the phone book, for cell phones that aren't. It's also more immediate than an e-mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the kind of thing where you can reach somebody in the movement, like turn on your TV and watch Obama on Larry King,&quot; said Todd Zeigler of the Bivings Group, a District firm that led online strategy for former Republican candidate Fred Thompson. &quot;As opposed to e-mail, which you might check once a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, the power of the Internet cuts both ways. Anyone can create their own Web site, blog or video that, if positive, gets linked to, and used by, the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If negative or controversial, such as the anti-Hillary YouTube spoof on Apple's Orwellian 1980s commercial, campaign officials are quick to disassociate themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Mr. Levine noted, the ability of video to spread on the Web like wildfire - as did the infamous clips of Mr. Obama's pastor the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. - can erode a candidate's control over his message, forcing him to speak about something he initially hoped to ignore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There can be an uneasy tension between official campaign employees and independent supporters, as evinced by the dust-up over a MySpace page devoted to Mr. Obama that was started by a California resident named Joe Anthony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign initially collaborated with Mr. Anthony, giving him content and suggestions on improving the site. But eventually, as Mr. Obama added more and more &quot;friends,&quot; the workload increased and Mr. Anthony demanded compensation from the campaign, who demanded control of the page. The controversy, which was widely reported on the Web, ended with MySpace handing over the domain to the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most analysts agree that Mr. Obama - the first modern candidate to spurn public funds after raising record-breaking amounts online - is winning the new media race, but there's no reason that Republicans can't catch up in the future, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Republicans will clearly figure this out and make a transition,&quot; Mr. Leyden said. &quot;It's just you can't do it overnight. I think by the next cycle, 2012, this new way of doing politics will totally be done on both sides and then it will be less about the technical advantage that these things bring, it will be all about the strength of your idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How bad is it for John McCain? Some of his supporters keep suggesting he would have a better shot at the White House if he promised to serve only one term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cue the old joke about the contest in which the first prize is a week in Philadelphia, and the second prize is two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this is no joke. McCain has flirted with the idea of being a voluntary, one-term wonder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In January, a woman at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire asked if he had the stamina for eight years in the White House. McCain, who at 72 would be the oldest president at the start of a first term, replied, according to The Boston Globe, &quot;If I said I was running for eight years, I'm not sure that would be a vote-getter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When reporters asked him later, he dismissed the one-term idea. But it turns out he had weighed making the pledge when he launched his White House bid last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marc Ambinder, who blogs on politics at theatlantic.com, reported June 2 that an early draft of McCain's announcement speech contained a one-term pledge. McCain decided against it after hearing the reasons it wouldn't work, among them that it diminishes presidential clout and instantly raises the curtains on the next presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> STILL, THE idea keeps coming back. Ramesh Ponnuru of the National Review has urged McCain to make the pledge, as have others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a gathering of rural advocates in Washington June 16, Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas, speaking as McCain's surrogate, said, &quot;He's probably even considering announcing that he would serve only one term, as a way of pushing the agenda on a bipartisan basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brownback seemed to distance himself from his own statement afterward, though, saying he had heard McCain say it months ago. Brownback said this is not the right time anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, what if McCain took the pledge in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul in September? It would take age off the table once and for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It could even mollify those Republicans who think McCain is insufficiently conservative. They could hold their noses and vote for him as the lesser of two evils, knowing he was on his way out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For McCain, saying he wanted only one term would free him from the endless tacking to the right. He could stop pandering on issues that matter to him - such as immigration and tax cuts. He could go back to his maverick self, which appeals to independent voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain needs something to give his campaign a lift. Some polls show Barack Obama with a comfortable, double-digit lead nationally over McCain among registered voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In four-person matchups - with McCain, Independent Ralph Nader, and Libertarian Bob Barr - Obama fares even better. The McCain campaign was reduced to disputing the methodology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FOUR STATE polls conducted by Quinnipiac University with The Wall Street Journal and washingtopost.com and released Thursday found Obama ahead in battlegrounds of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama has trounced McCain in fundraising, raking in $287.4 million to McCain's $119.6 million. Obama is so flush he turned down about $85 million in federal matching funds, and he's so golden that his flip-flop from previously saying he would take matching funds was a non-issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One Republican senator - Gordon Smith of Oregon - is running a re-election campaign ad touting his ability to work with Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Does this mean the presidential race is over? No. It means Obama had a good June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Peter A. Brown of the Quinnipiac poll said last week, &quot;Sen. Obama should not be picking out the drapes for the Oval Office just yet. His lead nationally, and double digits in some states, is not hugely different from where Sen. John Kerry stood four years ago at this point in the campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We still have four months until Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If McCain were to take the one-term pledge, he could argue that he's the candidate for change. It would be a way for the white male presidential candidate to make history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nobody has ever run for the White House promising to serve just one term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert G. Kaiser; Washington Post Staff Writer</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">STYLE; Pg. C01</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if the 2008 presidential election were decided by voters acting not on their political judgments or analyses of the candidates, but on their emotions? In the view of some experts, this is a trick question -- of course the election will be decided emotionally. Elections always are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Campaigns are about emotions and values more than about information,&quot; says John Russonello, a partner in a research and communications firm who loves to discover the feelings and visceral reactions that can move voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russonello does this with focus groups, now a ubiquitous tool in American politics and business. First used in the middle of the 20th century, the focus group -- typically a gathering of up to a dozen people chosen for particular demographic and political characteristics -- has become big business. In national and statewide political campaigns, they are as common as bumper stickers but a lot less visible. Usually focus groups are staged for small audiences -- representatives of the people paying for them. Tonight the public has an unusual opportunity to watch an entire two-hour focus group session on C-SPAN at 8 p.m. More about that in a moment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls,  the lifeblood of American politics,  can also tell us what people think -- which candidate they favor, how much they approve of a president, whether they believe the war in Iraq was worth fighting. But polls are science, exploiting the mathematical laws of random samples to explain what &quot;everyone&quot; thinks by asking the right 1,200 or so Americans the same questions. Focus groups, by contrast, are art. Their success depends on the skills of the person leading the discussion. A talented focus-grouper tries to expose the emotional juice that can both explain and alter poll results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A famous example of such alteration occurred in 1984. Peter Hart, a prominent Democratic pollster and focus group leader for three decades, was working for former vice president Walter F. Mondale, running that year for the Democratic presidential nomination against Sen. Gary Hart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hart thumped Mondale in the New Hampshire primary, producing &quot;a tsunami that swept over the Mondale campaign,&quot; Peter Hart remembers. &quot;Gary Hart appeared on the cover of all three newsweeklies. Everything was Hart.&quot; He was sent to Georgia, site of the next, suddenly crucial, primary to test a commercial attacking Hart before a focus group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tested this negative ad and everybody in the focus group booed. I spent the whole session hearing how Hart was new and young and marvelous and Mondale was everything else. About 80 minutes into the session I realized I had nothing&quot; to help Mondale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So I turned to them and said, 'Let me give you a situation. Imagine the country is in a terrible recession, unemployment is rising, it's very bad. Who do you want as president?' All 12 people wanted Hart. 'He's young, vibrant, he'll get the country moving again.' Mondale? 'Old, stale, tired, part of the old way of doing things . . .' Then I said, 'Imagine the country in an international crisis -- not a nuclear war but a serious crisis, when the red phone is being used. Who would you want as president? Twelve hands went up for Mondale. 'He's tested, he's stable, he's mature, he's seasoned, well versed, et cetera.' And Hart? 'Rash, new, untested . . .' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hart reported these reactions to the Mondale campaign, which quickly produced a new television commercial featuring a red telephone with a flashing orange light. A narrator intoned:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most awesome, powerful responsibility in the world lies in the hand that picks up this phone. The idea of an unsure, unsteady, untested hand is something to really think about. This is the issue of our times. On March 20, vote as if the future of the world is at stake. Mondale. This president will know what he's doing. And that's the difference between Gary Hart and Walter Mondale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mondale won in Georgia, and kept this ad on the air in all the states that later held primaries. &quot;The Hart people never had an answer to it,&quot; Peter Hart recalls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Thanks to the wonders of YouTube, that 1984 Mondale commercial can be seen by going to www.youtube.com and searching for &quot;Mondale Video 10.&quot;) at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fu-2Ew1ijg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Georgia focus group was an example of this art form at its most useful. Its fruits are not always so easy to pluck, and it is easy to misinterpret a group's comments, or be baffled by them. A bad leader can ruin a focus group. So can one or more ornery participants who try to dominate the proceedings. Often it is difficult to understand what is really important in a focus group discussion, and what is just noise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, Peter Hart is using focus groups to try to understand the presidential campaign as it unfolds. He has conducted five already and plans five more, all for the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center. The latest was held Tuesday night in York, Pa., and it will be broadcast at 8 tonight on C-SPAN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no red-telephone moment on Tuesday night, but there was plenty of emotion. Hart conducted the focus group at a market research firm, in a room surrounded by see-through mirrors. Several reporters watched through the glass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 12 participants (who were paid $100 each for their time) comprised six Democrats, two independents who leaned Democratic, two Republicans and two pure independents. None of the 12 supported Sen. Barack Obama or Sen. John McCain in the Pennsylvania primary on April 22; seven voted for Sen. Hillary Clinton. One of Hart's principal interests was to learn how those Clinton supporters felt about Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But before he could get to that question he tapped into strong feelings about the state of the country and the Bush administration. No one in the group had anything good to say about the state of the nation. Only three had anything kind to say about President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several participants made clear their own difficult circumstances. Michelle Bell, 38, an employee of Verizon and single mother of two, complained that she got no help from anyone. &quot;Even though I do work full time, trying to take care of the house, pay the mortgage, I have no money. I live paycheck to paycheck. But I still can't get reduced lunch for my kids at school. I think it's a bit ridiculous when there's people out there that don't work, and they're getting welfare and food stamps, and what am I getting? Nothing.&quot; A Democrat, she voted for Bush in 2004 and was leaning toward Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hart was impressed by the comments of two other women who voted for Bush in 2004 but seemed open to voting for Obama in November, a 32-year-old Republican homemaker and churchgoer named Jannell Mader, and Sheryl Randoll, an independent, 51-year-old pharmaceutical saleswoman with a history of voting for Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have two sons in college and one who's a senior in high school,&quot; said Randoll. &quot;I can plod along and make it on my own, but I really don't see it for them. I mean, if college is costing $50,000  a year and all of the things that go along with that, I don't see them being even as successful as I was, and I'm not even as successful as my father was. . . . I'm a single mom taking care of three kids. . . . I'm thinking we do need change. I'm not certain that either one of the candidates is going to bring the changes that we need, but we certainly need change to make it better for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am registered as a Republican and considered myself as a Republican up until this president,&quot; said Mader, who announced at one point that she admired Mike Huckabee. &quot;Now I'm like, I don't know what I am. . . . I think that for most of my life my decisions have been made based on morals and family values and that whole belief system that I've had instilled in me since birth. And now all of a sudden our country is like turned upside down with all these economic issues that I haven't encountered in my lifetime and it's really making me second-guess, you know, voting for those ideals instead of voting for other issues that need to be dealt with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I were John McCain,&quot; Hart said on the morning after the focus group, &quot;I'd be exceptionally nervous&quot; after hearing these women's comments. &quot;Those two people are terrible news for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's already looking at a deficit of 10 or 12 points in party ID,&quot; Hart said, referring to the gap between voters who identify themselves as Democrats or leaning toward Democrats and Republicans in this year's opinion polls. If McCain doesn't have traditional Republican voters like Mader and Randoll &quot;locked up in early June -- that is exceptionally important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hart saw another reason for McCain to be anxious -- five of the seven Democrats who voted for Clinton in the primary were already comfortable with Obama as their candidate. Hart had deliberately excluded people who had voted for Obama to make it easier for the Clinton supporters to speak their minds. In states like Pennsylvania, McCain must attract many non-Republican votes to win, and his campaign has already targeted Democrats who supported Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Hart is right that these signs were discouraging for McCain, the York focus group also showed how fluid the presidential race remains, and &quot;just how far from the finish line we are,&quot; in Hart's words. The discussion, which lasted nearly 140 minutes, demonstrated again and again how little the paricipants felt they knew about Obama or McCain. &quot;I don't know enough&quot; was the substance of many answers to Hart's queries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an effort to plumb their emotional reactions to both men, Hart fired a series of off-the-wall questions at the group: Imagine you are lost in a forest. Would you want Obama or McCain to help get you out? What kind of neighbor would McCain or Obama be? With which man would you choose to share an hour-long commute to work? Whom would you select to carry the American flag for the U.S. athletes marching in the opening ceremony of the Olympics?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama had fewer supporters than McCain on all of these questions, though only four of 12 said they leaned toward voting for McCain. This, said Hart, was evidence of the work Obama has to do to reassure voters that it would be safe and ultimately rewarding to vote for him. McCain is the relatively well-known quantity in the race, Obama still the newcomer. But Hart also noted how hard it was for members of the group to identify ways that McCain could win their votes in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only one member of the group had an outspoken answer to that question. Charles Fasano, a 56-year-old undertaker, identified himself as &quot;a Democrat . . . thinking more about McCain, just because I don't trust Osama -- I mean Obama. It's only one letter difference. His middle name's Hussein. He comes from a Muslim family. It's not right, I can't see it. I just fear for America if he comes in.&quot; Later in the discussion Fasano predicted race riots in America if Obama is elected. These were classic examples of sentiments that no poll would ever uncover, but came bubbling up freely in this focus group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one agreed with Fasano, nor did anyone point out that Obama barely knew his Muslim father or that side of his family. But several said they feared for Obama's safety. &quot;The real world doesn't do well with change,&quot; said Terry Mathison, 49, an independent who voted Republican in 2004. &quot;I think somebody would be out for him. I would fear for his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to new technology, says Vincent Breglio, a longtime Republican pollster and focus group leader, the future of this art form is bright. Breglio said he demonstrated this late last year in Iowa, in a new kind of computer-assisted and oversize focus group that he used on behalf of Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breglio assembled 25 people and put them all in front of laptop computers connected in a network. Instead of oral questions like Peter Hart's, he sent members of the group questions as e-mail, and the participants typed out their answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The data was just much richer,&quot; Breglio said. &quot;The meeker, less assertive people can participate without being identified. . . . We could ask fairly sensitive questions, like religious affiliations and beliefs and how they will influence votes, things that are very important but often difficult to tease out.&quot; And everyone in the group could answer every question, which isn't possible in the traditional focus group. The result, Breglio said, was the most productive, in-depth interviews he'd ever seen a focus group produce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few years back, when &quot;subprime&quot; generally referred to beef, economists used to congratulate themselves on their progress since the 1970s. Central banks had learned to tame inflation. Politicians had learned to appreciate the folly of price controls. Thanks to the economics profession, policymakers had grown wiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, inflation has returned. And politicians are out to control prices again, this time in futures markets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You see this most clearly with oil prices. Barack Obama worries that &quot;unregulated energy speculators may be distorting the market.&quot; John McCain complains that &quot;while a few reckless speculators are counting their paper profits, most Americans are coming up on the short end.&quot; On Thursday a measure demanding a clampdown on oil trading passed the House 402 to 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it's time for a quick refresher: Richard Nixon's early-1970s price controls were a disaster. Administering the controls on energy alone took an estimated 5 million man-hours per year and punished motorists with gas lines. Repeating this experiment by clamping down on oil trading is like burning your hand on a gas stove and then sitting on a barbecue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would-be  Nixons argue that hedge funds and their ilk are piling into oil futures, driving prices  above  &quot;reasonable&quot; levels. They note that  in 2000, speculators owned just over a third of the &quot;paper oil&quot; traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange but now own more than two-thirds. This buying pressure on paper oil is said to be pushing physical oil up. Stop the speculation, they say, and prices would revert to normal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most basic problem with this claim is that a speculator can buy paper oil only if someone else sells to him. For every trader who bets on a price rise, there must be another who bets the opposite. So an increase in the number of speculative players does not show whether prices will move up or down. Think of a youth  soccer team: If it adds two extra players it doesn't become more likely to win, because its opponents will add two players as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What matters is who those players are: Will they aggressively push the ball up the field, or will they retreat? Sometimes the bulls are more eager than the bears, and prices spiral upward. But this  is not some autonomous force that comes out of nowhere. If the bulls have the upper hand, it's generally because supply and demand favor higher prices. The fundamentals of physical oil drive the psychology around paper oil more than vice versa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why do I think that? Financial behavior often influences the real economy. In the recent mortgage bubble, for example, financiers made mortgages available to people who had been ineligible: They changed the fundamentals of demand for housing. But oil speculation is not like that. Investors who buy paper oil do not alter the demand for physical oil. Every paper claim they buy is a paper claim they will later sell, because they have no intention of converting their paper into real oil stocks. Oil is too expensive and cumbersome to store. A speculator is not going to show up in Cushing, Okla., when his futures contract matures and drive away with a tanker truck full of oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uncertain connection between speculation and price trends is clear in recent history. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission reports how much paper oil is bought and sold by commercial users -- oil companies, refiners -- and how much is bought and sold by speculators. During the first seven months of 2007, speculators as a group tripled the amount of paper oil they owned, buying it from commercial players. But since last August, speculators as a group have not added to their positions -- yet this was when oil prices went skyward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be too much to claim that futures prices don't influence  players in the physical market. But to the limited extent that speculators' influence is real, this is probably a good thing. If speculators see that oil suppliers are headed for trouble and that oil demand is trending up, they express their expectation of a higher price via the futures market. This can deliver a valuable message: Governments and consumers had better adjust before shortages get even nastier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as in Nixon's day, government's response to runaway prices would have unintended consequences. The most popular proposals would limit how many contracts a speculator can buy or sell on a futures exchange, and prevent  trading with mostly borrowed money. But the more you restrict trading on U.S. exchanges, the more you drive trading into the shadowy world of the unregulated swaps market or onto offshore rivals.  In the 1980s, Japan tried to prevent futures traders in Osaka from speculating on the Nikkei stock index. Nikkei futures trading thrived -- in Singapore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most fundamentally, Nixon's  heirs forget that the &quot;speculators&quot; they attack are often trying to reduce risk, not embrace it. Pension funds have piled into oil because they are trying to protect themselves from inflation. Small investors who load up on retail oil funds are mostly doing the same. I know my family will consume several thousand dollars' worth of oil this year, so I logged on to Fidelity's Web site and locked in my price. Does Congress think I'm irresponsible?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">FINDLAY, Ohio</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his corner of College Street, Jim Peterman stares at the four American flags planted in his front lawn and rubs his forehead. Peterman, 74, is a retired worker at Cooper Tire, a father of two, an Air Force veteran and a self-described patriot. He took one trip to Washington in 1989 -- best vacation of his life -- and bought a statue of the Washington Monument that he still displays in a glass case in his living room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes a smart vote is an American's greatest responsibility. Which is why his confusion about Barack Obama continues to eat at him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the television in his living room, Peterman has watched enough news and campaign advertisements to hear the truth: Sen. Barack Obama, born in Hawaii, is a Christian family man with a track record of public service. But on the Internet, in his grocery store, at his neighbor's house, at his son's auto shop, Peterman has also absorbed another version of the Democratic candidate's background, one that is entirely false: Barack Obama, born in Africa, is a possibly gay Muslim racist who refuses to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like you're hearing about two different men with nothing in common,&quot; Peterman said. &quot;It makes it impossible to figure out what's true, or what you can believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here in Findlay, a Rust Belt town of 40,000, false rumors about Obama have built enough word-of-mouth credibility to harden into an alternative biography. Born on the Internet, the rumors now meander freely across the flatlands of northwest Ohio -- through bars and baseball fields, retirement homes and restaurants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with polling that shows about one in 10 Americans thinks Obama is Muslim, the candidate's campaign has launched an aggressive effort to discredit rumors and clarify Obama's past. It created a &quot;Fight the Smears&quot; Web site and a new television ad that reiterates Obama's Christian faith, patriotism and family background. Dozens of volunteers have been sent to Ohio five months in advance of the election so they can spend extra time educating voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Peterman's block in Findlay, the campaign's efforts may already be too late. A swing voter who entered this election leaning Democratic, Peterson faces a decision that is no longer so simple as a choice between Obama and Republican Sen. John McCain, he said. First, he must pick the version of Obama on which he will stake his vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does he choose to trust a TV commercial in which Obama talks about his &quot;love of country&quot;? Or his neighbor of 40 years, Don LeMaster, a Navy veteran who heard from a friend in Toledo that Obama refuses to wear an American-flag pin?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does he trust a local newspaper article that details Obama's Christian faith? Or his friend Leroy Pollard, a devoted family man so convinced Obama is a radical Muslim that he threatened to stop talking to his daughter when he heard she might vote for him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll admit that I probably don't follow all of the election news like maybe I should,&quot; Peterman said. &quot;I haven't read his books or studied up more than a little bit. But it's hard to ignore what you hear when everybody you know is saying it. These are good people, smart people, so can they really all be wrong?&quot;<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">'Funny About Change' </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peterman bought his single-story house here in 1959, a few months after he left the Air Force and married. His wife, Mildred, had grown up in Findlay, and they never considered moving anywhere else. On College Street, the couple found all the hallmarks of America's heartland: a house for $9,000; a neighborhood where their two boys, one handicapped, could play outside after dark; a steady &quot;pencil-pushing&quot; job up the road for Jim at Cooper Tire headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighborhood built up around them. Leroy and Wanda Pollard came in 1962, drawn from southern Ohio by a booming auto industry that offered Leroy plenty of work as a mechanic. Mary Dunson bought the place next door in 1963. Don LeMaster, a police officer, moved in up the street with his wife, Margaret, in 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every newcomer to the block was white, working-class and Midwestern, and the neighborhood jelled easily. They babysat for one another. They complained to one another about their teenagers. They helped raise one another's grandkids. In all, seven different families have lived on the same block of College Street for at least 35 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all just found a great place at a great time,&quot; Leroy Pollard said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peterman hung the American flag on his porch first, in 1960, and the rest of College Street followed his example. By 1980, patriotic displays had grown into an unspoken contest of one-upmanship. Sixty flags planted in one yard on Memorial Day; a living-room window painted red, white and blue; a Buckeye tree decorated with Christmas ornaments celebrating Americana; a gigantic plastic unicorn perched on a front porch and draped in an American flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entire block -- and, soon, the entire town -- shared in unabashed pride and gratefulness for the country that had given them this place. In 1968, a local congressman persuaded the House of Representatives to officially declare Findlay as Flag City, USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with their pride came a nasty undercurrent, one that Obama's candidacy has exacerbated: On College Street, nobody wanted anything to change. As the years passed, Peterman and his neighbors approached one another to share in their skepticism about the unknown. What was the story behind the handful of African Americans who had moved into a town that is 93 percent white? Why were Japanese businessmen coming in to run the local manufacturing plants? Who in the world was this Obama character, running for president with that funny-sounding last name?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People in Findlay are kind of funny about change,&quot; said Republican Mayor Pete Sehnert, a retired police officer who ran for the office on a whim last year. &quot;They always want things the way they were, and any kind of development is always viewed as making things worse, a bad thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When people on College Street started hearing rumors about Obama -- who looked different from other politicians and often talked about change -- they easily believed the nasty stories about an outsider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Obama would be a disaster, and there's a lot of reasons,&quot; said Pollard, explaining the rumors he had heard about the candidate from friends he goes camping with. &quot;I understand he's from Africa, and that the first thing he's going to do if he gets into office is bring his family over here, illegally. He's got that racist [pastor] who practically raised him, and then there's the Muslim thing. He's just not presidential material, if you ask me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Don LeMaster: &quot;He's a good speaker, but you've got to dig deeper than that for the truth. Politicians tell you anything. You have look beyond the surface, and then there are some real lies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Jeanette Collins, a 77-year-old who lives across the street: &quot;All I know for sure about Obama is that we're not ready for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only one man on College Street remains open-minded, and recently even Peterman has started to sway. Like most of his neighbors, he dislikes McCain for his stance on the Iraq war and would like to cast his vote for a president who will bring the troops home. But on a recent visit to his son's auto shop, Peterman overheard misinformed customers talking again about a Muslim in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know. The whole thing just scares me,&quot; Peterman said. &quot;I'm almost starting to feel like the best choice is not voting at all.&quot;<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The Truth Squad </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, those who have pushed the truth in Findlay have been rewarded with little that resembles progress. Gerri Kish, a 66-year-old born in Hawaii, read both of Obama's autobiographies. She has close friends, she said, who still refuse to believe her when she swears Obama is Christian. Then she hands them the books, and they refuse to read them. &quot;They just want to believe what they believe,&quot; she said. &quot;Nothing gets through to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new advertisement running in Findlay, in which Obama is pictured with his white mother and white grandparents as he talks about developing a &quot;deep and abiding faith in the country I love&quot; while growing up in the Kansas heartland, is dismissed by residents of College Street as the desperate lies of another dishonest Washington politician. And they say that Obama's moves to put distance between himself and the Muslim community, with his campaign declining invitations to visit mosques and Obama volunteers removing two women in head scarves from the camera range at a rally in Detroit earlier this month are just a too-late effort to disguise his true beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the past month, two students from the University of Findlay have spent their Tuesday nights walking from door to door in the city to tell voters about Obama. Erik Cramer and Sarah Everly target Democrats and swing voters exclusively, but they've still experienced mixed results. Sometimes, at a front door, they mention their purpose only to have a dozen rumors thrown back at them and the door slammed. &quot;People tell us that we're in the wrong town,&quot; Everly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon, on a Tuesday night, they'll walk down College Street -- past the American flags, past the LeMasters, past the Pollards -- and knock on Jim Peterman's front door. They will ask for two minutes of his time, and Peterman will give it to them. He will listen to their story, weighing facts against fiction. For a few minutes, he might even believe them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he'll close his door and go inside, back to his life. Back to his grocery store, back to his son's auto shop, back to the gossip on College Street. Back to the rumors again.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can an &quot;Obamlet&quot; with &quot;Baraccoli&quot; be a useful tool to win the presidential election? Sen. Barack Obama's team hopes so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, more than 4,000 people hosted Unite for Change house parties - some with cutesy food names - in honor of the presumptive Democratic nominee, an effort to build the campaign's grass-roots supporters into a force that can't be stopped in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's part of the multifaceted &quot;persuasion army&quot; Team Obama hopes to build to do much of its work in the final days of the election, convincing neighbors block by block why the Democrat should be president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You'll start planning how to build this movement across the country in the weeks and months ahead,&quot; the campaign instructs supporters for the do-it-yourself political parties. &quot;We're counting on you to keep it going through November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the garlic capital of the world in Gilroy, Calif., to Levittown, Pa., Obama supporters reached out to their friends and neighbors - especially ones who aren't yet registered voters or who backed Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton during the Democratic primaries and caucuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ersula Cosby, an Obama voter from the Philadelphia suburb, organized her neighborhood party with a focus on Clinton backers because she recognized &quot;there were some hard feelings&quot; that lingered after the state's hotly contested April primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's great to address that issue on a local, personal level. It's better to hear it coming from your good friend, as opposed to being told by the party what you have to do,&quot; said Ms. Cosby, a lawyer who is new to grass-roots politics. One guest was a Clinton backer who will vote for Mr. Obama but acknowledged she needs to &quot;convince a lot of my friends&quot; to follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign aims to duplicate those efforts across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A human being talking to one human being as a swing voter trying to figure out what to do in this election is a very powerful thing,&quot; Obama campaign manager David Plouffe told reporters last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it's a sort of &quot;persuasion army&quot; that will help voters &quot;sort through&quot; political news and ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alastair Rami of Northwest Washington offered a brunch menu with &quot;Baraccoli Obamlets&quot; to woo &quot;Hillary Clinton supporters and independents and anyone else who hasn't yet made up their mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whether you're an old political pro, someone just getting involved for the first time, or someone who just likes a free brunch and stimulating political discussion, swing on by,&quot; he touted on his MyBarackObama page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama Web site allows supporters to network and find local events from sign-making to wine tasting on behalf of the candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a grass-roots organizing standpoint, the site for Sen. John McCain offers little more than press releases and the presumptive Republican nominee's schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members who sign up for the McCain network receive a welcome e-mail from the candidate suggesting two ways to get involved - a donation, and through the &quot;online action center&quot; to &quot;help spread John McCain's message to your family, friends, neighbors and co-workers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Republican does not provide as many outlets for doing so - a voter who signs up to be part of the Virginia team comes to a page with the latest McCain&nbsp;ad and his national schedule, not a Virginia-specific grass-roots page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By comparison, the Obama Virginia page on Sunday offered a commonwealth-specific blog, four voter-registration events for that day and also presented five regional Virginia groups voters can join to network with fellow fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Plouffe said he thinks the Democrats can &quot;exploit&quot; the &quot;enthusiasm gap&quot; showcased by many polls that indicate more people are &quot;very&quot; excited about Mr. Obama than feel the same way about Mr. McCain. A recent poll pegged the &quot;very enthusiastic&quot; figure at 40 percent for the Democrat and just 13 percent for the Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also noted the campaign is confident it can expand the electoral map because of its grass-roots support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we want to go try and register people in a community on the weekend, we can do that by asking people to show up somewhere,&quot; he said, adding the McCain enthusiasm numbers suggest his percentage of willing volunteers must be &quot;pretty low.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Obama spokesman Bill Burton, Oct. 24, 2007</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THAT WAS then: Democratic primaries to be won, netroot lefties to be seduced. With all that (and Hillary Clinton) out of the way, Obama now says he'll vote in favor of the new FISA bill that gives the telecom companies blanket immunity for post-9/11 eavesdropping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back then, he thoroughly trashed the North American Free Trade Agreement, pledging to force a renegotiation, take &quot;the hammer&quot; to Canada and Mexico, and threaten unilateral abrogation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the hammer is holstered. Obama calls his previous NAFTA rhetoric &quot;overheated&quot; and essentially endorses what one of his senior economic advisers privately told the Canadians: The anti-trade stuff was nothing more than populist posturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor is there much left of his primary season pledge to meet &quot;without preconditions&quot; with Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. There will be &quot;preparations,&quot; you see, which are being spun by his aides into the functional equivalent of preconditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's long march to the center has begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And why not? What's the downside? He won't lose the left, or even mainstream Democrats. They won't stay home on Nov. 4. The anti-Bush, anti-Republican sentiment is simply too strong. Election Day is their day of revenge -- for the Florida recount, for Swift-boating, for all the injuries, real and imagined, dealt out by Republicans over the past eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Normally, flip-flopping presidential candidates have to worry about the press. Not Obama. After all, this is a press corps that heard his grandiloquent Philadelphia speech -- designed to rationalize why &quot;I can no more disown Three months later, with Wright disowned, grandma embraced and the great &quot;race speech&quot; now inoperative, not a word of reconsideration is heard from his media acolytes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His FISA flip-flop elicited a few grumbles from lefty bloggers, but hardly a murmur from the mainstream press. Remember his pledge to stick to public financing? Now flush with cash, he is the first general-election candidate since Watergate to opt out. Some goo-goo clean-government types chided him, but the mainstream editorialists who for years had been railing against private financing as hopelessly corrupt and corrupting, evinced only the mildest of disappointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times expressed a sympathetic understanding of Obama's about-face by buying his preposterous claim that it was a pre-emptive attack on McCain's 527 independent expenditure groups -- notwithstanding the fact that (a) as Politico's Jonathan Martin notes, &quot;there are no serious anti-Obama 527s in existence nor are there any immediate plans to create such a group&quot; and (b) the only independent ad of any consequence now running in the entire country is an AFSCME-MoveOn.org co-production savaging McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, Obama's U-turn on public financing was not done for ideological reasons, it was done for Willie Sutton reasons: That's where the money is. It nonetheless betrayed a principle that so many in the press claimed to hold dear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am not disappointed in the least by his other calculated and cynical repositionings. I have never had any illusions about Obama. I merely note with amazement that his media swooners seem to accept his every policy reversal with equanimity .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth about Obama is uncomplicated. He is just a politician (though of unusual skill and ambition). The man who dared say it plainly is the man who knows Obama all too well. &quot;He does what politicians do,&quot; explained Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it's time to throw campaign finance reform, telecom accountability, NAFTA renegotiation or Wright overboard, Obama is not sentimental. He does not hesitate. He tosses lustily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why, the man even tossed his own grandmother overboard back in Philadelphia -- only to haul her back on deck now that her services are needed. Today, she is a featured prop in Obama's fuzzy-wuzzy get-to-know-me national TV ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not a flinch. Not a flicker. Not a hint of shame. By the time he's finished, Obama will have made the Clintons look scrupulous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fewer than five months remain before the November election, and, slowly but surely, the outlines of the national playing field are coming into focus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) appears committed to expanding the traditional group of battleground states -- launching his first ad of the general election in 18 states, including 14 that President Bush carried in 2004. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) seems to envision a more traditional playing field, concentrating his advertising on 10 (or so) states including quadrennial battlegrounds such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remains to be seen which approach will prevail. But here's a snapshot of the five states most likely to switch from the Democratic column in 2004 to the Republican one in 2008 (or vice versa). No. 1 is the most likely to flip this fall. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Michigan (Sen. John Kerry won with 51 percent in 2004): There's a reason that the endorsements of Obama by former senator John Edwards (N.C.) and former vice president Al Gore both happened in Michigan. Obama's campaign knows that its candidate's decision to skip the state's primary (and all of the agitation that ensued from that choice), coupled with the fact that McCain has shown strength in Michigan (witness his 2000 primary victory there), make the Wolverine State a major challenge. For Obama to win, he must run extremely well in Detroit and Ann Arbor and avoid being swamped in the more Republican-friendly territory covered by the 2nd and 3rd Congressional Districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Ohio (Bush won with 51 percent in 2004): Obama's chance to lock down Ohio went by the boards when Gov. Ted Strickland removed himself from the veepstakes. With Strickland out of the running, it's clear that Obama will have to put in the time to persuade Ohio voters -- particularly the working-class whites who supported Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) in the state's primary -- that he shares their values and concerns. Still, Republicans hit something close to rock bottom in 2006, and it's not clear whether the party can recover before November. National Republican strategists are not optimistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Nevada (Bush, 51 percent, 2004): The growth in Nevada is largely in and around Las Vegas (Clark County) and tends to favor Democrats, but there remains a substantial conservative vote in the rural reaches. McCain and Obama have made appearances in the state in the past week -- a sign that both believe it is up for grabs. Watch the manner in which Obama and McCain address the issue of Yucca Mountain, the proposed permanent dump site for the nation's nuclear waste, a plan that is strongly opposed by Nevadans. During a stop in the state last week, Obama blasted McCain for his proposal to build a string of nuclear plants, a not-so-subtle attempt to remind voters that he opposes Yucca while McCain supports it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. New Mexico (Bush, 50 percent, 2004): Bush's victory in the Land of Enchantment was the first by a Republican presidential candidate since 1988. It looks likely that New Mexico will return to its Democratic roots in 2008. Popular Gov. Bill Richardson is interested in a spot either on the ticket or in an Obama Cabinet and will work hard to make sure the senator from Illinois runs well in his home state. The swing voters in the state are Hispanics; they make up 42 percent of the population and will be heavily sought after by both Obama and McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Iowa (Bush, 50 percent, 2004): At the start of the 2008 election, Iowa was widely seen as the truest of tossups: Bush won the state by 10,000 votes of out more than 1.5 million cast in the last presidential election. The emergence of Obama, however, and the centrality of the Hawkeye State in launching his candidacy, has turned the state into the best pickup opportunity in the country for Democrats. The massive amount of money Obama spent to identify, organize and turn out voters in advance of the Jan. 3 caucuses looks to be a good long-term investment heading into the general election. In neither of McCain's presidential primary bids did he run an active campaign in Iowa -- a major disadvantage in the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PLAYERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans United for Change, an issues-oriented liberal organization, is undergoing a bit of a facelift in advance of the November election. Current Executive Director Brad Woodhouse is taking a leave of absence to help run the day-to-day communications at the Democratic National Committee. While Woodhouse's madcap style -- and e-mail precocity -- are  irreplaceable, Americans United will use a double-barreled approach in his absence: Caren Benjamin, a former aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), will be assisted in the day-to-day duties by Progressive Strategies, a Democratic consulting firm run by former Clinton aide Mike Lux. Susan McCue, former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.), will serve as a general consultant to the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One day: Big brains at the nexus of public policy and politics gather in Colorado for the Aspen Institute's 2008 Ideas Festival. Among the expected attendees are former president Bill Clinton and former Georgia senator Sam Nunn, one of the most-mentioned candidates for the Democratic vice presidential nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 16 days: July 15 is the final day for candidates to file for the Senate race in Minnesota. All eyes are on &quot;The Body,&quot; a.k.a. Jesse Ventura, a.k.a. the state's former governor. Ventura has played coy about his interest in joining an already high-profile field that includes Sen. Norm Coleman (R) and entertainer Al Franken (D). If Ventura runs, he would almost assuredly affect the final outcome.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">EVERYONE'S FAVORITE </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ever wonder what it would be like if the vice presidential sweepstakes was conducted like &quot;Survivor&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now we know -- thanks to the Massachusetts-based company Affinnova, which used &quot;evolutionary optimization&quot; to trim down a list of 100 potential veeps to the single strongest candidate for each party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The winners?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's just one: retired Gen. Colin Powell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell, who has said countless times that he has no interest in running for office, wound up atop both the Democratic and Republican lists. &quot;Likely voters for both parties in the study indicate Powell's strong leadership and dependability as factors for choosing him first,&quot; said a release on the findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rounding out the top five picks for Democrats, in order, were former vice president Al Gore, former representative Dick Gephardt (Mo.), Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.) and former senator John Edwards (N.C.). On the GOP side, the results for second through fourth place were Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in a virtual dead heat. Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani took fifth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings are the result of a Web-based sample of 2,000 likely voters from June 12 to 17. Participants were presented with three different president-vice president combinations and asked to pick the ticket that most appealed to them. Over time, those tickets not picked dropped off, and the more commonly selected moved up the list. It's Darwinism applied to politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Obama and McCain heed the evolutionary optimization? Probably not. But maybe they should, as Affinnova has done work for the likes of Wal-Mart, Procter &amp; Gamble and Microsoft.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court's landmark decision Thursday poses myriad questions for which answers are still a work in progress. Here are some of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. Does this eliminate all gun restrictions?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court's majority, stressed that the Second Amendment doesn't guarantee an &quot;unlimited&quot; right to bear arms. Scalia cited as legitimate long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, as well as bans on carrying firearms into schools and government buildings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laws imposing &quot;conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms&quot; are also probably safe, Scalia wrote, adding that his list of Second Amendment-friendly gun restrictions &quot;does not purport to be exhaustive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. But the ruling will extend beyond Washington, D.C.'s, gun ban, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Yes, although not right away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest federal compilation of state and local firearm laws is some 458 pages long, and it was published in 2005, so it's not up to date. Boston, Chicago and Denver, for instance, ban the possession and sale of assault weapons. Los Angeles and San Francisco ban the sale of .50-caliber handguns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An untold number of these existing laws will be subject to challenge. This will take time and money as lawsuits are filed and ordinances are revised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. Will the ruling allow those who are arrested or convicted on gun charges to challenge their cases?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Virtually every defense attorney&quot; whose client is facing &quot;a gun count&quot; in the indictment is obligated to seek dismissal, said Jack King, a D.C. attorney and the director of public affairs for the National Association of Criminal Defense lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact could be extensive because many of the gun charges are linked to drug raids, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. How about federal gun laws? Will they be affected?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Potentially yes, although most firearm regulations are at the state or local level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress has passed a number of firearms laws in the past, such as a since-expired assault weapon ban written in 1993. Only time will tell which gets challenged next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. What kind of gun laws will probably survive?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Narrowly tailored laws may be safe, along with laws that target the most sophisticated weaponry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scalia and the court's majority stress Washington's &quot;absolute&quot; prohibition of handguns . Presumably, laws that have a narrower focus will have a better chance in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court also noted that the Second Amendment right to bear arms may be limited to those weapons &quot;in common use at the time&quot; the amendment was written. In other words: no rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Although this certainly doesn't mean only 18th century flintlocks may be legally owned, the court stressed that sawed-off shotguns as well as &quot;M-16 rifles and the like may be banned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. How will this decision play politically in this election year?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. In the short term, the decision highlights the importance of the Supreme Court and offers a wedge issue for political operatives. In the long run: Who knows?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumptive Republican presidential candidate John McCain instantly embraced the decision, while his Democratic opponent, Barack Obama, offered a more nuanced view seemingly designed to minimize differences on the volatile gun issue. Obama stressed that, like the court's majority, he believes that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to bear arms. Obama sidestepped other parts of the decision, saying simply that it offers &quot;much needed guidance&quot; to officials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be clear: Barack will support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Obama spokesman Bill Burton, Oct. 24, 2007</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That was then: Democratic primaries to be won, netroot lefties to be seduced. With all that (and Hillary Clinton) out of the way, Obama now says he'll vote in favor of  the new FISA bill that gives the telecom companies blanket immunity for post-Sept. 11 eavesdropping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back then, in the yesteryear of primary season, he thoroughly trashed the North American Free Trade Agreement, pledging to force a renegotiation, take &quot;the hammer&quot; to Canada and Mexico and threaten unilateral abrogation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today the hammer is holstered. Obama calls his previous NAFTA rhetoric &quot;overheated&quot; and essentially endorses what one of his senior economic advisers privately told the Canadians: The anti-trade stuff was nothing more than populist posturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor is there much left of his primary season pledge to meet &quot;without preconditions&quot; with Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. There will be &quot;preparations,&quot; you see, which are being spun by his aides into the functional equivalent of preconditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's long march to the center has begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And why not? What's the downside? He won't lose the left, or even mainstream Democrats. They won't stay home on Nov. 4. The anti-Bush, anti-Republican sentiment is simply too strong. Election Day is their day of revenge -- for the Florida recount, for Swift-boating, for all the injuries, real and imagined, dealt out by Republicans over the past eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Normally, flip-flopping presidential candidates have to worry about the press. Not Obama. After all, this is a press corps that heard his grandiloquent Philadelphia speech -- designed to rationalize why &quot;I can no more disown [Jeremiah Wright] than I can disown my white grandmother&quot; -- then wiped away a tear and hailed him as the second coming of Abraham Lincoln. Three months later, with Wright disowned, grandma embraced and the great &quot;race speech&quot; now inoperative, not a word of reconsideration is heard from his media acolytes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worry about the press? His FISA flip-flop elicited a few grumbles from lefty bloggers, but hardly a murmur from the mainstream press. Remember his pledge to stick to public financing? Now flush with cash, he is the first general-election candidate since Watergate to opt out. Some goo-goo clean-government types chided him, but the mainstream editorialists who for years had been railing against private financing as hopelessly corrupt and corrupting evinced only the mildest of disappointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the New York Times expressed a sympathetic understanding of Obama's about-face by buying his preposterous claim that it was a preemptive attack on McCain's 527 independent expenditure groups -- notwithstanding the fact that (a) as Politico's Jonathan Martin notes, &quot;there are no serious anti-Obama 527s in existence nor are there any immediate plans to create such a group&quot; and (b) the only independent ad of any consequence now running in the entire country is an AFSCME-MoveOn.org co-production savaging McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, Obama's U-turn on public financing was not done for ideological reasons, it was done for Willie Sutton reasons: That's where the money is. It nonetheless betrayed a principle that so many in the press claimed to hold dear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As public financing is not a principle dear to me, I am hardly dismayed by Obama's abandonment of it. Nor am I disappointed in the least by his other calculated and cynical repositionings. I have never had any illusions about Obama. I merely note with amazement that his media swooners seem to accept his every policy reversal with an equanimity unseen since the Daily Worker would change the party line overnight -- switching sides in World War II, for example -- whenever the wind from Moscow changed direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth about Obama is uncomplicated. He is just a politician (though of unusual skill and ambition). The man who dared say it plainly is the man who knows Obama all too well. &quot;He does what politicians do,&quot; explained Jeremiah Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it's time to throw campaign finance reform, telecom accountability, NAFTA renegotiation or Jeremiah Wright overboard, Obama is not sentimental. He does not hesitate. He tosses lustily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why, the man even tossed his own grandmother overboard back in Philadelphia -- only to haul her back on deck now that her services are needed. Yesterday, granny was the moral equivalent of the raving Reverend Wright. Today, she is a featured prop in Obama's fuzzy-wuzzy get-to-know-me national TV ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not a flinch. Not a flicker. Not a hint of shame. By the time he's finished, Obama will have made the Clintons look scrupulous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">KYOTO, Japan, June 26</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush moved Thursday to drop North Korea from a list of countries that sponsor terrorism and to lift some trading sanctions, after the isolated totalitarian state turned over a long-delayed report that includes details of plutonium production in its nuclear program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly two years after North Korea stunned the world by detonating a small nuclear device, Bush said the declaration marked the start of an &quot;action for action&quot; process meant to end with full dismantling of the highly militarized country's nuclear facilities and nuclear weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush took office with an uncompromising approach to North Korea, designating it as part of an &quot;axis of evil.&quot; Later the administration moved toward engagement, sometimes looking the other way when the North faltered on its pledges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The communist state was six months late filing the report and omitted much of the information originally demanded, but U.S. officials greeted it Thursday as a significant step forward, while stressing that the job is just beginning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States has no illusions about the regime in Pyongyang,&quot; the North's capital, Bush said in a Rose Garden statement. The United States will continue to demand full verification that the nuclear program has been completely shut down. &quot;We remain deeply concerned about North Korea's human rights abuses . . . nuclear testing and proliferation, ballistic missile programs and the threat it continues to pose,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disarmament process has been tediously negotiated in six-country talks, with the North promising to give up its nuclear program in steps in return for aid and the end of sanctions. A highly photogenic next step is expected Friday afternoon, when the North's government has said it will blow up the cooling tower at its Yongbyon nuclear plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past nine months, technicians -- often working under the eye of U.S. experts -- have substantially disabled that facility, North Korea's major reactor. International television networks have been invited to document a demolition that U.S. officials say will both symbolize abandoned nuclear aspirations and make any future restarting of the plant more difficult.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">'A Lot Missing' </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 60-page declaration, handed over to Chinese officials in Beijing, reports on three separate &quot;campaigns&quot; of plutonium production from the early 1990s to 2005, according to a senior State Department official familiar with some of its contents. Plutonium, extremely radioactive, can be the main explosive material in nuclear bombs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of key interest will be how much plutonium the North Koreans say they made and whether they are perceived as declaring all of it. Estimates range from 30 to 50 kilograms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document was not released to the public, but officials said it did not address three key international concerns: a list of North Korea's nuclear weapons; a possible program to enrich uranium; and suspected sale of nuclear technology to other countries, including Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nuclear weapons experts had mixed reactions. &quot;There is some important progress represented by the agreement, but it's a worrisome omission with regard to Syria and highly enriched uranium. So there's a lot missing in this deal, and a lot wrong with this deal,&quot; said Michael J. Green, who was a Korea specialist on the National Security Council until 2005 and is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The North Koreans &quot;may conclude there is no serious consequence for testing weapons or transferring technology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector and now president of the Institute for Science and International Security, said the United States had made relatively small concessions to win significant steps from the North Koreans. &quot;They're pretty cheap to buy off -- sanctions and the terrorism list is not a huge thing to give up,&quot; he said.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">'Brazenly' Helping Syria </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Korea will be a major foreign policy challenge for the next U.S. president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), the Republican presidential candidate, cautioned Thursday that destruction of Yongbyon's cooling tower is still only a &quot;modest step&quot; and added: &quot;It is important to remember our goal has been the full, permanent and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.&quot; Washington must maintain diplomatic and economic pressure on the North until it fulfills all its obligations under six-nation talks, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's Democratic opponent, Sen. Barack Obama (Ill.), said that outstanding questions about the nuclear program must be answered and that he supported &quot;direct and aggressive diplomacy&quot; with the North.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed the hope the North Koreans would &quot;seize&quot; the current opportunity to &quot;improve relations with the United States -- as well as their neighbors -- by faithfully fulfilling their obligations.&quot; He added: &quot;If they do their part, I am confident that we will do ours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the toughest criticism came from Republicans. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) said in a statement that &quot;even while negotiating the agreement announced today, Pyongyang continued to brazenly assist another state sponsor of terrorism, Syria, in the development of an illicit nuclear program until an Israeli airstrike destroyed the facility in the Syrian desert last September.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Korea has agreed to verification principles that will allow outside experts to confirm the accuracy and completeness of information contained in  the declaration, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told reporters Thursday in Kyoto, where she had come for a meeting of foreign ministers of the Group of Eight industrialized countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early next week, diplomats from the six countries that are party to the nuclear talks -- North and South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States -- are to meet in Beijing. They will begin working out details for verifying the declaration's information and removing the North's plutonium from the country, U.S. officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush said Thursday that the disclosure was enough to warrant a relaxation of some of the steps that isolate the government of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provisions of the Trading With the Enemy Act will be lifted by proclamation, he said. In addition, North Korea's name will be removed from the list of state terrorism sponsors in 45 days, after congressional notification.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Worries in Japan </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While North Korea will no longer be officially considered an enemy, Bush and other officials in his administration emphasized Thursday that a complex web of other U.S. laws and sanctions remains in place, blocking a broad range of aid, trade and commercial activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By handing over the disclosure document Thursday, North Korea clears the way for substantial shipments of food, fuel and other aid. Severe food shortages have been predicted in North Korea for this summer; U.S. officials have pledged half a million tons of food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to remove North Korea from the terrorism list deeply worries Japan, the closest U.S. ally in Asia. It has argued that North Korea must first come clean with full details of its abduction of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and '80s. The fate of eight Japanese whom North Korea has acknowledged kidnapping but who the North says died years ago has become an obsession in Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said that Bush telephoned Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda on Wednesday to tell him that the United States remains concerned about the abduction issue. &quot;The United States will never forget the abduction of Japanese citizens,&quot; he said in his Rose Garden statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one in Japan is satisfied, but the Bush administration can say we have pressured North Korea to reopen negotiations with Japan about the abductees,&quot; said Ralph Cossa, president of the Pacific Forum of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Honolulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cossa said that if North Korea is removed from the  terrorism list, the principal regional losers will be &quot;Japan and the image of the United States in Japan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S. is now seen as less reliable than it has been for years,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minoru Morita, a political analyst in Tokyo, predicted that the U.S. move &quot;will probably light a small fire to Japanese nationalism and anti-Americanism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is a clear winner from Thursday's diplomatic maneuvering, it is North Korea, Cossa said. He noted that North Korea  delivered its declaration six months late and  reported nothing on Syria or uranium. &quot;Even though the North Koreans don't keep their promises very well, they demand that everybody else keep theirs,&quot; Cossa added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wright reported from Washington. Correspondent Jill Drew in Beijing and special correspondents Akiko Yamamoto in Tokyo and Stella Kim in Seoul contributed to this report.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1384 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court struck down the District of Columbia's ban on handgun possession yesterday and decided for the first time in the nation's history that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual's right to own a gun for self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court's landmark 5 to 4 decision split along ideological grounds and wiped away years of lower court decisions that had held that the intent of the amendment, ratified more than 200 years ago, was to tie the right of gun possession to militia service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the decision left for another time how the standards by which gun-control laws nationwide will be evaluated, it was decisive about the District's law, the strictest in the country. In addition to prohibiting ownership of handguns, the city also requires that shotguns and rifles be kept unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hold that the District's ban on handgun possession in the home violates the Second Amendment, as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense,&quot; Justice Antonin Scalia wrote. He was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Second Amendment, Scalia said, &quot;surely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opinion, the last and perhaps most anticipated ruling of the court's current term, delivered a bold and unmistakable endorsement of the individual right to own guns. At the same time, it raised as many questions as it answered about the ability of government to restrict gun ownership to promote public safety, a point made in detailed rebuttals from the liberals on the court, both from the bench and in two lengthy dissents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Stephen G. Breyer said the decision &quot;threatens to throw into doubt the constitutionality of gun laws throughout the United States,&quot; and he called that a &quot;formidable and potentially dangerous&quot; mission for the courts to undertake. He was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if to underscore the point, D.C. officials, who expressed disappointment with the ruling, vowed to replace the now-voided gun ban with strict handgun regulations, raising the possibility of further litigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Levy, a libertarian lawyer who had developed the strategy for challenging the D.C. law and recruited security guard Dick Heller and others as plaintiffs, said the court's ruling should be clear: &quot;The District may not attempt to solve its crime problems by violating the rights of law-abiding citizens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush administration had asked the court to recognize the individual right, and Scalia's broad, history-filled opinion went further. But the administration wanted the case sent back to a lower court for a fuller hearing on whether the D.C. law violated such a right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, President Bush seemed pleased with the result. &quot;As a longstanding advocate of the rights of gun owners in America, I applaud the Supreme Court's historic decision today confirming what has always been clear in the Constitution: The Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear firearms,&quot; he said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reaction from the presidential campaign trail was supportive, if a bit more so on one side than the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), the presumptive Republican nominee, called it a &quot;landmark victory&quot; for Second Amendment rights and criticized his rival's home town. &quot;Today's ruling . . . makes clear that other municipalities like Chicago that have banned handguns have infringed on the constitutional rights of Americans,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama (Ill.), the Democrats' all-but-certain nominee, issued a statement saying that &quot;I have always believed that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms, but I also identify with the need for crime-ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common-sense, effective safety measures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may not be surprising that both men would find something to like in the ruling, because Scalia concentrated on building a historical case for finding an individual right in the amendment's ambiguous 27 words. Setting standards for how courts and legislatures should decide the constitutional restrictions on gun control will evolve, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since this case represents this court's first in-depth examination of the Second Amendment, one should not expect it to clarify the entire field,&quot; Scalia wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One practical outcome of that strategy is that it probably kept Kennedy, who seemed at oral argument to be supportive of the individual right but worried about standards, with the majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 56 pages of the 64-page opinion, Scalia analyzed the historical and grammatical underpinnings of the amendment: &quot;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scalia drew on years of scholarly research to conclude that the amendment's opening clause about the need for a ready militia was only one of the reasons that the Framers recognized what he argued was a preexisting right to arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does the preface fit with an operative clause that creates an individual right to keep and bear arms?&quot; Scalia wrote. &quot;It fits perfectly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevens rebutted Scalia in 46 pages of his own, and the two engaged in a line-by-line battle over the meaning of the amendment. &quot;When each word in the text is given full effect, the Amendment is most naturally read to secure to the people a right to use and possess arms in conjunction with service in a well-regulated militia,&quot; Stevens wrote, adding that it meant &quot;no more than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Tushnet, a Harvard law professor who recently wrote a book about the Second Amendment, said the debate &quot;showed why lawyers shouldn't be historians,&quot; noting that Scalia and Stevens each wrote as though &quot;there's only one way to view what happened in 1791.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevens and especially Scalia often made their points in caustic and dismissive language. Throughout his opinion, Scalia used terms such as &quot;frivolous&quot; and &quot;absurdity&quot; to describe his opponents' legal reasoning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevens made his unhappiness known by reading parts of his dissent from the bench, and he pointedly recalled for his conservative colleagues Justice Felix Frankfurter, whom he called a &quot;true judicial conservative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two also sparred over the court's last look at the Second Amendment, in the 1939 case United States v. Miller. Scalia dismissed it as a halfhearted examination that did not consider the amendment's historical origins, while Stevens said that &quot;hundreds of judges have relied on&quot; it to view the amendment's guarantee as related to militia service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, whose decision the justices upheld yesterday in District of Columbia v. Heller, was the first to use the individual-right theory to strike a local gun-control law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How other restrictions will fare under the court's new directives is unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scalia said the opinion should not be read to cast doubt on &quot;longstanding prohibitions&quot; on gun possession by &quot;felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.&quot; He added that the list was not meant to be exhaustive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said the court recognized limitations on the right to keep and carry arms, and he indicated that federal bans on weapons such as machine guns may not be threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the majority declined to set a level of scrutiny by which judges should evaluate the constitutionality of gun restrictions that governments may set. It rejected Breyer's proposal to ask whether the statute burdens the right out of proportion to the &quot;salutary effects&quot; upon government interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breyer said the District's law would have met that burden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Scalia said one clear lesson from the decision is that the law went too far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table,&quot; he wrote. &quot;These include the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self-defense in the home.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A divided Supreme Court struck down the District's three-decade-old ban on handguns Thursday, ruling for the first time that the Constitution's Second Amendment guarantees individuals the right to own guns so they can protect themselves at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The landmark 5-4 decision is certain to renew the fierce national debate over gun control, as cities and states look for alternatives to conquer gun violence without running afoul of the court's ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Closer to home, Mayor Adrian M. Fenty vowed to enact a registration process that would allow the District to regulate gun ownership, while an emboldened National Rifle Association - the Northern Virginia-based gun lobby that helped make overturning the D.C. ban a cause celebre - set its sights on new legal fights to free gun owners from government restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our Founding Fathers wrote and intended the Second Amendment to be an individual right,&quot; said Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association, who called the court's ruling &quot;a great moment in American history.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Second Amendment as an individual right now becomes a real permanent part of American constitutional law,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the majority opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the court ruled for the first time since the Second Amendment was ratified in 1791 that the Founding Fathers intended for individuals also to own guns when they wrote into the Constitution's Bill of Rights that &quot;a well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Undoubtedly, some think that the Second Amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride of our nation, where well-trained police forces provide personal security, and where gun violence is a serious problem,&quot; Justice Scalia wrote. &quot;That is perhaps debatable, but what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the majority opinion pointed out that prior courts found prohibitions against carrying concealed weapons legal under the Second Amendment or &quot;state analogues,&quot; Justice Scalia only briefly mentioned the historical use of firearms for recreational purposes such as hunting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the justices appeared to leave untouched many other regulations involving guns, making clear that the government can regulate gun ownership for the public's safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms,&quot; Justice Scalia wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling elicited a wealth of opinions from lawmakers, the White House, presidential candidates and lobbyists on both sides of the gun-control issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama, the Illinois Democrat expected to win the party's presidential nomination, said the court's ruling endorsed his view that the Second Amendment provides for individual gun ownership while also allowing for &quot;common-sense, effective safety measures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that what works in Chicago may not work in Cheyenne,&quot; he said. &quot;Today's decision reinforces that if we act responsibly, we can both protect the constitutional right to bear arms and keep our communities and our children safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican and his party's presumptive nominee, applauded the decision and called gun ownership a &quot;sacred&quot; right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unlike the elitist view that believes Americans cling to guns out of bitterness, today's ruling recognizes that gun ownership is a fundamental right - sacred, just as the right to free speech and assembly,&quot; he said, referring to a comment made by Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gun ban case had divided the Bush administration. Solicitor General Paul G. Clement - concerned about how the ruling might impact existing federal laws - had urged the justices to return the case to a lower court for more consideration, while Vice President Dick Cheney signed on with congressional lawmakers asking the court to overturn the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House officials said, &quot;The president strongly agrees with the Supreme Court's historic decision today that the Second Amendment protects the individual right of Americans to keep and bear arms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The District of Columbia v. Heller case resulted in nearly 70 amicus briefs being filed on behalf of more than 320 members of Congress, 36 states and other interested parties on both sides of the case - some of whom were concerned about the consequences elsewhere in the country if the District's laws were struck down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the court's ruling, the NRA announced that it will file suits challenging gun laws in Chicago and San Francisco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's something we are preparing for, as early as tomorrow,&quot; San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, told The Washington Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Girese, counsel to Robert T. Johnson - the district attorney for Bronx County in New York - said the court was able to &quot;carve out some areas&quot; of the law where guns can be restricted but did not decide what standard of review to use when deciding if a prohibition is reasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That likely will lead to challenges on everything from gun laws to prior criminal convictions to firearm-licensing provisions, Mr. Girese said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a lot left unsettled by this decision,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benna Ruth Solomon, deputy corporation counsel for Chicago - which enacted a ban similar to the District's in 1982 - said a challenge to her city's laws would first have to overcome prior court rulings that state the Second Amendment does not apply to state and local governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amendment applies to the District because it is a federal enclave, Ms. Solomon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless and until the court changes that interpretation, the restrictions of the Second Amendment as interpreted today will not apply to state and local governments,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined in affirming the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Scalia argued in an extended historical and grammatical treatise that the intent of the Founding Fathers, structure of the Second Amendment and similar language contained in state constitutions provide for an individual right to bear arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also argued that the right to self-defense is inherent to the Second Amendment right to gun ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under any of the standards of scrutiny that we have applied to enumerated constitutional rights, banning from the home 'the most preferred firearm in the nation to keep and use for protection of one's home and family,' ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would fail constitutional muster,&quot; Justice Scalia wrote</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Stephen G. Breyer and David H. Souter dissented. Justice Stevens wrote that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to gun ownership but still &quot;does not tell us anything about the scope of that right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the majority opinion &quot;stakes its holding on a strained and unpersuasive reading of the amendment's text.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I fear that the District's policy choice may well be just the first of an unknown number of dominoes to be knocked off the table,&quot; Justice Stevens wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Breyer, who authored a separate dissenting opinion, said he disagreed with the majority in part because the District's gun law is &quot;permissible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is so because the District's regulation, which focuses upon the presence of handguns in high-crime urban areas, represents a permissible legislative response to a serious, indeed life-threatening, problem,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling was subsequently cheered by gun-rights activists and lamented by gun-control proponents. Alan Gura, the lawyer who argued against the ban on behalf of respondent Dick Anthony Heller, called Thursday &quot;a fantastic day for civil rights in our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned against new efforts by cities or states to restrict gun ownership in ways that might conflict with the Second Amendment right to bear arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're potentially stepping on an important civil right,&quot; Mr. Gura said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Heller, 66, said minutes after the ruling that he would register to purchase a handgun &quot;very soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very happy that now I'm able to defend myself and my household in my own home,&quot; Mr. Heller, a special police officer, said during a press conference in front of the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, disagreed with the Supreme Court ruling but said it leaves open possibilities for laws on licensing, registration and sales to restrict gun ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This opinion still allows common-sense gun-control laws,&quot; he said. &quot;What the court did today was that they limited the extremes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling also will force the District to revise its statutes regulating guns, although officials emphasized that the decision did not affect all of the city's firearms prohibitions and does not entitle anyone to carry firearms outside the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Fenty said the city's laws will remain intact for several weeks until a court injunction is issued that will officially prevent the District from enforcing the gun ban. He has directed the Metropolitan Police Department to develop a process for allowing &quot;qualified citizens&quot; to register their handguns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm disappointed in the court's ruling and believe introducing more handguns into the District will mean more handgun violence,&quot; said Mr. Fenty, Democrat. &quot;But I want to emphasize that at this moment, our gun laws remain in effect. It may be several weeks before there are changes to announce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The District's gun ban, the most stringent in the nation, was passed in June 1976 in a 12-1 vote by the D.C. Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It prohibits city residents, with few exceptions, from registering handguns and keeping them in the city. It also requires legal firearms such as shotguns and rifles to be stored disassembled or bound with trigger locks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 2003, Mr. Heller and five other residents sued the city in U.S. District Court, hoping to win the right to keep handguns and an assembled shotgun in their homes for self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, appointed to his post by President Clinton in 1994, dismissed the case about a year later. However, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the decision in March of last year with a 2-1 ruling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PALO ALTO, Calif.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifty years ago, Jack Kilby, who grew up in Great Bend, Kan., took the electrical engineering knowledge he acquired as an undergraduate at the University of Illinois and as a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin to Dallas, to Texas Instruments, where he helped invent the modern world as we routinely experience and manipulate it. Working with improvised equipment, he created the first electronic circuit in which all the components fit on a single piece of semiconductor material half the size of a paper clip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sept. 12, 1958, he demonstrated this microchip, which was enormous, not micro, by today's standards. Whereas one transistor was put in a silicon chip 50 years ago, today a billion transistors can occupy the same &quot;silicon real estate.&quot; In 1982 Kilby was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, where he is properly honored with the likes of Henry Ford and Thomas Edison. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you seek his monument, come to Silicon Valley, an incubator of the semiconductor industry. If you seek (redundant) evidence of the federal government's refusal to do the creative minimum -- to get out of the way of wealth creation -- come here and hear the talk about the perverse national policy of expelling talented people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modernity means the multiplication of dependencies on things utterly mysterious to those who are dependent -- things such as semiconductors, which control the functioning of almost everything from cellphones to computers to cars. &quot;The semiconductor,&quot; says a wit who manufactures  them, &quot;is the OPEC of functionality, except it has no cartel power.&quot; Semiconductors are, like oil, indispensable to the functioning of many things that are indispensable. Regarding oil imports, Americans agonize about a dependence they cannot immediately reduce. Yet their nation's policy is the compulsory expulsion or exclusion of talents crucial to the creativity of the semiconductor industry that powers the thriving portion of our bifurcated economy. While much of the economy sputters, exports are surging, and the semiconductor industry is America's second-largest exporter, close behind the auto industry in total exports and the civilian aircraft industry in net exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The semiconductor industry's problem is entangled with a subject about which the loquacious presidential candidates are reluctant to talk -- immigration, specifically that of highly educated people. Concerning whom, U.S. policy should be: A nation cannot have too many such people, so send us your PhDs yearning to be  free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, U.S. policy is: As soon as U.S. institutions of higher education have awarded you a PhD, equipping you to add vast value to the economy, get out. Go home. Or to Europe, which is responding to America's folly with &quot;blue cards&quot; to expedite acceptance of the immigrants America is spurning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two-thirds of doctoral candidates in science and engineering in U.S. universities are foreign-born. But only 140,000 employment-based green cards are available annually, and 1 million educated professionals are waiting -- often five or more years -- for cards. Congress could quickly add a zero to the number available, thereby boosting the U.S. economy and complicating matters for America's competitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suppose a foreign government had a policy of sending workers to America to be trained in a sophisticated and highly remunerative skill at American taxpayers' expense, and then forced these workers to go home and compete against American companies. That is what we are doing because we are too generic in defining the immigrant pool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama and other Democrats are theatrically indignant about U.S. companies that locate operations outside the country. But one reason Microsoft opened a software development center in Vancouver is that Canadian immigration laws allow Microsoft to recruit skilled people it could not retain under U.S. immigration restrictions. Mr. Change We Can Believe In is not advocating the simple change -- that added zero -- and neither is Mr. Straight Talk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain's campaign Web site has a spare statement on &quot;immigration reform&quot; that says nothing about increasing America's intake of highly educated immigrants. Obama's site says only: &quot;Where we can bring in more foreign-born workers with the skills our economy needs, we should.&quot; &quot;Where we can&quot;? We can now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solutions to some problems are complex; removing barriers to educated immigrants is not. It is, however, politically difficult, partly because this reform is being held hostage by factions -- principally the Congressional Hispanic Caucus -- insisting on &quot;comprehensive&quot; immigration reform that satisfies their demands. Unfortunately, on this issue no one is advocating change we can believe in, so America continues to risk losing the value added by foreign-born Jack Kilbys.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak of enthusiasm is a striking shift from the spring, when Republican advertisements from North Carolina to Mississippi to Illinois ominously painted Obama as an out-of-touch liberal bringing his brand of politics to regions of the country that should shun it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Ken Spain said the GOP will stick to that script this fall &quot;on a district-by-district basis.&quot; But a senior Republican strategist involved in House races said that strategy is now largely dead, &quot;except in rare instances, and I'm not sure it was a good idea in the first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tactic initially caused some Democrats to distance themselves from the senator from Illinois, but now most are eager to be as closely associated with his campaign as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New Hampshire, Democratic Senate candidate and former governor Jeanne Shaheen will campaign in Manchester today with Michelle Obama, whom Republicans have tried to turn into a political liability. Conservative House Democrat John Barrow has persuaded Obama to cut a radio advertisement for him ahead of his July primary in Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate campaign spokesmen for Democrats Tom Allen in Maine, Kay Hagan in North Carolina, Al Franken in Minnesota and Rick Noriega in Texas all said they have reached out to the Obama campaign and are pleading for a visit from either the candidate or his wife. Their efforts are not entirely surprising, given Obama's strength in those states during the Democratic primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Smith is a Republican, and his new television advertisement is unabashed in its attempt to portray Obama and him as partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who says Gordon Smith helped lead the fight for better gas mileage and a cleaner environment?&quot; a female narrator asks. &quot;Barack Obama.&quot; The ad then flashes to an image of Obama's face and his campaign Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fearing that the spot will confuse voters, Obama's campaign sent out a release Tuesday making it clear that he supports Smith's opponent, Democrat Jeff Merkley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Thomas M. Reynolds (R-N.Y.), who headed the NRCC in 2006, when the GOP was swept from power in Congress, said Smith's ad is smart, using the key West Coast issues of energy and fuel efficiency to distance the senator from President Bush and the Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith was one of the first senators to endorse presumptive Republican nominee John McCain during the primary season, but, Reynolds said, &quot;at the end of the day, although a lot of Republican strategists can say Oregon is in play, it would be a surprise if he wins it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remarkable as Smith's imagery is, Barrow's advertisement may be more telling. In May, Republicans tried to use the specter of Obama to sink another Southern Democrat, Travis Childers, who responded with an ad that said he had never sought Obama's endorsement and had never met him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Childers won his northern Mississippi district by a wider-than-expected margin, in part because Democratic strategists cited the anti-Obama tactics to rally black voters. The same dynamic -- anti-Obama attacks followed by a Democratic victory -- played out last month in a special election for a House seat in the Baton Rouge area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barrow, who beat his Republican opponent in 2006 by 864 votes, might have been as skittish as Childers, but he decided that Obama's endorsement could only help him in an unanticipated primary fight against African American state senator Regina Thomas -- as well as in the general election. Just as Childers benefited from black voter turnout, Barrow, who is white, believes that Obama can rally an often-skeptical Southern black electorate to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Obama decided Barrow had a better chance of holding the seat -- whose district stretches from Savannah to Augusta -- than the more liberal Thomas. Democratic strategists said the primary contest could serve as a test of Obama's strength outside Atlanta, in a state that he intends to contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's efforts on behalf of Barrow also jibe with his efforts to broaden the electoral map.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign manager David Plouffe laid out that plan yesterday, predicting that the campaign's &quot;50-state strategy&quot; will help Democrats down the ballot. Obama ads will soon be on televisions in traditional swing states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and Wisconsin, as well as in the longtime Republican strongholds of Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina, Alaska and Montana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign will dispatch workers to some states, such as Wyoming and Texas, not to win them but to help Democratic congressional candidates rally voter turnout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans scoffed at the strategy yesterday. Spain noted that at least half a dozen House Democrats, including some in districts where Obama lost badly to Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.) in the primaries, have refused to publicly endorse Obama. One of them, Rep. Dan Boren (D-Okla.) called Obama &quot;the most liberal senator,&quot; although he said he will vote Democratic in the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like so much about Barack Obama's campaign, his campaign manager's words don't match reality,&quot; said Republican National Committee spokesman Alex Conant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain pledged yesterday that he would make the federal government more environmentally friendly, while Sen. Barack Obama mocked his rival as  crafting energy policies that merely pander to voters, in the latest skirmish over which presidential candidate is better prepared to tackle the nation's energy and environmental problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech in Santa Barbara, Calif., McCain (R-Ariz.) vowed to &quot;put the purchasing power of the United States government on the side of green technology&quot; by buying fuel-efficient vehicles for its civilian fleet of cars and trucks and by retrofitting federal office space. The pledge comes months after Obama (D-Ill.) outlined a more detailed and ambitious proposal on the subject, virtually ensuring that the next administration will take significant steps to lower the government's output of energy and pollution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A greening of the government would probably have a major impact on the Washington region, as the modernizing of buildings would spark a mini-construction boom and ease  energy demands. Cleaner vehicles would also reduce harmful auto emissions, environmentalists say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every year, the federal government buys upwards of 60,000 cars and other vehicles, not including military or law enforcement vehicles,&quot; McCain said as he campaigned with California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a prominent GOP environmentalist. &quot;From now on, we're going to make those civilian vehicles flex-fuel capable, plug-in hybrid, or cars fueled by clean natural gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying that the U.S. government ranks as &quot;the single largest consumer of electricity in the world&quot; because it holds sway over &quot;3.3 billion square feet of federal office space&quot; worldwide, McCain said he plans to reduce the government's carbon footprint by updating its buildings and demanding better standards in new ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By retrofitting where possible, and by applying a higher efficiency standard to new buildings leased or purchased, we can save taxpayers billions of dollars in energy costs and move the market in the direction of green technology,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain did not provide details about his plan, causing some public watchdog and environmental groups to question how much energy would be saved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who first set his targets last October, has promised that he would make all new federal buildings 40 percent more efficient than current ones within five years, and carbon-neutral by 2025. He has also pledged to increase efficiency of existing federal buildings by 25 percent within five years and to ensure that the government derives 30 percent of its electricity from renewable energy by 2020 -- none of which McCain has promised to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bush has already instituted energy-efficiency measures for the White House and the government. The changes are not as dramatic as the proposals Obama has outlined, though they are more specific than McCain's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 2007, the president issued an executive order calling on the government to &quot;increase purchase of alternative fuel, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles when commercially available&quot; and to &quot;reduce petroleum consumption in fleet vehicles by 2 percent annually through 2015,&quot; among other measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and Laura Bush have also made changes in the White House, replacing all incandescent bulbs in hallways with compact fluorescent lights, installing low-consumption toilets in many places and putting in energy-efficient cooling units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a town hall meeting yesterday in a nature preserve near the Las Vegas Strip, Obama criticized his rival's  energy plans, though he did not mention McCain's proposal to &quot;green&quot; the federal government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to a McCain statement Monday in which the senator from Arizona acknowledged that new offshore U.S. drilling would not affect oil prices for years, Obama said that the presumptive GOP nominee is focused on extolling the &quot;psychological&quot; benefits of drilling. He called McCain's proposed $300 million prize for a new electric car battery a &quot;bounty&quot; for &quot;some rocket scientist to win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama described the nation's current high gasoline prices as the product of &quot;false promises and irresponsible policies&quot; that have prevented new technology and energy sources from replacing fossil fuels. &quot;For decades, John McCain has been part of this failure in Washington,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign responded by saying that &quot;Barack Obama has become the 'Dr. No' of energy, refusing to accept any idea that will contribute to solving America's energy crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside groups yesterday praised both candidates for seeking to curb the government's carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julia Bovey, spokeswoman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said municipal governments have made similar changes and cut back on their energy use as a result. &quot;We have seen cities and towns across America make a point to start buying efficient cars and trucks, and it can really make a difference,&quot; she said. &quot;There's no reason the federal government should continue to buy dinosaurs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Ellis, vice president of the budget watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, said the government should pursue &quot;a generic approach, meaning certain companies or favored individuals aren't getting huge windfalls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the federal government tries to pursue strategies to make its operation more efficient, as long as you do it in a cost-efficient manner, you're helping lead the way,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stalled U.S.-India nuclear cooperation deal faces a make-or-break hurdle Wednesday as warring factions within India's coalition government meet to decide whether to push ahead with the ambitious pact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But top U.S. officials and private analysts are already talking as if the agreement, intended to be a centerpiece of President Bush's second-term foreign policy agenda, has little chance of passing before Mr. Bush leaves office in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't quite say it's dead yet,&quot; said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association and a critic of the nuclear pact. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's somewhere between the intensive care unit and the morgue right now,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With U.S. congressional approval still needed on any final deal, the protracted negotiations in New Delhi may mean that any accord will have to wait for the Obama or McCain administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reality, of course, is that every day that goes by is one less day on the legislative calendar for us to be able to have congressional action take place,&quot; State Department spokesman Tom Casey said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'd like to believe that this deal is one that can and should be supported by whoever comes into office in January 2009, but, obviously, the next U.S. government will have to make their own decisions on it,&quot; the spokesman added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush hailed the August 2007 accord as a major opportunity for U.S. exporters and an opening to build a much broader strategic and political alliance with one of the rising powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its core, the deal would give New Delhi access to now-forbidden U.S. nuclear fuel and technology in return for allowing international oversight and inspection of India's civilian nuclear industry. India's military nuclear programs would not be covered by the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many U.S. critics saw the deal as highly favorable to India, but the accord has been unexpectedly caught up in a fierce political debate in New Delhi. Leftist parties have opposed the idea of a close relationship with Washington, while the leading opposition parties say the deal imposes unacceptable restraints on India's sovereignty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh cannot persuade Communist parties in his minority government to back the deal, political analysts say the clash could bring down the government and force early elections this fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with polls showing a rough political landscape for the government, Mr. Singh could decide to drop the nuclear deal or press for major changes. Both scenarios would deny Mr. Bush the foreign policy breakthrough he sought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a revised deal could be resurrected in 2009, a new U.S. administration and new Congress will need time to consider the deal. But U.S. officials are already trying to minimize the fallout from the possible collapse of what was intended to be the symbolic and economic core of a new relationship between Washington and New Delhi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Ambassador to India David Mulford, in a recent interview with the Hindu newspaper, acknowledged the protracted nuclear debate had &quot;sucked the oxygen out of everything else&quot; in the bilateral relationship. But he said that commercial, economic and cultural ties between the two countries remain solid and growing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael A. Levi and Charles D. Ferguson, fellows at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the U.S. administration and Congress should push for a more modest agreement, warning in a study earlier this month that outright rejection of the deal &quot;would have a real and negative effect on the bilateral relationship.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TNT will debut a new crime thriller series from Dean Devlin (&quot;Independence Day,&quot; &quot;The Librarian&quot;) called &quot;Blank Slate&quot; on Sept. 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next week, TNT will telecast the series finale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a very, very short series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in: two minutes per episode. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five of these episodes will air during TNT telecasts of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; reruns on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. TNT has ordered 20 episodes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the show's stars: two Acura cars, the TSX and the RL, which will be heavily featured in almost every episode. In promos, TNT will say things such as &quot;stay tuned to 'Blank Slate' presented by Acura.&quot; The episodes of &quot;Blank Slate Presented by Acura&quot; will air during the commercial breaks in the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; reruns, a network spokeswoman told The TV Column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where I come from, these are called &quot;ads.&quot; &quot;Fancy-schmancy ads&quot; is the technical phrase, I think. Kind of like those old Taster's Choice commercials with the hot young coffee-craving chick and her hot young coffee-supplying guy neighbor (hot steamy relationship ensued). Except with a much bigger budget. And about 90-seconds longer per episode. And, of course, with two Acura cars. And no coffee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's one bit of good news. You know those annoying pop-up ads that, um, pop up on the screen when you're trying to watch prime-time series on TNT? TNT will absolutely not clutter up episodes of &quot;Blank Slate&quot; with any stinkin' pop-up ads. Might block the view of the Acura TSX.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acura couldn't be happier about the new &quot;micro-series,&quot; noting the show's story line -- SPOILER ALERT -- &quot;integrates the advanced intuitive technologies of the Acura TSX and RL, while showcasing the car's sleek and modern design,&quot; according to Susie Rossick, Acura advertising manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Written and directed by John Harrison of &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Tales From the Crypt&quot; fame, &quot;Blank Slate&quot; is about one Anne Huston, who wakes up in an &quot;execution chamber&quot; after being accused of killing a federal agent. She is suffering from amnesia, which makes her &quot;the perfect candidate&quot; to become the guinea pig for a new FBI program in which memories of recent murder victims are implanted into living people, who are then given Acura TSXes to drive -- RLs for the weekends. You and I know they'd save a lot of time and money if they just kidnapped Barry Sonnenfeld's pie-making guy, who can bring murder victims back to life temporarily and ask them whodunnit, but try explaining that to the FBI.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their first broadcast since having Michelle Obama as guest co-host, The Ladies of &quot;The View&quot; made-for-TV-marveled over all the attention they received in the media from that visit with the wife of the Democratic presidential candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everywhere you looked all weekend, up until really this morning, there was Michelle on our show,&quot; Whoopi Goldberg gushed faux incredulously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whoopi insisted the timing of Obama's visit had nothing to do with efforts to fix her public image, as some reporters suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It had nothing to do with changing over who she was. . . . We have been talking to this woman since December about coming on to 'The View,' &quot; Whoopi said on yesterday's show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It happened also because it was just the time where there were all of these articles about 'Is she going to be a help?' 'Is she not?' 'What is she going to be like?' 'Do we really know her?' I mean, it just, it was the perfect timing,&quot; added sometime-journalist Barbara Walters, who showed up for the discussion on a purple bed, carried by four ginormous gladiators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fairness, the show was being broadcast live from Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, don't forget, you know, Cindy McCain was our guest co-host in April,&quot; Whoopi added. &quot;Now, did you guys think the media covered her period?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Her appearance?&quot; Whoopi added, clarifying her double-entendre so as to avoid any pesky &quot;Cindy McCain Menopausal, 'The View' Reveals&quot; blogger headlines along the lines of those &quot;Michelle Obama Says Her Husband Is 'Kind and Pathetic' &quot; headlines that plagued the show after the wannabe first lady told The Ladies her husband is &quot;kind, empathetic.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question isn't whether race will be an issue in the general election campaign between Barack Obama and John McCain. Race is already an issue, even if it is largely confined to the shadow world of implication and coded language. Obama is now dragging the race issue into the sunlight -- a move that has to be considered both risky and inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I say inevitable because the fact of Obama's race isn't something that voters could possibly miss, whatever they think about it. The riskiness of dealing openly with race is every bit as obvious as Obama's skin color: A new Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that three of every 10 Americans acknowledge having &quot;at least some feelings of racial prejudice.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other findings in the survey suggest that the distance between blacks and whites in this country has narrowed steadily in recent decades; nearly eight of 10 whites say they have a &quot;fairly close personal friend&quot; who is black, for example, while barely more than half of whites reported having black friends when the question was asked in 1981. Still, the poll suggests that as far as we've come on matters of race, we have a long way to go -- and that some reservoir of racial suspicion remains, should anyone want to try to exploit it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, speaking at a fundraiser in Jacksonville, Obama made what can only be described as a preemptive strike. &quot;It is going to be very difficult for Republicans to run on their stewardship of the economy or their outstanding foreign policy,&quot; he said. &quot;We know what kind of campaign they're going to run. They're going to try to make you afraid. They're going to try to make you afraid of me. 'He's young and inexperienced, and he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?' &quot; He went on to predict that Republicans would say that &quot;he's got a feisty wife&quot; as a way of attacking Michelle Obama. &quot;We know the strategy because they've already shown their cards,&quot; he said. &quot;Ultimately, I think the American people recognize that old stuff hasn't moved us forward. That old stuff just divides us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party has a problematic history on race, beginning with Nixon's &quot;Southern strategy.&quot; The era when the likes of the late Lee Atwater could overtly use race as a wedge issue is long gone. Today, any appeal to latent racial prejudice would have to be made more subtly -- the suggestion that there's something of the &quot;other&quot; about Obama, that he might not share traditional American values, that there's some question about his love of country. Given the steadfast patriotism that African Americans have displayed since the nation's founding, none of this makes historical sense. But it's more about the vibe than the reality, and the fact is that voters are attuned not just to what a presidential candidate says but also to how the candidate makes them feel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Obama has given his opponents little ammunition, they have focused on those who are close to him, beginning with his former pastor. Now some critics have turned to Obama's &quot;feisty&quot; wife, whose image as a tall, strong, confident black woman can perhaps be made to seem threatening to some people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there are voters who absolutely won't support Obama because of his race, there's not much he can do about it. But at least he can blow away all the smoke. He has served notice that he doesn't intend to be Swift-boated on race the way John Kerry was on his war record -- and that he will hit back even when attacks are more atmospheric than concrete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign made another move on this front last week when it began running a new television ad in a number of battleground states, including some, such as Georgia and North Carolina, that Republicans have long considered safe. In the ad, which is more about the candidate's character than his policies, Obama speaks of his personal history and delivers a paean to traditional American values -- while the viewer sees old family photos of his mother, who was white, and her parents, who helped raise him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to see the ad's iconography as anything but a reminder that while Obama is firmly self-identified as African American, he is also biracial. He is a black man who speaks with great affection and admiration for his white grandparents, who look like Middle America personified. The message: Race may be thorny and complicated, but it's no match for love.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the opening weeks of the general-election campaign, Sen. Barack Obama has moved aggressively to shape his campaign and offered a clear road map for the kind of candidate he is likely to become in the months ahead: an ambitious gamer of the electoral map, a ruthless fundraiser and a scrupulous manager of his own biography in the face of persistent concerns about how he is perceived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's early maneuvers suggest a clear understanding within the campaign of his strengths and weaknesses. He bought air time in 18 states, a sure sign that he hopes to expand Democrats' traditional electoral map. He opted out of the public campaign-financing system -- revealing his determination to press his financial advantage, even at the cost of handing his Republican opponent the opportunity to raise questions about the sincerity of his rhetoric on reform. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with a first ad that delves into his biography, Obama acknowledged ongoing concerns among his advisers that voters do not know whether he shares the values and beliefs of ordinary Americans, a potentially critical vulnerability. The ad speaks to the reality that enough questions were raised about Obama through the long nomination battle that he needs to address them. The campaign's concerns include both taking on misinformation -- such as the persistent claim that he is Muslim when he is in fact a Christian -- and framing a biography unlike that of any nominee in the modern era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any of the attempts to describe him inaccurately he takes head-on with the new commercial,&quot; said Valerie Jarrett, one of Obama's closest friends and confidants. &quot;You begin a new campaign with an introduction. You can't presume that everybody was paying attention during the primary season. So let's start with basics. He describes his roots, his philosophy, his love of country. That's a really good start.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Margolis, Obama's media adviser, said that, despite the long primary season, Obama still is not well known to voters in many parts of the country. &quot;They don't know the full story,&quot; he said. &quot;They don't have a complete sense of what motivates him, what are the biographical points of his life that have made him the person that he is today and what he wants to do as president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Margolis said the campaign is primarily working to fill an information vacuum, but he acknowledged that combating rumors that could endanger Obama's candidacy is also part of the motivation behind the opening ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are just a lot of big holes there for a lot of people,&quot; he said. &quot;But, to be sure, we live in a different world than we lived in before. This campaign is only possible because of the Internet, because of the technology, because we could raise a couple of hundred million dollars [from] 1.5 million Americans who on average gave less than $100 each. Could not have happened 10 years ago. On the other hand, you're constantly dealing with the misinformation that can spread quickly, where in 24 hours you can get millions of hits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as the campaign seeks to take control of Obama's image, hammering home the message that his is a thoroughly American story, the decision last week to opt out of the public financing system -- and forgoing more than $84 million in campaign funds -- added a new dimension to his profile as a politician. And it appeared to immediately cut both ways. Sen. John McCain pounced on the decision, questioning Obama's character. &quot;He has completely reversed himself and gone back, not on his word to me, but the commitment he made to the American people,&quot; McCain told reporters Thursday, citing Obama's initial pledge to stay within the existing campaign finance rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Obama's advocates also argue a positive lesson about their candidate's character can be drawn from the decision: that Obama is willing to take political risks in order to win. His toughness as a politician was often questioned during the Democratic primary, as Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton cast herself as the only Democrat able to do hand-to-hand combat with Republicans. &quot;People and commentators have been saying we know Barack is hopeful and that he appeals to a broad cross section of the public,&quot; Jarrett said. &quot;But perhaps people didn't know how tough he is. He's been saying all along, don't confuse hope with naivete.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If some Republicans rue the swift and calculated nature they say characterizes Obama's early steps, his campaign advisers say they have needed to move quickly to make up for the months spent waging the extended primary race. They cast the decision on public financing, for example, as motivated partly by timing, with just four full months left until Election Day to provide voters with the vision of Obama they hope to establish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scope of Obama's first advertising buy sent an unmistakable signal to McCain and the GOP that, at least initially, the senator from Illinois will invest money in states no Democrat has won in years, including Georgia, Indiana and Alaska. A recent poll for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee showed Obama within two points of McCain in Alaska, although well below 50 percent. Obama campaign manager David Plouffe predicted that Indiana &quot;is going to be a dogfight&quot; in the fall, even though Obama lost the primary there in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The content of the ad drew plaudits even from some Republicans for its focus on values, tax cuts and welfare reform. &quot;He is not trying to cobble together the old Democratic coalition of interest groups and get 48 percent like John Kerry,&quot; Alex Castellanos, a Republican media consultant, said in an e-mail message. &quot;This is not three yards and a cloud of dust. This is an aggressive leap across the 50-yard line to play on Republican turf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the past week, other elements of Obama's aggressive outreach were on display. Shifting increasingly toward general-election issues, he met with military officers and a newly formed national security working group. He hit McCain over a secret meeting the Republican held with Hispanics in Chicago -- a hit that is part of his effort to win over a group that backed Clinton overwhelmingly in the primary and could be key to helping him reshape his electoral opportunities to include Western states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At his meeting with 16 Democratic governors on Friday, the participants, including some of Clinton's most politically important backers, gushed about the degree to which his campaign staff had sought their input, inviting them to Chicago for dinner, putting them onstage with Obama at a briefing and asking each governor to bring in a top political aide who can be involved in planning as the campaign progresses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This isn't about 'I'm coming to your state, and can you go do a photo op,' &quot; said Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius. Another Democratic governor, Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan, said the level of contact from the Obama campaign has surpassed any she has ever received from a presidential candidate. &quot;We've never been reached out to in this way,&quot; said Granholm, a former Clinton supporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that he is running in a year in which the political climate is as favorable for the Democrats as it has been in any year in recent memory, one question the Obama team must grapple with is why the presumptive Democratic nominee does not have a more substantial lead over McCain in early polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top advisers point to several factors. First, they acknowledge that the long nomination battle has left scars within the party. Right now, polls show that Obama is winning a smaller share of Democratic support than McCain is winning of Republican support. Campaign officials expect that to change as the summer progresses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they also acknowledge that McCain runs better with independent voters than anyone else the GOP might have nominated. By the fall they hope to have drawn enough distinctions with McCain to make those independents think twice about their support for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, they argue, they have not yet begun to compete for Republican support, particularly among women who favor abortion rights or GOP voters disaffected with President Bush. In the end, they believe that whichever candidate wins the highest percentage of voters in the other party is likely to be the next occupant of the White House.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama was chatting with Katrina Davis, a Missouri woman whose daughter was hospitalized with a heart ailment, when he turned the talk to the half-dozen 7-year-olds who had slept over for his daughter's birthday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know Chuck E. Cheese,&quot; Obama said as a group of reporters looked on. &quot;That's as noisy a place as there is on Earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his march to the Democratic presidential nomination, the Illinois senator has demonstrated an ability to mesmerize 20,000 people in an arena, but for all his sudden fame, most voters know little about the texture of his life. Now, in ways large and small, he and his staff are trying to add some dabs of color to a gauzy portrait, using media coverage to convey the sense of a down-to-earth fellow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here he is on Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show, chatting about how his daughters like to make pancakes with whipped cream on Sundays before they go off to church. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There he is with his wife on the cover of Us Weekly, released the same day that Michelle Obama locked arms with Barbara Walters and talked about her disdain for pantyhose on &quot;The View.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here he is riding his bike in a helmet and tucked-in polo shirt, joking afterward that he figured the press would portray him like Michael Dukakis &quot;wearing that tank helmet&quot; and that some bloggers &quot;said I looked like Urkel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There he is with his first general-election ad, showcasing his single mom and grandparents who &quot;taught me values straight from the Kansas heartland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's staff says no artifice is involved. &quot;The most extraordinary thing about him, maybe the most surprising, is how normal he is,&quot; says David Axelrod, his chief strategist. &quot;He'll read Foreign Policy magazine, a treatise on economic policy and Sports Illustrated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outlines of Obama's life are well known. The son of a Kenyan father who abandoned him, he rocketed to success: Harvard Law School, best-selling author, Illinois lawmaker, freshman senator who seized the nomination from Hillary Clinton, preaching the audacity of hope to large and boisterous crowds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is a less flattering side. For weeks, the most relentlessly reported fact about him was that he was a member of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright's church. He was mocked for asking an Iowa crowd about the price of arugula at Whole Foods, a store with no outlets in the state, and for rolling gutter balls at a Pennsylvania bowling alley. As he struggled with working-class voters, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd said that &quot;his exclusive Hawaiian prep school and years in the Ivy League made him a charter member of the elite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama strategists say there is no grand plan to overhaul their man's image. &quot;Sometimes a bike ride with your family is just a bike ride with your family,&quot; says press secretary Bill Burton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But few things are left to chance in a presidential campaign, especially media venues. &quot;We're doing everything we can to reach voters where they are,&quot; Burton says. &quot;A pretty small percentage of voters read The Washington Post.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidates routinely try to sell their preferred personal narrative, and recent history confirms that such things matter. When John Kerry went windsurfing in 2004, President Bush's campaign used the footage to mock the Democratic nominee. President Bill Clinton famously vacationed in Jackson Hole, Wyo., where he was photographed riding a horse and wearing a cowboy hat, after pollster Dick Morris determined that would be more popular than another Martha's Vineyard retreat. And George H.W. Bush discovered a love for pork rinds in his 1988 campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In posing for Us Weekly, Obama is stealing a page from Clinton, who appeared on People's cover with Hillary and Chelsea after clinching the 1992 nomination, at a time when research showed many people didn't even know he had a daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Us Weekly Editor Janice Min says the Obama campaign immediately agreed to the request by her magazine, whose soft-focus profile dealt with such matters as Michelle Obama shopping at Target and enjoying &quot;Sex and the City.&quot; &quot;It was a clear win for them,&quot; she says. &quot;To me, Barack Obama and Michelle Obama have that certain air of celebrity about them that not many politicians end up having.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Todd Harris, a Republican strategist who worked for John McCain's 2000 campaign, says Obama is in danger of being pigeonholed because of his Harvard pedigree and remarks about &quot;bitter&quot; small-town residents who cling to religion and guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cement has already been set to label Obama as an elitist,&quot; Harris says. &quot;Whether his campaign lets it dry will be up to what they do. The idea is to make him someone the average swing voter in the Midwest can relate to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenge may be slightly greater for Obama because of his unusual name, biracial heritage and early childhood in Indonesia. &quot;When you're famous but not well known, you're an empty vessel that can be filled up by one side or the other,&quot; says Chris Lehane, a strategist for Al Gore's 2000 campaign. &quot;You try to find social signifiers that people will be drawn to.&quot; This is particularly true, he says, for &quot;an African American who by definition needs to appeal to folks who may not have had a lot of interaction with African Americans on a daily basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has not mounted a comparable effort. He is occasionally photographed barbecuing ribs at his Arizona ranch and has been interviewed by Jon Stewart and Ellen DeGeneres. His wife, Cindy, did a photo shoot for Vogue and also appeared on &quot;The View,&quot; while his daughter Meghan maintains a lighthearted blog. McCain has been on the national stage for two decades, and aides believe his image is well defined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain strategists also recognize that Obama is treated as a phenomenon and simply draws more media coverage. Since 2006, Obama has been featured on 11 Time and Newsweek covers (and Michelle Obama has one appearance), compared with five for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Obama is a talented orator, there is a natural reserve about him when he meets with small groups. While touring the St. Louis hospital, he politely questioned several heart patients and wished them well but displayed no real emotion. The campaign's aim is to convey a warm and relaxed person who, despite his deficient bowling skills, can relate to the concerns of working Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Linda Douglass, Obama's spokeswoman, told Time's Mark Halperin that Obama &quot;is a serious movie and TV buff. To test his knowledge of 'The Godfather,' I asked him who betrayed Michael Corleone by setting up the meeting with Barzini: Clemenza or Tessio? He rolled his eyes and said, 'Tessio, of course.' He added that Tessio was played by Abe Vigoda, who, he pointed out, was also on the TV show 'Barney Miller.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That tidbit was widely picked up after Halperin posted it June 6 on Time.com. Douglass has also asked Obama about his cooking skills, telling a reporter that he enjoys making curry and Chinese dishes. She calls Obama &quot;the most normal person I've ever met&quot; running for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is practically required these days for candidates to work the entertainment shows -- Obama danced with DeGeneres, for instance -- as a way of showcasing their lighter side. But the Obama effort has intensified lately. On Father's Day, he used a Chicago church to talk about how his father abandoned him at age 2, while hailing &quot;two wonderful grandparents from Kansas who poured everything they had into helping my mother raise my sister and me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sports can serve as a common denominator. When Gore was being painted as an egghead in earth tones, Lehane says, aides had him run a few plays with the Pittsburgh Steelers and pitch batting practice to the Detroit Tigers as a way of courting fans. Such lessons have not been lost on the Obama camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's love of basketball is well known. But it wasn't until April that HBO's &quot;Real Sports&quot; was allowed to air footage of him on the court. &quot;I can't imagine more fun than having a good pickup basketball game,&quot; he told host Bryant Gumbel, especially &quot;when you're actually hitting some shots.&quot; It didn't hurt that he scored the game-winning layup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jock narrative continued when Obama's traveling aide, Reggie Love, told the New York Times how the two men wind down after a long day by watching ESPN's &quot;SportsCenter.&quot; And Obama repeatedly played hoops before the cameras during the final primaries, in one case with the University of North Carolina Tar Heels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such images can be an asset in neutralizing the false rumors that have been dogging Obama. &quot;Where there are gaps in knowledge, there's always the danger of misinformation,&quot; Axelrod says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media can also serve as a megaphone. After the Chicago biking excursion two weeks ago, Boston Herald columnist Margery Eagan wrote: &quot;It's hard to get Willie Hortoned -- turned into the radical black guy who gives white America the heebie jeebies -- when you look as suburban, as unchic, as let's-hop-in-the-Explorer-and-head-to-Costco wonky as Obama looks in this oh-no! photo.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama's team once worried that the presidential hopeful was widely unknown, but now he faces a challenge in making sure voters know the right things about the presumptive Democratic nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One year ago, Mr. Obama's camp cheered polls showing he had gone from 53 percent name recognition to 75 percent. Now that he has defeated one of the best-known Democrats in the country, nearly all U.S. voters recognize Mr. Obama's name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is, many don't know much about his background or where he stands on the issues, and Republicans and groups working for his defeat in November are working to define him on their terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama on Friday told reporters he is &quot;still relatively new on the national scene&quot; compared with presumptive Republican nominee Sen. JohnMcCain of Arizona. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got a lot of work to do everywhere,&quot; he said. &quot;John McCain's a fine man and somebody who has been in the public eye for a long time. ... When your name is Barack Obama, you're like Avis; you've got to work, you know, twice as hard&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's one reason Mr. Obama has rolled out an 18-state biographical ad campaign portraying him as having fierce love for his country and detailing his legislative record of cutting taxes &quot;for working families&quot; and passing laws &quot;moving people from welfare to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator from Illinois often talks about bipartisanship, and notes on his Web site that his first bill signed into law was co-sponsored with Sen. Tom Coburn, Oklahoma Republican, to create a searchable Internet database tracking federal grants and contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Mr. Obama is &quot;very unknown&quot; while Mr. McCain remains &quot;not all that well known,&quot; said pollster Scott Rasmussen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the first election in a very long time that what the candidates do between now and November will determine who wins,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the positions of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain remain relatively undefined for voters, who on Nov. 4 face the first election since 1952 without an incumbent president or sitting vice president on either ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several polls show that at least half of voters are unfamiliar with where either candidate stands on the issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is not surprised that there is not a &quot;real hard and fast recognition of everything each one of these guys stand for&quot; or recognition much beyond their names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously that's our challenge in the next few months is to fill that in in a way that is greater and more compelling than what the Republicans will do or what [independent pro-Republican groups] will try to do,&quot; he said Thursday at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Republicans are labeling Mr. Obama as they have other Democrats for years, saying he would govern as a &quot;tax-and-spend liberal,&quot; but also are exploiting his errors to cast doubt in the minds of Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, a Republican, listed his party's talking points about Mr. Obama's liabilities: his controversial former pastor, his wife's comments about pride in America and the candidate's remarks that some people are &quot;bitter&quot; and &quot;cling&quot; to guns, religion or nativism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are so many unanswered questions about who Barack Obama is,&quot; Mr. Bolling told The Washington Times. &quot;A lot of pieces of the puzzle that just don't fit - with Jeremiah Wright and that church in Chicago [and] comments his wife has made. People are just a little bit uncertain about who this guy really is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican labeled Mr. Obama &quot;untried and unproven&quot; and called him the &quot;least qualified and most inexperienced candidate to ever seek the presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gibbs said the senator may soon embark on a background or biography tour to &quot;introduce him aggressively throughout the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July, Obama aides said their primary focus was introducing their boss to voters because &quot;the more people that get to see him, the more they like him.&quot; The strategy proved smart in the Democratic contests: The more time Mr. Obama spent in a state, the better he tended to perform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Mr. Obama's allies are working feverishly to spread his message, calling him the candidate of true change and saying Mr. McCain offers nothing more than a third term for a vilified President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama volunteers across the country on Saturday are organizing more than 1,000 Unite for Change &quot;meetings&quot; to &quot;bring together people who supported all of the Democratic candidates, as well as independents and even some Republicans,&quot; around a common cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters seeking information on the Obama Web site can find the basics: He grew up in Hawaii, was raised by a single mother and his grandparents. He met his Kenyan father just once. After college, he was a community organizer in Chicago, then at Harvard Law School, he became the first black president of its prestigious law review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama was a civil rights lawyer in Chicago, taught constitutional law and then served in the state Senate for eight years. He faced a relatively easy election to the U.S. Senate in 2004, boosted by his heralded speech at the Democratic National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Journal uses his 2007 Senate votes to rank him as the most liberal member of the chamber, a label that delights Republicans. Mr. Obama dismisses the ranking as flawed because his support for creating an independent ethics office to police Congress is one of the votes the survey defined as liberal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Mr. Obama won the Iowa caucuses, 47 percent of voters found him to be liberal, Mr. Rasmussen said. That number has risen to 69 percent in the six months since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perceptions of him are changing pretty rapidly,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By comparison, the numbers for 2004 Democratic nominee Sen. John Kerry moved by single digits as voters learned more about him after the primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another front to the image war, Mr. Obama has created a Web site designed to &quot;fight the smears&quot; sent via e-mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One such e-mail titled &quot;John McCain's sons&quot; correctly details that Mr. McCain's young son was deployed to Iraq. But the widely circulated e-mail includes a blatant misquote of Mr. Obama's book &quot;The Audacity of Hope&quot; that plays on the false rumors that he is a Muslim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction,&quot; the e-mail quotes Mr. Obama, a Christian, as having written, going on to blare in all capital letters &quot;He did not say stand with Americans!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's book did, in fact, say he would stand with Americans. In a long passage, he described his conversations assuring Arab- and Pakistani-Americans &quot;that their citizenship really means something, that America has learned the right lessons from the Japanese internments during World War II, and that I will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama Web site rebuts the most widely spread rumors with photo or video evidence. His campaign also has worked harder to showcase his patriotism and define his mixed heritage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His new ads feature photos of Mr. Obama with his white mother and grandparents, who says they taught him &quot;values straight from the Kansas heartland&quot; included a &quot;love of country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America is a country of strong families and strong values. My life's been blessed by both,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He closes the ad with a subtle rebuttal against unfounded e-mail rumors questioning his patriotism: &quot;I approved this message because I'll never forget those values, and if I have the honor of taking the oath of office as president, it will be with a deep and abiding faith in the country I love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said his intention with the ads was to remind voters &quot;that I come to politics because of my own story, somebody who wasn't born into wealth or privilege, that was given extraordinary opportunities, probably because of a family that cared for me and gave me a great education, but partly because of a country that allows you to make it if you try.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the two weeks since Barack Obama became the presumptive Democratic nominee, John McCain has demonstrated a knack for driving the daily political debate, forcing his opponent to respond to a challenge to meet in town hall debates, accusing him of being &quot;delusional&quot; about terrorism and saying he flip-flopped on public financing for his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even as McCain's strategists claim tactical victories, Republicans outside the campaign worry that underlying weaknesses in its organization and message are costing him valuable time to make the case for his own candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allies complain that the campaign has offered myriad confusing themes that lurch between pitching McCain as a committed conservative one day and an independent-minded reformer the next, while displaying little of the discipline and focus that characterized President Bush's successful campaigns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Republican supporters of the presumptive nominee said they were puzzled by a series of easily avoidable mistakes, including sloppy political stagecraft and poorly timed comments that undercut McCain's reputation as a maverick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grumbling intensified last week when McCain launched a television commercial declaring that he had &quot;stood up&quot; to Bush on global warming, on the same day he traveled to Houston to call for lifting the federal ban on offshore drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics said the ad's message about the differences between McCain and Bush was lost when Bush endorsed the same coastal drilling proposal the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm baffled that the McCain guys have somehow managed to take a guy who practically had 'reform' tattooed to his forehead and turned him into the bastion of the status quo,&quot; said one Republican strategist, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The veteran strategist, who has not been asked to join the campaign, said the &quot;devastating me-too chorus from Bush and [Vice President ] Cheney&quot; on oil drilling is a &quot;great example of the schizophrenia that surrounds their campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior aides to McCain reject such criticisms as &quot;armchair quarterbacking.&quot; They cite recent polls that show McCain only slightly behind Obama despite record low approval ratings for Bush and congressional Republicans. A Washington Post poll on Tuesday showed McCain trailing Obama by six percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We feel very good about where our campaign is right now, and John McCain is running very competitively in an electoral environment that is otherwise very challenging for Republicans,&quot; said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign faced inquiries yesterday from Democrats, who continued to raise legal questions about McCain's Friday trip to Canada, where he spoke at a $100-per-person luncheon and then met with business executives privately. Democrats demanded to know whether McCain's campaign received any money from foreign sources, since that would be illegal under U.S. law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker said the $100 tickets sold by the Economic Club of Canada did not benefit the campaign and that the meeting with executives was not a fundraiser. Mark Adler, the chief executive of the club, said in an e-mail that &quot;all ticket revenue was used to stage the event and luncheon,&quot; and that &quot;the McCain campaign in no way benefited financially from this event.&quot; Hazelbaker said flatly that neither of the events was &quot;a campaign event.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic officials questioned why, then, the campaign paid for the Canada trip and brought reporters along. And they said the event with executives could qualify as an in-kind contribution since some of McCain's comments there were reportedly political in nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign did get a bit of good news last week: It raised about the same amount of money in May as the Obama campaign did, and the Republican trails by only a little in cash on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the criticisms mount, McCain has begun to make some changes to his operation and adapt to a general-election race against a well-funded opponent with a large and sophisticated political organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the request of campaign manager Rick Davis, senior adviser Steve Schmidt will leave McCain's side on the trail and return to headquarters for what a source said will be a &quot;much greater operational role&quot; in the campaign. A former aide to Cheney, Schmidt managed California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's reelection campaign. His portfolio will expand to include strategy, communications, policy, scheduling and other areas, the campaign source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Bush communications director Nicolle Wallace joined McCain's campaign as a senior strategist in May. Last week, she spent time with McCain on his plane for the first time. Matt McDonald, another veteran of the Bush and Schwarzenegger teams, has also been added to the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite those moves, McCain's campaign continues to be led by a relatively insular group of advisers who stuck by him during the darkest times of his primary campaign. Interviews with lawmakers and Republican operatives last week revealed concern about their strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The biggest mistake they are making, they are trying to walk this tightrope between creating distance from Bush and not angering the base,&quot; said a Michigan Republican operative who described himself as nervous about McCain's chances of victory in that swing state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's got to highlight the things that used to make conservatives pull their hair out,&quot; said the Michigan operative. &quot;I don't think they are doing that very well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Republican strategist, who worked for a rival GOP campaign during the primary and has ties to Bush's political team, said the McCain team has &quot;not really figured out&quot; how to present McCain to voters: as an experienced conservative leader or a reformer who wants change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To them, McCain is inevitable,&quot; the GOP strategist said. &quot;They are good on the opposition research side of forcing the agenda. But who John McCain is and what he stands for -- it's a little hard to connect all the dots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem has played out in the campaign's changing slogans. On June 3, a much-ridiculed green background behind McCain sported the new phrase &quot;A Leader We Can Believe In,&quot; a play on Obama's message of &quot;Change We Can Believe In.&quot; But just a few days later the campaign had ditched that slogan and replaced it with &quot;Reform. Prosperity. Peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain or his aides seem to have undercut their message at times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same day that McCain sought to respond to higher gas prices by calling for an end to the drilling moratorium, his senior policy adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, told reporters in a conference call that the move would not boost oil supplies or bring down gas prices in the immediate future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A three-day trip to Florida in early June was overshadowed by questions about McCain's opposition to Everglades funding and a catastrophic insurance fund. His comment last week that it's &quot;not important&quot; if troops remain in Iraq distracted from a Philadelphia town hall that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, some McCain allies believe voters will turn to him if Obama's initial luster fades. &quot;This was a guy who was above politics, and it's becoming clear that he's just another politician,&quot; Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.) said of Obama. &quot;For most voters, McCain is a safe haven.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be even in a . . . horse race, I find that good news,&quot; said Rep. Jeb Hensarling (Tex.), who chairs the Republican Study Committee. &quot;He's clearly the one Republican, I believe, who can be victorious in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) said the race is a draw, adding that McCain has the edge on terrorism and foreign policy while Obama leads on the issue of change. &quot;They're just in the ring, circling each other, and neither is pulling the punches they might want to,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kingston said McCain does need to focus on certain elements of a modern campaign, such as his Internet operation, if he hopes to stay close with Obama. &quot;Obama and his friends at MoveOn.org, they own the Internet right now,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's people continue to be aggressive in their critique of Obama, pressing what they see as a clear advantage. In a memo released to the news media Friday, Schmidt accused Obama of using words that are &quot;empty of meaning&quot; and of putting rhetoric above policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The memo said that Obama broke his word on a promise to participate in the public financing system and that he had gone back on his pledge to debate &quot;anywhere, anytime&quot; by refusing to meet McCain in town hall meetings every week this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis, who is leaving Congress after this year, said McCain has the advantage of being a well-defined brand in the minds of many voters. And he said there is plenty of time left to burnish it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is still skirmishing. They are still sparring. The main event won't start until after the conventions,&quot; Davis said. &quot;This still has a long way to go. People forget that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every time someone suggests we perhaps should lift some of the restrictions that have hamstrung the nation's oil production there are a thousand voices screaming no. The environmentalists say no. The ethanol industry cries no. The politicians reacting to each of these shake their heads no. The speculators who make their money off high oil prices shout no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The excuses are endless as to why drilling offshore or on Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or wherever would do little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and lessen the intense pain of expensive gasoline. It would take years for this oil exploration to pay off, they say, echoing exactly their excuses years ago. New refineries and nuclear power plants are far too dangerous, they argue. We have to look for alternative fuels, and build cars that get more miles to the gallon than the current models. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how long would that take? It's coming, it's coming is the vague reply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have to grow more corn or use grass or something to create G85 Ethanol or develop cars that run on water and batteries or air or something even more exotic. We have to tap the vast oil shale beds that have enough oil to meet our needs for several hundred years. But, wait, 40 years ago the oil barons and economists contended that if petroleum ever reached $30 a barrel, it would be economically feasible to begin commercial oil shale operations. Then that benchmark got lifted to $50 and then $60 and on and on. Well, how about $135 and still no shale oil?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's build a pipeline from some place to some place like that one that is so environmentally friendly in Alaska. That would be nice, but only if there were oil and gas to pump through it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So those who see some hope in the sudden efforts of the Bush administration and the proposals by Sen. John McCain to lift the ban on offshore exploration and drilling in an area of the Continental Shelf that is believed to contain untold fossil fuel riches, better forget it. Already Sen. Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee and the front-runner in the polls, has made it clear he doesn't buy into any of these ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drill for oil? Are you nuts? That's for the dark ages and won't put a dent in our needs. Besides, the voracious oil companies and speculating profiteers would just sell it overseas. Oh, yeah. Have you heard the one about the oil spill?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, the anguish and economic dislocation caused by seemingly uncontrollable pricing goes on. Suddenly, the only transportation we can count on for long hauls - the airline industry - is in such bad shape because of the preposterous fuel costs there are dire predictions about losing one or more of the country's so-called &quot;legacy&quot; carriers. You know, the big boys like American, Delta, Continental or United. Even if they survive the cost of a ticket might be out of the reach of a great segment of the population, taking us back to the day when air travel was so expensive few could afford it. In those days at least there were rails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly the number of cities that depend on the legacy airlines would be drastically reduced and the number of flights cut as much as half or even two-thirds, leaving the residents of even some sizable communities isolated, except for the highways where no one can afford to drive. They could always take the bus, you say. Right. But what company can afford to meet the pump costs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The need for a comprehensive energy plan is overwhelming. Yet we have none and every effort to remedy that results in accusations about who had a hand in it and who will benefit the most with no resolution in sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress fiddles while Americans burn fuel approaching $5 a gallon. There must be an answer somewhere that makes sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could it be solved if our elected officials said as they did about traveling to the moon: OK, we'll try to keep politics out of this equation for the national good, with every special interest giving up something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can either Barack Obama or John McCain bring this detente about? That's probably going to be the No. 1 question in the campaign for the dubious honor of leading the nation the next four years.</SPAN></P>

Bill to provide World War II veterans with money for education, unemployment compensation plus home and business loans. Three years later, vets made up half of the nation's college enrollment, according to the History Channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The old Depression-era work ethic was very much intact in those days. Only 20 percent of the funds set aside for unemployment was ever doled out. Meanwhile, 20 million veterans and dependents used the education benefits and 14 million home loans were guaranteed for a total federal investment of $67 billion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who took advantage of the G.I. Bill included former Presidents George H.W. Bush and Gerald Ford, former Vice President Al Gore and entertainers Johnny Cash, Ed McMahon, Paul Newman and Clint Eastwood.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The entire presidential election hinges on whether the public perception is that we are a nation at war. If they feel that we are, John McCain stands to win as the safer bet than Barack Obama. If Americans are more concerned with gas prices, I don't see how McCain avoids being stigmatized as the old dude who is obsessed with staying in Iraq,&quot; writes Philip Klein in The American Spectator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to be greeted properly. Fist bump, please.&quot; - Michelle Obama, to her five co-hostesses on ABC's &quot;The View.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm all for recycling, but it's better applied to paper and plastic than to the failed policies of the 1970s.&quot; - Sen. John McCain, speaking about Sen. Barack Obama's energy policies during a campaign stop in Houston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, seven out of 10 American citizens between the ages of 17 and 24 who are walking the streets of America cannot qualify for entry into our services without some form of a waiver, and that is a national crisis. If somebody has 'a little stain on their shirt' and they want to raise their hand and come serve their country in a time of war - knowing not if, but when they are going to deploy in harm's way - where would you rather them be?&quot; - Army Lt. Gen. David P. Valcourt, chief of staff of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, at the 2008 Joint Warfighting Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Al Gore is a hypocrite and a fraud when it comes to his commitment to the environment, judging by his home energy consumption.&quot; - Drew Johnson, president of the Tennessee Center for Policy Research, on his study that found Mr. Gore's home burned 213,210 kilowatt-hours of electricity a year, enough to power 232 average American households for a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When they do use power, it's green power.&quot; - Gore spokeswoman Kalee Kreider, telling The Tennessean that the Gores' utility bills have dropped 40 percent since their home was fitted with solar panels and other &quot;green&quot; energy systems.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whether for reasons of expediency or laziness, the press usually ends up defining Presidential candidates by one or two go-to adjectives. Once established, these adjectives end up framing much of the ensuing debate, often at the expense of more substantive conversation: Can George W. Bush both be compassionate and a conservative? Is John Kerry really a flip-flopper? When shorthand becomes longhand, a lot gets lost in the transcription,&quot; writes Justin Peters of the Columbia Journalism Review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We very much hope that 'historic' doesn't become the default adjective used to describe Barack Obama and his Presidential campaign. (Or, if you like, his 'crusade.') By prefacing any mention of the Obama campaign with words like these, the press effectively turns Obama into a symbol instead of a candidate. The conversation becomes less about his policies and more about his place in history, the coverage becomes less about events and more about emotions, and, before you know it, everybody's caught up in crusades of hope, faith, and other treacly cliches.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton is expected to return to Senate politics next week, now that her run for the Democratic presidential nomination is over, but a campaign finance filing made plain last night that the effects of that losing effort will continue to weigh on her political future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's campaign was $22.5 million in debt at the end of May, $3 million more than a month earlier. More than half of the latest debt ($12.2 million) was owed to the candidate herself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton received $12.6 million in contributions in May, and she had $3.4 million cash on hand left for primary spending. She also had $23.3 million for the general election, money she cannot use to pay off her primary debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton has shunned most public appearances since her departure from the race on June 7, but she is expected to campaign with Sen. Barack Obama at a pair of events late next week, the first joint public events for the former rivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday night, Clinton will introduce Obama to a group of her top donors at the Mayflower Hotel in the District, a bid to smooth relations between her supporters and the presumptive Democratic nominee. She is also scheduled to speak that day to the National Association of Latino Elected Officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton is expected to return to Capitol Hill early in the week, according to a senior Democratic aide, and could appear on the Senate floor as early as Tuesday morning to vote on a housing crisis bailout package. Votes are expected later in the week on a sweeping new surveillance bill that would effectively shield telecommunications companies from privacy lawsuits, and a war funding bill that also includes new education benefits for veterans. Clinton, and possibly Obama, could be present for both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A week from today, you will have seen [Clinton] at the Capitol,&quot; her spokesman Philippe Reines said by e-mail yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokesman Bill Burton said that next Friday's joint appearance may be limited to one event but that the campaign is not ready to announce details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters yesterday in Jacksonville, Fla., Obama defended his decision a day earlier to opt out of the federal financing system for the general election after pledging to seek a deal with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) to use public as opposed to private money. McCain continued to bash Obama on the issue yesterday, accusing him of breaking his word and saying the decision compromised his claim to credentials as a reformer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the decision is almost certain to give Obama an enormous financial advantage in the final eight weeks of the race. While McCain will be restricted to spending the $84.1 million that public financing will provide, Obama can raise and spend as much as he can. The Obama campaign reports that he has already attracted at least 1.5 million donors, and Clinton could ask her donors to redirect to Obama the general-election money she must return. Some political observers believe he could amass $300 million or more to spend on the general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign announced last night that it raised $22 million in May, a relatively small sum compared with his previous totals -- he raised $55 million in February -- but still $1 million more than McCain's May total of $21 million, the best showing so far for the Republican. McCain finished May with just under $32 million in the bank, compared with Obama's $43 million, although about $10 million of Obama's total can be spent only after the party's nominating convention in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At his news conference, Obama said he had opted out to preserve his ability to compete with independent conservative groups he expected to  challenge him, although no such well-funded national organizations have materialized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He asserted that his fundraising rules, which bar contributions from federal lobbyists and political action committees, represent meaningful campaign finance reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a reporter pointed to the dearth of well-heeled, GOP-aligned independent groups emerging, Obama responded by asserting that they could &quot;pop up pretty quickly and have enormous influence,&quot; adding: &quot;And we've already seen them -- and there was an ad run in South Dakota . . . where it took a speech that I had made, extolling faith, and made it seem as if I had said that America was a Muslim nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He continued, &quot;We've already seen attacks on my wife from, you know, the Tennessee Republican Party. I don't think I'm off the wall here to see that, you know, there are a lot of outside groups that are potentially going to be going after us hard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, speaking to supporters at a Jacksonville fundraiser, Obama said of Republicans, &quot;We know what kind of campaign they're going to run. They're going to try to make you afraid. They're going to try to make you afraid of me: 'He's young and inexperienced and he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black? He's got a feisty wife.' &quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumptive Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama pulled in almost $22 million from donors in May as he finished the primary battle, demonstrating his ability to raise cash one day after he announced he was declining public funds and would instead privately finance his general election campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illinois senator's campaign filed a report Friday with the Federal Election Commission showing the figures, bringing his total haul to date to $294 million. He spent $26.8 million in May as he fought Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in six Democratic contests, losing three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the start of June, Mr. Obama had $43 million in cash on hand, the report showed. He can freely spend his primary election donations until the nominating convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $22 million figure - almost all of which was for use in the Democratic primaries and can be spent through the late-August convention - was less than Mr. Obama's best months but equal to the best month of presumptive Republican nominee Sen. John McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, the Arizona senator announced he had raised $21 million in May and began this month with $31.5 million in the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaigns sparred over Mr. Obama's broken promise to participate in the public-financing system in the general election as long as his Republican opponent did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama also promised to &quot;aggressively pursue&quot; a deal with the eventual Republican nominee on public financing compromise and said later that he would meet personally with Mr. McCain on the subject. He did neither.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday he defended his decision to skip the $84 million in public funds available through the system Congress set up in 1974 to curb the influence of wealthy donors, reiterating his belief the &quot;broken&quot; system is being exploited by Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his campaign does not take money from political action committees or federal registered lobbyists and has extended those rules to the Democratic National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ninety percent of our contributions are from small donors, and what we have done is to create a system that allows us to free ourselves from dependence on special interests and from lobbyists,&quot; he said. &quot;That stands in contrast to Senator McCain's operations, right now, where he says he's in the system and yet a huge proportion of his money is raised from special interests, from lobbyists. I don't think that's a recipe for reform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain senior adviser Steve Schmidt wrote a memo to reporters Friday arguing the Democrat's decision proves he is willing to go back on his word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said much of Mr. Obama's &quot;rapid ascent&quot; can be &quot;traced to the power of Barack Obama's spoken and written words.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of his rapid ascent and the relative lack of record from which the American people can judge, the words that Barack Obama uses deserve a level of scrutiny befitting the importance that he places on them. But when examined closely, more often than not these words are empty of any meaning in the light of his record and reality,&quot; Mr. Schmidt said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under scrutiny, it becomes &quot;increasingly difficult for those of us with the responsibility of following this year's election closely to discern what Obama truly believes at his core on the issues of great importance to the American people,&quot; Mr. Schmidt said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confronted with quotes from Republicans who say he is a hypocrite, Mr. Obama turned the criticism back at Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was all over the map on public financing,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;He said he would consider opting out ... later when his campaign had collapsed for a while, he said he's definitely in&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama also defended himself Friday in a USA Today op-ed piece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's more, Sen. McCain has, in fact, been running a privately financed general election campaign since February, using private money raised during the primary to attack me and target battleground states,&quot; Mr. Obama wrote. &quot;By the time he accepts his party's nomination, Sen. McCain will have run a privately funded general election campaign for seven months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In tandem with the private financing announcement Thursday, Obama campaign manager David Plouffe solicited donations in a new appeal to get 50,000 people to make a donation by Independence Day. The campaign upped the goal to 75,000 after cracking 52,000 on Friday, less than 24 hours after the appeal went out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his e-mail Mr. Plouffe singled out 527 group Freedom's Watch, telling supporters the group &quot;has said it will spend as much as $250 million under Karl Rove's direction to attack and defeat Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To compete, Barack has put his faith in ordinary people giving only what they can afford. That's been the strategy of this campaign from the beginning, and more than 1,500,000 supporters like you have gotten us this far,&quot; Mr. Plouffe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not mention that liberal-leaning MoveOn.org will spend more than $30 million on Mr. Obama's behalf to attack Mr. McCain and already is running a tough ad about the Iraq war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, neither Mr. Plouffe nor Mr. Obama noted that in the 2004 electoral cycle, according to the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute, &quot;Democratic-oriented groups received nearly four times as much 527 money as Republican-oriented ones ... $321 million to $84 million&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama aides on Friday acknowledged that fact, but singled out the widely-covered Swift Boat Veterans for Truth as the most effective so-called 527 group for its pro-Republican attacks on Sen. John Kerry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama met Friday in Chicago with the nation's Democratic governors to outline his vision for the country, telling them they &quot;deserve and need a partner in the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going to be working on these issues for many years to come,&quot; he told them. &quot;My hope is we can hit the ground running in January of '09 ... and be ready to govern when the time comes&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He singled out governors who supported his primary opponent, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, to praise their efforts on foreclosures and alternative energy: &quot;You've all proved that our states are still the laboratories of our democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've seen what happens when the federal government bails out investment banks on Wall Street, but doesn't do enough to help the thousands of Americans who are losing their homes to this foreclosure crisis every day,&quot; he said. &quot;You've seen what happens when $10 billion a month in Iraq takes away money that could be used to fix roads and bridges, to secure levees and dams.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a fundraiser Friday in Jacksonville, Fla., Mr. Obama quipped to high-dollar donors he could preview the Republican attacks for the fall:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know what kind of campaign they're going to run. They're going to try to make you afraid. They're going to try to make you afraid of me,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;[TFI]'He's young and inexperienced and he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black? He's got a feisty wife.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His joke drew cheers and he continued: &quot;We know the strategy because they've already shown their cards. Ultimately, I think the American people recognize that old stuff hasn't moved us forward. That old stuff just divides us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, D-Mich., who leads the Congressional Black Caucus, said members of her caucus asked her to forward the names of Edwards and Nunn when she met Wednesday with Obama's vice presidential search team. The vetting team, Caroline Kennedy and Eric Holder, indicated the two were on the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kilpatrick said she made several suggestions during the 45-minute meeting, including former Vice President Al Gore, Pennsylvania Rep. John P. Murtha, and Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland. Gore endorsed Obama in Detroit on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She declined to say which names were put forth by Kennedy and Holder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Edwards has said he is not seeking the vice presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nunn would bring national security credentials to the ticket, having served as the longtime Armed Services Committee chairman. The Georgian is a member of Obama's foreign policy advisory group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Nunn has not been in office for more than a decade, so he is not well-known nationally. He is a conservative Democrat who supported school prayer and opposed gays in the military. Nunn will turn 70 in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Criticism for Myanmar: Cindy McCain harshly criticized Myanmar's military junta yesterday while vowing to make improving human rights there a priority if she becomes America's first lady.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's just a terrible group of people that rule the country, and the frightening part is that their own people are dying of disease and starvation and everything else and it doesn't matter,&quot; she said during a trip to Vietnam, where she has worked with a charity that helps children born with facial deformities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't understand how human life doesn't matter to somebody. But clearly, it doesn't matter to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama reversed his pledge to seek public financing in the general election yesterday, a move that drew criticism from adversaries and allies alike but could provide him with a significant spending advantage over Republican rival John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama will become the first major-party presidential nominee to reject the public funds, passing up nearly $85 million in taxpayer money and instead looking to the 1.5 million donors who contributed to his primary campaign. Given his groundbreaking success in raising money in the Democratic primaries, estimates of how much he could collect for the general-election run to $300 million or more, a sum that would allow the senator from Illinois to compete even in traditionally Republican states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not an easy decision, and especially because I support a robust system of public financing of elections,&quot; Obama said in a video message to supporters, circulated yesterday morning by his campaign. &quot;But the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken, and we face opponents who've become masters at gaming this broken system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement came as Obama's national finance committee was preparing to meet in Chicago, and on the same day he launched his first television ad of the general election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the hours after the announcement, McCain indicated he would consider forgoing public financing as well, but he later indicated that he will opt into the system. &quot;We will take public financing,&quot; he said on the Straight Talk Express bus. Asked why, he said simply, &quot;Because we decided to take public financing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But earlier in the day the senator from Arizona lashed out at Obama. &quot;This is a big, big deal,&quot; McCain told reporters while touring a flood-ravaged area in Columbus Junction, Iowa. &quot;He has completely reversed himself and gone back, not on his word to me, but the commitment he made to the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the end of April, Obama had raised $272 million, and he is required to file a report covering his May activities today. McCain submitted his May filing yesterday, showing he had raised a total of about $122 million after bringing in $21 million last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the public financing system, which was established in the wake of the Watergate scandal, candidates are barred from raising private funds or spending their own money on their general-election bids. The lump sum they receive from the Treasury is the only money they can spend once they are officially declared their party's nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A separate public funding system governs the presidential primaries, and Obama and McCain were among the contenders who shunned the federal money and the spending limits that come with it. With his bid for the GOP nomination foundering late last year, however, McCain used the promise of his ability to collect public funding as collateral for campaign loans. Both the Federal Election Commission, which governs the systems, and the Democratic National Committee have been highly critical of the maneuver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, government watchdog groups expressed disappointment with Obama's move. Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook called $85 million &quot;plenty of money&quot; and warned that private funding -- even in the mostly small sums that Obama relies on -- &quot;comes with the expectations of special access or favors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presumptive Democratic nominee is one of three lead Senate sponsors of legislation to change the public financing system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Obama knew the circumstances surrounding the presidential general election when he made his public pledge to use the system,&quot; said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), a co-sponsor of the bill, called Obama's decision &quot;a mistake&quot; but added: &quot;I look forward to working on this and a wide range of other reform issues with him when he becomes president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, McCain cleared his schedule to visit the scene of extensive Midwestern flooding, but his trip was overshadowed by Obama's announcement, which has the potential to change the shape of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if to underscore his financial advantage, Obama released his first national television ad yesterday, a 60-second spot that will run in potential swing states, including Missouri, Florida and Pennsylvania, as well as in Alaska, Montana and North Carolina -- states that McCain needs to carry to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain brushed aside the suggestion that Obama's potential money edge will hurt his prospects. &quot;That doesn't worry me,&quot; he told reporters in Iowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although campaign finance issues rank low on lists of voter concerns, the McCain team pounced on Obama's move, along with his rejection of the 10 town hall meetings that McCain has proposed, as evidence that his claim to represent a &quot;new politics&quot; is empty rhetoric. The campaign circulated Obama quotes praising public financing and accused him of breaking his pledge to negotiate the issue with the GOP nominee. McCain spokesman Brian Rogers dismissed an account by Obama aides of recent talks between the two camps on the issue, saying it was &quot;flat-out false.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's broken his word,&quot; said Charles R. Black Jr., a top McCain adviser. &quot;He said he believes in the new politics; to me it sounds like the old politics. If you're going to change politics in America, that's a step backward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Republicans conceded privately that Obama's decision puts them at a disadvantage. McCain has attended dozens of fundraisers since he clinched the nomination in March, averaging close to one event per day. He appeared in Chicago on Wednesday night at an event that raised more than $1 million, and he met with donors in Minneapolis yesterday. Next week's schedule includes two fundraisers in California, two in Ohio and one in Las Vegas. McCain's wife, Cindy, will join Henry A. Kissinger for an event with U.S. expatriates in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign is also bracing for a huge wave of spending from labor unions and other Democratic-aligned groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I assume he's going to outspend us,&quot; Black said of Obama. &quot;We don't have to spend as much as he does to win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's announcement was not unexpected. Months ago, he began to shift away from an early pledge to &quot;pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After securing the Democratic nomination this month, Obama moved quickly to impose his own stringent fundraising restrictions on the Democratic National Committee, ordering it to stop accepting donations from federal lobbyists and political action committees, and he has discouraged his donors from contributing to liberal independent political organizations, called 527 groups, that are expected to hammer McCain in the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain's campaign and the Republican National Committee are fueled by contributions from Washington lobbyists and special interest PACs,&quot; Obama said in his message to supporters yesterday. &quot;And we've already seen that he's not going to stop the smears and attacks from his allies running so-called 527 groups, who will spend millions and millions of dollars in unlimited donations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date, no conservative 527 groups have materialized. But Obama portrayed his call as a preemptive strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the very beginning of this campaign, I have asked my supporters to avoid that kind of unregulated activity and join us in building a new kind of politics -- and you have,&quot; Obama said. &quot;. . . I'm asking you to try to do something that's never been done before.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumptive Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama - the &quot;people-powered&quot; presidential candidate who previously promised to publicly finance his campaign - on Thursday abandoned that pledge, becoming the first candidate since the funding system's post-Watergate creation to decline the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to forgo more than $84 million in public funds and instead raise massive sums from a 1.5-million-donor network was hailed by supporters as allowing his fundraising juggernaut - which went live with ads in 18 states Thursday - a clear advantage against presumed Republican nominee Sen. John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. McCain, other national Republicans and some campaign finance reformers excoriated the senator from Illinois as breaking trust with voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama is the first major party candidate to decline public financing of the general election campaign since 1974, when Congress created the system designed to reduce the influence of wealthy donors in politics. It's a system Mr. Obama once said he &quot;strongly&quot; supported but now thinks is &quot;broken&quot; and being manipulated by Republicans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator revealed the long-anticipated move in a Web video to his massive list of supporters, urging donations and underscoring the reason he is opting out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we don't stand together, the broken system we have now, a system where special interests drown out the voices of the American people will continue to erode our politics and prevent the possibility of real change,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;Join me, and declare your independence from this broken system and lets build the first general election campaign that's truly funded by the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain aides said Mr. Obama has proved himself a &quot;typical politician&quot; since he retreated from his pledge to &quot;aggressively&quot; try to reach an agreement, and the Democrat acknowledged to supporters it was no easy decision, &quot;especially because I support a robust system of public financing of elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain told reporters Thursday he will stay within the public financing system and called the Obama decision a violation of trust that he considers &quot;disturbing to all Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a big deal,&quot; the Arizona Republican complained, saying Mr. Obama &quot;completely reversed himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2000, Republican George W. Bush became the first candidate to scrap public financing in the primary, and most major-party primary candidates have followed suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Russ Feingold, Wisconsin Democrat who partnered with Mr. McCain in 2002 to reform campaign finance laws by primarily eliminating the unregulated flow of cash to national political parties, disputed the Obama premise that the system is broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Feingold also praised his own proposed bill to reform the system again, a measure Mr. Obama supports and Mr. McCain does not. The Feingold bill increases the public financing spending limits from $75 million to $100 million per candidate and eliminates state-by-state funding limits for the primaries. It requires disclosure of big donors who bundle multiple donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Obama is committed to reforming the current system, and I look forward to working on this and a wide range of other reform issues with him when he becomes president. But this decision was a mistake,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, who had $46.5 million in the bank as of April, will solicit money from the same private donors who helped him raise more than $265 million since the campaign began in January 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, who has raised $96 million to date, had $24 million cash on hand at the end of April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when each candidate's figures are combined with their respective party figures, it's Mr. McCain with the advantage - something his team has been pointing out lately and a fact the Obama camp used as justification for the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee's $40 million cash on hand at the end of April brings the Republican Party total to $64 million on hand, while the Democratic National Committee's $4.4 million in the bank gives the Democrats about $51 million in total. New figures for May will be released Friday, and both parties have been holding big-dollar fundraisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign argued Mr. McCain forced the issue by using the Democrats' prolonged primary season after he wrapped up the nomination to raise money and run a general election ad in Ohio 21,000 times. Obama aides said he had given a green light to spending from outside groups not governed by the same laws since Mr. McCain last week said, &quot;I can't be a referee&quot; to which groups are running attack ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RNC lashed out as well, noting the toughest ad on television - hitting Mr. McCain for his support for the Iraq war - is sponsored by independent pro-Obama groups MoveOn.org and AFSCME. They also noted labor unions plan a $53 million anti-McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Team Obama pushed back against broken promise accusations, saying Mr. Obama always said the two camps would have to agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But aides said yesterday that Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain never personally met to talk about the issue and that the Obama campaign said no agreement was possible after the campaigns' chief attorneys met for less than an hour earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mr. Obama began to back away from that suggestion during the primary season, his rival Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, New York Democrat, sharply criticized him for going back on his word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign also provided a &quot;timeline&quot; of his reversal that began with his February 2007 inquiry to the Federal Elections Commission as to whether he could raise money from donors but later return the money if the Republican nominee agreed to use only public funds for the general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Should both major party nominees elect to receive public funding, this would preserve the public financing system, now in danger of collapse, and facilitate the conduct of campaigns freed from any dependence on private fund-raising,&quot; the Obama campaign wrote the FEC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a November questionnaire for the Midwest Democracy Network Mr. Obama answered, &quot;Yes,&quot; he would &quot;participate in the presidential public financing system,&quot; and even added: &quot;Senator John McCain has already pledged to accept this fundraising pledge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not expect that a workable, effective agreement will be reached overnight,&quot; Mr. Obama wrote in a USA Today February editorial. &quot;When the time comes, we will talk and our commitment will be tested. I will pass that test, and I hope that the Republican nominee passes his.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blogger Markos Moulitsas of Daily Kos hailed Mr. Obama's decision and said it would have been &quot;political malpractice&quot; for Mr. Obama to &quot;tell his millions of small-dollar donors that they couldn't invest financially in his campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, Republicans will whine that Obama 'broke his promise.' They've got no other choice. McCain is getting crushed financially, and has little of the popular support that Obama enjoys,&quot; Mr. Moulitsas said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama supporters also cheered the decision on BarackObama.com, which the campaign turned into a hub announcing the decision and urging donations under a &quot;Declare your independence from a broken system&quot; banner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheree Williams boasted that she had &quot;just donated another $50&quot; and promised to give another $200 on June 30. &quot;Who's with me??? Let's take back AMERICA!!!&quot; she wrote. She exemplifies the Obama network - the average donation is $88, far less than the $2,300 maximum.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal auditors said yesterday that the Air Force bungled its decision to award a multibillion-dollar contract for new refueling tankers to a team that includes the European company Airbus, touching off calls for a congressional probe and putting yet another twist in the years-long, scandal-plagued effort to replace the aging tanker fleet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Feb. 29 award of the $40 billion contract had spurred a fierce and unusual public relations battle between the loser Boeing, which claimed it was treated unfairly, and winner Northrop Grumman and its partner, European Aeronautic Defence and Space, parent of Airbus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also triggered fears that thousands of well-paying jobs in the United States would evaporate. Critics said the Air Force was being shortsighted by awarding key defense contracts to a European company, possibly hobbling the industrial might of Boeing, the nation's top airplane maker. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's finding by the Government Accountability Office is the latest in a series of public relations debacles for the Air Force. It comes just two weeks after Air Force Secretary Michael W. Wynne and Chief of Staff Gen. T. Michael Moseley were asked to resign because of &quot;a chain of failures&quot; in their leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of the award, some of whom represent states where Boeing employs thousands of people, questioned whether those resignations were linked to problems with the tanker contract. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) is among several lawmakers who said they would ask Congress to review the Air Force's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress needs to investigate,&quot; Cantwell said. &quot;How is it that the process was so flawed? These mistakes are so glaring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), whose state is also home to major Boeing operations, called the GAO decision &quot;a major win for Kansas and America's industrial base.&quot; Roberts said he and Rep. Todd Tiahrt (R-Kan.) would introduce legislation mandating that the Air Force hold another competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Air Force has 60 days to respond to the GAO findings. The service can agree or ask the GAO to reconsider. It said in a statement that it would review the decision to determine its next step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Air Force will do everything we can to rapidly move forward so America receives this urgently needed capability,&quot; said Sue C. Payton, assistant secretary of acquisition for the Air Force. &quot;The Air Force will select the best value tanker for our nation's defense while being good stewards of the taxpayer dollar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The months-long GAO review found that the Air Force failed repeatedly to follow procedures designed to ensure a fair and open competition and good value for taxpayers. The GAO urged the Air Force to renew discussions with both teams and obtain revised proposals, and to effectively stage a new competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our review of the record led us to conclude that the Air Force had made a number of significant errors that could have affected the outcome of what was a close competition between Boeing and Northrop Grumman,&quot; said Michael R. Golden, the GAO's managing associate general counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boeing filed its protest with the agency March 11 after it lost the deal to build 179 refueling aircraft, which are essentially gas stations in the sky. The Chicago-based company is the largest U.S. aircraft manufacturer, with 44,000 jobs in the United States and operations in 40 states. It began building the Air Force's fleet of KC-135 tankers nearly 50 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2003, the Air Force attempted to award a contract to replace the fleet, but that effort was mishandled. After awarding a $20 billion contract to Boeing to lease tankers, the Air Force's procurement chief at the time, Darleen A. Druyun, admitted that she favored Boeing while negotiating for a job with the company. Druyun and Boeing's former chief financial officer went to prison, and Boeing agreed with the Justice Department to pay $615 million -- the biggest penalty ever paid by a defense contractor -- to settle allegations of misconduct on the tanker deal and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arizona Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, had spearheaded the investigations that turned up fraud in the contract for leasing tankers and pressed the Air Force to widen the competition for a new one. Yesterday, Democrats said the GAO report showed that McCain's pressure on the Air Force was improper, and his Democratic presidential rival, Sen. Barack Obama (Ill.), called for a new competition. A McCain spokesman said in a statement that the senator's hope all along was for a fair and open process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tanker contract, after its initial phase, could be worth up to $100 billion over the next two decades. The deal gives the winner a major inside track on future military aircraft sales and an advantage in commercial airline business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boeing said in its protest that the Air Force had not fairly evaluated the technical capabilities, costs and other areas of its proposed aircraft, which is based on the 767 jetliner. Without the tanker contract, Boeing has said it would shut down the 767 production lines. EADS and Northrop said they planned to build a major plant in Mobile, Ala., and had scheduled a groundbreaking for next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GAO's 69-page decision has to be reviewed by both teams and redacted for proprietary information, so it could take several days before the details are known, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a summary of its decision, the GAO outlined seven reasons why it sustained Boeing's protest, saying the Air Force conducted &quot;misleading and unequal discussions with Boeing&quot; during the process. The Air Force's evaluation of operating the aircrafts was &quot;unreasonable,&quot; it said, noting that the service adjusted Northrop's engineering costs so that they were lower than Boeing's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said that the Air Force never justified its conclusion that the proposed Northrop tanker could handle refueling all types of military planes and that the service mistakenly found that Boeing's plane was more expensive to operate and maintain when it was, in fact, cheaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike McGraw, vice president of Boeing's tanker program, said &quot;we welcome and support today's ruling by the GAO fully sustaining the grounds of our protest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northrop spokesman Randy Belote said, &quot;We continue to believe that Northrop Grumman offered the most modern and capable tanker for our men and women in uniform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GAO rarely sustains protests, defense analysts said, so it raises serious questions about the Air Force and its leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot believe that in the most highly scrutinized procurement in the history of the United States Air Force, the GAO found so many errors,&quot; said Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even one of Northrop's strongest supporters called for an investigation of the selection process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Air Force officials didn't miss it by a little; they apparently missed it by a mile,&quot; said Tom Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonprofit group that worked closely with Northrop on a public relations campaign defending the award. &quot;If this is the best the Air Force can do on its most critical contract award, the system remains dysfunctional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff writer Michael D. Shear and staff researcher Julie Tate contributed to this report.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) met here last night with dozens of union leaders in an effort to mobilize their support for the general election as lingering rifts from a hard-fought primary campaign as well as broader tensions among major unions threaten to undermine organized labor's efforts on his behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several of the largest unions in the AFL-CIO supported Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees spent heavily on ads attacking Obama. AFSCME's president, Gerald W. McEntee, criticized Obama until the end of the primaries, declaring in late May that Obama was a weak candidate who &quot;will literally walk almost lame into the Democratic National Convention&quot; and who &quot;has a problem with the blue-collar worker and relating to that worker.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the second straight election cycle in which AFSCME picked a loser. In 2004, it endorsed former Vermont governor Howard Dean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Obama needs McEntee -- both to bring AFSCME's resources to bear and because of McEntee's influential role as the chairman of the AFL-CIO's political committee. AFSCME signaled it was on board this week. It helped pay for a hard-hitting TV ad by the antiwar group MoveOn.org attacking Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), and AFSCME's political director had a four-hour meeting with the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFSCME leaders declined to comment last night, but leaders of other AFL-CIO unions said they expect McEntee to fall in line. &quot;One of the things with Jerry is that he certainly gets fired up, and he may have overextended himself on this one. He is going to take a serious look at Obama,&quot; said Paul Shearon, secretary-treasurer of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Little, president of the Transport Workers Union, the first AFL-CIO union to endorse Obama, said McEntee's misgivings about Obama will not keep the labor federation's political committee from doing all it can for Obama. &quot;He does a good job chairing that committee, but it's a committee decision and not a Jerry McEntee decision in how we move forward,&quot; Little said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama met last night with the leaders of many of the 56 unions in the AFL-CIO, but one who was missing was R. Thomas Buffenbarger, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Buffenbarger delivered several stinging riffs against Obama while campaigning for Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hope! Change! Yes, we can! Give me a break!&quot; Buffenbarger said in February. &quot;I've got news for all the latte-drinking, Prius-driving, Birkenstock-wearing, trust-fund babies crowding in to hear him speak! This guy won't last a round against the Republican attack machine!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFL-CIO spokeswoman Denise Mitchell said last night that the coalition will wait a short while before officially endorsing Obama, but she noted that the coalition has already spent four months casting McCain as unfriendly to labor, with 16,000 homes visited, 1.5 million leaflets distributed and 500,000 mailings sent out. The AFL-CIO is budgeting more than $50 million for the fall campaign. &quot;While our unions may have a few things to work out, we believe that we'll be strong and united,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also tension within the rival Change to Win coalition, which broke away from the AFL-CIO in 2005 and whose leaders will meet with Obama this morning. Its largest member, the Service Employees International Union, initially declined to offer a nationwide endorsement in the primary, instead letting state chapters endorse on their own. After former senator John Edwards (D-N.C.), a labor favorite, dropped out in January, the union's national leadership signed off on a full endorsement of Obama in February -- later than many Obama supporters in the union had hoped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those pushing hardest for an Obama endorsement after Edwards dropped out was United Healthcare Workers-West, a 150,000-member SEIU chapter in California that is embroiled in a nasty power struggle with SEIU President Andy Stern. Yesterday, the chapter's leader, Sal Rosselli, said his union's attempt to protect itself from a breakup being sought by Stern would distract from its efforts on Obama's behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, Rosselli noted, the national leadership had blocked his staff from leaving California to campaign for Obama during the primaries. A recent proposal by SEIU's large New York chapter to impose a moratorium on the internal power struggle until after the election was defeated by the national leadership, Rosselli said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential campaign &quot;is not going to be our priority, and if we could focus on that, that would be our preference,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEIU secretary-treasurer Anna Burger dismissed his charge, saying SEIU had agreed to campaign for Obama at its recent convention and that it was up to Rosselli's chapter to follow that. &quot;I would expect every single local to go out and implement the program we adopted,&quot; she said. &quot;This is no [power] struggle that we started. We're focused on winning the election and winning real change for working families.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABC is extending its option with late-night host Jimmy Kimmel by another year, keeping him at the network through at least 2010, Variety reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to exercise an early extension comes in the wake of Mr. Kimmel's positive attention for his &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live Game Night&quot; series of post-NBA Finals specials, which included a now-famous fist bump Sunday with presidential candidate Barack Obama. Rival candidate John McCain appeared on Mr. Kimmel's show following Tuesday's National Basketball Association game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those &quot;game night&quot; specials have averaged 3 million viewers, giving the show a bit more exposure than its usual audience. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kimmel also scored quite a bit of attention earlier this year, thanks to a video short featuring his real-life girlfriend, Sarah Silverman - although its title can't be repeated here - that centered on a long-running gag between Mr. Kimmel and actor Matt Damon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like all late-night talkers, Mr. Kimmel took a ratings hit this season because of the writers strike. However, he took less of a hit than his rivals. According to Variety, his show averaged 1.7 million viewers in the just-completed TV season, down just 4 percent (from 1.8 million) the year before . All other late-night talkers suffered double-digit declines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kimmel&quot; also beat CBS' &quot;The Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson&quot; for the first time (by a slim margin, 1.727 million viewers versus 1.725 million) and came within 184,000 viewers of NBC's &quot;Late Night With Conan O'Brien (1.727 million versus 1.911 million), Variety says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Girl' power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Showtime turned a nifty ratings trick Monday with its new half-hour &quot;Secret Diary of a Call Girl&quot; premiering to record numbers, TVWeek.com says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Call Girl&quot; attracted 949,000 viewers to the premium cable network in its first run Monday, outranking every other series premiere in the three-decade-plus history of Showtime. The previous record holder at the network was &quot;The L Word,&quot; which drew 936,000 viewers when it bowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strong tune-in for &quot;Call Girl&quot; represents the latest triumph for Bob Greenblatt, the Showtime entertainment president who has launched hits such as &quot;Dexter,&quot; &quot;The Tudor &quot; and &quot; Californication.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Call Girl&quot; also was given a big leg up by its lead-in, the fourth-season premiere of Showtime's smash &quot;Weeds.&quot; The latter series attracted 1.3 million viewers in its 10 p.m. run Monday, a stunning 65 percent rise over the show's third-season premiere. It also was the highest-rated telecast on Showtime since 2004, when Nielsen began reporting ratings for individual Showtime channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Showtime already has ordered a second season of &quot;Call Girl,&quot; TV Week reports.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can we talk?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joan Rivers' salty tongue apparently got her booted from a British daytime talk show in the middle of its live broadcast, Associated Press reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Rivers used two expletives while talking about actor Russell Crowe as a guest host on the live gab-fest &quot;Loose Women.&quot; She was asked to leave during a commercial break, AP says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the 75-year-old comedian said in a statement that she was sorry for the swearing and had assumed a censor would be able to &quot;bleep&quot; out the words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then she cracked wise, saying the incident reminded her of her wedding night because she was asked to leave in the middle of that, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Choice' gig for Miley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifteen-year-old Miley Cyrus will host the &quot;Teen Choice 2008&quot; awards show on Fox, which will air in prime time Aug. 4 at 8 p.m., the Hollywood Reporter says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the musicians up for honors are Chris Brown, with nine nominations, and Justin Timberlake with three. (Mr. Timberlake is the most-winning Teen Choice icon, taking home 21 of the event's trophies - a surfboard - since 1998.)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters thinking the Republican lines of attack against Sen. Barack Obama sound familiar aren't experiencing deja vu - Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton previewed several of them during the primary campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats warned that the prolonged Obama-Clinton battle could give Republicans ammunition, and they have been proved right as Mrs. Clinton's harsher words resurface in campaign missives from Sen. John McCain and national, state and local Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is naive and inexperienced on foreign policy, Mrs. Clinton suggested for months. Republicans have echoed the attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats now want to move past the nasty fight and Clinton backers are standing by Mr. Obama's side, but Republicans aren't eager to let the opposing party forget its warring. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We could point to many,many examples during the debates where the words 'irresponsible' and 'naive' were applied to Senator Obama, but not by a Republican, but by Hillary Clinton. She'll probably be in a different position now, but these are issues that Hillary Clinton very dramatically pointed out during the Democratic primary,&quot; former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani told reporters Wednesday. The former Republican presidential candidate was using Mrs. Clinton's line to go after Mr. Obama after the Democrat's formation of a national security &quot;working group&quot; to advise him on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press conference this week, Mr. McCain of Arizona employed another familiar line against Mr. Obama - evoking his rival's remarks this spring that some rural voters are &quot;bitter&quot; and &quot;cling&quot; to religion and guns. Mrs. Clinton labeled the comments &quot;elitist,&quot; and repeatedly went after Mr. Obama as having insulted voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I won't tell [the American people] that in small towns across America and Pennsylvania that they are bitter or angry about their economic conditions,&quot; he said, adding that he knows why gun enthusiasts &quot;embrace their constitutional rights ... [and churchgoers] embrace their religion because they're fundamentally good and decent people&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain slam could have been culled from Mrs. Clinton's own attack in April when the &quot;bitter&quot; comments were first reported and she said it seemed Mr. Obama was blaming rural voters for opposing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said that they cling to religion and guns and dislike people who are different from them. I don't believe that,&quot; she said. &quot;I believe that people don't cling to religion; they value their faith. You don't cling to guns; you enjoy hunting or collecting or sport shooting. I don't think he really gets it that people are looking for a president who stands up for you and not looks down on you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, the Republicans are portraying Mr. Obama as a hypocrite for criticizing the 2005 energy bill even though he voted for it - another Clinton argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't end there - on the economy, trade issues and even Mr. Obama's oratorical ability, the Republicans seem to be adopting much of the Clinton attack playbook - which she retired after it became clear this spring that she had lost the nomination to the political newcomer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former first lady's most infamous line about years of experience - during which she questioned whether he had passed the &quot;commander-in-chief&quot; test - has made a cameo in Republican attack ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator McCain will bring a lifetime of experience to the campaign, I will bring a lifetime of experience and Senator Obama will bring a speech that he gave in 2002,&quot; Mrs. Clinton said in March, referring to Mr. Obama's speech opposing the Iraq war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added, &quot;I think it's imperative that each of us be able to demonstrate we can cross the commander-in-chief threshold. And, I believe that I have done that, certainly Senator McCain has done that, and you will have to ask Senator Obama with respect to his candidacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those comments were pulled together in a Republican National Committee ad questioning Mr. Obama's experience, and appear on an RNC Web site- ClintonVsObama, www.gop.com/clintonvsobama/.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the candidates have come together, and Mrs. Clinton will extend her enthusiastic endorsement further next Thursday as she introduces her former opponent to her top fundraisers in the District. A source familiar with the event's planning said the candidates also are looking for a date for a public appearance with the two Democrats together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back when they were political rivals Mr. Obama predicted that Mrs. Clinton's words would resurface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure that Senator Clinton feels like she's doing me a great favor, because she's been deploying most of the arguments that the Republican Party will be using against me in November, so it's toughening me up,&quot; Mr. Obama said at the Associated Press annual luncheon in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, it was Mrs. Clinton who first riffed on Mr. Obama's &quot;hopeful&quot; message, and talked about the &quot;audacity&quot; of the senator from Illinois in a reference to his book title, and now the RNC and Mr. McCain's team offer a snarky &quot;Audacity Watch&quot; in e-mails to reporters. Mr. McCain also has lambasted Mr. Obama's &quot;Change You Can Believe In&quot; slogan, similar to Mrs. Clinton's label &quot;Change You Can Xerox&quot; back in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton hit Mr. Obama in a February debate that he hadn't held a hearing in his Foreign Relations subcommittee about Afghanistan. Republicans have adopted the line as well. Voters can expect the Republicans to needle Mr. Obama on his &quot;present&quot; votes in the Illinois state senate, something Mrs. Clinton often mentioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama on Wednesday gathered his new national security team, which now includes former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and retired Gen. Wesley Clark, who each previously backed Mrs. Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told reporters that their positions were similar and that's why &quot;it's so easy for ... senior advisers of Senator Clinton to support my candidacy&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Albright was not so kind last year when the Democrats sparred over whether to meet with leaders of rogue nations. She said in July that Mrs. Clinton's refusal to meet with the leaders without preconditions was a perfect answer while Mr. Obama's idea lacked &quot;diplomatic spadework.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That argument between the Democrats - one of their main differences - morphed into the first real fight between Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans are using words of former Clinton supporters who have said anything remotely negative about the presumed Democratic nominee against him, such as when Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland once compared Mr. Obama's run for the presidency to choosing the &quot;next American Idol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Clinton greatest hits the Republicans may be using this fall:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a February speech in the Washington: &quot;The American people don't have to guess whether I understand the issues or whether I would need a foreign policy instruction manual to guide me through a crisis, or whether I'd have to rely on advisers to introduce me to global affairs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late February in Ohio: &quot;We need a president who also realizes that we have real enemies. I know it's true, because I went to ground zero the day after 9/11. We need a president who knows what it takes to protect and defend the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December, Mrs. Clinton said she is &quot;ready on Day One&quot; while voters risk &quot;put[ting] America in the hands of someone with little national or international experience, who started running for president the day he arrived in the U.S. Senate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton aides and the RNC most of the year were on the same page, e-mailing reporters negative articles about Mr. Obama - and in particular his ties to indicted real estate developer Tony Rezko - within moments of each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never thought I'd compliment Clinton, but she actually made some solid points in the primary about Obama's weak judgment,&quot; said RNC spokesman Alex Conant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you ever turned on a TV in the D.C. area in the 1970s or '80s, you remember the Ourisman Chevrolet girl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was Susan Gailey, the radiant blonde who marched through the car lots in all those commercials singing the most indelible jingle of the era: &quot;You'll always get your way-aay / At Ourisman Chev-ro-let!&quot; The ads, an instant sensation, got her dubbed &quot;Washington's only sex symbol.&quot; She was mobbed in local restaurants, recognized on the street as far away as Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her career seemed so promising; then, she vanished. Now we know why: Gailey's daughter was the 13-year-old girl at the center of director Roman Polanski's sensational 1977 statutory rape case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though her daughter, Samantha Geimer, went public with her story more than a decade ago, a still shell-shocked Gailey remained in the shadows -- until last month, when she agreed to accompany her daughter to the N.Y.C. premiere of an acclaimed new HBO documentary about the case, &quot;Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She said, 'You need to stand up and face this -- you're going to feel better,' &quot; Gailey told us. &quot;You know, I did feel better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We reached Gailey via phone in Kilauea, on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Now 69, she's a real estate agent who hasn't worked in showbiz for years. We read Gailey a quote she gave in a Washington Post profile nearly 30 years ago that, in  hindsight, breaks your heart. (&quot;There came a time in my life that I don't want to talk about -- I don't know how you'll explain that, but I just went away.&quot;) Indeed, she told us, discretion was essential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our first thing was to protect Samantha,&quot; she said. &quot;The second thing was to protect my job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The York, Pa., native had moved her family to Los Angeles a few years after the Chevrolet commercials put her on the map. She quickly won roles on &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; and &quot;Police Woman&quot; -- but after the Polanski incident, &quot;I stopped dead in my tracks,&quot; she said. Gailey wanted to shield her daughter's identity. And because the unnamed mother who would let her young daughter attend a photo shoot with Polanski was being pilloried in the media (&quot;I was so stupid and naive,&quot; she told us), she also had to conceal her own involvement. Otherwise, she feared, she would lose the Chevrolet gigs that were supporting her family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gailey continued as the Ourisman Chevrolet girl into the late 1980s; she kept shooting ads for Casey Chevrolet in Virginia's  Tidewater  area into the 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She passed up a chance to be interviewed for the HBO documentary. &quot;The first time I watched it, it freaked me out, reliving that time,&quot; she said. She felt calmer by the time of the premiere. &quot;I met Roger Gunson, the prosecutor, who was just wonderful. He said, 'All those things they said about you weren't true.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gailey moved to Hawaii nearly two decades ago -- &quot;in the mountains, with peacocks and goats, horses, chickens, ducks, macaws.&quot; Both of her daughters and all of her five grandchildren live just minutes away. &quot;We're all happy, healthy, fine, healed, good,&quot; she said. So if anyone asked whatever happened to the Ourisman Chevrolet girl, she told us, &quot;You can say she died and went to Heaven.&quot;<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">In the Presidential Bake-Off, the Chips Are Off Old Blocks </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The recipe police are at it again! Both Cindy McCain and Bill Clinton are accused of stealing a sweet treat for Family Circle magazine's &quot;Presidential Cookie Bake-Off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates' spouses were each asked to submit their favorite cookie recipe for readers to vote on: McCain offered an oatmeal-butterscotch recipe from a &quot;good friend,&quot; Clinton submitted an oatmeal variety by a family cook, and Michelle Obama shared a fruity shortbread courtesy of her daughters' godmother. Sharp-eyed bakers quickly noticed that McCain's recipe -- &quot;an absolute must&quot; for family get-togethers -- was a duplicate of Hershey's, and Clinton's had been lifted straight from Betty Crocker. (This is the second time the McCain team got caught: In April, a campaign aide posted some family favorites that turned out to come from the Food Network.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's cut them some slack, people. Generations of home bakers (yes, even moms) have passed off plagiarized peanut puffs as original family heirlooms. And honestly, how many amateur cooks ever create their own recipes? Pass the chocolate chips and we'll forget the whole thing.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">A Joycean Irish Toast to a Day of Epic Proportions </SPAN><BR></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatives, seizing on the Supreme Court's ruling last week on Guantanamo detainees, want to turn the court into election fodder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope they succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No issue in this campaign is as simultaneously neglected and important. And the opposite reactions of John McCain and Barack Obama to the decision underscore how much is at stake for the future of the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama hailed the ruling for showing that &quot;a state can't just hold you for any reason without charging you and without giving you any kind of due process -- that's the essence of who we are.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain was initially mild, saying only that the decision &quot;obviously concerns me.&quot; By the next day, though, he was as over the top as Justice Antonin Scalia, who warned that the court's action &quot;will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed.&quot; Legal reasoning -- or ad copy for the Republican National Committee?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any event, McCain got the point. &quot;One of the worst decisions in the history of this country,&quot; he thundered last Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worse than Roe v. Wade, to take an example on which McCain and I differ but that illustrates the overheated nature of his reaction?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This reaction makes little sense from a man who has repeatedly vowed to shut down Guantanamo -- on his first day in office, no less -- and ship its remaining prisoners to Fort Leavenworth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, the whole point of stashing the detainees at Guantanamo was to avoid giving them the rights that everyone acknowledged they would have on U.S. soil. So the McCain solution -- sending them to Leavenworth -- would create the very situation he now decries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important, the ruling will not have anywhere near the disastrous consequences forecast by the McScalias of the world. The five-justice majority did not order that any detainees be freed. It didn't give al-Qaeda fighters an express ticket to federal court. In fact, it said, &quot;except in cases of undue delay,&quot; courts should stay out until the military makes the first judgment about whether prisoners should be held or released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain lamented that the court was giving rights to &quot;enemy combatants . . . ardently seeking to destroy the United States of America and all that we stand for and believe in.&quot; Strikes me that a big part of what we believe in is the rule of law and the notion that people can't be held indefinitely without a fair hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As his evolving reactions to the Guantanamo case may indicate, legal issues are not at the center of McCain's policy interests. But they are a top priority for conservative activists, which makes me all the more nervous about what a McCain presidency would mean for the court. Yes, a Democratic Senate could temper the kind of nominee McCain would select, but a conservative legal movement whose rallying cry is &quot;No More Souters&quot; will be hard to satisfy with an unknown commodity. Remember Harriet Miers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next president is almost certain to have one appointment, and quite possibly two or more. In addition, the oldest justices are also the most liberal: John Paul Stevens is 88; Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 75.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, a President McCain could shift the court significantly to the right, while a President Obama would be lucky, even with a Democratic Senate, to nudge the court even a bit in a liberal direction. More likely, he would merely be able to maintain the shaky, conservative-leaning status quo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is shaky indeed -- not just when it comes to abortion rights, the usual focus of Supreme Court debate in election years. Certainly, the addition of one or two conservative justices could mean, if not Roe's explicit demise, then a dramatic curtailing of the right to choose. Yet the court is at a tipping point on issues that range from the scope of presidential power to the separation of church and state to the future of affirmative action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, one of the casualties of a McCain appointee to the high court could be McCain's signature campaign finance legislation. The handwriting for the demise of McCain-Feingold is already on the wall -- and it comes from the very justices he praises as model nominees, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, who joined in a ruling last year to overturn a key part of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What, one wonders, would a President McCain say if and when the rest of McCain-Feingold goes -- that this, too, is one of the worst decisions ever?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ad: John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago. Today he has a realistic plan that will curb greenhouse gas emissions. A plan that will help grow our economy and protect our environment. Reform. Prosperity. Peace. John McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis: There is nothing subtle about this ad: The Republican senator from Arizona is explicitly trying to distance himself from an unpopular president. And his chosen issue is climate change, which just happens to have special appeal for independent voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain broke with President Bush last month when he proposed mandatory curbs on greenhouse gas emissions -- a step the administration has resisted -- along with emissions credits that polluting companies could trade. McCain's approach calls for a 60 percent reduction in emissions by 2050, compared with the 80 percent cut being pushed by his Democratic rival, Sen. Barack Obama (Ill.), and many scientists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While McCain is using global warming to neutralize Obama's charge that he's running for Bush's third term, he angered environmentalists this week by proposing to lift a ban on offshore oil drilling.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton has scheduled her first appearance with Sen. Barack Obama since the end of the Democratic nomination fight, a joint meeting with some of her top contributors next week at the Mayflower Hotel, officials from both camps confirmed yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton h  as not appeared in public since endorsing her rival on June 7, going on vacation after that. But her finance director, Jonathan Mantz, has reportedly been working overtime to arrange the introduction of some of Clinton's fundraisers to Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mantz informed donors about the June 26 get-together in e-mails and urged them to attend.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day after hiring Patti Solis Doyle, who was fired from Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign in February, Sen. Barack Obama praised her as a &quot;terrific, experienced campaign hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama sparked fury from some Clinton insiders when he tapped Solis Doyle to serve as chief of staff to his as-yet-unpicked running mate. Her selection strongly suggests that Obama is not considering Clinton for the ticket, a move that one Clinton donor on Monday called a &quot;slap in the face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talking to reporters on his plane, Obama said he has known Solis Doyle for years and organized with her brother in Chicago. &quot;I've known the family for a very long time,&quot; Obama said. &quot;I think that she will bring not only a set of skills that we're going to need as we put together our ticket, but she's going to be a terrific adviser and offer insight and judgment that will help us win in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is slated to debut today and run for a week in the general-election swing states of Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan, with an additional run on CNN and MSNBC funded by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The initial investment is expected to reach $543,000, a MoveOn spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has refused to commit to any Iraq withdrawal plan, and has speculated that U.S. troops could remain in the country for decades, similar to the ongoing American military presence in South Korea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As voters pay ever-higher gas prices, Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama are fleeing from their previous energy policy stances, with the Republican embracing expanded drilling and the Democrat seeking to punish energy companies he voted to reward just three years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential candidates also traded fire over how to pursue the war on terrorism, with Mr. McCain's camp accusing Mr. Obama of &quot;a perfect manifestation of a Sept. 10th mind-set&quot; for praising the way the nation treated the 1993 World Trade Center bombing as a law-enforcement matter. Mr. Obama countered that Republicans' war on terrorism hasn't produced Osama bin Laden. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think they have much standing to suggest they've learned a lot of lessons from 9/11,&quot; Mr. Obama told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain traveled Tuesday to Houston, the nation's oil capital, to reverse positions and propose an end to the federal ban on expanded offshore drilling. He also took the opportunity to blast Mr. Obama's call for a windfall profits tax on oil companies, saying it was a solution straight from the 1970s, even though the senator from Arizona was open to such a tax just last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Senator Obama] wants a windfall profits tax on oil, to go along with the new taxes he also plans for coal and natural gas. If the plan sounds familiar, it's because that was President Jimmy Carter's big idea, too, and a lot of good it did us,&quot; Mr. McCain said. &quot;Now, as then, all a windfall profits tax will accomplish is to increase our dependence on foreign oil, and hinder exactly the kind of domestic exploration and production we need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama blasted Mr. McCain for going to Texas to &quot;tell a group of Houston oil executives exactly what they wanted to hear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Much like his gas tax gimmick that would leave consumers with pennies in savings, opening our coastlines to offshore drilling would take at least a decade to produce any oil at all, and the effect on gasoline prices would be negligible at best since America only has 3 percent of the world's oil,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama this week has been attacking a 2005 energy bill as a symbol of Washington's counterproductive corporate giveaways, even though he voted for that measure. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, New York Democrat, used that vote against Mr. Obama during their heated primary battle, saying in New Hampshire that if you &quot;rail against&quot; tax breaks for big oil but &quot;you voted for Dick Cheney's energy bill&quot; in 2005, &quot;that's not change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain also voted against the energy bill, calling it &quot;a grab-bag of corporate favors,&quot; and Republicans slammed Mr. Obama in a Web ad Tuesday for hypocrisy on the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaigns acknowledge that high gasoline prices have become the dominant issue, and polling shows most Americans are ready for anything that could bring relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Fox 5/The Washington Times/Rasmussen Reports poll released this week found that 53 percent of Americans say the U.S. should start drilling even in protected nature preserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is further than either candidate has been willing to go, though by supporting some new drilling Mr. McCain has topped Mr. Obama in calling for more production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats balked at the polling, saying it was based on the premise that drilling would lower prices - something Sen. Bill Nelson, Florida Democrat, disputed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Drilling offshore does not lower oil prices,&quot; Mr. Nelson argued. &quot;Drilling is not about the price of oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course you're going to get an answer, 'Yes,' to that question. It's not a real reflection of the general public's feeling out there,&quot; Mr. Nelson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nelson likened Mr. McCain to defeated Republican Resources Committee Chairman Richard Pombo. The congressman from California lost his seat in 2006 in part because environmental groups targeted him for pushing coastal drilling and for being tied to oil donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the Richard Pombo plan pulled off the shelf,&quot; Mr. Nelson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatives and advocates for expanded drilling also accused Mr. McCain of hypocrisy, saying his new position leaves him supporting local decision-making in some cases, and opposing it in others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it is proper to grant the coastal states authority over offshore energy production - and we believe it is - then it is also proper to grant Alaskans the same authority over the state and federal lands on ANWR's frozen coastal plain,&quot; said Thomas J. Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research. &quot;The people of Alaska have been asking Washington for this right for more than two decades.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain defended the distinction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Quite rightly, I believe, we confer a special status on some areas of our country that are best left undisturbed. When America set aside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we called it a &quot; refug &quot; for a reason,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans compared the senator from Illinois to Mr. Carter on energy and to 2004 Democratic presidential nominee Sen. John Kerry for the terrorism comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kerry, of Massachusetts, was attacked repeatedly for saying terrorism was a law-enforcement matter, and McCain national security adviser Randy Scheunemann leveled a similar charge against Mr. Obama, citing the &quot;September 10th mind-set.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He does not understand the nature of the enemies we face,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kerry, in a conference call on behalf of Mr. Obama Tuesday, said Mr. McCain offers his own failed policy and that Mr. Obama is a breakthrough. He said Mr. Obama's position that he would unilaterally bomb a target in Pakistan shows that the Democrat has a better understanding of the post-Sept. 11 world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I do not take it lightly,&quot; the likely Republican presidential nominee said of Virginia and its 13 electoral votes. &quot;I watched the results of recent elections in this state, so I do have a lot of work to do,&quot; he added at a news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democrats have won the past two elections for governor and unseated a Republican for a Senate seat in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the last Democratic presidential candidate to win the state was President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A McCain strategy memo released online last week counted Virginia as one of 17 &quot;solidly Republican&quot; states. But University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato called that laughable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That is a pure bluff. Nobody buys it,&quot; he said. &quot;They are thinking in terms of a 2004 electorate. They are going to get a very different and larger electorate in 2008.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The biggest changes, Sabato said, will be a huge black turnout and lopsided fundraising in favor of Sen. Barack Obama, the probable Democratic nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Big Obama&nbsp;ad buys in Virginia could force McCain to come back to the state more often than he would like, Sabato said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain called yesterday for an end to the federal ban on offshore oil drilling, offering an aggressive response to high gasoline prices and immediately drawing the ire of environmental groups that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has courted for months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move is aimed at easing voter anger over rising energy prices by freeing states to open vast stretches of the country's coastline to oil exploration. In a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, nearly 80 percent said soaring prices at the pump are causing them financial hardship, the highest in surveys this decade. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must embark on a national mission to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil,&quot; McCain told reporters yesterday. In a speech today, he plans to add that &quot;we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the United States. But a broad federal moratorium stands in the way of energy exploration and production. . . . It is time for the federal government to lift these restrictions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's announcement is a reversal of the position he took in his 2000 presidential campaign and a break with environmental activists, even as he attempts to win the support of independents and moderate Democrats. Since becoming the presumptive GOP nominee in March, McCain has presented himself as a friend of the environment by touting his plans to combat global warming and his opposition to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and in the Everglades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of several environmental groups criticized him for backing an idea they said would endanger the nation's most environmentally sensitive waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's disappointing that Senator McCain is clinging to the failed energy policies of the past,&quot; said Tiernan Sittenfeld, legislative director for the League of Conservation Voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Club political director Cathy Duvall said McCain &quot;is using the environment as a way to portray himself as being different from George Bush. But the reality is that he isn't.&quot; The group began running radio commercials yesterday that criticize McCain's environmental record in the battleground state of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Sen. Barack Obama joined the criticism, calling the idea of lifting the ban the wrong answer to out-of-control energy prices. &quot;John McCain's plan to simply drill our way out of our energy crisis is the same misguided approach backed by President Bush that has failed our families for too long and only serves to benefit the big oil companies,&quot; Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy policy -- led by the spike in gas prices -- is now a top-tier issue in the campaign, forcing both candidates to shift their attention from other domestic issues and foreign affairs. Spot prices for a barrel of crude oil briefly hit an all-time high yesterday, flirting with $140 a barrel before settling back to a bit less than $134.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Post-ABC poll, conducted Thursday through Sunday, about half of those surveyed called high gas prices a serious burden, while the issue emerged for the first time during the campaign as a top concern for voters. Obama held double-digit leads over McCain as the candidate more trusted to deal with gasoline prices and energy policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While both candidates have spoken about the need to shift to cleaner energy sources, they have proposed different ways to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain backs federal subsidies for building more nuclear power plants, which he considers the best way to reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions. He plans to begin outlining his energy proposals in the first of three major speeches today in Houston. Aides said the centerpiece of the speech will be the proposal to lift the ban on drilling, but McCain will also have harsh words for market speculators who are driving up the cost of oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Investigation is underway to root out this kind of reckless wagering, unrelated to any kind of productive commerce, because it can distort the market, drive prices beyond rational limits, and put the investments and pensions of millions of Americans at risk,&quot; he will say in the speech, according to excerpts the campaign provided yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama backs using money raised through an auction of greenhouse-gas emissions credits to bolster research and development projects, while imposing requirements on how much renewable energy public utilities would have to buy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday in the down-at-the-heels manufacturing city of Flint, Mich., Obama said that a new energy policy must be part of government efforts to revive the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our dependence on foreign oil strains family budgets and it saps our economy. Oil money pays for the bombs going off from Baghdad to Beirut, and the bombast of dictators from Caracas to Tehran,&quot; Obama said. &quot;Our nation will not be secure unless we take that leverage away, and our planet will not be safe unless we move decisively toward a clean energy future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's call for an end to the coastal oil drilling ban is at odds with his oft-stated view that drilling should remain off-limits in sensitive areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Asked by reporters about those places, McCain said yesterday that he still thinks the refuge is a &quot;pristine&quot; area and opposes drilling there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator's push to end the ban is sure to annoy two key Republican allies -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist -- both of whom oppose drilling off their states' coastlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schwarzenegger spokesman Aaron McLear noted the governor's overall support for McCain's candidacy but said: &quot;There are things that he and the senator will agree on, and things they won't agree on.&quot; Crist said in a statement: &quot;It has become increasingly clear that we must be pragmatic in protecting both our beaches and our economy. We look forward to the dialogue as we move forward to protect both our environment and our country's economic interests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress created a moratorium on new drilling off the coast in 1981, and every president since then has extended it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While McCain has traditionally sided with environmentalists on climate change, he has a mixed voting record on oil drilling and support for renewable energy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Countrywide Financial sweetheart-loan scandal continues to grow, spreading to senators and other Beltway potentates. We are about to find out if Congress' passion for investigating business ethics extends to conflicts of interest and cash that involve fellow members,&quot; the Wall Street Journal says in an editorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Take Sen. Kent Conrad, the North Dakota Democrat whose office issued a Friday statement saying that 'I never met Angelo Mozilo.' What he did not say then but admitted under later questioning by a Journal reporter is that, although he may not have had a face-to-face meeting with the Countrywide CEO, Mr. Conrad had called Mr. Mozilo and asked for a loan. The result was a discounted loan on his million-dollar beach house and a separate commercial loan of a type that residential lender Countrywide did not even offer to other customers, regardless of the rate,&quot; the Journal said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So after calling the CEO of a company with various matters before the Senate, asking for a loan and then receiving at least two sweetheart deals, Mr. Conrad now says: 'I did not think for one moment - and no one ever suggested to me - that I was getting preferential treatment.' Lawyers will immediately wonder if this isn't a version of the 'ostrich defense,' which judges describe during jury instruction as willful blindness or deliberate ignorance. For what other reason, besides preferential treatment, would one call the CEO of the mortgage company? Does Mr. Conrad call August Busch IV when he wants to buy a six-pack?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both agree</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman John Ensign have in common?&quot; Human Events political editor John Gizzi asks at www.human events.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The answer is that both agree, at least for now, that the Democratic Party will increase its present 51-to-49 seat advantage in the U.S. Senate after elections this November,&quot; Mr. Gizzi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In back-to-back meetings hosted by the Christian Science Monitor in Washington last week, the chairman of the DNC and head of the campaign arm for Senate Republicans differed only in the number of seats they anticipated Democrats will have after the '08 elections. Dean told a Monitor breakfast on Wednesday, June 11, that he expected 'we'll pick up from five to seven seats' in the Senate. At a Monitor lunch the next day, Nevada Sen. Ensign told reporters that for his party to lose no more than three seats this fall 'would be a terrific night for us. I don't want to slip below the four-seat loss.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary's stature</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whys and wherefores of the collapse of Hillary Clinton's campaign are already achingly familiar. The more interesting question is what Hillary achieved in spite of losing, and maybe even because of it,&quot; New York magazine's John Heilemann writes at nymag.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rapidly congealing conventional wisdom is that the answer is worse than nothing: Her legacy has been tarnished, her status degraded, and her reputation diminished by the brass-knuckle brawl she waged against [Sen. Barack] Obama. But arguments can be made that, by historical standards, Clinton's treatment of Obama wasn't all that rough; that, far from weakening him for his tussle with John McCain, she made him appreciably stronger; that by fighting until the end, she helped gin up a fever-pitch level of engagement among Democrats that will redound to the party's benefit this fall, rather than undermining it,&quot; Mr. Heilemann said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What strikes me as inarguable is that Hillary is today a more resonant, consequential and potent figure than she has ever been before. No longer merely a political persona, she has been elevated to a rarefied plane in our cultural consciousness. With her back against the wall, she both found her groove and let loose her raging id, turning herself into a character at once awful and wonderful, confounding and inspiring - thus enlarging herself to the point where she became iconic. She is bigger now than any woman in the country. Certainly, she is bigger than her husband. And although in the end she may wind up being dwarfed by Obama, for the moment she is something he is not: fully, poignantly human.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Losing issue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; 'Climate change is never going to rise to the status of a top-tier political issue' is how one top climate-policy expert recently described the political lay of the land to me,&quot; James Pethokoukis writes in a blog at www.usnews.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just take a look at the results of a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. The top issue for voters (27 percent) was job creation and economic growth. Right behind was the war in Iraq (24 percent). Then came energy and gas prices (18 percent). Far down the list were the environment and global warming, at a minuscule 4 percent,&quot; Mr. Pethokoukis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So despite all the media attention on global warming as an existential threat to humanity, it still scores a bit below illegal immigration in the hierarchy of voter concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there lies an opportunity for John McCain to turn the issues of energy and the environment to his advantage in his race against Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1110 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with one of the worst national political environments in modern political history, Republican incumbents are turning to a tried-and-true approach to win reelection: pork.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent ads for Sens. Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Elizabeth Dole (N.C.) and Norm Coleman (Minn.), the incumbents highlight their ability to work across party lines to deliver dollars for their respective states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Call it the clout factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clout is certainly something people want out of their senators,&quot; said Sen. John Ensign (Nev.), chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, adding that any GOP incumbent on the ballot this fall faces serious peril. &quot;If you have an 'R' in front of your name, you had better run scared,&quot; Ensign said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dole's ad notes that she helped win $4 billion for agriculture programs and kept &quot;every major North Carolina military base&quot; from closing during the latest round of the Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that's clout . . . that's Elizabeth Dole,&quot; say two of the North Carolinians featured in the commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McConnell's ad strikes a similar tone -- seeking to turn his role as Senate minority leader into a positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senate Leader Mitch McConnell has a vision for a new Kentucky,&quot; says the narrator, before noting that the Republican has delivered $280 million for the state's university system, $70 million to &quot;fight crime&quot; and $1 billion for parks and conservation. &quot;The leader who can do more for Kentucky's future,&quot; the narrator says at the end of the commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Coleman's ad, he touts his ability to bring compromise. &quot;The business of serving the people is about making a difference and about doing something, not just fighting about it but doing something about it,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's not in the ads is as important as what is. In none of the three commercials is President Bush's name mentioned. The limited use of the Republican brand is particularly striking in Kentucky and North Carolina, which Bush carried with 60 percent and 56 percent, respectively, during the 2004 election. Coleman's qualifying his party ties makes more sense, given that in 2004 Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) won Minnesota by three percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears as though McConnell, Coleman and Dole have all reached the conclusion that the only message that can win for a Republican in the current environment is a purely transactional one: Reelect me, and I'll continue to bring home the bacon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While pork-barrel spending is decried by many politicians in Washington -- including, loudly, by presumptive GOP nominee John McCain -- there's a reason it remains a staple. Many voters like to see their politicians providing &quot;deliverables&quot; back home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In places such as Kentucky and North Carolina, highlighting the delivery of federal dollars could be even more effective, given the slowdowns in the two states' economies. Money coming back to a state means jobs, and, in an economic downturn, voters -- no matter how much they may dislike the president or stand in opposition to the war in Iraq -- can get behind someone who is helping them keep their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Dole, Coleman and McConnell -- as well as Republican senators in tougher reelection fights, such as John E. Sununu (N.H.) and Gordon Smith (Ore.) -- the transactional approach may well be their best path to reelection.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Revolution's Bucks </SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.) officially suspended his presidential campaign Thursday night, having never won a GOP primary or caucus but nonetheless stirring up an impressive cadre of passionate supporters eager to follow his Libertarian-style lead. In the process, Paul proved himself to be a surprisingly strong fundraiser, bringing in $35 million through April 30, with $4.7 million left in the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So while Paul's army waits for word of where the &quot;revolution&quot; will lead them next, Republicans around town might be more interested to know what he intends to do with all that cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is time now to take the energy this campaign has awakened and channel it into long-term efforts to take back our country,&quot; Paul wrote on his campaign site. &quot;We have some exciting plans and projects to move the revolution forward that will come together in the next several months. Watch for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul doesn't plan to endorse McCain, and he still appears intent on holding an alternative convention in Minnesota while the official Republican National Convention is underway in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Perhaps more important, Paul plans to support Libertarian-leaning candidates within the GOP for various offices. Does that mean he will back primary challenges to sitting Republicans? That's not clear yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is indisputable is that Paul has demonstrated the ability to mobilize large numbers of volunteers and supporters quickly, and that he can back up his preferred candidates with financial support. The vast majority of his contributors are small-dollar donors, the kind campaigns salivate over because they can be asked to contribute again and again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through March 31, Paul's House reelection committee gave $26,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee and contributed to a handful of GOP incumbents and candidates -- more than Paul has given in other recent election cycles. His fellow House GOPers might want to try to stay on his good side, lest they end up on the wrong end of the revolution in their next primary campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">P  LAYERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) continues to tap senior aides to former senator Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) for critical roles in the general-election race. Mindy Myers and Mitch Stewart are the most recent additions. Myers, who had been serving as chief of staff to Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), has a long history with Daschle, having worked in his Senate office and served as political director of DASHPAC -- Dedicated Americans for Senate and House Political Action Committee. Stewart, too, goes way back with Daschle. He was a field organizer for Sen. Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) in his 2002 reelection victory over then-Rep. John Thune (R) and served as field director for Daschle's unsuccessful reelection bid in 2004 (a race lost to Thune). Stewart served as Obama's Iowa caucus director this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 12 DAYS: Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, one of the most mentioned names in the Republican veepstakes, will speak at a dinner for the Connecticut Republican Party. The dinner has been a hotbed of national political talent, having hosted former Florida governor Jeb Bush and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  54 DAYS: The Summer Olympics begin in Beijing, China. The games are sure to dominate the news for the two weeks they will span, shunting all but the most urgent of political coverage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain is seemingly imitating the campaign strategy Hillary Clinton used against Barack Obama during the Democratic primaries and caucuses. Like Mrs. Clinton, Mr. McCain is emphasizing his experience and foreign-policy credentials. His campaign is also mirroring her campaign focus on winning big states, courting swing voters, and wooing the white, blue-collar vote. Mrs. Clinton achieved some success with this formula. Yet in the long run, her strategy failed. Why, then, is Mr. McCain adopting an approach that ultimately failed for Mrs. Clinton?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Experience: Mrs. Clinton stated throughout her campaign that Mr. Obama did not have sufficient experience. Exit polls from the Democratic primaries and caucuses revealed that the majority of voters agreed with Mrs. Clinton. Voters nonetheless concluded that he has good judgment and is a capable leader. Also, change mattered more to them than experience. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain is touting his many years of experience. The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll reveals that the majority of voters state that Mr. McCain is indeed more experienced than Barack Obama. Yet they regard Mr. Obama as more likeable and inspirational. By a margin of 54 percent to 42 percent, voters declare that they prefer a candidate who will bring &quot;greater changes&quot; rather than one who has more experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Foreign policy: During the campaign, Mrs. Clinton repeatedly stated that Mr. Obama would not be an effective commander-in-chief. In February, she launched the infamous 3 a.m. campaign ad. However, Mrs. Clinton's emphasis on her foreign-policy credentials backfired. It led to highlighting her 2002 vote in support of the Iraq war resolution - a war that the majority of Americans are weary of. It also led to placing her foreign policy record in the spotlight. As a result, any gaffe in this area received much press coverage. Recall her statement that she landed in Bosnia, in 1996, under sniper fire. Video footage surfaced revealing that she arrived peacefully and was greeted by a young girl. The press and public lampooned her as a liar. Also, in March, when her schedule as first lady was released to the public, it was clear she had been little more than her husband's informal adviser during his presidency. In short, Mrs. Clinton appeared weak and inconsequential in foreign affairs - an area she had claimed was one of her major strengths. By the time she refocused her campaign message on the economy, it was too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, Mr. McCain is touting his foreign policy credentials. And this, too, puts attention on the Iraq War - which 68 percent of Americans oppose. Also, Mr. McCain's foreign policy gaffes - such as confusing Sunni and Shi'ite, declaring that American troops might be in Iraq for &quot;one hundred years,&quot; and stating that it is not &quot;too important&quot; to bring the troops home but to keep them from harm's way - are magnified by the media. The rest of his message is drowned in the roar. Simultaneously, Mr. Obama's campaign is deftly linking Mr. McCain's foreign-policy credentials to an unpopular war, an unpopular president and the &quot;failed politics of the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Big states and swing voters: In her campaign strategy, Mrs. Clinton focused on the big states. She tried to woo swing voters such as Jews, Hispanics and women. She did indeed succeed in winning many of the big states and she won the support of the majority of swing voters. Yet, she still lost the overall pledged delegate count and the superdelegate count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, is still campaigning as though we were in 2000 or 2004 - as though the 2008 Democratic primaries had not occurred. Was he awake during the Democratic primaries? Like Mrs. Clinton, he too is focusing on battleground states and swing voters. Indeed, he needs to make these efforts. However, he cannot take the conservative base for granted - which he has yet to secure. He must also have a broader national strategy that attracts new voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*White, blue-collar voters: Mrs. Clinton was successful at the end of her campaign in courting white, blue-collar voters. She emphasized pocketbook issues, portrayed Mr. Obama as an elitist and - to the nation's horror -played the race card. Her campaign rebounded in the final months. She won West Virginia, Kentucky and Puerto Rico by large margins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain is attempting to woo the white, blue-collar vote with his economic platform and his straight-talk personality. Mr. McCain is trailing Mr. Obama by a margin of 42 percent to 47 percent with blue-collar voters. The Arizona senator has a slight lead with white voters, 47 percent to 41 percent. Will this be enough to win the election when it was not ultimately sufficient for Mrs. Clinton?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain has yet to grasp that the old electoral map and the old politics are dead. In interviews held recently at The Washington Times, leading Republicans, such as former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and Rep. Tom Davis, drew attention to Republican deficiencies. They called for greater party cohesion and better campaign planning. Mr. McCain should heed their advice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVERYBODY KNOWS the very first rule in picking a vice presidential nominee is to do no harm. Really, you can choose anybody. How dumb would you feel if it turned into an embarrassment? This is why the careful, modern candidate sets up a screening system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how dumb would you feel if you got into trouble over your selection for the vice presidential screener? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is having the first post-primary crisis . James Johnson, who resigned Wednesday as the leader of the Obama vice presidential selection committee, is an old Washington hand who had helped Walter Mondale and John Kerry with the same task. His aura of experience was apparently not diminished one whit by the fact that both the candidates he assisted lost, and that one of them ran into embarrassing controversies over his running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immediate cause of Johnson's downfall was a charge that he had been given a sweet deal on three home loans by the head of Countrywide Financial Corp., which Obama had criticized for its role in the subprime lending crisis. Since Countrywide seems to hold the mortgage on every house in the United States, it is also disliked by many, many Americans on general principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, not so bad. As Obama pointed out, you cannot really expect a presidential candidate to set up a committee to vet the people who are going to be on the vetting committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there's all this other stuff. Johnson is the former head of Fannie Mae, which under his direction, according to regulators, engaged in accounting practices that were, at best, sloppy. At the same time, he sat on the boards of five corporations, where he appeared to serve as cheerleader for the theory that corporate executives deserve to be paid obscene amounts of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does someone go up to Obama, who once sponsored a bill to curb excessive executive compensation, and say, &quot;You know the vice presidential search committee? For chairman, how about Jim Johnson? Remember the guy who tried to give the head of UnitedHealth Group $1.4 billion in stock options?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Johnson quit Wednesday, the McCain headquarters issued a statement saying that the fact he had been selected in the first place raised &quot;serious questions about Barack Obama's judgment.&quot; This does not seem like a great avenue of attack for a campaign in which a large chunk of the top staff was recently dismissed for being lobbyists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps in an attempt to differentiate the cases, the McCain spokesman said: &quot;America can't afford a president who flip-flops on key questions in the course of 24 hours.&quot; Under a McCain presidency, the bleeding would presumably go on for weeks and weeks before the inevitable occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although McCain has, so far, not demonstrated that he can manage anything more challenging than a backyard barbecue, that still does not make the Johnson situation look any better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the vice presidential vetting committee is not a job for which there are a limited number of qualified candidates. You could appoint a hero firefighter or a nun to be the public face of the search. You hire experts to do the background checks. You would want your own trusted advisers sitting in on the interviews. The other two committee members, Caroline Kennedy and a former deputy attorney general, could have managed on their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But no, we have to have a seasoned wise man whose high standing among the movers and shakers of the nation's business and political elite seemed to hinge on the fact that he feels every single one of them deserves more money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gentle spirits may decide that it's a good thing the Obama campaign is getting this sort of thing out of the way early. Crueler ones may note that at least they can't blame this one on Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before the final primaries, I was in South Dakota talking to George McGovern, who is the gold standard when it comes to disastrous vice presidential selections. If Obama ever asked him for advice, McGovern said, he'd tell him to avoid exhaustion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got that advice from Barry Goldwater. He said watch out for fatigue. That's when you make mistakes,&quot; McGovern added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One ridiculous decision doesn't mean Obama won't be a good candidate, but it does suggest he needs to take a long nap.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a year after Congress pledged to curb pork barrel funding known as earmarks, lawmakers are gearing up for another spending binge, directing billions toward organizations and companies in their home districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earmark spending in the House's defense authorization bill alone soared 29 percent last month, from $7.7 billion last year to $9.9 billion now, according to data compiled by Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan watchdog group in the District. The Senate bill has not been approved, but the proposal includes an increased number of earmarks, although for a slightly lesser total cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawmakers had promised to cut back on earmarks and mandated better disclosure of them after steady criticism that they were funding programs with little debate or oversight. The promises led to an initial decline in earmarks last year that was trumpeted on Capitol Hill. But the new data show that they are surging again, at least in the proposed Pentagon authorization budget, which sets out priorities to be funded in a later appropriations bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both parties talk a good game on cutting earmarks, but at first opportunity, the House larded up,&quot; said Stephen Ellis, vice president of the watchdog group. &quot;This is just another broken promise.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think of a way to spend money on defense, and it could easily be among the hundreds of projects added quietly to the House and Senate spending plans this spring. Many of the earmarks serve as no-bid contracts for the recipients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Requests include $204,000 for an infantry platoon battle course from Sens. Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor, both Arkansas Democrats; $2.2 million for nanofluids for advanced military mobility from Rep. Geoff Davis (R-Ky); $98 million for a Northrop Grumman project to develop an aircraft sensor suite, from Sens. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.) and Mel Martinez (R-Fla.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambliss was a part of another bipartisan group of lawmakers who also requested allocating $497 million to United Technologies, Lockheed Martin and Pratt &amp; Whitney for &quot;advanced procurement or line close down costs,&quot; the watchdog group's data show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funding for an indoor small-arms range in Connecticut? It's in there too, at $11 million, care of Sens. Lieberman and Christopher J.  Dodd (D-Conn.) So is $10 million for school-age services on a military base in Kentucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tens of millions of dollars more are directed at lawmakers' state universities, sometimes for research of metals, composites and other technology. That includes $2.5 million for development of three-dimensional integrated circuit research at Boise State University and $3 million for &quot;superstructural particle evaluation&quot; at East Carolina University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest surge has occurred under Democratic leadership of Congress, but it is difficult to compare earmark spending with that of Republican-controlled Congresses because there was no disclosure requirement until last year. This year, all sides have racked up some big requests in the defense authorization bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Senate, Lieberman led the way with his participation in 14 requests worth more than $292 million, some of them involving more than one lawmaker, the watchdog group data show. Sen. Carl M. Levin (D-Mich.) made 48 requests, many with colleagues, worth more than $198 million. Sens. Jeff Sessions (Ala.) and Elizabeth Dole (N.C.) led Republicans by participating in requests totaling $188 million and $182 million, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading earmarkers in the House include Democrats Solomon P. Ortiz (Tex.) and Neil Abercrombie (Hawaii) and Republicans Duncan Hunter (Calif.) and Robin Hayes (N.C.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earmark spending has a long history, and some lawmakers said it is a constitutional right for Congress to control the government's purse. Proponents note that earmarks often provide funding to organizations doing good work that otherwise would not get a dime from Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other lawmakers contend that the standard practice on Capitol Hill of slipping in earmarked extras -- often at the behest of lobbyists working for corporations, universities and other beneficiaries -- is fostering an atmosphere of dirty politics. Critics said the process of sorting through earmarks also distracts lawmakers from providing oversight of other budget matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said the budget system almost demands that lawmakers use earmarks to win support from voters. He said his colleagues also award earmarks with the expectation that they will generate campaign contributions from happy recipients and their lobbyists, a dynamic that Taxpayers for Common Sense describes as the &quot;pay-to-play system.&quot; Lawmakers often boast of the earmarks they have obtained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data compiled by the watchdog group show that 60 percent of the members of the House Armed Services Committee who arranged earmarks also received campaign contributions from the companies that received the funding. Almost all the members of the committee received campaign contributions from companies that got earmarks this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's corrupting. It's a much bigger problem than the sum of its parts. It's much more than just waste,&quot; said Flake, who has criticized both Republican and Democratic colleagues for questionable earmarked projects. &quot;One good defense earmark can yield tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Silvestre Reyes (D-Tex.), for instance, requested a $4 million earmark for Digital Fusion, a company whose executives have recently donated $18,000 to the lawmaker. Rep. Todd Akin (R-Mo.) also inserted a $5.4 million earmark for Clean Earth Technologies, whose executives have donated $14,000 to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vincent Perez, a spokesman for Reyes, said, &quot;The congressman's appropriations projects are carefully vetted to ensure they are consistent with the needs and interests of his constituency, and there is no connection between his fundraising efforts and his work in Congress.&quot; Akin's office said his earmark was for developing imaging technology that &quot;would be a huge step forward in force protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate also relies on earmarks, though not quite so heavily. The number of earmarks in the Senate defense authorization bill rose sharply from 309 to 435, although the overall spending declined slightly this year, to $5.4 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The requests by Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, included earmarks to General Motors, whose executives have recently donated $29,000 to the senator, according to the watchdog group. Levin's office did not respond to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of earmarks is not going to go away anytime soon. Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill), the presumptive Democratic nominee for the White House, disclosed in March that he had sought $740 million in earmarks over the past three years, about a third of which received funding. He has also proposed legislation requiring better disclosure of earmarks before they are approved. GOP rival Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), one of the sharpest earmark critics in Congress, has made it a point to buck the trend and avoid asking for earmarks.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, June 12</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Microphone in hand and surrounded on all sides by friendly inquisitors, Republican Sen. John McCain called on a man in the back row of New York's Federal Hall on Thursday night and waited for another opportunity to demonstrate his mastery of the off-the-cuff answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to put our country first and not our party first, and too many people have that reversed,&quot; McCain told the man, who asked about how he would break Washington gridlock. &quot;And by the way, this is not a cheap shot. It's a matter of record. . . . You put your finger on what has to be done. Yes, there's going to be a change in Washington, but will it be the right kind of change or the wrong kind of change?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is McCain's arena of choice -- the town hall -- where mixing serious answers with flip comments and the occasional sarcastic insult has become his trademark as much as the smartly crafted speech in front of thousands defines his rival, Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.). Now, the McCain campaign sees town halls as a necessity, hoping the old-style format will serve as a video-age counterweight to the rhetorical chasm between his stilted and sometimes awkward speechmaking and Obama's often rousing delivery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain (Ariz.) has dared Obama to join him at 10 town hall meetings during the next 10 weeks, answering questions from a few hundred undecided people at a time. If it works as the campaign hopes, voters will see McCain as the more informed candidate, with a better command of the nitty-gritty issues that presidents face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This isn't a gimmick or some type of a hidden ruse,&quot; said McCain adviser Steve Schmidt, calling it a way to elevate the presidential debate and a chance to &quot;change the trajectory of this campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea has helped soothe concerns among Republican strategists, who have been distraught over McCain's inability to compete with Obama's rhetorical flair. That contrast was never more evident than on the day last week when Obama clinched the Democratic nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a widely panned speech in Louisiana designed to kick off the general election, McCain flubbed some lines and smiled awkwardly at moments. He stood in front of a green banner and spoke to a crowd of a couple of hundred, a setting that was lampooned by Democrats and Republicans alike. An hour or so later, Obama spoke in the center of a St. Paul, Minn., arena in front of 17,000 screaming supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain has the potential in town hall meetings to be really good. He has almost no potential to be really good in a big speech and zero potential being better than Obama in a big speech,&quot; said one Republican consultant, who asked for anonymity to discuss the campaign's strategy on the town hall challenge. &quot;It's the one format where he could legitimately shine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the risks are huge for McCain. He is essentially betting the presidency on a series of side-by-side performances with his rival in a largely uncontrolled environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As evidence of the danger, McCain's most famous gaffes have come during town hall meetings. It was at a January town hall in Derry, N.H., that McCain said it would be &quot;fine with me&quot; if U.S. troops stay in Iraq for 50 years or more, providing a sound bite that his political rivals have put to great use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Make it a hundred,&quot; he said, cutting off the questioner as a bit of annoyance showed through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When McCain is on his own, town hall audiences are generally filled with Republicans, most of whom are supporters and often allow him to joke or finesse his way out of tough answers. The dynamic with Obama would be different, with a more skeptical audience and with  McCain's chief rival on stage ready to challenge his answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing next to Obama during televised town hall meetings could also highlight the kind of direct comparison that most campaigns strive to avoid: the image of a 71-year-old candidate next to one who is 46.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could give Obama a chance to upstage McCain, looking presidential in the one forum that had been exclusively McCain's. Although Obama's performance in debates was more uneven than his formal speechmaking, McCain's advisers say they do not believe the Harvard-educated lawyer will flop in a town hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a risk that I believe is absolutely worth taking,&quot; said Mark McKinnon, a former media consultant for McCain who helped conceive the town hall challenge. &quot;I think when people see McCain unvarnished, they like what they see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem for McCain is that most people in the country do not see him at his town hall meetings. After well over 100 of them during the primary campaign, they have become routine, unlikely to garner more than a brief mention in news reports. Joint town hall meetings with Obama would be seen as grand political theater and would almost surely be televised nationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One result would be plenty of free media exposure for a campaign that has little hope of matching Obama in ad dollars. In the primaries, Obama spent nearly $78 million on television commercials, and McCain spent about $11 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One GOP adviser said the consensus in the campaign is that town halls are McCain's &quot;best setting,&quot; whereas Obama is &quot;only average&quot; in unscripted exchanges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was during debates with his Democratic rivals that Obama said he would meet with anti-U.S. heads of government without conditions. And  the candidate answered a question about how he would respond to another al-Qaeda attack with the wonkish answer that he would ensure an &quot;effective emergency response.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's use of town halls has become legendary. In his 2000 campaign, they helped create his reputation for &quot;straight talk&quot; because he was willing to take tough, unscripted questions. After his 2008 campaign imploded last summer, he held 100 town hall meetings in New Hampshire in a bid to revive the &quot;maverick spirit&quot; of his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed with that confidence, McCain has challenged Obama to one town hall meeting each week, to have started with Thursday night's forum at Federal Hall, where George Washington took his first presidential oath of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama initially praised the idea, but his campaign said Thursday night was too soon to work out the details. It later offered a counterproposal:  lengthier exchanges along the lines of the famous meetings between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are happy to do more than the three typical presidential debates in the fall,&quot; Obama told reporters this week. &quot;It's not realistic for us to do 10. We're dealing with all the campaign events that I have to do, since we've just finished our primary election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain aides had considered putting an empty chair on the stage for Obama but thought better of it. Still, McCain tweaked Obama for failing to show up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, this town hall meeting probably would have been a little more interesting if Senator Obama had accepted my request to join,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's aides insist their proposal is not strictly an attempt to provide a safe environment for their candidate, and they reject the notion that they are seeking free air time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a good thing for democracy,&quot; McKinnon said. &quot;This is the sort of thing voters are looking for.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a quintessentially Washington moment:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There, in the Ritz-Carlton ballroom Monday, stood Vernon Jordan -- the political insider, corporate networker and financial rainmaker, tall and impeccably turned out -- presiding over his last meeting as head of the Economic Club of Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his four-year tenure, Jordan had used his incomparable connections to bring the heads of J.P. Morgan Chase, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, American Express, Pfizer and General Electric, along with the secretary of the Treasury, the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the president of the United States, to speak to 400 of the city's top business executives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, for his final act, Jordan had reached beyond the Old Economy establishment and snared the chief executive of Google, the hottest company on the planet. Jordan had met Eric Schmidt the year before at Bilderberg, the super-secret gathering that falls between Davos and Bohemian Grove on the calendars of the global elite. By the end of that three-day meeting in Istanbul, Jordan had snared his final speaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Depending on your point of view, Jordan represents everything that is right or wrong with Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the cynical and conspiratorial, Jordan epitomizes the clubby and back-scratching Washington power broker, an amoral fixer who uses his web of connections to enrich himself and his clients while corrupting the political process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to those who know him, Jordan is a good friend and generous colleague who does well only by doing good. He follows in a long line of super-lawyers -- Harry McPherson, Clark Clifford, Bob Strauss and Lloyd Cutler -- who moved as gracefully in the government as they did in the corporate boardroom, serving as counselors valued for their wisdom and discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, which is it: Are Washington power brokers good or bad for the system? Apparently, we can't decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We never could in the case of Jordan, whose friendship with Bill Clinton was the source of never-ending controversy, starting with his chairmanship of the Clinton transition effort in 1992 and ending with a special prosecutor's investigation into his job-placement activities on behalf of White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Nothing unethical was ever uncovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now it's happening again in a presidential campaign in which both candidates are competing to distance themselves from the permanent Washington establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain has already fired a number of his top campaign aides because at some point they made money as Washington lobbyists. So far, the hatchet hasn't fallen on volunteers and unpaid advisers, but given the overheated rhetoric and mindless media coverage, it's only a matter of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Democratic side, Jim Johnson, the former Fannie Mae chairman and former chief of staff to Walter Mondale, was forced to resign this week as head of the vice presidential vetting committee for Democrat Barack Obama in response to a variety of allegations about corporate missteps.  Meanwhile, Obama's new economic adviser, Jason Furman, came under fire from labor unions that complained he consorted with known free-traders such as former Treasury secretary Robert Rubin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, of course, a certain appeal to candidates who vow to change the way business is done in Washington and hold out the promise of bringing new people with fresh ideas into the process. God knows, we could use a good dose of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at the same time, there are both silly and dangerous qualities to the current purge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years, I've had plenty of critical things to say about the way Johnson ran Fannie Mae and his willingness to defend excessive pay packages. He certainly wouldn't be on my list for secretary of the Treasury or chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Obama were looking for someone discreet and thorough, with deep experience in presidential campaigns and wide contacts in the Democratic Party who has experience vetting potential running mates, it's hard to think of a better candidate than Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem about this presidential campaign is that it has been too little about the candidates and their programs and too much about drawing deep meaning from whom they hire, who has given political contributions or even where the candidates go to church. It all smacks of a new kind of political correctness in which anyone with an unpopular view, a controversial past or a connection to the political or corporate establishment has to be officially renounced and banished from the political process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a way, we've seen this before. Jimmy Carter and Clinton both came to Washington vowing to change the way things were done. Initially, they had broad support from the public and the media. But after the inevitable stumbles, the sentiment turned, and suddenly it was conventional wisdom that they were naive and arrogant and that it was a mistake not to recruit people with more Washington experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lesson from Carter and Clinton is that we need both: a mix of old hands and fresh blood, of time-tested experience and reformist zeal. It may be good politics, and good sport, to rail against the Vernon Jordans, the Jim Johnsons and others in the permanent establishment. But the dirty little secret is that it's folly to try to succeed in Washington without them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama hasn't yet accepted Sen. John McCain's invitation for 10 town hall meetings, so Thursday evening the presumed Republican presidential nominee went ahead without him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain used a nationally televised town hall from New York City to make his case that the two men have a chance to cut through partisanship in Washington by doing joint appearances to tackle the issues on voters' minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Americans are tired, they're tired of the spin rooms, they're tired of the sound bites,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr. Obama wrapped up Democrats' nomination last week, Mr. McCain issued his challenge, hoping the head-to-head match-ups would help him keep Mr. Obama from running away with the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the pitfalls of such a performance were also apparent Thursday night, with Mr. McCain's best moment coming from his friendly audience rather than himself. The final questioner was a self-identified conservative Hispanic voter who said as a Catholic, as a father and as a Hispanic American, Mr. McCain's policies were very attractive to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, Mr. McCain stumbled his way through his answer to the man, even appearing to forget or be confused by the question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issues, Mr. McCain, who voted against both of President Bush's tax cuts, accused Mr. Obama of favoring broad tax increases and say he himself would rule out ever allowing a tax increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think you should raise people's taxes in any time,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's not clear what that means for the expiring Bush tax cuts - some of which Mr. McCain has said should not be made permanent to the full extent Mr. Bush wants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign responded by pointing to a new analysis from a budget group, the Tax Policy Center, that says Mr. McCain's tax plan, while cutting most taxes, would largely benefit upper-income Americans. The analysis says Mr. Obama raises taxes on the wealthy and lowers taxes on lower-income folks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain also accused Mr. Obama of having &quot;the most extreme voting record of any senator&quot; and said the Democrat has not shown he can work with Republicans the way Mr. McCain has done with Democrats - with the Arizona Republican usually irking his own party at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to put our country first and not our party first, and too many people have that reversed,&quot; he said, pointing to his teamwork with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts on immigration and Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin on campaign-finance laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama camp retorted that Mr. McCain was worse for having sided with Mr. Bush 95 percent of the time he voted last year, and said the rankings that found Mr. Obama with the most liberal voting record in the Senate last year were skewed because Mr. Obama missed many votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the joint appearances, the Obama campaign last week released a letter indicating he was open to some sort of joint appearances, but has not followed up with Mr. McCain since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that it's not realistic to do all 10 given all the campaigning that I have to do since we just finished our primary election,&quot; Mr. Obama said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain, who has adopted some of Mrs. Clinton's campaign messages during the past two weeks, even seemed Thursday to be echoing her 2000 Senate campaign listening tour in his own defense for doing a full series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the opportunity for you to talk to me, as well as for me to talk to you,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum offered to host two of the joint town halls in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday's town hall was carried live on Fox News Channel, which broke away twice for commercials. Fox said it would give Mr. Obama the same forum if he wanted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans, smelling the success of knocking out the head of Sen. Barack Obama's vice-presidential search committee Wednesday, renewed efforts to ensnare another top adviser to the Democratic presidential candidate with the exploits of his Washington-insider past. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The criticism Thursday centered on Obama adviser Eric H. Holder Jr., who is scrutinizing candidates to be the Democratic presumptive presidential nominee's running mate. As deputy attorney general under President Clinton, Mr. Holder reviewed the last-minute pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charged with 51 counts of fraud, tax evasion and illegally trading with Iran, Mr. Rich fled to Switzerland in 1983 but won a pardon from Mr. Clinton in 2001. The decision prompted a congressional investigation because Mr. Rich's wife was a major Democratic donor and prosecutors said they were never consulted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indicted by then-U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Rich failed to return to the U.S. following the indictment and was on the FBI's Most Wanted list for several years. Mr. Holder had given a &quot;neutral, leaning towards favorable&quot; opinion of the pardon that led directly to the pardoning of Mr. Rich on Mr. Clinton's last day in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it is a matter of record that Mr. Holder recommended the pardoning of Mr. Rich,&quot; Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told reporters Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And all those things will be taken into consideration by the media and the American people, especially when you are entrusting individuals with one of the most important decisions that a presidential candidate can make before that individual is elected and that is who the running mate is,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican outcry over Mr. Holder came a day after Obama adviser Jim Johnson, who was leading the vice-presidential search team, resigned amid questions about his Wall Street dealings, including ties to subprime lender Countrywide Financial Corp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats defended Mr. Holder and raised their own questions about top officials in Mr. McCain's campaign, including former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Arthur B. Culvahouse, who is leading the search for Mr. McCain's running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's telling that John McCain, whose vice presidential search process is headed by a prominent D.C. lobbyist who served as the Reagan administration's point man on the Iran-Contra scandal, would try to recycle a tired attack on Mr. Holder,&quot; said Obama campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sevugan said Mr. McCain instead should &quot;talk about the issues on a day when a nonpartisan report shows that the Barack Obama would provide three times as much tax relief to middle-class families and John McCain would provide nearly a quarter of his tax cuts to households that make more $2.8 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign also criticized former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina, a top economic adviser in the McCain campaign, who &quot;presided over thousands of layoffs at Hewlett-Packard while receiving a $21 million severance package and $650,000 in mortgage assistance.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama, who has lambasted runaway corporate salaries on the presidential campaign trail, accepted the resignation Wednesday of a prominent adviser who has had some big Wall Street paydays of his own lately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama adviser Jim Johnson, who ran the Democrat's vice presidential search team until his surprise resignation, has earned six-figure stock and compensation deals while sitting on boards of several publicly traded companies over the past year, according to Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resignation was announced by the Obama campaign amid increasing criticism that Mr. Johnson received discounted mortgage loans from subprime lender Countrywide Financial Corp., a company Mr. Obama has railed against on the campaign trail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jim did not want to distract in any way from the very important task of gathering information about my vice presidential nominee, so he has made a decision to step aside that I accept,&quot; Mr. Obama said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a very good selection process under way, and I am confident that it will produce a number of highly qualified candidates for me to choose from in the weeks ahead. I remain grateful to Jim for his service and his efforts in this process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Democratic adviser who vetted vice presidential candidates for Sen. John Kerry's presidential run in 2004, Mr. Johnson's corporate dealings recently placed him in the cross hairs of the AFL-CIO. Last year, the union singled out Mr. Johnson and three other directors at Target Corp. over &quot;possible conflicts on interest&quot; over ties to pharmaceutical and health insurance industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to Target citing $115 million in possible retirement costs for the company, AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka wrote that he was concerned about a conflict between Mr. Johnson's directorship at Target and his role on the board at Minnesota-based UnitedHealth Group Inc., a health plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UnitedHealth came under federal scrutiny over a stock-option scandal at a time when Mr. Johnson served on the company's compensation committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E-mail and phone messages left with Mr. Johnson's lawyer were not returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AFL-CIO previously had criticized Mr. Johnson's role on the compensation committees of several public companies, according to public reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Johnson has served on the board of KB Home, a home construction company, along with longtime Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton supporter Ron Burkle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other directorships included positions on the corporate boards of United Health, which paid him $334,413; Target, $332,925; Temple Inland, $349,587; and Goldman Sachs, where he received $695,569 in total compensation in fiscal 2007, according to SEC filings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following Mr. Obama's announcement, the Republican National Committee immediately turned its sights on Eric H. Holder Jr., another member of the Obama vice-presidential search committee. A former deputy attorney general, Mr. Holder came under Republican fire for his role in the pardon of billionaire Marc Rich in the last days of the Clinton White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now a private lawyer, he lobbied in 2002 and 2003 for Large Scale Biology Corp., a Maryland biotechnology company, and telecommunications company Global Crossing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Barack Obama is concerned his campaign's ties to special interests are distracting from his VP search and message, why is Eric Holder still on his search committee?&quot; said RNC spokesman Alex Conant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Conant also raised questions about Steve Farber, a registered lobbyist and a big fundraiser for the Democratic National Convention in Denver. Mr. Obama and the Democratic National Committee have pledged not to accept donations from federal lobbyists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute earlier this month found that Mr. Farber and convention fundraisers from both parties are soliciting big contributions from corporate special interests. Those sorts of donations aren't permitted in the presidential campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why is registered federal lobbyist Steve Farber leading the convention for Obama's supposedly 'lobbyist-free' campaign? Obama's hypocritical attacks show he can't stand up to his own standard - and that he just isn't ready to make change,&quot; Mr. Conant said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor charged back Wednesday that Sen. John McCain's campaign took 15 months to rid lobbyists from its staff because of a &quot;perception problem&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also noted that Arthur B. Culvahouse, who is heading Mr. McCain's vice-presidential search, chairs the same law firm that represented disgraced former Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's too bad their campaign is still rife with lobbyist influence and doesn't see a similar perception problem with the man currently running their own vice-presidential selection process, a prominent D.C. lobbyist whose firm has represented Exxon and a top Enron executive ...&quot; he said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Culvahouse is not currently a lobbyist, but was registered to lobby in 2004 for Fannie Mae, where Mr. Johnson served as chief executive in the 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Vietor also said former Hewlett Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina, a top economic adviser in the McCain campaign, &quot;presided over thousands of layoffs at Hewlett Packard while receiving a $21 million severance package and $650,000 in mortgage assistance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Wednesday, DNC Chairman Howard Dean called criticism of Mr. Johnson &quot;nuts,&quot; calling it a &quot;Republican planted story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jim Johnson doesn't work for the campaign, he doesn't get paid, he's a volunteer,&quot; he told reporters at gathering hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain are relying on Washington insiders and former lobbyists to scrutinize possible vice presidential candidates, even as they campaign against lobbyists as a corrosive force in the nation's capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, on Tuesday derided as a &quot;game&quot; inquiries into his decision to name former Fannie Mae chief executive James A. Johnson to lead his search for a running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Johnson, a former lobbyist, is drawing scrutiny over ties to subprime-mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp., which Mr. Obama has railed against on the campaign trail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would have to hire the vetter to vet the vetters,&quot; the Illinois Democrat told reporters at a news conference in St. Louis. &quot;I mean, at some point, we just asked people to do their assignments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican nominee, has reached out to Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr., White House counsel in the Reagan administration from 1987 to 1989, to head his search.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Culvahouse is chairman of O'Melveny &amp; Myers LLP, which has a powerful Washington lobbying office. A former lobbyist, he has represented Lockheed Martin, Fannie Mae and British Steel, according to Senate and Justice Department filings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The running mate-search picks are providing fodder for both campaigns, as the candidates are being forced to defend their reliance on the same sort of Washington insiders they have crusaded against for months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds on Tuesday said Mr. Johnson's appointment by Mr. Obama reflected &quot;a growing presence of ties to the very industries that he speaks out against on the campaign trail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no greater hypocrisy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said the McCain campaign &quot;is run and paid for by Washington lobbyists,&quot; adding that Mr. Culvahouse's firm had represented disgraced Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling, the company's former CEO convicted in 2006 of multiple federal felony charges relating to Enron's financial collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite all the campaign talk against lobbyists, political experts say it's probably unrealistic for the campaigns to truly rid themselves of people with lobbying ties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They need to have some ability to run an effective campaign and to raise money, and to do that takes the kind of connections and interconnections that lobbyists have,&quot; said Robert Oldendick, a professor of political science at the University of South Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If a campaign was truly free of those kinds of connections, they probably couldn't be very effective,&quot; he said. &quot;Charges are going to fly back and forth, but in the end, I think it's going to be a wash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daron Shaw, an associate professor of government at the University of Texas and a strategist for President Bush in the 2000 and 2004 campaigns, said both candidates need to weigh the benefit of appointing a consultant against the possible political flap if that person once worked as a lobbyist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People who are going to be players in either campaign are probably going to have worked for other partisan or special interests before. That's the way politics operate,&quot; Mr. Shaw said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Department records show Mr. Johnson, chief executive of mortgage giant Fannie Mae from 1991 to 1998, also registered as an agent for Egypt in 1988 to lobby U.S. officials on the country's military-sales debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Registration papers show Mr. Johnson contracted as a part-time lobbyist for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., though records don't indicate that he received any compensation for the assignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criticism of Mr. Johnson's appointment arose after the Wall Street Journal on Saturday reported that he had received discounted mortgage loans from Countrywide. Mr. McCain later told Fox News that Mr. Johnson's appointment to lead the vice presidential search suggested &quot;a bit of a contradiction&quot; between Mr. Obama's words and actions on the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Culvahouse holds his own Fannie Mae ties, Senate lobbying records show. He lobbied for the mortgage giant as recently as 2004. He also lobbied for Lockheed Martin for the &quot;timely development&quot; of a more cost effective U.S. commercial space transportation industry in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1980s, Mr. Culvahouse also worked as an agent for British Steel, advising the company on trade issues before Congress, the White House and various federal agencies, according to Justice Department records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another member of the three-person Obama vice presidential search committee, former Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. lobbied for Large Scale Biology Corp., a Maryland biotechnology company, and telecommunications company Global Crossing in 2002 and 2003.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama defended the appointments of Mr. Holder and Mr. Johnson on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jim Johnson has a very discrete task, as does Eric Holder, and that is simply to gather up information about potential vice presidential candidates,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;They're performing that job well. It's a volunteer, unpaid position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they're giving me information, and I will then exercise judgement in terms of who I want to select as a vice presidential candidate,&quot; he said. &quot;So these aren't folks who are working for me, they're not people who I have assigned to a particular job in a future administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments drew immediate criticism from the Republican National Committee, which called Mr. Obama's comments &quot;totally inconsistent with his rhetoric, but wholly consistent with his own record.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERVENT SUPPORTERS of Barack Obama like to say that putting him in the White House would transform America. With all due respect to the candidate, that gets it backward. Obama is an impressive speaker who has run a brilliant campaign -- but if he wins in November, it will be because our country has already been transformed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's nomination wouldn't have been possible 20 years ago. It's possible today only because racial division, which has driven U.S. politics rightward for more than four decades, has lost much of its sting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the de-racialization of U.S. politics has implications that go far beyond the possibility that we're about to elect an African American president. Without racial division, the conservative message -- which has long dominated the political scene -- loses most of its effectiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take, for example, that old standby of conservatives: denouncing Big Government. Last week John McCain's economic spokesman claimed that Obama is President Bush's true fiscal heir, because he's &quot;dedicated to the recent Bush tradition of spending money on everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the truth is that the Bush administration's big-spending impulses have been largely limited to defense contractors. But more to the point, the McCain campaign is deluding itself if it thinks this issue will resonate with the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans have never disliked Big Government in general. In fact, they love Social Security and Medicare, and strongly approve of Medicaid -- which means that the three big programs that dominate domestic spending have overwhelming public support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Ronald Reagan and other politicians succeeded, for a time, in convincing voters that government spending was bad, it was by suggesting that bureaucrats were taking away workers' hard-earned money and giving it to you-know-who: the &quot;strapping young buck&quot; using food stamps to buy T-bone steaks, the welfare queen driving her Cadillac. Take away the racial element, and Americans like government spending just fine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But why has racial division become so much less important in American politics?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the credit surely goes to Bill Clinton, who ended welfare as we knew it. I'm not saying that the end of Aid to Families with Dependent Children was an unalloyed good thing; it created a great deal of hardship. But the &quot;bums on welfare&quot; played a role in political discourse vastly disproportionate to the actual expense of AFDC, and welfare reform took that issue off the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another large factor has been the decline in urban violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As historian Rick Perlstein documents in his terrific new book &quot;Nixonland,&quot; America's hard right turn really began in 1966, when the Democrats suffered a severe setback in Congress -- and Reagan was elected governor of California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause of that right turn, as Perlstein shows, was white fear of urban disorder -- and the associated fear that fair housing laws would let dangerous blacks move into white neighborhoods. &quot;Law and order&quot; became the rallying cry of right-wing politicians, above all Richard Nixon, who rode that fear right into the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But during the Clinton years, for reasons nobody fully understands, the wave of urban violence receded, and with it the ability of politicians to exploit Americans' fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true that Sept. 11 gave the fear factor a second wind: Karl Rove accusing liberals of being soft on terrorism sounded just like Spiro Agnew accusing liberals of being soft on crime. But the GOP's credibility as America's defender has leaked away into the sands of Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me add one more hypothesis: Although everyone makes fun of political correctness, I'd argue that decades of pressure on public figures and the media have helped drive both overt and strongly implied racism out of our national discourse. For example, I don't think a politician today could get away with running the infamous 1988 Willie Horton ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, the campaign against misogyny hasn't been equally successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, none of this guarantees an Obama victory in November. Racial division has lost much of its sting, but not all: You can be sure that we'll be hearing a lot more about the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and all that. Moreover, despite Hillary Clinton's gracious, eloquent concession speech, some of her supporters may yet refuse to support the Democratic nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Obama does win, it will symbolize the great change that has taken place in America. Racial polarization used to be a dominating force in our politics -- but we're now a different, and better, country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For decades, Republicans counted on Cuban-Americans to swing Florida's Hispanic vote to their side of the aisle during presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But times are changing in this battleground state, where Hispanics increasingly are registering as unaffiliated or as third-party members, a trend that coincides with Republican candidates steadily losing ground in legislative elections. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the controversial 2000 presidential election, which ultimately was decided when the Supreme Court ended a recount of Florida ballots, the ranks of registered Hispanic independents have increased about 10 percentage points, to 27 percent, and the percentage of Florida's 1.2 million Hispanics backing Republican candidates has dropped 13 points, to about 51 percent, said officials at Democracia U.S.A., a national nonpartisan Hispanic group headquartered in Miami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What this study shows us is that Hispanics are taking a much closer look at what party they're joining - if they join one at all,&quot; said Jorge Mursuli, president of Democracia USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts speculate that the repeated promises by successive U.S. presidents to effect change in Cuba, with no tangible results, has jaded some Cuban voters into abandoning their traditional Republican alliances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lots of them tell me that both the Democratic and Republican parties continue to make a lot of promises [about Cuba] and never deliver,&quot; said Andy Gomez, a senior fellow at the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both presidential candidates say that will change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presumptive nominees, Democratic Sen. Barack Obama and Republican Sen. John McCain, have promised to tackle issues traditionally important to Hispanic voters, such as immigration, education, health care and Cuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, both candidates made the rounds in South Florida, focusing heavily on Hispanic interests. Each promised to outdo the other when it comes to addressing the needs of America's Latino community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain's campaign points to the Arizona Republican's popularity among Hispanic voters in his home state and says there's no need to be worried by the trend of Cubans and other Hispanics registering as unaffiliated voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't see that as a downside whatsoever,&quot; said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's camp says his own family's immigration experience will help him win Florida's Hispanic vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The senator's father was an immigrant - that's something he has in common with Florida's Hispanics,&quot; said Obama campaign spokesman Josh Earnest, who also surmised that &quot;the overwhelming sentiment among independents and those not affiliated was their dissatisfaction with the current administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, Mr. Obama has some ground to make up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exit polls in the Democratic primaries showed Hispanic voters heavily favored his former rival, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, including by a margin of 59 percent to 30 percent in Florida's own primary. The exit polls showed Hispanics made up 12 percent of the Democratic primary electorate in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, Mr. McCain won 54 percent of the Hispanic vote on the Republican side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men have been increasing their Hispanic outreach. Mr. Obama recorded an entire campaign ad in Spanish before the Puerto Rico primary, and Mr. McCain has released several Spanish-language ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama also has adopted &quot;Si se puede&quot; - a labor union motto for farm workers - in campaign appearances in heavily Hispanic areas and has benefited from support from top Latino stars such as George Lopez.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">RICHMOND, June 8</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fairfax County Republican Vincent F. Callahan Jr., former chairman of the Virginia House Appropriations Committee and onetime ally of James S. Gilmore III, said he would announce Monday that he is supporting Democrat Mark R. Warner in the state's U.S. Senate race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Callahan said Gilmore, Warner's GOP opponent, misled legislators and the public about the state's finances and the cost of his signature effort to eliminate the car tax when he was governor from 1998 to 2002. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The figures Gilmore used were so utterly erroneous and far-fetched that they were mind-boggling,&quot; said Callahan, who helped Gilmore push his car tax proposal through the House of Delegates in the late 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Callahan's endorsement comes as Warner is working hard to get some Republicans behind his campaign against Gilmore, who secured the GOP nomination last weekend. Warner, who succeeded Gilmore as governor, said Callahan's endorsement &quot;reflects the kind of bipartisan approach we brought to Richmond and hopefully we can bring to Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dick Leggitt, Gilmore's campaign manager, disputed Callahan's suggestion that Gilmore was fiscally reckless as governor. Leggitt also dismissed Warner's efforts to win over Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bottom line with the car tax is it put $1 billion into the hands of working men and women and it took it out of the hands of a group of powerful state legislators,&quot; said Leggitt. He later added, &quot;We are comfortable [Warner] is going to get some support from 'country club Republicans,' and he is going to get a lot of support from tax collectors and tax spenders. But we are picking up support from a lot of working men and women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Callahan will join former Senate president John H. Chichester Jr., also a Republican, on a conference call with reporters Monday to announce their support for Warner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chichester already is featured in a Warner TV commercial. But Callahan's decision to back Warner is somewhat of surprise because he has long ties to the Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Callahan was the lead House sponsor of Gilmore's proposal to eliminate the car tax, also know as the personal property tax, in 1998. Gilmore ran for governor on a promise to get rid of the unpopular tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gilmore and legislative leaders agreed to phase out the tax over five years. To make sure the state could afford it, they agreed to suspend the plan if revenue growth fell below 5 percent. In 2001, Chichester and Senate Republicans said the economy had slowed enough that they could not enact the fourth phase of the tax cut. But Callahan sided with Gilmore to keep it on track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Callahan, who represented McLean from 1968 until this year, said he made a mistake because the Gilmore administration gave him bad information about state finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've never seen figures so far off the mark,&quot; said Callahan, who called Warner &quot;among the best governors&quot; he served with during his 40-year career in the legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warner accuses Gilmore of leaving the state with a $6 billion budget deficit. Warner said he slashed spending early in his term but was forced to push through a $1.4 billion tax increase in 2004. Callahan initially supported raising taxes that year but voted against the final bill because he said the tax increase was too big.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warner and legislators also froze the phasing out of the car tax in 2004. Because the phaseout was never fully implemented, Virginia residents still pay the tax annually, although just a portion of what they would have paid had Gilmore not sought to eliminate it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview Friday on WTOP radio, Gilmore defended his record by noting that the state constitution requires that the budget be balanced every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state was not broke,&quot; Gilmore said. &quot;It had over $1 billion in the bank when I left. The truth is the budget was balanced. . . . We put $1 billion in the rainy-day fund, and we gave a substantial tax cut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gilmore accuses Warner of spending too much money instead of keeping his 2001 campaign promise not to raise taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I kept my word and did what I said I was going to do,&quot; said Gilmore, who maintains his car tax cut proposal was &quot;an excellent program that really helps regular people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although their differing views on each other's record as governor is shaping up as a major issue in the Senate race, Gilmore's campaign hopes to pivot toward a discussion of such federal issues as national security, energy policy and taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gilmore also is trying to make the Senate race a referendum on the presidential contest between Sens. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.). Gilmore says Obama is too liberal for Virginia. To try to insulate himself from the outcome of the presidential race if voters turn against Obama, Warner has begun an aggressive program of outreach to Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think you will see others step forward,&quot; said Warner, who has met with dozens of Republicans in recent weeks to seek their endorsements or ask them not to help Gilmore, according to Warner's staff and Republicans who have been contacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Callahan and Chichester note they are both supporting McCain. But one Virginia McCain supporter -- retiring Sen. John W. Warner (R) -- appears to be sticking with Gilmore this year. John Warner announced Friday that he has donated $2,000 to Gilmore's campaign, although he has yet to formally endorse him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am confident we will be able to unite this party,&quot; Gilmore said Friday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As debate scholars, we applaud the June 4 letter from John McCain to Barack Obama proposing an ambitious series of town hall debates prior to the Democratic National Convention. While debates have become routine fixtures in modern presidential campaigns, there are some striking features of the McCain proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Timing alone is noteworthy - it is very early in the electoral cycle to be talking about general election debates. While novel, the town hall series idea is not unprecedented. McCain's letter cites 1963, when Sen. Barry Goldwater and President John F. Kennedy &quot;agreed to make presidential campaign history by flying together from town to town and debating each other face-to-face on the same stage.&quot; Sadly, an assassin's bullet stopped the debate series before it could get going. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is worthwhile to recover the debate spirit of 1963. As George Faras shows in his compelling book, No Debate, the current presidential debate system is broken. The problem is that the authority in charge, the Commission on Presidential Debates, is beholden to the political parties and mainstream commercial television interests. This skewed situation where the foxes (corporate and political elite) guard the deliberative henhouse has a track record of producing dueling monologue formats, vapid exchanges, and circumscribed citizen involvement. Indeed, the McCain letter decries the &quot;empty sound bites and media-filtered exchanges that dominate our elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WE COULD NOT agree more. While this form of sportified debate lends itself to sensationalized media coverage and horse-race handicapping, it does little to resupply the nation's precious reservoir of creative public debate energy. Luckily, this type of energy is a renewable resource that can be restocked by public-driven approaches to debates in this upcoming presidential election and beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If nothing else, the McCain debate letter awakens us to the possibility. Citizens need not settle for a scripted and stale form of presidential debating. Thanks to this opening, voters and venue hosts are now empowered to participate in the grand &quot;debate about debate&quot; - the discussions that shape the character of specific public debate events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is the source of the McCain campaign's new pro-debate drive? It may reflect the rising prominence of John McCain's communications adviser and debate specialist, Brett O'Donnell. As an intercollegiate debate coach at Liberty University, he evinced a strong commitment to public debate, with an admirable focus on expanding student participation rates by bringing new voices into the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Early commentary on the town hall proposal has focused on the remarkable way that the McCain letter seems to wrest authority from the Commission on Presidential Debates. It is our hope, now that the two campaigns are engaged in negotiations, that this refreshing call for experimentation and flexibility in the formats and procedures of the presidential debates does not give way to business as usual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Obama camp's preliminary response to the McCain town hall proposal seems positive in this regard. David Plouffe welcomed the debate concept and constructively suggested a citizen-friendly, &quot;less structured and lengthier&quot; format, one that &quot;more closely resembles the historic debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OTHER promising format wrinkles might include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Opportunities for candidates to question each other directly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * More sustained back-and-forth cycles of exchange on focused topics. This could prompt candidates to drill down beyond the surface of polished talking points. Debate is like peeling an onion; you often have to go through several layers of argument and refutation to reach the core of an issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Utilization of new media technologies such as YouTube to expand the pool of possible questioners. CNN screened videotaped citizen questions for its July 2007 primary debates. It would be illuminating to see a panel of local citizens and community leaders try their hand at selecting YouTube questions submitted for use in debates held in their hometowns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The devilish details of campaign debates should not be decided in back rooms stuffed with the mavens of Madison and Pennsylvania Avenues. Will particular format features give one candidate a leg up in the political horse race? Perseveration on this question obscures the more fundamental issue at stake, which is whether certain forms of debate can better inform the electorate and energize citizen deliberation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regardless of political persuasion, we should join together to see the McCain campaign's pro-debate momentum gain concrete expression in new formats, venues, and voices added into the presidential election process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a recently posted YouTube music video, to a hypnotic bongo beat, rapper MIKE-E knocks out rhymes about . . . universal health care:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You are among the masses/ One of 47 million people without health care access . . . Focus on the laws that must be enacted/ Because we know there are flaws in our health care practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These may sound like lyrics only a lobbyist could love, but the video -- sponsored by the American Cancer Society -- expresses the frustration felt by those trying to end the United States's status as the only industrialized nation whose citizens don't have universal access to health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a cold truth: Despite much media hand-wringing on the subject, most of us give about as much thought to those who lack health coverage as we do to soybean subsidies.The major obstacle to change? Those of us with insurance simply don't care very much about those without it. It's only when health care costs spike sharply, the economy totters or private employers begin to cut back on benefits that the lack of universal health care comes into focus. Noticing the steadily growing ranks of the uninsured, the broad American public -- &quot;us&quot; -- begins to worry that we'll soon be joining the ranks of &quot;them.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News stories about the uninsured typically offer poignant profiles of people with whom the public can easily identify. As an award-winning article in Redbook last year informed its readers, &quot;Increasingly, this is a problem for the middle class.&quot; Similarly, the Cover the Uninsured Web site, sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, highlights personal stories of seven appealing uninsured individuals. Several are current or former small-business owners. Six are white, and one is an African-American woman. There are no identifiable Hispanics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality, however, is that only a minority of the uninsured are either the typical Redbook reader or that nice shopkeeper down the street. Two-thirds of those without health insurance are poor or near poor, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. And there are clear disparities in how different racial and ethnic groups are affected. Only 13 percent of non-Hispanic white Americans is uninsured, compared with 36 percent of Hispanics, 33 percent of Native Americans, 22 percent of blacks and 17 percent of Asians/Pacific Islanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians understand what this means in practical terms. If a lack of health insurance were truly a white middle-class crisis, then conservatives and liberals would long ago have joined together, carved out a compromise and done something. Instead, we're served a constantly recycled set of excuses for legislative stalemate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unofficial Republican attitude toward universal health care can be boiled down to the three &quot;nots&quot;: not our voters, not our kind of solution and not our priority. None of the Republican presidential candidates even pretended to present a serious plan for universal coverage, nor did Republican primary voters demand one. The only candidate who had actually worked successfully toward universal health care -- former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney -- apologetically disowned his own groundbreaking achievement. Presumptive nominee John McCain's recent health care proposal doesn't make anything more than a start toward covering all the uninsured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Democrats play their own &quot;us vs. them&quot; games. Although high-profile party leaders are loudly calling for universal coverage -- recall the Barack Obama-Hillary Clinton slugfest over their respective plans -- they reassure the middle class that the cost of compassion will be covered by repealing tax cuts for the wealthy. This &quot;free lunch&quot; approach may tax credulity, but it does avoid the need for discussing other taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be fair to the politicians, the interest groups representing the public have exhibited little appetite for genuinely grappling with the uninsured problem. AARP, one of the most powerful consumer groups, is running a high-profile ad campaign advocating a vague health care &quot;reform.&quot; But imagine the revolt if the organization's leaders had asked its elderly membership to insist that those with no health insurance, including 9 million children, should be guaranteed basic care before Congress spent hundreds of billions of dollars adding a Medicare pharmaceutical benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the American Medical Association has been a consistent voice for covering the uninsured, it reserves its political muscle for issues that excite its members. And the blunt truth is that the percentage of physicians who actually provide care to the uninsured or to Medicaid patients has been steadily declining for a decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the American Cancer Society decided to focus its marketing budget on coverage for the uninsured, some supporters grumbled that it wasn't &quot;our fight.&quot; The society responded that cancer patients without health insurance are diagnosed later and have a far greater chance of dying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other interest groups have been more likely to follow the AARP and AMA &quot;stick to your knitting&quot; model than the ACS one. Large unions advocate health care for all, but in practice, they're most concerned about maintaining benefits for their members. As a self-employed consultant who pays more than $1,000 a month for a very modest family plan (and am grimly happy to have even this), I have gazed longingly at the $25 per month that a friend who belongs to a municipal union pays for a far more generous plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the general public talks about a health care crisis, what they're generally talking about is rising costs, a constant complaint since the Hoover administration (though Richard M. Nixon was the first president to officially declare a health care &quot;crisis&quot;). In response to this public clamor for cost control, those who advocate for the uninsured have decided to talk not only about the 22,000 of &quot;them&quot; who die annually because of a lack of access to care, but also to emphasize the money that providing coverage to &quot;them&quot; could actually save the rest of &quot;us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commonwealth Fund recently tallied the ways in which universal health care would save hundreds of millions of dollars, most of which were related to lowering the societal costs exacted by the greater burden of illness among the uninsured. The list was an exhaustive and exhausting one that nonetheless had the whiff of desperation, as if civil rights activists had appealed for support against segregation because it was reducing the pool of qualified candidates for the Selma, Ala., police department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are glimmers of hope. A growing number of insured families are struggling with higher co-payments and deductibles and skimpier coverage. These uneasy &quot;underinsured&quot; may yet join forces with the uninsured to demand protection from a situation that places them, as MIKE-E puts it, &quot;One paycheck from poverty/ One illness or injury from misery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A survey last year by the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that more than two thirds of Americans were willing to pay 1 percent more in federal income taxes to make sure that everyone had health insurance. This counts as progress, as does the bipartisan Healthy Americans Act, a significant step toward universal coverage proposed by Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.)and Bob Bennett (R-Utah).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years, our society has gradually provided a medical safety net for the elderly and disabled (Medicare), the poor (Medicaid) and veterans. At one time, these commitments were controversial, and there's no doubt that they're expensive. Yet Americans from all walks of life understand that the true value of these programs must be weighed on a moral scale as well as a financial one. It's our willingness to be our brothers' keepers that in part defines who we are as Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been nearly a century since Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican running unsuccessfully on the Bull Moose Party ticket, boldly became the first presidential candidate to promise universal health coverage. That was in 1912. Nearly a century later, we're still waiting for a leader with the courage and skill to break through our fears and successfully lead the charge up that particular hill.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Barack Obama will head into the general election with the ability to raise significantly more money than his Republican opponent, an extremely rare position for a Democrat and one that could give him a huge advantage in mobilizing supporters, reaching voters and competing across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party leaders say they expect Obama to surpass the more than quarter-billion dollars he amassed during the primaries, buoyed by a fundraising list with more than 1.5 million names, an uncommon knack for attracting money online and the expected addition of scores of established bundlers who helped bankroll Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's advantage, which could stretch into the tens of millions over Republican Sen. John McCain, would allow the senator from Illinois to build a far more robust field operation and let him drench radio and television airwaves in a much broader array of states, including those where Democrats do not traditionally compete. He would also have enough money to enjoy the luxury of making mistakes, whereas any poor choices McCain makes would be felt much more acutely. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From my vantage point, the enthusiasm is there, and for the first time we're seeing the [Internet] fundraising and the traditional fundraising both pulling the rope the same way,&quot; said Mitchell Berger, a Florida lawyer who helped oversee fundraising for President Bill Clinton in 1996 and for Vice President Al Gore in 2000, and who is raising money for Obama. &quot;More than any time in my memory, Democrats are ready to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While not all of McCain's aides and supporters agree that Obama will substantially outraise him this fall, they said the senator from Arizona is uniquely positioned to wage a lean, underdog effort, much as he did in the Republican primaries. They said his knack for parlaying late-night television appearances and free-wheeling bus tours into free media attention have proved that money is not the only way to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator McCain has demonstrated he can run a competitive campaign without spending as much as his opponents,&quot; said senior adviser Charles R. Black Jr. &quot;He just finished demonstrating it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also appears confident that his fundraising will continue to accelerate. Yesterday, campaign manager Rick Davis announced that McCain will air ads in 10 swing states, including costly markets such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, from now until November. Davis called it &quot;the single most significant ad buy since this election cycle began two years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign officials told reporters yesterday that their fundraising will be bolstered by the Republican National Committee, which had more than $53 million in the bank at the start of the month; in comparison, the Democratic National Committee had less than $5 million on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have enjoyed a fundraising advantage in the modern era of presidential politics, and only Democrats backed by the power of incumbency, such as President Bill Clinton in 1996, have been in a position to compete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2000, for instance, George W. Bush raised $95.5 million during the primaries, almost double Gore's $48 million. And during the general election, when both candidates accepted an equal share of federal funds, the RNC outraised its Democratic counterpart by almost $120 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. The pattern continued in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, that pattern has flipped. Obama has raised $265 million over 15 months, and he had $46 million on hand at the end of April. McCain finished the same period having raised $96 million. He raised another $21.5 million in May and finished the month with $31.5 million in the bank. Obama has not released May figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While McCain appears poised to accept $85 million in federal money for the general election -- funding that will kick in after he formally accepts the nomination in September -- Obama has not indicated whether he will honor an earlier pledge to do the same. His top fundraisers say they expect him to forgo the funds in favor of raising money with no upper limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their confidence in Obama's ability to far exceed the federal amount stems in part from discussions with top Clinton fundraisers, who helped bring in $214 million for her bid. &quot;I was talking to them all day yesterday and today,&quot; Berger said. &quot;They're not difficult conversations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several veteran campaign strategists from both parties said Obama's potential financial edge could emerge as a significant barrier for McCain, particularly as the two candidates start to organize efforts in key battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain will have to consider the expensive advertising costs in places such as New Jersey and California when deciding whether to try to compete there, said Evan Tracey of the Campaign Media Analysis Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I'm McCain, I've got to be a little intimidated by the kind of money Obama can raise,&quot; Tracey said. &quot;I mean, McCain basically has got to outmaneuver Obama. He's got to guess right on issues, timing and markets pretty much every time between now and November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Stratton, a Colorado-based Democratic political consultant, said money could prove more important in 2008, because both Obama and McCain intend to make strong appeals to independent voters and in more states than in previous elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think they'll both find they have lots of states that are not locked in, states where both camps have the ability to play, and they'll have to decide how to spread out their resources,&quot; Stratton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott Reed, a Washington political strategist who managed Sen. Robert J. Dole's presidential campaign in 1996 and is close to McCain, said the candidate is no doubt aware of the financial impediments he faces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will not be a traditional button-down campaign; McCain cannot afford that,&quot; Reed said. &quot;I think you can expect to see the old playbook thrown out the window.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reed suggested that an early example of this is McCain's offer to hold a lengthy series of town-hall-style discussions with Obama. &quot;Bringing the circus to town brings you a week of free media,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also predicted that McCain would name his vice presidential pick early, in part to generate media attention during a normally quiet period during the summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the RNC has begun preparing for the enhanced role it will play if McCain takes public funding after the party's convention. RNC officials said they have been investing heavily in the voter files and commercial data that allow them to narrowly target their appeals to various groups of voters. The party has also moved quickly to establish a Victory Fund program that enables it to raise money in tandem with the candidate and with state committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats have launched a similar program, though the DNC's fundraising efforts have lagged. Officials there say that has been largely a result of the protracted primary. This week, the party also invoked rules matching Obama's self-imposed restrictions on not taking money from federal lobbyists and political action committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RNC Chairman Mike Duncan said that while McCain probably will not have as much money as Obama, he will have enough to be competitive. &quot;A year ago, people were writing him off,&quot; Duncan said. &quot;He proved that the person with the most amount of money doesn't always win.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By all accounts, America turned a big, sloppy, sweat-moistened, blood-filled and tear-stained page on June 3. The ancestors - founders, slaves, fallen soldiers and soldiers of that heavy cross we bore for 400 hundred years - offer us all quiet, mystical smiles that glisten in the next morning dew. History marks a new day - although any celebration is muted by uncertainty and jaw-dropping disbelief. We have reached the apex of historic &quot;firsts,&quot; the once exclusive measure of black progress gauged by a series of extraordinary acts: one of the two major political parties nominates an African American man as its candidate for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's nothing more than a major political moment etching its way into history books and news archives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The platitudes and feel-good reflection might seem appropriate, at first. But let's keep it real. The star-struck piety and &quot;black first&quot; euphoria that always creeps into the conversation, ultimately diminishes the real value of the achievement. Sen. Barack Obama clinched this through pure calculation, political mastery and flawless organizational skill mixed with fund-raising octane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Listen, learn and take notes. Dispense with the civil rights nostalgia, give momentary thanks to the almighty and move on into the realm of political power and maturity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multiple stories now emerge. The race is on between the Illinois Democrat and the Arizona Republican. The symbolism, contrasts and dichotomies in this race are tectonic and unprecedented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race is between a Hanoi prison of war hero vs. a tellurian biracial love child of '60s Shrangri-la. One is an heir of a military family set; the other a humble global nomad who finds his destiny somewhere between scraped nickels in New York and community organizing in Chicago. One is a white-haired, aged white man who seems strikingly familiar and same in our perceptions of Free World leader and American politics; the other defies convention with his blackness propped against a language of racial commonality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, here it is, folks: black man vs. white man. Classic. A brother of many lands takes on ? &quot;The Man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the language on race will be very different, very crisp and, at times, nuanced by slick campaign commercials and 527 trickery. &quot;Fairy tale?&quot; Former President Clinton almost got it right - no: simply titanic literary plot-line come-to-life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, when the historic page groans and turns, we find ourselves doing away with many of the traditional norms in politics. It will be tempting to perceive this race through the debilitating prism of race - to blame every misstep, insult and gaffe on ugly cultural habits and racial iniquities. And, unfortunately, there are those in the elections business who will sharpen their knives and have at it, carving away at every blistering scab within the social fabric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is why discipline from both candidates will be key. Sen. John McCain must resist overtures from narrow-minded political hacks who want to pull a play-on-stereotype special. Mr. Obama must continue his attempt to stay above it all, and he must defy the pettiness of business as usual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the general election, self-definition will be the most critical game plan in Mr. Obama's campaign arsenal. To win, he cannot latch onto the racial significance or Afrocentricity of this moment. He cannot be the amazingly &quot;articulate&quot; or exceptionally African American with Ivy League credentials. He must be the senator from Illinois and the qualified Democratic nominee. He cannot market himself as prodigious and rare. In other words, his strategy must be based on vision and plan - from &quot;Yes We Can&quot; to &quot;Here's How We Do It.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, Mr. McCain will stubbornly persist with his thick line in the Iraqi sand, his position firm on U.S. troop presence in the Middle East. There is a tremendous challenge before him, managing his embrace of an unpopular war while condemning pork-barrel Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this new landscape, Mr. McCain must find a way to push his political experience and represent change or a departure from the Washington establishment. That has been his strong suit for more than three decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes Mr. McCain different? We've watched him two-step a strange dance these past several months - a quixotic portrayal of himself as the &quot;maverick&quot; candidate we've grown to appreciate while clearly molding himself as the leader of a party unaccustomed to such.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, this race appears destined for a unique generational struggle between bitter old and energetic new. Should the graying man of Beltway yesteryear win, it is because he found a way to look new and fresh against the sharp 46-year-old only four years in the U.S. Senate and several historic steps away from once-unimaginable American history. There is a hunger for freshness this election cycle, and each nominee must avoid looking backward. This is the campaign about looking forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither man or running mate can talk about yesterday. All must focus on tomorrow.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Christina Bellantoni, THE WASHINGTON TIMES</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAGE ONE; A01</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1214 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm in, and I'm in to win,&quot; Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton declared on Jan. 20, 2007, when announcing she was embarking on a bid to become first female president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she didn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats examining Mrs. Clinton's surprising loss to Sen. Barack Obama cite underestimating her rival, a flawed fundraising strategy, or her failure to offer enough of what voters say they wanted: Change. Others say the aura of inevitability that built her up is what brought her down as some voters saw her as acting entitled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her aides early on focused on the wrong candidate - former Sen. John Edwards - thinking that Mr. Obama was a fad whose support was &quot;a mile wide and an inch deep,&quot; and would soon flame out. Instead, she was out-organized by the political newcomer whose massive rallies and strong support with young voters have Republicans scared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had the former first lady and senator from New York imitated Sen. John McCain and skipped the Iowa caucuses - as one top staffer recommended early on - Mr. Obama's win there may not have carried so much weight. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, she fought hard in Iowa and burned through cash on a helicopter tour, on ads that pushed a message that wasn't working, and on shovels for snowy driveways on caucus night to help her older supporters get to the caucus. The efforts and spending didn't help, and her third-place showing did what Obama allies had hoped: cast doubt on the inevitability surrounding her candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caught off guard by his fundraising, she didn't adjust quickly enough to focus on small donations that built the Obama fundraising juggernaut. He considered purchases of $1 bumper stickers as donations, a strategy that helped him build his war chest early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once she caught up and deployed similar tactics, the money flowed from dedicated supporters, but it was too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama has not had time to celebrate his own historic bid to become the first black president before Mrs. Clinton dominated coverage with the issue of whether and how she will concede. She is to make her official endorsement of the senator from Illinois on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The night he clinched the delegate number for the party nod and Mrs. Clinton did not congratulate him on crossing the threshold needed for ultimate victory, Mr. Obama cautioned friends that he didn't want champagne to flow aboard his plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He quoted NBA great Magic Johnson, a Clinton supporter, by saying it made no sense to cut the nets before the finals in an allusion to the competitive and accelerated general election Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some of his top supporters privately grumbled that he didn't get time to savor the incredible victory he had just achieved - the defeat of a titan with political machinery that few thought could match hers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early Obama donor and Black Entertainment Television founder Sheila Johnson was beaming Wednesday after a Democratic fundraiser in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether she thought he would reach this point when first giving to his campaign, she said, &quot;I really believed that he could be, and that's the only way you can go forward. You take the risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Clinton adviser Mike Henry, who left the campaign in February, argued in a May 2007 memo that competing in Iowa was risky for the former first lady. The advice, which the candidate rejected, correctly predicted a split decision among Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under that scenario, &quot;We now enter into the February 5th mega states with no money, little time to raise it, and have to rely on earned media to get our message out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skipping Iowa, he said, &quot;is a bold move, one that increases our momentum and improves our positioning. This is a better, smarter, and more efficient way to win the nomination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats who have closely followed the campaign said they found Mrs. Clinton's early ads with an &quot;experience&quot; message - and especially her &quot;3 a.m.&quot; ad portraying Mr. Obama as weak on national security - were tired and didn't recognize a changing political dynamic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, by contrast, reached out to voters more extensively with text messaging and through Web videos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late March, Mrs. Clinton pivoted and began a broader push using technology to showcase her true personality. Her to-the-camera video testimonials and use of daughter Chelsea to speak with passion about her mother greatly boosted her in the eyes of her most fervent supporters: women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April, she ditched chief strategist Mark Penn, the man many blame for her early campaign implosions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early on, he took a large role in shaping her image as tough, one she later reversed to portray herself as a woman of the people and sensitive maternal figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleven months ago, Mr. Penn distributed a memo later dubbed the &quot;inevitable&quot; memo, noting: &quot;Hillary's electoral strength has grown in the last quarter and she is better positioned today than ever before to become the next president of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited polls showing her with nearly 20-point leads over &quot;her nearest competitors,&quot; and in the long memo mentioned Mr. Obama's name only to cite those polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Voters yearn for change and they say that Hillary has the strength and experience to actually bring about that change. Hillary's message: that her strength and experience will bring real change that America needs, is resonating strongly with voters,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her legacy remains to be determined, and those who want to forgive her for sharply attacking Mr. Obama will be closely watching how she treats Mr. Obama and if she fulfills her promise to work her &quot;heart out&quot; on behalf of his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many think an Obama-Clinton ticket in the fall would be unbeatable, but few political strategists think it will be formed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As people examine the race, most praise her for the last months of the race especially, hitting multiple states and campaigning tirelessly. When she did not dominate on Super Tuesday as initially expected because of her wide name recognition and one-time double-digit national leads, her campaign was forced to scramble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They made choices that allowed Mr. Obama to start a February winning streak but ultimately strengthened her argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of deploying resources for the February contests - including several caucuses where Mr. Obama had been more organized - Mrs. Clinton sent her staffers into Texas and Ohio, and began talking up the importance of those large states and Pennsylvania's election April 22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She won all three - though Mr. Obama got more delegates because of Texas's complex multistep caucus rules - and then dominated contests in West Virginia and Kentucky and even pulled off a surprise upset in South Dakota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign underestimated her strength in the states in the Appalachian region, with campaign manager David Plouffe telling reporters around March 4, &quot;We see not a single contest on the calendar left where she could win by big margins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, she won West Virginia by 41 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama's team had long been laser-focused on earning delegates by attracting huge voter turnout and their strategy allowed him to build a lead and convince the party leaders he could duplicate that success in the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 2007, when Mrs. Clinton announced the presidential ambitions the world had long suspected, she promised a &quot;conversation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let the conversation begin. I have a feeling it's going to be very interesting,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RISING IN THE Senate on May 13, Chuck Schumer explained: &quot;I rise to discuss rising energy prices.&quot; The president was heading to Saudi Arabia to seek an increase in its oil production, and Schumer's gorge was rising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saudi Arabia, the New York Democrat said, &quot;holds the key to reducing gasoline prices at home in the short term.&quot; Therefore arms sales to that kingdom should be blocked unless it &quot;increases its oil production by one million barrels per day,&quot; which would cause the price of gasoline to fall &quot;50 cents a gallon almost immediately.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can a senator, with so many things on his mind, know so precisely how the price of gasoline would respond to that increase in the oil supply?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schumer does know that if you increase the supply of something, the price of it probably will fall. That is why he and 96 other senators recently voted to increase the supply of oil on the market by stopping the flow of oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects against major physical interruptions. Seventy-one of the 97 senators who voted to stop filling the reserve also oppose drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One million barrels is what might today be flowing from ANWR if in 1995 President Clinton had not vetoed legislation to permit drilling there. One million barrels produce 27 million gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel. Seventy-two of today's senators -- including Schumer and 38 other Democrats, including Barack Obama; and 33 Republicans, including John McCain -- have voted to keep ANWR's estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil off the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Schumer, according to Schumer, is complicit in taking $10 away from every American who buys 20 gallons of gasoline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democracy,&quot; said H.L. Mencken, &quot;is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.&quot; The common people of New York want Schumer to be their senator, so they should pipe down about gas prices, which are a predictable consequence of their political choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also disqualified from complaining are all voters who sent to Washington senators and representatives who have voted to keep ANWR's oil in the ground, and who voted to put 85 percent of America's offshore territory off-limits to drilling. The U.S. Minerals Management Service says that restricted area contains perhaps 86 billion barrels of oil and 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas -- 10 times the oil and 20 times the natural gas Americans use in a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drilling is under way 60 miles off Florida. The drilling is being done by China, in cooperation with Cuba, which is drilling closer to South Florida than U.S. companies are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANWR is larger than the combined areas of five states (Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Delaware) and drilling along its coastal plain would be confined to a space one-sixth the size of Washington's Dulles Airport. Offshore? Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed or damaged hundreds of drilling rigs without causing a large spill. There has not been a significant spill from an offshore U.S. well since 1969. Of the more than 7 billion barrels of oil pumped offshore in the past 25 years, 0.001 percent has been spilled. Louisiana has more than 3,200 rigs offshore -- and a thriving commercial fishing industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his &quot;Gusher of Lies: The Dangerous Delusions of 'Energy Independence,'\&quot; Robert Bryce says Brazil's energy success has little to do with its much-discussed ethanol production and much to do with its increased oil production, the vast majority of which comes from off Brazil's shore. Investor's Business Daily reports that Brazil, &quot;which recently made a major oil discovery almost in sight of Rio's beaches,&quot; has leased most of the world's deep-sea drilling rigs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 2006, two U.S. companies announced that their &quot;Jack No. 2&quot; well, in the gulf 270 miles southwest of New Orleans, had tapped a field with perhaps 15 billion barrels of oil, which would increase America's proven reserves by 50 percent. Just probing four miles below the Gulf's floor costs $100 million. Congress' response to such expenditures is to propose increasing the oil companies' tax burdens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America says to foreign producers: We prefer not to pump our oil, so please pump more of yours, thereby lowering its value, for our benefit. Let it not be said that America has no energy policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Sen. John McCain wasted no time Tuesday night in launching his first general-election broadside against Sen. Barack Obama, casting the Democrat as an out-of-touch liberal who offers a false promise of change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a prime-time speech designed to upstage Obama  on the night he claimed the Democratic nomination, McCain began what top aides and other Republicans promise will be an aggressive effort to claim the mantles of reform, experience and mainstream values. Obama, he said, is an &quot;impressive man&quot; but one with a thin record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For all his fine words and all his promise, he has never taken the hard but right course of risking his own interests for yours,  of standing against the partisan rancor on his side to stand up for our country,&quot; McCain said less than two hours before Obama spoke in the same arena in St. Paul, Minn., where McCain will claim the Republican nomination in September. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain began his speech by praising Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who in the Democratic primary race won over many rural and working-class voters that McCain hopes to capture in November. &quot;As the father of three daughters, I owe her a debt for inspiring millions of women to believe there is no opportunity in this great country beyond their reach,&quot; McCain said. &quot;I am proud to call her my friend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two McCain aides said his speech was the beginning of a &quot;great debate&quot; on the direction of the country. It will be followed quickly by a television ad campaign aimed at reinforcing McCain's core message: that Obama's sweeping rhetoric offers little real promise of changing the political culture in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confronting what his aides expect to be Obama's principal attack against him, McCain explicitly rejected the idea that he represents President Bush's third term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why does Senator Obama believe it's so important to repeat that idea over and over again?&quot; he asked. &quot;Because he knows it's very difficult to get Americans to believe something they know is false.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As evidence of his independence, McCain highlighted his breaks with Bush on Iraq, energy and climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech, Obama honored McCain's service but derided the Republican's claim to stand for change, linking him to what he called the &quot;failed&quot; foreign and economic policies of Bush. &quot;So I'll say this -- there are many words to describe John McCain's attempt to pass off his embrace of George Bush's policies as bipartisan and new,&quot; Obama said. &quot;But change is not one of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speeches were more direct and personal than they have been in the past. McCain said  half a dozen times that Obama's &quot;old&quot; ways &quot;are not change we can believe in&quot; -- a play on Obama's slogan -- as he stood in front of a sign that said &quot;Leadership we can believe in.&quot; Obama mocked McCain's support for Republican policies, saying his Democratic vision is &quot;the change we need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Iraq, McCain said Obama would &quot;draw us into a wider war with even greater sacrifices.&quot; Obama accused McCain of supporting &quot;a policy where all we look for are reasons to stay in Iraq, while we spend billions of dollars a month on a war that isn't making the American people any safer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain decried &quot;wasteful spending by both parties&quot; and said, &quot;Senator Obama has supported it and proposed more of his own.&quot; Obama invited McCain to travel more to economically hard-hit communities, so &quot;he'd understand the kind of change that people are looking for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A McCain-Obama matchup means voters will have a stark choice between two men who both assert that they will be the agents of upheaval in Washington. One is a military hero who Americans have known for decades. The other is a Chicago community organizer introduced to the public at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain crossed the nominating finish line long before Obama, but he has struggled to take advantage of the extra time. McCain has spent the past two months unveiling campaign themes and taking swipes at Obama, but he has also been dogged by questions about his age and health, his wife's tax returns and his connection to controversial pastors and lobbyists. And some Republicans have expressed concern about how slowly McCain has moved to match Obama's organizational prowess across the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After watching Clinton beat up on Obama, top McCain advisers say that the Republican nominee faces the likelihood of a revitalized rival who will quickly seek to unify his party and to tap into the obvious energy among Democratic activists and donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain advisers concede that the battle for the White House will play out in a political environment that is terrible for Republicans: Gas and food prices are high, economic anxiety runs deep, Bush is pushing an unpopular war, and 80 percent of Americans think the country is on the wrong track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those advisers say the long Democratic battle has exposed serious weaknesses for Obama, especially among blue-collar voters, and provided a road map for questioning the nominee's lack of experience and judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the help of the Republican National Committee, McCain's campaign aims to portray Obama as weak and naive on foreign policy, with questionable judgment on big issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will call him a liberal who is out of the mainstream. They will question his record on bipartisanship and cast him as an elitist who cannot identify with middle Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spoke in Kenner, a suburb of New Orleans hit hard by Hurricane Katrina and a place that McCain's campaign said exemplifies the government dysfunction that he vows to fix. A couple of hundred people crammed into a small room at a local convention center, while nearly another thousand lined up outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A brass band played, and local high school cheerleaders cried:  &quot;Get those votes! Let's go, McCain! Get those votes, let's go!&quot;</SPAN></P>
