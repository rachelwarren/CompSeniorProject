</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what strikes me this election eve: I can't remember a presidential campaign that was so disconnected from the actual challenges of governing that will confront the winner the morning after. When this election campaign began two years ago, the big issue was how and for how long we continue nation-building in Iraq. As the campaign comes to a close, the big issue is how and at what sacrifice we do nation-building in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, you'd barely know that from the presidential debates. Watching them in the context of the meltdown of the financial system was like watching a game show where the two contestants were kept offstage in a soundproof booth and brought out to address the audience without knowing the context. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the last debate, John McCain and Barack Obama have unveiled broad ideas about how to restore the nation's financial health. But they continue to suggest that this will be largely pain-free. McCain says giving everyone a tax cut will save the day; Obama tells us only the rich will have to pay to help us out of this hole. Neither is true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are all going to have to pay, because this meltdown comes in the context of what has been  &quot;perhaps the greatest wealth transfer since the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in 1917,&quot; says Michael Mandelbaum, author of  &quot;Democracy's Good Name.&quot;  &quot;It is not a wealth transfer from rich to poor that the Bush administration will be remembered for. It is a wealth transfer from the future to the present.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never has one generation spent so much of its children's wealth in such a short period of time with so little to show for it as in the Bush years. Under George W. Bush, America has foisted onto future generations a huge financial burden to finance our current tax cuts, wars and now bailouts. Just paying off those debts will require significant sacrifices. But when you add the destruction of wealth that has taken place in the last two months in the markets, and the need for more bailouts, you understand why this is not going to be a painless recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush team leaves us with another debt - one to Mother Nature. We have added tons more CO2 into the atmosphere these last eight years, without any mitigation effort. As a result, slowing down climate change in the next eight years is going to require even bigger changes and investments in how we use energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that New York Times columnists are not allowed to  &quot;formally&quot; endorse candidates and given that the context of this election has changed so much from the policy positions the candidates started with, all I can suggest is that you vote for the candidate with these character traits:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, we need a president who can speak English and deconstruct and navigate complex issues so Americans can make informed choices. We have paid an enormous price for having a president who could not explain and reassure us during this financial meltdown. We wasted a huge amount of time pretending that we could punish Wall Street without punishing Main Street - when, in fact, they are intricately intertwined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major money market fund - Reserve Primary - failed in September because the extra interest it offered customers derived, in part, from the $785 million in high-yielding Lehman Brothers commercial paper and notes it was holding. Depositors who told their congressmen to just let that greedy Lehman Brothers fail were shocked to discover this meant that their own money market would be frozen. No, we don't need a president defending greed on Wall Street, but we do need one who can explain that we are all in the same boat, that a leak at one end can sink everyone and that while we must regulate, we don't want to kill risk-taking and the rewards that go with that - which are essential to growing our economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, we need a president who can energize, inspire and hold the country together during what will be a very stressful recovery. We have to climb out of this financial crisis at a time when the baby boomers are about to retire and going to need their Social Security and eventually Medicare. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are all going to be paying the government more and getting less until we grow out of this hole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, we need a president who can rally the world to our side. We cannot get out of this crisis unless China starts consuming more and unless Europe keeps lowering interest rates. Everyone is interconnected, and everyone is still looking to America to lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, bottom line: Please do not vote for the candidate you most want to have a beer with (unless it's to get stone-cold drunk so you don't have to think about this mess we're in). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vote for the person you'd most like at your side when you ask your bank manager for an extension on your mortgage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vote for the candidate you think has the smarts, temperament and inspirational capacity to unify the country and steer our ship through what could be the rockiest shoals our generation has ever known. Your kids will thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday is Election Day. You might not have known that. Maybe I'm the only one in the universe who has been driven around the bend by the barrage of commercials, debates, yard signs, phone calls, mailings, speeches and photo ops. I may be the only one who almost doesn't care if Daffy Duck is our next president, so long as all of this is over!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, I wanted to remind the rest of you that you're supposed to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also want to help ensure that North Carolina will not be the one state that screws up the voting. Florida will never live that down, and I don't want the same reputation as some of the voters down there who apparently have the IQ of a Rice Krispie treat. We are much more on the ball here in the Old North State, right? OK, then:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, does everyone know where he or she is supposed to vote? You might want to find that out. It's probably at a church or a school, which is handy either way. Church gives you the opportunity to say a quick prayer that you drive off a cliff before having to watch another debate. And, if you're Catholic, you could couple your vote with a visit to confession, especially since you probably haven't been since eighth grade, when the priest told you it was a sin to hide &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; under your mattress after your mother had forbidden it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're supposed to vote at the school your children attend, try to hit it when the kids are safely in class, because if they happen to walk by on their way to social studies, you will most likely hear, &quot;Hey, there's my dad! He's voting for McCain! Hey, dad, did you vote for McCain yet?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, &quot;Yo, mom, how's Obama doing? My mom said she might vote for Obama twice, right, mom?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other than that, it's nice to be in your children's school when it isn't for a parent-teacher &quot;conference.&quot; When they call you for a parent-teacher &quot;conference,&quot; who are they kidding? Do they think we're stupid? We all know it's really going to be a &quot;You'd better get in here pronto, your kid has killed the class hamster!&quot; kind of talk, don't we?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Election Day, you can just wander around after you vote, peek into classrooms, get the latest &quot;Understanding Your Adolescent&quot; brochures in the office, listen outside math class to see if the teacher really is a follower of Satan, as your child has testified. Perhaps you can secretly slip a new hamster into the cage while the kids are at lunch? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After you've secured your instructions on where to vote, please try to arrive more than 30 seconds before the polls close. This will enable you to avoid being spat upon by polling place volunteers, who have been there since 6 a.m, answering questions like, &quot;Now, who's running for governor again?&quot; and &quot;Why isn't Jesse Helms on this sheet, you commie?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, try to come to your polling place without assorted children clinging to your skirts. Teaching children about the voting process is a wonderful thing, but let's be honest: They can't learn much while they're still nursing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you must bring children with you, and if your upbringing will not allow you to lock them in the car with a video and a box of Nilla Wafers (not that I ever did that) then, please keep track of them while you're voting. Do not allow them to whip open the curtains of adjoining voting booths and yell, &quot;Boo!&quot; or &quot;Mama, she didn't push the same button you did!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My respect for &quot;seasoned&quot; citizens is huge. I learned more at my grandmother's knee -- or, actually, while helping her stir the sauce -- than I ever learned in school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But please, if you have any mercy in you at all, don't regale everyone in line with tales of how &quot;there hasn't been a decent campaign since Wendell Wilkie ran!&quot; Or how your &quot;granddaddy would turn over and shoot someone if he saw the Grand Old Party now!&quot; Or, &quot;why in hell aren't those kids locked in the car with a video and some cookies!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Believe me, we all feel your pain, and I promise to do my share of regaling for children and grandchildren, but for now can we just concentrate on pushing that lever down correctly? Or coloring in the right circle? Or punching out a chad? (Interestingly, my brother got punished for punching out a Chad back at St. Catherine's Elementary school. But, I digress.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That about does it. Everybody ready? Say it with me now: Dear Lord, no matter what happens tomorrow, please give me the strength to keep my foot out of the television set. Amen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama and John McCain uncorked massive get-out-the-vote operations in more than a dozen battleground states Sunday, millions of telephone calls, mailings and door-knockings in a frenzied, fitting climax to a record-shattering $1 billion campaign. Together, they'll spend about $8 per presidential vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With just two days to go, most national polls show Obama ahead of McCain. State surveys suggest the Democrat's path to the requisite 270 electoral votes - and perhaps far beyond - is much easier to navigate than McCain's. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama exuded confidence.  &quot;The last couple of days, I've been just feeling good,&quot; he told 80,000 gathered to hear him - and singer Bruce Springsteen - in Cleveland.  &quot;The crowds seem to grow and everybody's got a smile on their face. You start thinking that maybe we might be able to win an election on November 4th.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Peterborough, N.H., McCain held his final town hall-style event in the state that put him on the national map in 2000 and launched his GOP primary comeback eight years later.  &quot;I come to the people of New Hampshire to ask them to let me go on one more mission,&quot; said McCain, who is looking for an upset victory against Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show the six closest states are Florida, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Nevada and Ohio. All were won by Bush and made competitive by Obama's record-shattering fundraising. The campaigns also are running aggressive ground games elsewhere, including Iowa, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Colorado and Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All that's left now for the candidates is make sure people vote Tuesday - if they haven't already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Election Day is becoming a misnomer. About 27 million absentee and early votes were cast in 30 states as of Saturday night, more than ever. Democrats outnumbered Republicans in pre-Election Day voting in key states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That has Democrats - and even some Republicans - privately questioning whether McCain can overtake Obama, even if GOP loyalists turn out in droves on Tuesday. Obama may already have too big of a head start in critical states like Nevada and Iowa, which Bush won four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the campaign closes, voters were being inundated with a crush of television ads and automated phone calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new TV ad, Obama highlighted Vice President Dick Cheney's support for McCain. The ad features Cheney, an extremely unpopular figure among the general public, at an event Saturday in Wyoming, saying:  &quot;I'm delighted to support John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not to be outdone, the Republican National Committee rolled out battleground phone calls that include Hillary Rodham Clinton's criticism of Obama during the Democratic primary. She is heard saying:  &quot;In the White House, there is no time for speeches and on-the-job training. Sen. McCain will bring a lifetime of experience to the campaign, and Sen. Obama will bring a speech that he gave in 2002.&quot; A Clinton spokeswoman said she disapproves of the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another phone call to Pennsylvania and Ohio voters takes Obama's words about coal-burning technology out of context and claims he will  &quot;bankrupt the coal industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pennsylvania GOP also unveiled a TV ad featuring Obama's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, declaring  &quot;God damn America!&quot; in a sermon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and McCain campaigned on each other's turf Sunday. Obama was in Ohio, a bellwether state Bush won four years ago and where polls show Obama tied or winning. McCain visited Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, states won by Democrat John Kerry in 2004. He trails in both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and the RNC dramatically ramped up their spending in the campaign's final days and now are matching Obama&nbsp;ad for ad, if not exceeding him, in key battleground markets in states such as Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia and Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After months of planning, the Republican Party launched the last stage of its vaunted  &quot;72-hour program,&quot; when volunteers descend on competitive states for the final stretch. Democrats unleashed their  &quot;persuasion army&quot; of backers scouring their own backyards to encourage people to back Obama in the campaign's waning hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign reported that Saturday was its largest volunteer day, with more volunteers showing up to work the phones and walk neighborhood precincts than ever before in the campaign. Said Obama spokesman Bill Burton,  &quot;Our volunteers are completely engaged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's crew says theirs are, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There's no doubt that we've got an uphill battle,&quot; said Rich Beeson, the RNC's political director. But,  &quot;We still have a lot of voters that we can and will turn out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RNC reported making 5.4 million voter contacts last week, compared with 1.9 million in the same week in 2004, and it says its volume has steadily increased since October began. Overall, it says 26 million voters have been contacted by volunteers over four months. On Saturday alone, the RNC said, an estimated 3 million voters were contacted by phone or in person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain planned visits to media markets that hit battlegrounds Florida, Virginia, Indiana, New Mexico, and Nevada on Monday. A repeat trip to Pennsylvania also was slated before McCain returns home to Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama planned visits to Florida, North Carolina and Virginia on Monday and a quick stop in Indiana Tuesday morning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told reporters he would hold a news conference on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - The following 16 states are expected to be the most hotly contested in the nation on Tuesday. Here's a closer look at each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colorado (9 electoral votes)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rocky Mountains have become the newest presidential battleground, with Colorado looming as the biggest prize in the region this fall. Colorado hasn't voted for a Democrat for president since 1992, but it increasingly looks like Barack Obama country. The state clearly tilts in his direction going into the election's final weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats targeted the state early and held their convention in Denver to signal their determination to continue a political conversion in the state. And Obama has tried to overwhelm John McCain with money and manpower. The senator from Illinois has more than 50 offices around the state to mobilize his voters, compared with McCain's dozen. McCain drew several thousand enthusiastic supporters when he was in Denver a week ago; two days later, Obama drew 100,000. An Obama victory here would close off a critically important avenue that the senator from Arizona needs to reach 270 electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida (27) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state at the center of the 2000 presidential election is back again as one of a handful of true tossups in the fight between McCain and Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spent millions of dollars on commercials in the late summer and early fall before McCain responded with ads of his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While polling initially showed Obama's ads having little effect, as the fall has worn on the race for the Sunshine State has tightened considerably, with most surveys showing the two candidates in a statistical dead heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crucial area in the state is the Interstate 4 corridor, which crisscrosses Florida from Flagler County on the east coast to Sarasota County on the west coast. Every recent statewide election has been decided in this area, and all six statewide elected officials hail from one of the 12 counties considered part of the I-4 corridor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Georgia (15)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Georgia has been a solidly Republican state, but Obama invested heavily in voter registration efforts, hoping a huge turnout among blacks could push him toward victory. When polls showed McCain in good shape earlier this fall, the Obama campaign took down its television ads but kept some staff in the state. With polls now tightening and early-vote numbers looking positive, Obama decided to begin running ads again this weekend. McCain still rates a narrow favorite, but the margin could be smaller than expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surge of black voters and the Obama campaign's aggressive voter registration over the summer could help the Democrats defeat Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R, who is in a tossup race with former state representative Jim Martin. The race could go into a December runoff if neither candidate gets more than 50 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada (5)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada sided with Bush in the past two elections, but Democrats have done an impressive job over the past year in changing the composition of the electorate. That has given Obama hopes of picking off the state Tuesday, but McCain is fighting hard to keep Nevada red. Heading into the final days, it leans slightly toward Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago, Republicans and Democrats were at rough parity in voter registration, but in the past year Democratic registration has surged, and the party now enjoys an advantage of just over 100,000. Another positive sign for Obama is in early-vote statistics. In the two big population areas - Clark County (Las Vegas) and Washoe County (Reno) - Democratic early votes significantly outnumber Republicans'. And, in contrast to John Kerry four years ago, Obama also has spent time courting rural voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Mexico (5)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the start of the 2008 election season, Republicans controlled two of the state's three House seats and one of its Senate seats, and were still riding high on Bush's narrow victory in the Land of Enchantment four years earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for months now, Republicans have acknowledged that Obama is almost certain to carry New Mexico on Tuesday, and they have ceded the state in order to conserve resources for Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic whitewash will continue in the Senate race, where Rep. Tom Udall, D, is comfortably ahead of Rep. Steve Pearce, R, for the seat of retiring Sen. Pete Domenici, R.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Carolina (15)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top three races here couldn't be closer. Obama won big in the primary and has mounted a huge TV and ground game ever since, but McCain has fought hard to keep the state's record of being in the GOP column ever since Jimmy Carter won in 1976. Democrats figure that the black vote share would have to climb 6 or 7 percentage points above the normal 18 to 20 percent for Obama to make it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Gov. Mike Easley, D, term-limited after eight years, Lt. Gov. Beverly Perdue, D, was the early favorite, but seven-term Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory, R, has captured the change theme. In the past, Republicans have won the governorship only in years of big presidential victories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Elizabeth Dole, R, became a target for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which ran largely unanswered TV ads all summer for her opponent, Kay Hagan, D. Dole found herself trailing in the polls and has opened a negative attack on Hagan, even linking her to atheism, but shut out of local newspaper endorsements, she may not have reacted in time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Robin Hayes, R, who won by 329 votes last time, is facing the same opponent, populist teacher Larry Kissell, D, who this year has much stronger national support. Hayes added to his problems by telling a McCain rally that  &quot;liberals hate real Americans that work and achieve and believe in God.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio (20)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Republican has won the White House without winning Ohio, and there's no realistic way to chart a course for McCain that doesn't include the Buckeye State. He and Sarah Palin are showering Ohio with attention, but he is in a struggle to keep Ohio in the Republican column. This state is rated a tossup, but polls have shown Obama with a small but consistent lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most famous political figure in Ohio politics this fall is Joe the Plumber, the Toledo-area everyman who has become McCain's proxy in the economic debate. The economy is McCain's biggest burden here. Next to Michigan, Ohio may be the Midwestern state hardest hit by the economic downturn, and its slump long predates the mortgage and financial industry collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's hopes for converting Ohio lie in huge turnouts in the bigger cities and improving over Kerry's performance in small-town and rural southern Ohio. Obama ran poorly in those areas in the primary, and McCain is counting on those voters to pull him through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans are braced for the loss of House seats here. Rep. Steve Chabot is in a tossup race against state Rep. Steve Driehaus, D, in the 1st District, where a large black turnout for Obama could sink the Republican. Rep. Jean Schmidt, R, also faces stiff competition in her rematch against Democrat Victoria Wulsin, but her strongly Republican district may save her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retirements have created two vulnerable Republican seats. In the 15th District, Democrat Mary Jo Kilroy, who nearly defeated Rep. Deborah Pryce in 2006, is now in a tossup race against state Sen. Steve Stivers, R. In the 16th District, where Ralph Regula, R, is retiring, state Sen. Kirk Schuring faces real competition from state Sen. John Boccieri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania (21)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost no state has seen more of McCain and Palin in the closing days than Pennsylvania, but Obama appears to be holding his hard-earned advantage. After losing the primary here to Hillary Clinton, he solidified his position by choosing Scranton native Joe Biden as his running mate and rallied a blue-collar Democratic base that has grown in numbers under popular Gov. Edward Rendell. McCain and Palin have fought hard for those voters and lead among them in some polls. But Palin's weakness among suburban independents and the prospect of a massive black vote in Philadelphia tilt the race toward Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats, who gained four House seats in 2006, are favored for all of them, although Rep. Chris Carney, D, is getting a challenge from entrepreneur Chris Hackett, R. A more serious threat faces veteran Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D, weakened by publicity over earmarks that benefited a family-owned business. He faces Lou Barletta, the mayor of Hazleton, who won national attention for an ordinance banning employment of illegal immigrants. Kanjorski was worried enough to enlist the help of former president Bill Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Longtime Rep. John Murtha, D, has found himself in trouble over remarks suggesting that his district is  &quot;racist&quot; or  &quot;redneck.&quot; That brought fresh support from Washington for his opponent, William Russell, R, a retired Army lieutenant colonel. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats have rushed funds to Murtha, and he is expected to survive. Democrats have targeted seven-term Rep. Phil English, R, and are running a new candidate, landscape architect Kathy Dahlkemper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia (13)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No state has seen its politics change more dramatically over the past four years than Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, Bush won it rather easily - 54 percent to 45 percent - over Kerry, the 10th straight time the Republican presidential candidate had carried the commonwealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intervening years, however, have brought almost no good news for the GOP. Democratic Gov. Timothy Kaine claimed the state's highest office in 2005, and the following year Sen. George Allen, R, fell in a stunning upset to James Webb, D.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats seem likely to keep up their momentum Tuesday. Polls conducted in recent weeks have shown Obama leading McCain by between four and nine points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Democratic Gov. Mark Warner is cruising to a victory over another former governor - Republican Jim Gilmore - in the race to replace retiring Sen. John Warner, R.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SALISBURY, N.C. (AP) Thousands of voters lined up for hours across North Carolina on Saturday to cast a ballot on the final day of a record-setting early voting period, as the candidates at the top of the ticket began making their final push to win over the public's support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The voting lines are incredible,&quot; said an excited Lt. Gov. Bev Perdue, the Democratic candidate for governor, after campaigning outside early voting sites in the eastern North Carolina cities of Goldsboro and Greenville. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 2.5 million voters had cast an early ballot as of Saturday afternoon a turnout of 40 percent and more than double the roughly 1 million people who cast an early or absentee ballot four years ago. State Board of Elections director Gary Bartlett said late Saturday he was unaware of any problems popping up in the final hour of early voting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The early voting numbers will grow once the final tallies are released Sunday, but they already far exceed the initial predictions of state election officials, who urged county election boards to extend early voting by four hours and keep accepting early ballots until 5 p.m. Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least half of the state's 100 counties did so, and the lines were long late into the day. The wait to cast an early ballot was at least an hour at most early voting sites in Guilford County, while at the Triangle Towne Center mall in Wake County, the line looped around several buildings. At Independence Regional library in Charlotte, the wait was more than four hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aaron Newell-Tutu, 19, said he didn't plan to vote Saturday. But his mother had other plans.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c6">Palin: Obama tax plan would leave 'dreams dashed'</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said Saturday that Barack Obama's tax plan will dash the dreams of Americans and their children as she urged voters in this surprise swing state to vote against such a change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin said Obama's plans show that he has an &quot;ideological commitment to higher taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you believe America is still the land of possibilities and if you don't want your dreams dashed and your children's dreams dashed by the Obama tax increase, then, North Carolina, we're asking for your votes,&quot; Palin told the rowdy crowd of several thousand at the state fairgrounds in Raleigh. &quot;Can we count on your vote on Nov. 4?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alaska governor said Obama's &quot;phony&quot; tax plan has been repeatedly revised downward as surrogates have at times offered different benchmarks for the middle class, including New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson's remark this week that it would end at $120,000. Palin said Obama's tax ideas were beginning to unravel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would decimate many small business,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though twice touting gun rights, Palin spent much of her speech focusing on Obama's tax ideas as supporters held up signs referring to &quot;Joe the Plumber&quot; the Ohio workman who has become a campaign theme for McCain after he questioned Obama on his tax plan.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c6">Dole starting &quot;robocalls&quot; on Hagan and atheists</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) Incumbent GOP Sen. Elizabeth Dole continued Saturday to question her campaign rival's attendance at a fundraiser hosted by an adviser to an atheist advocacy group, beginning a round of automated calls that includes clips of Kay Hagan trying to explain her decision to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dole's campaign began sending out automated telephone calls that talks about Hagan, a Democratic state senator, and the Godless Americans Political Action Committee. Dole's campaign said 1.3 million calls are planned through Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hagan has sued Dole over her initial television ad about the fundraiser, accussing her of defamation and libel. The initial spot concludes with a picture of Hagan while another woman says, &quot;There is no God.&quot; Hagan is an elder at her Presbyterian church and has responded with an ad that strongly declares her Christian faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dole said Saturday she didn't know whether her advertisement had succeeded in its intended purpose, but she defended the widely criticized line of attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are two issues. One: why did she go? And the second, what does she think about their agenda?&quot; Dole said in an interview. &quot;She's not answering the ... questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The automated call asks listeners to &quot;press one&quot; to hear from Hagan. Recipients then hear clips of an interview in which Hagan tries to explain why she attended the event after Dole's campaign had raised questions about the hosts and the Godless Americans PAC.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c6">Casket with anti-Obama sticker raises ire in NC</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) North Carolina officials are decrying the appearance of a casket with an anti-Barack Obama sticker at a Cravens County polling place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Democrats said Saturday the coffin and sticker are an attempt to intimidate people voting early. Republican Party spokesman Brent Woodcox told The (Raleigh) News &amp; Observer that citizens should be outraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP says the casket was in place for at least several hours. A bumper sticker on it showed an image of Obama and the phrase &quot;O' No!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, federal officials say Justice Department personnel will monitor voting Tuesday in several counties in North Carolina and South Carolina as part of a nationwide effort to protect voting rights and prevent fraud. Observers will be in Alamance County, N.C.; and in Dorchester and Georgetown counties in South Carolina.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My boys ate souse, and to this minute don't know what it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They may eat it again next year if we walk by the booth giving out samples at the state fair. A visit to the fair in Raleigh and the county fair that's now under way in Wilmington are among our young family's traditions. This is the time of year for traditional events in our area. Here's a few we share that may give you ideas of your own. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday morning you'll find us bent over plates of steaming pancakes at Hoggard High School. It's the best cafeteria food I've ever had. Jack, 8, and Logan, 6, are veterans of these massive Kiwanis Club feeds but this will be the first for 1-year-old Ben and 2-month-old Kara. We go every year, joining several thousand of our friends and neighbors. Jack and Logan are good for two plates of cakes apiece, Ben will spackle his shirt with one syrup-drenched cake and Kara will sweetly observe or cry at the top of her lungs or both. Good father that I am, I will go up to the counter for several more plates for my children that will get slid back to me because those cakes shouldn't go to waste now, should they? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, you'll find us bent over a steaming ballot. The hot races locally and nationally make this an election I don't want my children to miss so I'll take one or more with me to our polling place. They benefit from seeing their parents and neighbors patiently and cheerfully do their democratic duty. Plus, they get those neat little flag stickers. Based on what they've learned in school, Jack wants me to vote for McCain because he's good at the barbecue. Logan is lobbying me to vote for Obama because he's famed for his chili. Tough call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next weekend we'll get to the Cape Fear Fair and Expo at the airport. This is a good deal if you have kids who like to ride rides. The one-price-covers-all is a bargain if you don't get sidetracked by the carnival games and candy apples. To get to the midway, you walk through a series of tents full of farm animals and commercial displays. Jack and Logan race through them, scoop up the free pencils and brochures for gutter cleaning, and then head for the rides. Three or four hours later, we'll trudge back out, stopping long enough to pick up a helpful pamphlet on insuring your tractor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few weeks later will come our annual trips to Wrightsville Beach and Carolina Beach for the holiday boat parades, to Enchanted Airlie for the trains and to Mike's Farm near Jacksonville for the hayride through fields of Christmas lights. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restaurant at Mike's has the world's best macaroni and cheese but no souse. It's an, um, delicacy made up of the less popular parts of the pig, what's on the snout and between the ears. Don't tell Jack and Logan. That way, getting soused at the state fair can become a family tradition. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite John McCain's prediction of an upset, Barack Obama reached for a landslide Friday, invading his rival's home state with TV ads and building a lead in early voting in key battlegrounds as the presidential race headed into a hectic final weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain charged that Obama, bidding to become the first black president, &quot;began his campaign in the liberal left lane of politics and has never left it. He's more liberal than a senator who calls himself a socialist,&quot; he added in Hanoverton, Ohio, a reference to Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet with the economy almost certainly in a recession and the country clamoring for change after eight years of Republican rule, even some of McCain's allies conceded the obvious. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said it would take a  &quot;major struggle for him to win&quot; - although he quickly added the Arizona senator had come back before when he had been counted out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privately, McCain's aides said their man trailed Obama by 4 points nationwide in internal polling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Associated Press-Yahoo News poll of likely voters put the Democrat ahead, 51 to 43, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same survey gave McCain reason to hope - one in seven voters, 14 percent of the total - said they were undecided or might yet change their minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the race for the White House drew most of the attention, minority Republicans in Congress braced for the loss of more seats in both the House and Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some said fresh polling in North Carolina suggested that incumbent GOP Elizabeth Dole had fallen further behind since airing an ad that tried to tie Democratic rival Kay Hagan to atheists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four days before the election, Obama was expanding his reach, and drawing large crowds as he moved methodically from one state to another that voted Republican in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a stop home in Chicago to share Halloween with his two daughters, Obama took a bus ride about 30 miles across the state border, capping his day with a rally in Highland, Ind.  &quot;We are four days away from changing the United States of America,&quot; he proclaimed to a cheering crowd on a comfortable October evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indiana is one of about a half-dozen states that went for President twice but remain up for grabs late this election season. Bush won the state by a 60-39 percent margin in 2004, and the competitive nature of the state this time around shows the strength of Obama's standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama used the occasion of Halloween to rib McCain in a new way, saying the Republican wore his usual costume:  &quot;Just like every year, he's going as George W. Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in Iowa, Obama said,  &quot;What you started here in Iowa has swept the nation.&quot; His victory in the state's Democratic caucuses on Jan. 3 set him on the path to the party's nomination, and now to a lead in the presidential polls in the campaign's final hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One senior adviser said the Illinois senator had been given the names of potential Cabinet and White House staff picks for review but had not had much time to consider them. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama could name a chief of staff as early as next week if he wins the election, in an effort to project a sense of urgency. Aides have contacted Rep. Rahm Emanuel of Illinois to consider a possible appointment to the post, but no job has been offered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides announced he would air television commercials in McCain's home state of Arizona as well as in North Dakota and Georgia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad in McCain's state was a soft sell in a campaign that has had its share of attacks. This spot featured endorsements from former Secretary of State Colin Powell and Warren Buffett, the nation's best-known investor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, dismissed it as a waste.  &quot;We encourage them to pick other states that we intend to win&quot; to spend their money, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis contended,  &quot;We are witnessing perhaps, I believe, one of the greatest comebacks since John McCain won the primary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privately, some Republicans expressed concerned about early voting trends, although the party had yet to unleash its final 72-hour program, designed to reach millions of voters deemed sympathetic to McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics showed Democrats ahead among pre-Election Day voters in Iowa, North Carolina, Florida, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada. Bush won all six in 2004, and McCain needs to win most of them to claim the White House this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Georgia, one of the states where Obama began advertising on Friday, official figures show 35 percent of the early votes have been cast by blacks, and lines have been longest in and around reliably Democratic Atlanta. In the 2004 election, blacks accounted for 24 percent of the state's ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain was on the second day of a bus tour through battleground Ohio, a state that supported Bush and has voted with the winner in each presidential election for two decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We're closing, my friends, and we're going to win in Ohio. We're a few points down but we're coming back and we're coming back strong,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shippensburg, Pa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emily Daywalt decided to go to the first political rally of her life because she wanted to cheer Sarah Palin, who was here a few days ago to inspire the faithful. Daywalt said she likes it that Palin &quot;hunts and that she believes in God and that she is a strong, independent woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ask the 19-year-old from South Mountain, Pa., why she is voting against Barack Obama, and she hones right in on John McCain's closing argument. Obama, Daywalt said, &quot;wants to spread the wealth,&quot; which she interprets as meaning that he'd &quot;give it to people who don't do anything.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all of the McCain campaign's relentless use of guilt-by-association techniques right to the end, the 2008 campaign is concluding on a remarkably substantive argument. It is a debate about what constitutes social fairness and whether a top-down or a bottom-up approach to economic growth will define the country's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is often described as cautious, but he has been bold and unrelenting in his criticisms of trickle-down economics and tax cuts concentrated on the wealthy. He used Thursday's negative numbers on economic growth to press his case against theories that conservatives have been touting for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The decline in our GDP didn't happen by accident,&quot; Obama said. &quot;It is a direct result of the Bush administration's trickle-down, Wall Street-first, Main Street-last policies that John McCain has embraced for the last eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, economic populism is thriving right now and if Obama wins, his election would not simply be a non-ideological verdict against the status quo. It would be a clear repudiation of conservative economic ideas and of McCain's claim that a more-egalitarian approach to growth constitutes &quot;socialism.&quot; McCain's attacks on Obama's thinking have been so forceful and direct that they require this election to be seen as a referendum that will settle a long-running philosophical argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has presented McCain with a problem. By endorsing tax cuts for Americans earning less than $200,000 a year - i.e., the vast majority of taxpayers - Obama has complicated the typical Republican claim that Democrats always support raising taxes. Obama is candid in saying that he thinks the wealthy should pay more so that most Americans can pay less. He also thinks the government can help vulnerable members of the middle class and the poor secure health care and go to college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has complicated McCain's effort to root his argument on taxes in middle-class self-interest, since Obama already has that covered. So McCain has actually had to defend giving large tax benefits to the wealthy and to business, and engage in a wholesale argument against any sort of redistribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain regularly charges that Obama wants to be the &quot;redistributor in chief.&quot; Speaking at the rally here at Shippensburg University, Palin was forced to say this about Obama's support for a variety of tax credits aimed at helping the poor and middle class: &quot;He says that he is for a tax credit, which is when government takes your money in order to give it away to someone else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is, of course, a mighty peculiar definition of tax credits. It is also an odd argument from a ticket that itself is committed to a research-and-development tax credit for corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true that Obama favors &quot;refundable&quot; tax credits to help low-income workers, including some who may pay no income taxes but do pay many other taxes. McCain has argued that Obama's refundable tax credits amount to &quot;welfare.&quot; That, too, is a strange claim, since McCain favors refundable credits as part of his health plan. But the whole idea is to persuade voters such as Emily Daywalt that Obama really is just out to help those &quot;who don't do anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that is why Obama's 30-minute advertisement on Wednesday night was targeted directly to voters such as Daywalt, or at least to those like her who are still persuadable. It was Obama's tribute to the country's working people who seek nothing more than decent incomes, health care and a chance to see their children succeed. It was less a political ad than a documentary about the value of work and the responsibilities of family life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, Republicans have argued that the way to help struggling working people is to give more money to the wealthy. Obama is saying that we should cut out the middleman and help working people directly. My hunch is that Obama's argument will prevail, and that conservatives will then work overtime to try to deny the judgment the people have rendered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five years ago, Jackson Browne appeared as a guest star in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons.&quot; In an effort to seek his wife's forgiveness, Homer throws a party for Marge and books Browne as the entertainment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting at the piano, the singer announces to a yard full of guests: &quot;I'm here to serenade you with a song&quot; - a loud cheer pierces the night air - &quot;from my latest album.&quot; That, of course, brings a collective groan. &quot;Just kidding,&quot; he assures them. &quot;Here's one of my many classics.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scene underscores an all-too-familiar feeling for any veteran artist. It wouldn't be a Jackson Browne concert if he didn't hear shouts coming from the audience, as in: &quot;'The Pretender!&quot; &quot;Running on Empty!&quot; &quot;Doctor My Eyes!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now 60, Browne recorded his first album in 1972 and is touring to promote his 17th, &quot;Time the Conqueror.&quot; It's his first studio recording in six years and his first studio album for the label he founded, Inside Recordings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've got me pretty busy, but it's fun. I'm having a great time,&quot; he says by telephone from Los Angeles, where he had flown from the Midwest and would leave the next day to resume his tour in North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the cover of &quot;Time the Conqueror,&quot; Browne sports a beard flecked with gray. He sees the record as acceptance of the fact that &quot;life is temporary. The acceptance of that brings a lot of gifts. You don't have forever, so you have to come to the point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What ensues is a highly energetic album with songs shaped by a band whose oldest members began playing with Browne 15 years ago. Its newest performers are a pair of background vocalists, Chavonne Morris and Alethea Mills, women in their early 20s who are graduates of an inner-city school in Los Angeles that brims with talent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The album is a clever interweaving of the personal and the political, including &quot;The Drums of War,&quot; &quot;Where Were You,&quot; which probes President Bush's response to Hurricane Katrina, and &quot;Going Down to Cuba,&quot; whose subtlety is driven home largely through humor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Browne recently sued John McCain's presidential campaign for copyright infringement for using his 1977 hit, &quot;Running on Empty,&quot; in an attack ad on Barack Obama, whose most avid supporters include Browne. He says he recently heard Obama speak at a rally in St. Louis attended by more than 100,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long known for his activism, Browne is mentioned in a new song by Randy Newman, titled &quot;A Piece of the Pie&quot;: &quot;Jesus Christ, it stinks here high and low/The rich are getting richer, I should know/While we're going up, you're going down/No one gives a (expletive) but Jackson Browne.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Browne loved it. &quot;It's a very funny thing to say,&quot; he says, noting that Newman sent it to him before he recorded it. &quot;It was like getting a shout-out from your hero.&quot; Browne chuckles about the reviewer who once wrote of his career: &quot;Has there ever been an album where somebody doesn't die?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His melding of the personal and the political is nothing new. He wrote one of his signature songs, the moving ballad &quot;These Days,&quot; when he was only 16. It's one of many that chronicle his life's journey, including his political activism. As he once told an interviewer: &quot;What's more personal than your political beliefs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the boomer generation, &quot;Time the Conqueror&quot; serves as a wake-up call. &quot;You try not to waste energy or time,&quot; he says of being 60. &quot;It's good to have goals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his case, he's fueled by a band made up of younger performers, whom he praises for &quot;their excellence, their spontaneity, their ability to play emotionally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He loves the verse in the title song that &quot;says it's time to decide what kind of world you believe in, and, obviously, to be in the second half of your life, you still have a choice that your world is just beginning - or is coming to an end. You have to accept the idea that there's a time frame in which you can do something.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RALEIGH -- Democratic Party presidential nominee Barack Obama on Wednesday made his last pitch for North Carolina's 13 electoral votes, telling supporters they can reject policies that have contributed to the worst economic crisis since the Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to about 20,000 people at a rally on the state legislative campus, Obama invited a comparison of his policies and Republican nominee John McCain's to those of the country's last two presidents, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Bill Clinton was president, your average wages and incomes went up $7,500,&quot; Obama said. &quot;Under George Bush, it went down $2,000. So if I've got economic theories that are similar to Bill Clinton's, and [McCain's] got economic theories similar to George Bush's, you can look and see which one worked and which didn't. The facts are there for everybody to see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama coupled the comparison to a defense of his call for a middle-class tax cut partly funded with offsetting tax increases on those making more than $250,000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal has drawn criticism from McCain, but Obama said he intends only to return the highest brackets to the rates that prevailed under Clinton, who left office amid an economic boom unrivaled since the Vietnam War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has &quot;called me a socialist for wanting to roll back the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans so we can finally give tax relief to the middle class,&quot; Obama said. &quot;I don't know what's next. By the end of the week he'll be accusing me of being a secret communist because I shared my toys in kindergarten.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's visit came with only six days left in the 2008 campaign. Polls have shown that he and McCain are running even in North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcome here might be critical on election night because Republicans and Democrats alike have conceded that there's no way McCain can win without carrying North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama started building a campaign organization here more than a year ago and in the May primary, used it to administer a killing blow to the candidacy of fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His performance in the Triangle is key to a repeat of that showing against McCain, said John Hood, president of the Republican-tied John Locke Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illinois senator &quot;is in contention [for North Carolina] because he's crushing McCain in the Triangle,&quot; Hood said. &quot;If he wins, it will be largely because of voters in the Triangle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Wednesday's rally, Obama supporters like Tuscaloosa-Lakewood neighborhood resident Keith Ernst of Durham voiced confidence in the outcome, regardless of how the North Carolina vote turns out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People in my neighborhood are just eager for this,&quot; Ernst said. &quot;Some are nervous. They think he can't actually win. [They say,] 'We've seen it before and somehow it's going to get stolen away at the last minute.' I just try to say, 'He's going to win this election and we just need to do our part and vote.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, 37 percent of Durham's voters have cast ballots. According to the local Board of Elections, 70,896 of the county's 190,917 registered voters had weighed in as of Wednesday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bill Bell, who endorsed Obama a year ago and has helped spearhead the senator's effort locally, watched Wednesday's rally from behind the stage. He predicted an Obama victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's going to win,&quot; Bell said. &quot;I haven't a doubt in my mind about it. He's going to win North Carolina, and he's going to win the presidency. Trust me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama and his chief strategist, David Axelrod, both said the campaign has to finish strong and not take the outcome for granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is going to be a dogfight right to the end and we're ready to compete to try to win every single day and especially Election Day,&quot; Axelrod told reporters. &quot;We're going to mobilize our people and we're going to get out there because you don't just saunter into the presidency. You've got to earn it and you've got to compete hard every single day.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunrise, Fla. | Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama plunked down $4 million for a campaign-closing television ad Wednesday night and summoned voters to &quot;choose hope over fear and unity over division&quot; in Tuesday's election. Republican John McCain derided the event as a &quot;gauzy, feel-good commercial,&quot; paid for with broken promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America, the time for change has come,&quot; Obama said in the final moments of the unusual ad, a blend of videotaped moments and a live appearance before thousands in Sunrise, Fla. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In six days we can choose an economy that rewards work and creates jobs and fuels prosperity starting with the middle class,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-minute ad, aired on CBS, NBC, Fox and several cable networks, came days from the end of a race in which Obama holds the lead in polls nationally and in most key battleground states as he bids to become the first black president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while it is unusual for candidates to acknowledge the possibility of defeat, Republican running mate Sarah Palin said she intended to remain a national figure even if the ticket loses next week. &quot;I'm not doin' this for naught,&quot; she told ABC News in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans and even some Democrats said the race was tightening as it neared the end. Although Obama made no mention of McCain in his paid television ad, both men sharpened their rhetoric during the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, in Florida, argued that Obama lacks &quot;what it takes to protect America from terrorists&quot; as he sought to shift attention away from the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question is whether this is a man who has what it takes to protect America from Osama bin Laden, al-Qaida and the other great threats in the world,&quot; he said. &quot;He has given no reason to answer in the affirmative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, in North Carolina, said if &quot;Senator McCain is elected, 100 million Americans will not get a tax cut ... your health care benefits will get taxed for the first time in history ... we'll have another president who wants to privatize part of your Social Security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For weeks now, the race has tilted Obama's way as the two men traverse traditionally Republican states - Obama angling for a sizeable triumph and McCain hoping to win the White House in a close finish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Associated Press-GfK polls taken within the past several days showed Obama ahead in four states that supported President Bush in 2004 and essentially even with McCain in two others. A separate survey suggested even McCain's home state of Arizona was not safely in his column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-minute campaign commercial, purchased at a cost that campaign aides put at roughly $4 million, not only marked Obama's attempt to seal his case with the electorate, but also underscored his enormous financial advantage in the race. He has outraised McCain by far after first committing - and then reneging - on a pledge to limit spending to the $84 million available under federal matching funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama used his commercial to pledge a rescue plan for the middle class in tough times. &quot;I will not be a perfect president,&quot; he said. &quot;But I can promise you this - I will always tell you what I think and where I stand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across 30 minutes, the ad blended views of Obama speaking in a setting that resembled the Oval Office, at the Democratic National Convention and elsewhere as well as scenes of Americans discussing their economic and health care troubles. His wife, Michelle, and his two daughters had cameos, and there were photos of his black father from Kenya and white mother from Kansas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain sought to blunt Obama's campaign-closing pitch, lacking the funds to match it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's got a few things he wants to sell you: He's offering government-run health care ... an energy plan guaranteed to work without drilling ... and an automatic wealth spreader that folds neatly and fits under any bed,&quot; McCain told an audience in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the campaign, former Democratic rival Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton as well as McCain sought to raise doubts about Obama's relatively thin resume on foreign policy and national security matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, Obama traveled last summer to Iraq, Afghanistan and Europe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, he tapped Sen. Joseph Biden, who has long experience in foreign policy, as his vice presidential running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversely, McCain has slumped in the polls as the economic crisis has unfolded in the past several weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters Wednesday, he said the economic meltdown, while serious, was temporary, and the nation would emerge stronger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides Obama, he criticized the Democratic leaders of Congress, who hope to command larger majorities in the new House and Senate than they do now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're getting only a glimpse of what one-party rule will look like,&quot; he said, predicting deep cuts in defense spending and efforts to shrink America's role in the world if Democrats take over the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let there be no confusion about the threats we face,&quot; said McCain. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raleigh | Barack Obama accused Republican rival John McCain on Wednesday of stooping to low tactics by labeling the Democrat a socialist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what's next,&quot; Obama, the presidential candidate, said at an outdoor rally. &quot;By the end of the week, he'll be accusing me of being a secret communist because I shared my toys in kindergarten. I shared my peanut butter and jelly sandwich.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama turned to ridicule to rebut McCain's references to Obama's encounter with &quot;Joe the Plumber.&quot; McCain has capitalized on a moment when Obama told an Ohio plumber he wanted to  &quot;spread the wealth around&quot; by boosting taxes on wealthier people to finance a middle-class tax cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally was the opener for Obama's one-man television blitz Wednesday, when he saturated prime-time with a 30-minute ad and popped up on late-night television. He also gave an interview to ABC News, and appeared with fellow Democratic star Bill Clinton at a rally timed for the local nightly news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ABC interview, Obama said he &quot;absolutely&quot; wants Republicans in his Cabinet should he be elected Tuesday. But he ducked the question of whether he'd keep Defense Secretary Robert Gates at the Pentagon, saying only that it's important  &quot;to return to a tradition of nonpartisan national security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also contemplated a potential loss and said: &quot;I could envision returning to the Senate, and just doing some terrific work with the next president and the next Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-minute infomercial was Obama's final opportunity to reach a mass audience to discuss his principles of governing. Obama's proposals were showcased through the stories of four different people who illustrate specific national challenges and how Obama would address them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spoke in the video, either with voters or directly to the viewing audience. It ended by cutting to Obama at a live appearance in Sunrise, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Raleigh, Obama painted a bleak picture of a McCain presidency. He said voters would get no help paying for college, would have their health benefits taxed and would see tax relief go to the rich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So whether you are Suzy the student, or Nancy the nurse, or Tina the teacher, or Carl the construction worker, if my opponent is elected, you will be worse off four years from now than you are today,&quot; Obama said. &quot;Let's cut through the negative ads and the phony attacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, trailing in the polls with time dwindling, has tried to boost his chances by hammering Obama's tax plan. Obama says he wants to give a tax cut to 95 percent of taxpayers, but McCain says Obama and Democrats in Congress will wind up taxing the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's counter punch came amid new poll data in his favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An AP-GfK poll shows Obama leading in four key states won by President Bush in 2004 and essentially tied with McCain in two other Republican states - North Carolina and Florida, where Obama campaigned Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, meanwhile, was trying to win over voters from the comfort of their couches.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; Pg. 8A</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">596 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The listing McCain campaign has descended into a bout of pre-criminations that is delightful fodder for political reporters. Who can deny that some cretinous McCain aide calling Sarah Palin &quot;a diva&quot; makes good copy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain still has a chance to win, so it'd be more sensible to delay the &quot;who lost 2008?&quot; debate until after Nov. 4. But since it's already in full flower, let's consider a chief culprit in the campaign's current low state - the candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the McCain paradox: No other Republican candidate had a character and background - as a courageously independent spirit - better suited to making the presidential campaign competitive this year. But perhaps no Republican candidate was so poorly suited to the task of running a presidential race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain earned his chops as the media's favorite Republican senator by being a maverick, or in a less exalted formulation, a gadfly. He pursued pet causes inimical to his party, such as campaign-finance reform, and made it his role to tell fellow Republicans what he considered hard truths. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of this endeared him to Republican primary voters. He won the nomination anyway on the basis of his admirable support for the surge (adopted when he was in typical gadfly mode) and a few stock lines. He became the Republican nominee by default, without an organization or fundraising operation to speak of, and soon enough lost the press, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's rapport with the media depended on snarky banter about his own party and about himself. That couldn't continue in the general election, so McCain's campaign cut him off. His lifeline to his former admirers denied to him, McCain became a demonstrably unhappy warrior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a gadfly, McCain often attacked Republican campaign tactics. He denounced the Swift Boat vets in 2004. Still thinking like a gadfly, back in April he reprimanded the N.C. Republican Party for running an ad featuring the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. In ruling Wright out of bounds, McCain had taken off the table Barack Obama's most damaging association. McCain had gadflied himself!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not surprisingly, McCain has been badly outclassed in fundraising by Obama. As a gadfly, McCain always considered fundraising fundamentally distasteful. He celebrated the public financing rules that Obama has blown by on his way to raising some $750 million. McCain was so adamant about campaign-finance strictures that he harangued against independent groups, so-called 527s, and partly as a result, there are few of them to come to his aid in his desperate hour of financial need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gadflies are loners because they spend so much time offending their own side. In his initial primary campaign prior to the 2007 meltdown, McCain staffed up with Bush loyalists - because there were so few McCain loyalists - who didn't understand his appeal. Now, his general-election campaign is rife with former Bush staffers leaking to the press to save their post-McCain campaign reputations. Ah, the agony of the gadfly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside his campaign, meanwhile, McCain is getting abandoned by all the Republicans who usually pronounce themselves &quot;troubled&quot; by Republican tactics. If McCain weren't running for president, and it were some other Republican who had attacked Obama for his associations and picked Sarah Palin as his running mate, surely McCain himself would be on some Sunday show clucking his disapproval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he can't be a gadfly now. McCain's character and background still might see him through somehow, despite a lackluster effort for which he, the gadfly as nominee, bears most of the blame.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After weeks of being out-advertised by Barack Obama, John McCain and the Republican Party are nearly matching the Democrat ad for ad in key battleground markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ad spending and ad placement data obtained from Democratic and Republican operatives show that in the closing days of the campaign the Republican voice has grown louder in states such as Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia and Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, Obama had been scheduled to buy about $2.5 million in Florida ads for the last week of the campaign. McCain is now set to spend about $1.6 million and the Republican National Committee added $1.5 million to their buy in the state this week. Obama appears to have added more weight to his ads since. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad war is especially noticeable in Florida's central corridor, which includes Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those near-parity levels in crucial states come with a price. McCain has had to trim back his ads in Minnesota, Maine, New Hampshire and Wisconsin, giving Obama even greater edges there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A map of the states where McCain and the RNC are spending their money also illustrates the defensive nature of their 11th hour strategy. Except for Pennsylvania, the McCain-GOP focus was on trying to hold states that President Bush won in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In North Carolina, a new poll released this week shows Obama and McCain running about even among voters even though the state hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter won in 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while the GOP may have turned up the volume in crucial states, Obama had outspent them for weeks with ads that promoted his cause and attacked McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last round of ads comes as national polls show Obama with a lead but with McCain closing in. State polls, however, are the more important barometer of how the election might turn out. And by that measure, Obama is in a much better spot, with clear holds of past Democratic states and competing in what have been reliably Republican states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've got to pull the perfect straight here and they don't have any margin for errors,&quot; said Evan Tracey, a media consultant who tracks political advertising. McCain is &quot;doing this at the expense of the Wisconsins and the Minnesotas. Clearly they're on their heels now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also retains a financial advantage over McCain, permitting him to air ads on national broadcast and cable networks that reach every state in the country. At no time was that financial superiority more evident than Wednesday night, when Obama aired a half-hour, prime-time infomercial on NBC, CBS and Fox as well as BET, MSNBC, Univision and TV One.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama gained his money edge by bypassing the public financing system for the general election the first major party candidate to do so since the campaign reforms of the Watergate era. He had initially pledged to accept the limits of public funds if McCain did, but later changed his mind. McCain, by deciding to accept public financing, was left to spend only $84 million in September and October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Sen. Obama had kept his word and abided by the legal FEC financing system, the two campaigns would have been at advertising parity all along,&quot; said Brad Todd, whose firm, OnMessage Inc., is running the GOP's independent expenditure operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Todd added, &quot;The most important five days of any presidential campaign are the last five days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the RNC has stepped in with significant aid. The party's independent expenditure arm, which cannot coordinate spending with McCain, has spent about $21 million in ads against Obama since Monday, according to party filings with the Federal Election Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party ads have been both broad and targeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RNC had been targeting Ohio, Indiana, Florida, Virginia, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. Just this week it added West Virginia and Montana, previously strong Republican states that Obama has managed to move toward him. It launched a new ad Thursday in Ohio, Indiana, Virginia and Florida markets that seeks to raise doubts about Obama's lack of executive experience. &quot;Can you hand your nation to a man who has never been in charge of anything?&quot; the ad says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RNC also planned to air a Virginia-specific ad aimed at the state's veterans and the workers who rely on its military presence. The ad, airing only in Norfolk, warned that Obama would slice military spending, endangering jobs in the state. &quot;America's safety depends on Virginia,&quot; the ad states. &quot;And Virginia's economy depends on our military.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign issued two new ads Thursday that aides called the &quot;closing argument.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the ads takes a positive tone as it contends that Obama is &quot;a leader who'll bring us together,&quot; citing high-profile endorsements from former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a Republican, and billionaire investor Warren Buffett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other spot was a swipe at McCain and Bush, placing the two in the mirrors of a car heading down the road and passing signs featuring a negative view of McCain policies. At the end, McCain and Bush appear together in the rearview mirror as the spot asks: &quot;Look behind you. We can't afford more of the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're like me and at least one other person I know, you've turned into the Village at Myrtle Grove, at the prompting of its sign in Monkey Junction, thinking you'd find a PetSmart. But you didn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You're not blind, and you're not seeing things. Despite the sign at the entrance to the former Myrtle Grove Shopping Center, there isn't a PetSmart now and there may never be. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on the bright side, there's a Japanese steakhouse planning to open in the center early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the signed lease that was in hand earlier this year between PetSmart and developer Ziff Properties, both agreed to terminate it several months ago, said James Mattox, vice president of Morrisville-based Lincoln Harris, which is in charge of leasing for the center. He is not sure why the sign remains but said it will be removed this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PetSmart wanted to see another anchor tenant in addition to The Home Depot, which opened last year, and Staples, which will open within a week or two, Mattox said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of the anchor interest we had is on hold until some things are sorted out with the economy,&quot; he said. &quot;Despite that, we've got several leases that are in process and we're optimistic that it will get leased up in the coming months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mattox added that a pet store is not out of the question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope to have something like (PetSmart),&quot; he said. &quot;We've had some real good dialogue with a similar user.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hibachi Grill, a full-service, sit-down restaurant with a sushi bar, has signed a lease to go into the southern part of the center near the post office, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also at the Village at Myrtle Grove, girls' and women's fashion retailer Cato opens its newest store there Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pizza poll: Pizza Hut restaurants in Wilmington and Carolina Beach kicked off their Get Out &amp; Vote Campaign on Tuesday. With Election Day looming, these Pizza Huts are conducting their own presidential poll with two meal deals offered to customers: a McCain Meal (two medium one-topping pizzas, an order of breadsticks and an order of cinnamon sticks for $19.99) and an Obama Deal (one medium one-topping pizza, one Tuscan pasta order and an order of breadsticks for $19.99). The restaurants are posting a running tally on the votes and are sharing the results with customers when they visit or call to place an order. They are also ending their conversations with, &quot;Don't forget to get out and vote in the real election.&quot; Details: www.pizzahut.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signs of the times: Sign-A-Rama is having a ribbon cutting at its new location, 2509 S. College Road, at 4 p.m. Thursday, followed by a grand opening until 6 p.m. There will be prizes, food and beverages. Details: 793-4770; www.signarama.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celebrate the season: Waterford Village Shoppes, 497 Olde Waterford Way in Leland, will have a fall festival from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday. Festivities include a Halloween costume contest, food, crafts, music, prizes, kids' activities, artists, a charitable food drive and a silent auction to benefit Lower Cape Fear Hospice. Details: Lisa Britt, 392-9325; brittl@the harrelsoncompany.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Something's fishy: Cape Fear Fish Market has opened a second location at 7220 Wrightsville Ave. near Wrightsville Beach. It offers fresh local seafood, new marinades and sauces under its own brand and seasonings. The market is open to the public seven days a week. Cape Fear Fish Market's original location is at 1515 Marstellar St. The new store's manager is Wes Collett. Details: 256-3384.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lunch bunch: The second Eddie Romanelli's location, at 503 Olde Waterford Way in Leland, is now open for lunch. Details: 383-1885; www.atlanticquest.net/waterford.htm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of Romanelli's: Eddie Romanelli's is offering students free pizzas to reward staying in school, and you don't even have to earn top grades. Any student in pre-K through 12th grade may bring in his or her report card for a free pizza. The offer is good at both locations and is good for one pizza per child per report card for dine-in orders only with the purchase of an entree. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harrisonburg, Va. | Barack Obama will focus on the economy and how his tax plans would help the middle class in a half-hour political infomercial Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program, scheduled to run on television networks on the 79th anniversary of the stock-market crash of 1929, &quot;will share the specifics of Obama's plans to turn the economy around and get the country back on track,&quot; campaign spokesman Bill Burton said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to make sure every voter heading into the voting booth knows exactly what Barack Obama would do to bring about fundamental change as president,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign aides declined Tuesday to answer questions about what images viewers will see when they tune in, whether the format will be live or taped and whether it will feature Obama alone or include additional voices such as business leaders or economic experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program will air at 8 p.m. EDT on NBC, CBS, Fox, Univision, BET, MSNBC and TV One, and at various times in other time zones. Obama is scheduled to be speaking during that time at a rally in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Obama continues to lead Republican John McCain nationally and in battleground states, a new Ipsos/McClatchy Poll suggests that the race has tightened, as McCain has used &quot;Joe the Plumber,&quot; an Ohio voter who worried that Obama's plans would raise his taxes, to paint the Illinois senator as a socialist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama leads McCain by 48-42 percent nationally in the poll released Tuesday, down from an 8-point lead the week before. Significantly, the survey found that Obama's advantage on jobs and the economy had fallen from 16 points to 7 points in one week, suggesting that McCain's &quot;Joe the Plumber&quot; tactic had scored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is the first presidential candidate since Ross Perot in 1992 to purchase half-hour prime-time slots to get his message across. With millions of dollars left in his campaign war chest, he has the cash on hand to buy the time to drill his message home and answer McCain's criticisms and allegations six days before the election. The Arizona senator had no comparable plans for a national television buy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economy continued to be a focus of both men's stump speeches on the campaign trail Tuesday. They began in the Democratic-leaning battleground state of Pennsylvania and made their way south to Virginia and North Carolina, two states that voted for President Bush but could swing to Obama this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Obama is running to be redistributionist in chief. I'm running to be commander in chief. Senator Obama is running to spread the wealth,&quot; McCain said at an event in Hershey, Pa., that drew about 8,000 people. He was criticizing Obama's plans to raise taxes on the wealthy and big businesses and reduce them for families that earn less than $200,000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said that theories of trickle-down economics and lax regulation promoted by Bush and McCain had led to the economic crisis, and that it was McCain, who's proposed taxing employer health benefits in conjunction with a health-care tax credit, not Obama, who ultimately could raise taxes on the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain has ridden shotgun as George Bush has driven our economy toward a cliff,&quot; Obama said, &quot;and now he wants to take the wheel and step on the gas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rain&quot; was the operative word in Pennsylvania, where both presidential candidates started the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's rally in Hershey was indoors. He canceled a second event at an outdoor venue in Quakertown because of cold, driving downpours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama braved the rain, bareheaded, in a pair of jeans and a water-resistant jacket, when 9,000 of his supporters came out hours early in winter caps, mud shoes and umbrellas to hear him speak outdoors at Widener University in Chester. He asked for their help turning out friends and family to the polls: &quot;Be as determined as you are today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His staff whisked him back to his hotel to shower and change, and hoped that he'd avoid catching cold between now and Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Hershey, McCain tried to appeal to baseball fans by vowing that if he's elected president, World Series games won't be delayed by infomercials, a reference to Obama's 30-minute ad. Fox has a deal to slightly delay the start of a possible Game 6 between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Tampa Bay Rays in order to carry Obama's program.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | As the economic wreckage piles dangerously higher, the Federal Reserve is prepared to ratchet down interest rates - perhaps to their lowest point in more than four years - with the hope of relieving some of the pain felt by many Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The convergence of a housing collapse and a lockup in lending has created the worst financial crisis in more than a half-century. Alan Greenspan, who ran the Fed for 18 1/2 years, called it a &quot;once-in-a century credit tsunami,&quot; and conceded that he made mistakes that may have aggravated the economy's slump. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a recession seen as inevitable, if not already under way, any Fed rate cut would be aimed at cushioning the fallout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vanishing jobs and shrinking paychecks have forced consumers to cut back sharply. Millions of ordinary Americans have watched their 401(k)s and other nest eggs shrink and the value of their homes drop, making them feel in even worse financial shape. In turn, businesses have cut back on hiring and other investments as customers hunker down and credit problems make it harder and more costly to get financing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are sobering times,&quot; said Paul Kasriel, chief economist at Northern Trust Co.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the problems have been feeding on each other. So far, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues haven't been able to break the vicious cycle, despite hefty rate reductions and a flurry of unprecedented steps aimed at getting credit flowing more freely again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernanke says he'll use all tools to battle the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To that end, Fed policymakers are widely expected to lower the central bank's key interest rate at the conclusion of a two-day meeting Wednesday - their last session before the November elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors and some economists predict the central bank will drop the rate by half a percentage point to 1 percent. If that happens, it would mark the lowest rate since the summer of 2004. Others, however, think the rate will be cut by a smaller, quarter-point to 1.25 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In turn, rates on home equity, certain credit cards and other floating-rate loans tied to commercial banks' prime rate should drop by a corresponding amount. A half point reduction would leave the prime rate at 4 percent; a quarter-point cut would drop the rate to 4.25 percent. Either way, the prime rate would be the lowest in more than four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed hopes that lower rates will spur people and businesses to spend again, helping to brace the wobbly economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it would be a good faith psychological move,&quot; said Richard Yamarone, economist at Argus Research. However, Yamarone and others doubt that another rate reduction will entice people - many buried under piles of debt - to ramp up spending. But it might help a little, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumer spending - which accounts for the single-biggest chunk of overall economic activity - probably fell in the July-to-September quarter. That would mark the first quarterly drop since late 1991, when the country was coming out of a recession, economists said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that, many predict the national economy contracted in the third quarter. The government releases the report on gross domestic product on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDP measures the value of all goods and services produced within the United States and is the broadest barometer of the country's economic health. Many also believe the economy will continue to contract through the rest of this year and into next year. All that would more than meet a classic definition of recession - two straight quarters of shrinking GDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernanke has repeatedly warned that the country's economic weakness could last for some time - even if the government's unprecedented $700 billion financial bailout package and other steps do succeed in getting financial and credit markets to operate more normally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many expect the unemployment rate - now at 6.1 percent - to hit 7.5 percent or higher by next year. Employers have cut jobs each month so far this year. A staggering 760,000 jobs have disappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Democrat Barack Obama or Republican John McCain, the next president will inherit a deeply troubled economy and a record-high budget deficit that could cramp his domestic agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasriel thinks another rate reduction could help squeezed banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lowering rates would increase the difference between the rate banks charge each other to borrow overnight and the rates they are paid on investments in super-safe Treasury securities, a popular investment these days given the chaos in credit markets and on Wall Street, he said. &quot;That will improve profits and will enable banks to restore their capital,&quot; Kasriel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To unclog credit, the Treasury Department recently announced a historic step, saying it would inject up to $250 billion into banks in return for partial ownership. The hope is that banks will use the capital infusions to rebuild their reserves and boost lending to customers. The money also can be used by a bank to buy another bank, strengthening both to better weather the financial storms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, the Fed and other central banks joined together to slash rates, the first coordinated move of that kind in the Fed's history. That dropped the Fed's key rate down to 1.50 percent and marked an about face in policy. The Fed in June had halted an aggressive rate-cutting campaign that had started in September, aimed at shoring up the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed had moved to the sidelines out of fear that its rate cuts would worsen inflation. Since then the inflation threat has lessened. The threat of a global recession has dampened once surging prices for energy, food and other commodities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now a few economists are starting to worry about deflation - a widespread and dangerous bout of falling prices - if the U.S. and world economy get stuck in a long and painful recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remote - but powerful concern about deflation - was among the reasons why the Greenspan Fed held rates at very low levels for so long in the aftermath of the last recession, in 2001. By the summer of 2003, Greenspan had ratcheted down the Fed's rate to 1 percent, which was the lowest since 1958. The Fed held rates at those historically low levels for one year before beginning to bump them up to fight inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics contend that those low rates fed the housing bubble and lax lending standards that eventually would burst and imperil the economy. The meltdown drove up foreclosures and forced financial companies to rack up huge losses on soured mortgage investments, laying low storied Wall Street firms and causing banks to fail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Harold C. Simmons, the Texas billionaire, helped bankroll the Swift Boat Veterans advertisements in 2004, the attack helped crush Sen. John Kerry's presidential campaign, raising questions about Kerry's war record and knocking the candidate off message in the closing months of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With $5 billion to his name and a fervent belief in conservative causes, Simmons sought to be just as bold this year, financing the first advertisements that highlighted Sen. Barack Obama's ties, however slight, to William Ayers, the former member of the '60s-era Weather Underground. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, in spite of writing some big checks, his efforts have met with less success in trying to derail the Democratic presidential candidate this time around. And his mixed record this year shows how the independent money that shaped the 2004 election is less of a factor in helping the Republican cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Simmons' group, the American Issues Project, spent $2.9 million flooding some swing states with the advertisements linking Obama to Ayers, the campaign of Sen. John McCain and his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, adopted that theme as one of their main lines of attack against Obama. And last week, the Republican National Committee used the Ayers issue in thousands of automated calls to voters' homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American Issues also spent $1 million on television commercials blaming the Democrats for the financial crisis. The commercials attack Senate Democrats, while not mentioning Obama, which allows the group to avoid Federal Election Commission oversight. The group says these advertisements will be its last before Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diminished role played by Simmons, who is also a McCain donation bundler, reflects the smaller role played by outside groups in general on the left and the right. Part of this stems from the fact that Obama and McCain initially asked these groups to stand down. But perhaps even more, given the history of the Swift Boat attacks in 2004, Democrats were better prepared when Simmons began his effort this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so were watchdog groups. Democracy 21, which was one of several groups to file a complaint that resulted in fines against the Swift Boat effort, has already complained to the FEC. In a filing last month, Democracy 21 said Simmons' group violated campaign finance laws by failing to register as a political group, which would severely limit the amount that Simmons, or other donors, could give to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Martin, a director of American Issues, responded by saying:  &quot;People can threaten lawsuits all they want. But we are convinced that we have carefully abided by all the laws.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet while the Ayers advertisements never had the same force as the Swift Boat ones, they did cause the Obama campaign to divert money, staff time and legal talent to respond. The 60-second Ayers advertisements were also countered with the Obama campaign's own 30-second commercials rebutting the claims and criticizing McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Simmons is little known to the average voter, his willingness to use his wealth to finance political attacks that resonate with conservative voters has kept him a force to be reckoned with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His group, American Issues, is made up of veterans of the 2004 Swift Boat campaign and was organized to keep it veiled in as much secrecy as possible. Other than Simmons, the group has not identified any donors, or said whether it has anyone else's money but his.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, one of the criticisms of the Kerry campaign was that it did not move quickly and forcefully to counter the advertisements. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has learned from that episode, and took legal actions and started an aggressive drive to undercut Simmons' message once the Ayers ads ran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters, too, appear to have less appetite for such attacks. Recent polls showed that the McCain campaign's own use of the Ayers issue has hurt McCain more than helped him. And in Michigan, after American Issues spent lavishly on the Ayers advertisements, the McCain campaign effectively exited the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simmons, who built an industrial empire and a Texas-size reputation as a swashbuckling corporate raider, has poured millions into the Republican Party and a number of conservative groups. He provided cash early on to kick-start President Bush's political career and has remained one of the president's largest financial backers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a bundler of contributions for McCain, Simmons has raised $50,000 to $100,000 from others for the candidate. That is on top of the $2.9 million he gave to American Issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simmons gave $3 million to the Swift Boat effort and $500,000 to Progress for America, an independent Republican 527 group. He and his wife, Annette, have made $4 million in federal campaign contributions since they began giving, and are major state-level donors. The political action committee of Contran Corp., which is controlled by the Simmons family, has made $1.2 million in donations to federal campaigns since 2002, according to filings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Issues Project is organized as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, a thinly regulated entity that can engage in limited amounts of civic campaigning, but cannot advocate for or against candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A group that is funded almost entirely by one donor who has given money to Swift Boat and is run by former McCain operatives, put out false ads about us - we will fight back immediately to correct the record,&quot; said Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the Obama campaign.  &quot;We live in a media environment and have to respond to everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American Issues is a Web-based group. It has no bricks-and-mortar office. Its Web site says it champions conservative values that have made America a  &quot;blessed nation,&quot; and supports smaller government, lower taxes, a strong defense and opposition to  &quot;radical Islamic extremists abroad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of its founders is Chris LaCivita, who is a consultant to the group and was a media adviser to the Swift Boat effort. Another founder is Tony Feather, a Republican strategist and close associate of Karl Rove, who also founded the Progress for America, the 527 group that Simmons helped finance in 2004 and that was later found to have violated federal election law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Failor Jr., one of the group's two directors, worked on the McCain campaign in Iowa, and the group's public relations are handled by Christian Pinkston, whose firm represented the Swift Boat campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the 2004 election, the FEC found that the Swift Boat group illegally spent $20 million to influence the election and was fined $299,500. Progress for America spent $31 million in 2004, and was fined $750,000 for violating election law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrarian that I am, I'm voting for John McCain. I'm not talking about bucking the polls or the media consensus that it's over before it's over. I'm talking about bucking the rush of wet-fingered conservatives leaping to Barack Obama before they're left out in the cold without a single state dinner for the next four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I stand athwart the rush of conservative ship-jumpers of every stripe - neo (Ken Adelman), moderate (Colin Powell), genetic/ironic (Christopher Buckley) and socialist/atheist (Christopher Hitchens) - yelling &quot;Stop!&quot; I shall have no part of this motley crew. I will go down with the McCain ship. I'd rather lose an election than lose my bearings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, I'll have no truck with the phony case ginned up to rationalize voting for the most liberal and inexperienced presidential nominee in living memory. The &quot;erratic&quot; temperament issue, for example. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if McCain's risky and unsuccessful but in no way irrational attempt to tactically maneuver his way through the economic tsunami that came crashing down a month ago renders unfit for office a man who demonstrated the most admirable equanimity and courage in the face of unimaginable pressures as a prisoner of war. He later steadily navigated innumerable challenges and setbacks, not the least of which was the collapse of his campaign just a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain the &quot;erratic&quot; is a cheap Obama talking point. The 40-year record testifies to McCain the stalwart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor will I countenance the &quot;dirty campaign&quot; pretense. The double standard here is stunning. Obama ran a scurrilous Spanish-language ad falsely associating McCain with anti-Hispanic slurs. Another ad falsely claimed McCain supports &quot;cutting Social Security benefits in half.&quot; And for months Democrats insisted that McCain sought 100 years of war in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's critics are offended that he raised the issue of William Ayers. What's astonishing is that Obama was himself not offended by William Ayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, the most remarkable of all tactical choices of this election season is the attack that never was. Out of extreme (and unnecessary) conscientiousness, McCain refused to raise the legitimate issue of Obama's most egregious association - with the race-baiting Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Dirty campaigning, indeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case for McCain is straightforward. The financial crisis has made us forget, or just blindly deny, how dangerous the world out there is. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have a generations-long struggle with Islamic jihadism. An apocalyptic soon-to-be-nuclear Iran. A nuclear-armed Pakistan in danger of fragmentation. A rising Russia pushing the limits of revanchism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plus the sure-to-come Falklands-like surprise popping out of nowhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who do you want answering that phone at 3 a.m.? A man who's been cramming on these issues for the last year, who's never had to make an executive decision affecting so much as a city, let alone the world? A foreign policy novice instinctively inclined to the flabbiest, most vaporous multilateralism (e.g., the Berlin Wall came down because of &quot;a world that stands as one&quot;), and who refers to the most deliberate act of war since Pearl Harbor as &quot;the tragedy of 9/11,&quot; a term more appropriate for a bus accident?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or do you want a man who is the most prepared, most knowledgeable, most serious foreign policy thinker in the United States Senate? A man who not only has the best instincts, but has the honor and the courage to, yes, put country first, as when he carried the lonely fight for the surge that turned Iraq from catastrophic defeat into achievable strategic victory?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's just no comparison. Obama's own running mate warned this week that Obama's youth and inexperience will invite a crisis - indeed a crisis &quot;generated&quot; precisely to test him. Can you be serious about national security and vote on Nov. 4 to invite that test?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And how will he pass it? Well, how has he fared on the only two significant foreign policy tests he has faced since he's been in the Senate? The first was the surge. Obama failed spectacularly. He not only opposed it. He tried to denigrate it, stop it and, finally, deny its success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second test was Georgia, to which Obama responded instinctively with evenhanded moral equivalence, urging restraint on both sides. McCain did not have to consult his advisers to instantly identify the aggressor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | The presidential race tightened after the final debate, with John McCain gaining among whites and people earning less than $50,000, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll that shows McCain and Barack Obama essentially running even among likely voters in the election homestretch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll, which found Obama at 44 percent and McCain at 43 percent, supports what some Republicans and Democrats privately have said in recent days: that the race narrowed after the third debate as GOP-leaning voters drifted home to their party and McCain's &quot;Joe the plumber&quot; analogy struck a chord. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three weeks ago, an AP-GfK survey found that Obama had surged to a seven-point lead over McCain, lifted by voters who thought the Democrat was better suited to lead the nation through its sudden economic crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contest is still volatile, and the split among voters is apparent less than two weeks before Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I trust McCain more, and I do feel that he has more experience in government than Obama. I don't think Obama has been around long enough,&quot; said Angela Decker, 44, of La Porte, Ind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Karen Judd, 58, of Middleton, Wis., said, &quot;Obama certainly has sufficient qualifications.&quot; She said any positive feelings about McCain evaporated with &quot;the outright lying&quot; in TV ads and his choice of running mate Sarah Palin, who &quot;doesn't have the correct skills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new AP-GfK head-to-head result is a departure from some, but not all, recent national polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and McCain were essentially tied among likely voters in the latest George Washington University Battleground Poll, conducted by Republican strategist Ed Goeas and Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. In other surveys focusing on likely voters, a Washington Post-ABC News poll and a Wall Street Journal-NBC News survey have Obama up by 11 points, and a poll by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center has him leading by 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls are snapshots of highly fluid campaigns. In this case, there is a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points; that means Obama could be ahead by as many as 8 points or down by as many as 6. There are many reasons why polls differ, including methods of estimating likely voters and the wording of questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Franklin, a University of Wisconsin political science professor and polling authority, said variation between polls occurs, in part, because pollsters interview random samples of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they all agree, somebody would be doing something terribly wrong,&quot; he said of polls. But he also said that surveys generally fall within a few points of each other, adding, &quot;When you get much beyond that, there's something to explain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AP-GfK survey included interviews with a nationally representative random sample totaling 1,101 adults, including 800 deemed likely to vote. For the entire sample, the survey showed Obama ahead 47 percent to 37 percent. He was up by five points among all registered voters, including the likely voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A significant number of the interviews were conducted by dialing a randomly selected sample of cell phone numbers, and thus this poll had a chance to reach voters who were excluded from some other polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was taken over five days from Thursday through Monday, starting the night after the candidates' final debate and ending the day after former Secretary of State Colin Powell broke with the Republican Party to endorse Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's strong showing is partly attributable to his strong debate performance; Thursday was his best night of the survey. Obama's best night was Sunday, hours after the Powell announcement, and the full impact of that endorsement may not have been captured in any surveys yet. Future polling could show whether either of those was merely a support &quot;bounce&quot; or something more lasting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During their final debate, a feisty McCain repeatedly forced Obama to defend his record, comments and associations. He also used the story of a voter whom the Democrat had met in Ohio, &quot;Joe the plumber,&quot; to argue that Obama's tax plan would be bad for working class voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody,&quot; Obama told the man with the last name of Wurzelbacher, who had asked Obama whether his plan to increase taxes on those earning more than $250,000 a year would impede his ability to buy the plumbing company where he works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, McCain's campaign unveiled a new TV ad that features that Obama quote, and shows different people saying: &quot;I'm Joe the plumber.&quot; A man asks: &quot;Obama wants my sweat to pay for his trillion dollars in new spending?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since McCain has seized on that line of argument, he has picked up support among white married people and non-college educated whites, the poll shows, while widening his advantage among white men. Black voters still overwhelmingly support Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican also has improved his rating for handling the economy and the financial crisis. Nearly half of likely voters think their taxes will rise under an Obama administration compared with a third who say McCain would raise their taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the last AP-GfK survey in late September, McCain also has:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Posted big gains among likely voters earning under $50,000 a year; he now trails Obama by just 4 percentage points compared with 26 earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surged among rural voters; he has an 18-point advantage, up from 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doubled his advantage among whites who haven't finished college and now leads by 20 points. McCain and Obama are running about even among white college graduates, no change from earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Made modest gains among whites of both genders, now leading by 22 points among white men and by 7 among white women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Improved slightly among whites who are married, now with a 24-point lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Narrowed a gap among unmarried whites, though he still trails by 8 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has cut into Obama's advantage on the questions of whom voters trust to handle the economy and the financial crisis. On both, the Democrat now leads by just 6 points, compared with 15 in the previous survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama still has a larger advantage on other economic measures, with 44 percent saying they think the economy will have improved a year from now if he is elected compared with 34 percent for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intensity has increased among McCain's supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month ago, Obama had more strong supporters than McCain did. Now, the number of excited supporters is about even.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight of 10 Democrats are supporting Obama, while nine in 10 Republicans are backing McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independents are about evenly split.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | Starting the month with nearly $134 million in the bank, Democrat Barack Obama enters the final stretch of the presidential election with a robust ad presence in 18 states and the flexibility to expand if the politics move him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican rival John McCain has no wiggle room. His budget a fraction of Obama's, McCain is looking to stretch his advertising dollar wherever he can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Obama buys ads in expensive media markets such as Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia, McCain is trying to extend nine-day advertising commitments to 14 days in places like Green Bay and Madison, in Wisconsin, reducing his spending and the number of spots he airs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who began October with $47 million in hand, was taking similar cost-cutting steps in New Hampshire. Democrats said they detected similar moves in Maine, Minnesota and Colorado. Obama leads in polls in all five states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The adjustments indicated McCain, aware of his financial disadvantage, was beginning to focus on more closely contested states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has emerged as the most prodigious fundraiser ever in presidential politics. He spent $65 million on commercials in September. McCain spent $22.5 million. Even with extra help from the Republican National Committee, McCain has been at a clear disadvantage on the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is airing ads is local markets but also is buying significant chunks of time on the national broadcast networks and national cable networks. McCain and the RNC are limiting themselves to state-by-state air wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RNC is spending more than $20 million between last Friday and the Nov. 4 election on independent ads to help McCain in Colorado, Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Except for Pennsylvania, all the states backed George W. Bush in the last two presidential elections. McCain is airing ads in those states as well as Nevada, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Maine, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has targeted the same states but also is in Montana, West Virginia and Michigan, a state McCain is no longer contesting. Obama also has ads in three Kentucky border markets, giving him extra reach into Indiana and Missouri and possibly positioning him in the event polling shows Kentucky to be vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama reported raising a record-shattering $151 million in September, more than doubling the fundraising record he set in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is accepting public financing and cannot raise money. He is limited to $84 million for the two months before Election Day.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | With Democrat Barack Obama holding a clear financial advantage, Republican John McCain is fine-tuning his advertising message and increasing his television spots going into the final two weeks of a presidential contest that is shattering spending records. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spent $37 million in September, leaving him $47 million for October. His monthly financial report filed with the Federal Election Commission shows he spent nearly two-thirds of his money, $22.5 million, on advertising as he tried to keep up with Obama's&nbsp;ad blitz in battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is seeking to narrow that gap. He spent about $9.4 million on ads in key battlegrounds last week, according to the political ad monitoring firm TNS/CMAG, and is expected to spend more this week. The Republican National Committee is set to spent $1 million a day over the next two week on ads helping McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For McCain this has always been about threading the needle down the stretch,&quot; said Evan Tracey, the head of TNS/CMAG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama, who reported raising $150 million in September, retains the upper hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A schedule of anticipated Obama&nbsp;ad buys obtained by The Associated Press show that Obama plans to spend about $30 million in contested states during the next two weeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, he also spent about $12 million on national networks and national cable channels - a rate that he is expected to sustain, if not increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also is buying a half hour of air time on Oct. 29 on NBC, CBS and Fox - an expensive commitment of time - to address the nation in prime time five days before Election Day, Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is no longer buying time on national networks or national cable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locked in a close contest in Virginia, McCain has begun buying advertising on Washington, D.C., stations, a costly market that he had avoided while he concentrated on less expensive areas in southern Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, however, has been able to spend in markets that are financially out of reach for McCain. For instance, Obama is buying air time in Chicago to reach a portion of northwestern Indiana, and is buying expensive time in Boston to reach southern New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who is participating in the public financing system for presidential elections, is limited to spending a total of $84 million in the two months before the election. Obama bypassed the public finance program and has continued to raise private donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has received significant help from the Republican National Committee, which raised $66 million in September and will report $77.5 million cash on hand at the start of October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means that together, McCain and the party began the month with more than $124 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party can spend up to $19 million in coordination with the campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is advertising in a number of Republican states that have not been considered competitive presidential battlegrounds in the past, including Virginia, North Carolina, Colorado, Indiana, Montana and West Virginia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON | Colin Powell on Sunday became the most prominent Republican to endorse Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama, with the former secretary of state and retired four-star general declaring the senator from Illinois to be a &quot;transformational&quot; figure who would &quot;electrify our country ... (and) the world.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell's endorsement, on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; came as Obama's campaign announced it had raised more than $150 million in September, more than doubling the previous record for monthly fundraising and giving him a vast financial advantage over Republican John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell said he respects McCain and considers him a friend. But he said that McCain's  &quot;unsure&quot; response to the ongoing economic crisis and his selection of a running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, whom  &quot;I don't believe is ready to be president of the United States&quot; disappointed him, as had the recent negative tenor of McCain's campaign and a  &quot;narrower and narrower&quot; Republican approach to serious national problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I watched Mr. Obama,&quot; particularly in recent weeks, Powell said, and  &quot;he displayed a steadiness, an intellectual curiosity, a depth of knowledge ... in not just jumping in and changing every day, but showing intellectual vigor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama  &quot;has given us a more inclusive, broader reach into the needs and aspirations of our people,&quot; he said.  &quot;He is crossing lines - ethnic lines, racial lines, generational lines.&quot; Powell added that the Democratic senator had chosen in Sen. Joe Biden a running mate who  &quot;is ready to be president on Day One.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement is a blow to McCain, a fellow Vietnam War veteran whose 2000 presidential campaign Powell supported before George W. Bush won the Republican nomination. McCain had pledged publicly during that campaign to name Powell as his secretary of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain sought to shrug off the endorsement, saying that he has always  &quot;admired and respected&quot; Powell and that it  &quot;doesn't come as a surprise.&quot; He said that he was pleased to have the support of four other former Republican secretaries of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican former House speaker Newt Gingrich said on ABC's  &quot;This Week&quot;:  &quot;What that just did in one sound bite - and I assume that sound bite will end up in an ad - is it eliminated the experience argument. How are you going to say the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, former national security adviser, former secretary of state was taken in?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In explaining his decision, Powell was more critical of the Republican Party and McCain's campaign than of the candidate himself. He said Republican attempts to tie Obama to the 1960s domestic terrorism of William Ayers amounted to  &quot;demagoguery&quot; and a distraction from pressing issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell also said he was troubled by Republicans who  &quot;said such things as  'Well, you know that Mr. Obama is a Muslim.' Well, the correct answer is  'He is not a Muslim; he is a Christian. He's always been a Christian.' But the really right answer is  'What if he is?' Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's that time again. With the mud flying in the presidential race, pundits, journalists and political observers of all stripes are denouncing the campaign's new, strikingly negative tone. Listening to them, you'd think that the very fabric of our democracy were being ripped apart every time a candidate aired a tough attack ad, threw an elbow or issued a sharply worded statement. It's no surprise that the public has joined the chorus to denounce negativity in politics. But as someone who has spent years studying negative advertising, I say hold the handwringing over attack ads. They're actually pretty good for the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before you throw down the paper in disgust, let me offer, as Sen. John McCain likes to say, some &quot;straight talk.&quot; For starters, let's not be prudish about this. Really, what did we expect to happen? The polls all show that Sen. Barack Obama has opened up a significant lead over McCain, who is saddled with a sagging economy and a wildly unpopular president. Senior GOP operatives recently told The Washington Post that the McCain campaign would take a newly aggressive tone to try &quot;to change the subject here,&quot; as one McCain hand put it. So is it any wonder that McCain is airing mostly negative ads at this point? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Obama's not innocent, either. While McCain's running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, blasted the Democratic nominee for his rather thin ties to a seemingly unrepentant member of the Vietnam-era Weather Underground, Obama responded with an ad reminding voters of McCain's role in the &quot;Keating Five&quot; savings-and-loan scandal of the 1980s. Recent data from Nielsen suggest that the campaigns have aired roughly the same number of negative ads. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most people assume that negativity in politics is a bad thing. But they're wrong. Attack ads aren't just inevitable; they're actually helpful to voters. Negative ads, on average, are actually more informative than positive ones. This claim sounds like sacrilege in light of all the negativity about negativity, but the data are clear. Believe it or not, I've examined all the ads aired by presidential candidates on television from 1960 to 2004, and my analysis has led me to some startling conclusions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, negative ads are more likely than positive ads to be about the issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, negative ads are more likely to be specific when talking about those issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, negative ads are more likely to contain facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And finally, negative ads are more likely to be about the important issues of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How is this possible? How can something so widely reviled actually turn out to be good for us? It's like finding out that Big Macs are nutritious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is that we rarely consider what's necessary for a negative ad to work. Obama can't just say that a McCain presidency would be bad for the economy. Instead, he must make an argument, even a 30-second one, showing how McCain's policies will supposedly lead to an economic downturn. That forces Obama to be much more specific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, attacks need evidence to work. Could Obama attack McCain as unprepared to serve as commander-in-chief? Not in this lifetime. McCain has the necessary experience, and claiming otherwise would backfire. Similarly, McCain can't question Obama's intelligence because the Democrat is clearly smart. When ads lack the evidence to support their claims, they tend to work against the candidate who aired them. Just consider the flak McCain took recently after running his &quot;sex education&quot; ad. It simply wasn't credible to claim that Obama supported sex education for 6-year-old kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the reason people don't like negative ads is that attacks aren't fun; learning about someone's weaknesses isn't enjoyable. Nonetheless, it's important. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line: Candidates are great at telling us all about their strengths, but they just won't tell us about their weaknesses. So that task falls to their opponents. We need this negative information to make an informed choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. elections are pitched battles for control of the federal government. But the candidate left standing will be battle-tested for the fiery trial that awaits him when he takes that oath of office.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asheville | The resume that propelled consummate Washington insider Elizabeth Dole to the Senate six years ago is reading more like a rap sheet in a year when the political winds are blowing against Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former American Red Cross president, one-time White House hopeful and Cabinet member for two GOP presidents suddenly finds herself in an uphill race against a little-known Democrat for a Senate seat that has been in Republican hands for 35 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dole hasn't lived amongst us that much,&quot; said Ann Jennings, 80, a supporter of Dole's Democratic challenger, state Sen. Kay Hagan. &quot;She doesn't know what's going on in North Carolina.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't long ago that Dole was considered such a sure thing that state and national Democrats struggled to recruit a challenger. They ended up with Hagan, a state senator who at first declined their offer but who is emerging as a late favorite. Most recent polls have her leading Dole by single digits, a tough position for any incumbent this close to the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money is a problem this year for Dole, a household name in Republican politics who won her seat with 54 percent of the vote. This time, she's dipping into her personal finances to prop up her campaign amid an onslaught of Democratic ads tying her to President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor are there much in the way of coattails for Dole to ride. Her party's presidential nominee, John McCain, is struggling to hang on to North Carolina - which hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in more than 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dole doesn't sugarcoat her prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've got a situation here where the president's numbers are absolutely, unbelievably poor,&quot; Dole said in a recent interview. &quot;I also think McCain is underperforming right now, and that will change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's an ominous climate for Senate Republicans, who appear certain to lose seats in Virginia and New Mexico. Dole's race is among a half-dozen others that are too close to call or starting to lean Democratic. All told, Democrats now have a slim chance to win a 60-seat majority - a critical milestone that would render Republicans all but powerless in the chamber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dole is well aware of the stakes. She was chairwoman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee two years ago, giving a widely panned performance in an election where the GOP lost six seats and control of the chamber - casualties of what Dole said was a tidal wave of votes cast against the Iraq war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, a surge in Democratic registration and excitement surrounding presidential nominee Barack Obama could doom Dole's chances, said Carter Wrenn, a longtime Republican strategist who for years advised Dole's predecessor, the late Sen. Jesse Helms. Wrenn added that Dole isn't helping herself with a campaign he feels lacks a clear message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They don't really have a clear strategy now as how they get to the finish line. They're thrashing. They're looking for it,&quot; Wrenn said. &quot;But the Democrats are running straight toward their goal, and the Republicans appear not quite sure what to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dole spent plenty of time on the road raising money for Senate candidates during her time at the NRSC, adding to the Democratic-fed perception that she doesn't spend enough time in North Carolina to call the Tar Heel State home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hagan has spent months hammering away with an effective attack line that ends with Dole clicking her heels to return to Kansas, home of her husband, former Senate Majority Leader and GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole. Dole was registered to vote in Kansas until just before running for her Senate seat in 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Bob and Elizabeth Dole have responded with a vigorous campaign schedule and a television ad reintroducing herself to voters during a walk through the front yard of her childhood home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I grew up in this house in Salisbury, and my mother and dad taught me that anything that seems too good to be true usually is,&quot; Dole says, perhaps implying something about Hagan as much as the greedy Wall Street bankers she goes on to talk about in the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hagan is one of the leading budget-writers in the state Senate and has run a safe and consistent campaign. She has conservative tendencies that at times mirror Dole's, such as their shared opposition to amnesty for illegal immigrants and their objection to the federal bailout package brokered between the Democratic-led Congress and the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A niece of Lawton Chiles, Florida's former senator and governor, Hagan was an unknown outside of Greensboro or halls of the statehouse until this year. She was low on the list of Democratic prospects to challenge Dole, and when the party finally turned to her after others declined, Hagan also passed at the chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month later, she got into the race and is now the star of Democratic campaign events, where she draws raucous applause that drowns out that of the party's candidate for governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're up in the polls, so I think people are cheering that,&quot; Hagan said. &quot;They're excited that somebody is challenging Elizabeth Dole, taking her on, and is likely to win this race.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me get this straight. A couple of agitated yahoos in a rally of thousands yell something offensive and incendiary, and John McCain and Sarah Palin are not just guilty by association -- with total strangers, mind you -- but worse: guilty according to The New York Times of &quot;race-baiting and xenophobia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But should you bring up Barack Obama's real associations - 20 years with Jeremiah Wright, working on two foundations and distributing money with William Ayers, citing the raving Michael Pfleger as one who helps him keep his moral compass (Chicago Sun-Times, April 2004) and the long-standing relationship with the left-wing vote-fraud specialist ACORN - you have crossed the line into illegitimate guilt by association. Moreover, it is tinged with racism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that, when John McCain actually heard one of those nasty things said about Obama, he incurred the boos of his own crowd by insisting that Obama is  &quot;a decent person that you do not have to be scared (of) as president&quot; makes no difference. It surely did not stop John Lewis from comparing McCain to George Wallace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The search for McCain's racial offenses is untiring and often unhinged. Remember McCain's Berlin/celebrity ad that showed a shot of Paris Hilton? An appalling attempt to exploit white hostility at the idea of black men  &quot;becoming sexually involved with white women,&quot; fulminated New York Times columnist Bob Herbert. He took to TV to denounce McCain's exhumation of that most vile prejudice, pointing out McCain's gratuitous insertion in the ad of  &quot;two phallic symbols,&quot; the Washington Monument and the Leaning Tower of Pisa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except that Herbert was delusional. There was no Washington Monument. There was no Leaning Tower. Just photographs seen in every newspaper in the world of Barack Obama's Berlin rally in the setting he himself had chosen, Berlin's Victory Column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herbert is not the only fevered one. Rachel Maddow of MSNBC and Jonathan Alter of Newsweek fell over themselves agreeing that the  &quot;political salience&quot; of the Republican attack on ACORN is its unstated appeal to racial prejudice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This about an organization that is being accused of voter registration fraud in about a dozen states. In Nevada, the investigating secretary of state is a Democrat. Is he playing the race card too?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes the charges against McCain especially revolting is that he has been scrupulous in eschewing the race card. He has gone far beyond what is right and necessary, refusing even to make an issue of Obama's deep, self-declared connection with the race-baiting Jeremiah Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the name of racial rectitude, McCain has denied himself the use of that perfectly legitimate issue. It is simply Orwellian for him to be now so widely vilified as a stoker of racism. What makes it doubly Orwellian is that these charges are being made on behalf of the one presidential candidate who has repeatedly, and indeed quite brilliantly, deployed the race card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How brilliantly? The reason Bill Clinton is sulking in his tent is because he feels that Obama surrogates succeeded in painting him as a racist. Clinton has many sins, but from his student days to his post-presidency, his commitment and sincerity in advancing the cause of African-Americans have been undeniable. If the man Toni Morrison called the first black president can be turned into a closet racist, then anyone can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just weeks ago, in Springfield, Mo., and elsewhere, he warned darkly that George Bush and John McCain were going to try to frighten you by saying that, among other scary things, Obama has  &quot;a funny name&quot; and  &quot;doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has never said that, nor anything like that. When asked at the time to produce one instance of McCain deploying race, the Obama campaign could not. Yet here was Obama firing a pre-emptive charge of racism against a man who had not indulged in it. An extraordinary rhetorical feat, and a dishonorable one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes this all the more dismaying is that it comes from Barack Obama, who has consistently presented himself as a healer, a man of a new generation above and beyond race, the man who would turn the page on the guilt-tripping grievance politics of Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ask yourself: Can we afford John McCain?&quot; That's Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Relieve your worst cold symptoms fast.&quot; TheraFlu. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama. Blind ambition. Bad judgment.&quot; McCain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So many messages, so little chance for political candidates to make sure theirs are heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the campaign's final weeks, people in battlegrounds like this one are pounded with paid partisan pitches as candidates, interest groups and political parties make their last pleas to voters - competing with the usual mix of ads for commercial products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contested areas like Columbus, the political ads - for local initiatives, state legislative races, congressional contests and the presidential race - multiply in the final homestretch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact might seem questionable. Images and slogans blur with competing political spots and consumer pitches. But the candidates clearly think it's worth the money. A lot of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is financially outpacing McCain here and elsewhere. He seems to be running three or more ads in this competitive state to every one for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illinois senator is so flush with cash that he can even afford an ultra-expensive 30-minute prime time national spot on major networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the week ending Oct. 12, Obama spent at least $30 million nationally to about $14 million for McCain and the Republican National Committee combined. Here in the Columbus market, Obama doled out $425,000 to $260,000 for McCain and the RNC, according to ad-tracking firm TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is airing at least five different ads here, a mix of positive messages promoting his biography and plans, as well as negative messages that assail his rival. McCain appears to be airing only one commercial in Columbus and it criticizes Obama and his fellow Democrats. Nationally, roughly one-third of Obama's ads attack McCain directly while virtually all of McCain's ads go after Obama, according to a recent study by the Wisconsin Advertising Project at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going back to the primaries, people have been inundated with political ads in some places all year with hardly a reprieve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strategists for both Obama and McCain have had trouble this year determining the best way to ensure their messages reach voters in an era where blogs compete with newspapers, iPods compete with radio, and download-able programs compete with traditional TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, TV commercials still are an important way to court a mass audience with crystalized messages that don't go through the news media's filter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, campaigns can target their spots to specific audiences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | Race, an inescapable but explosive issue on which both presidential candidates have tread carefully if not tried to ignore, is increasingly popping up as it's becoming more likely the country will elect its first black president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of John McCain and Barack Obama, though not the candidates themselves, are amplifying the issue in the homestretch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among Democratic backers: Rep. John Lewis, the black Georgia Democrat and prominent civil rights leader who accused the GOP ticket of &quot;sowing the seeds of hatred and division&quot; and recalled the atmosphere segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace fostered in the 1960s; and Democratic Rep. John Murtha of Pennsylvania, who referred to the western part of his state as &quot;a racist area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among GOP allies: a California group, which distributed anti-Obama literature with stereotypical black America images of a watermelon, ribs and a bucket of fried chicken. Another group put Obama's incendiary black former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, in a TV ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show Obama leading nationally and in key battlegrounds little more than two weeks before the Nov. 4 election. He's already made history as the first black nominee of a major political party, and his candidacy has energized minority voters in ways never before seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the unknowns: Should Obama win the White House, will racism become a subtext throughout his tenure? Or does his presidency work to soothe emotions still raw four decades after the civil rights movement and nearly 150 years since the end of slavery?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race has always been in the background of the general election. Obama's campaign bristles at any suggestion of exploiting Obama's skin color; McCain's advisers deeply fear being called racists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue boiled up over the summer. Obama said Republicans would try to scare voters by saying &quot;he doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills.&quot; McCain's campaign, quick to counter any notion of racism, accused Obama of playing the race card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent AP-Yahoo News poll found that 40 percent of all white Americans hold at least a partly negative view toward blacks. The survey indicated that racial misgivings could cost Obama the White House if the election is close.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 733.08 points, or 7.8 percent, to 8,577.91. The S&amp;P 500 finished down 90.17 points, or 9.03 percent, to 907.84. The tech-heavy Nasdaq bled 150.68 points, or 8.47 percent, to 1,628.33. The second straight day of declines erased Monday's striking increases. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech to the Economic Club of New York that was followed by an unusual and frank question-and-answer session, Bernanke signaled that the U.S. economy is sure to get worse, hinted at further interest-rate cuts and implicitly criticized the economic-rescue plans that both major presidential candidates are touting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later the Fed released its Beige Book, a report from its 12 district banks on economic conditions around the country. All 12 reported worsening conditions, yet another indicator that the economy appears to be in recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Consumer spending was weak in nearly all districts. Consumers continued to pull back on big-ticket items, including autos. Several districts reported that reduced credit availability was restraining auto sales. Tourism was weaker, particularly lower domestic travel,&quot; Brian Bethune, an economist with the forecaster Global Insight, said in a research note on the Beige Book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Manufacturing activity moved lower in most districts, and there were greater concerns about the economic outlook. Autos and building materials continued to report weak demand conditions, and hurricanes disrupted oil and gas production,&quot; Bethune reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales fell 1.2 percent in September. That was almost twice the consensus expectation and another clear sign, along with big September job losses, that the economy skidded to a halt as the global financial crisis worsened last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernanke's speech focused on the economic outlook. He suggested that U.S. exports, which had helped keep growth going for much of the year, now are poised to fall as a global slowdown unfolds. He also hinted that last week's coordinated trans-Atlantic half-point reduction in interest rates left room to cut even further. The Fed's benchmark federal funds rate now stands at 1.5 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under questioning, Bernanke answered with candor unusual for a man whose job usually requires him to be vague in order to avoid spooking the markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to compare today with the handling of the Great Depression, Bernanke, a scholar on the period, said that Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal fiscal stimulus failed to end the troubles. Roosevelt, however, didn't take office until three and a half years after the stock market crashed in 1929.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Implicit in that answer was this view: The stimulus spending suggested by Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama or the tax cuts proposed by Republican candidate John McCain are unlikely to end the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think contemporary scholarship argues that, at least in the case of the United States, fiscal policy was not the critical element, unless you count World War II, which obviously mobilized the entire economy,&quot; Bernanke said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hard lesson being learned now, he said, is that monetary policy - the use of interest rates to accelerate or decelerate the economy's growth as well as the Fed's aggressive push to recapitalize banks with easy loans - has its limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We reached a point ... where the situation required additional firepower,&quot; Bernanke said, referring to the $700 billion rescue plan that Congress authorized. He added that &quot;monetary policy ultimately cannot always solve the problems, and you do sometimes need fiscal or financial intervention, and we're getting that currently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current law has tied the Fed's hands at times, Bernanke said. He cited last month's bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers. The Fed did everything possible to save Lehman, he said, but because it was an investment bank not subject to commercial banking laws, it couldn't qualify for the same kind of government rescue as Charlotte, N.C.-based national bank Wachovia, which sold itself to Wells Fargo this month after a silent run on it by fleeing depositors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Bear Stearns, another investment bank, fell on hard times in March, the Fed was able to broker its sale to J.P. Morgan Chase because Bear had adequate collateral to offer in exchange for Fed lending. There was no such collateral available with Lehman, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lehman was not allowed to fail,&quot; Bernanke said, refuting suggestions by European leaders that he'd done just that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. policymakers must ask, he said, how to prevent a replay of inflated asset prices such as those seen during the dot-com bubble in tech stocks of the late '90s and the subsequent housing bubble. Whether or not he meant to point fingers at his predecessor, these inflated prices occurred on the watch of former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who argued that it was the role of the market, not the Fed, to prick asset-price bubbles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously the last decade has shown that bursting bubbles can be an extraordinarily dangerous and costly phenomenon for the economy, and there is no doubt that as we emerge from the current crisis that we're all going to look at that issue and what can be done about it,&quot; Bernanke said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He suggested that a new supervisory and regulatory structure is needed, a rare move for a Fed chairman. Lawmakers must decide whether monetary policy or supervisory regulation should be the leading approach to prevent financial meltdowns, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do believe the latter does have a significant role to play in constraining excessive leverage, excessive risk taking and the other elements that lead to bubbles,&quot; Bernanke said, laying blame for today's crisis squarely on Wall Street investment banks that were allowed to borrow huge amounts to make risky investments with scant supervision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernanke also said there were now risks to the global financial system from unregulated credit default swaps. These are insurancelike products that allow big investors to hedge against potential losses. The market for swaps is thought to total $55 trillion, yet it's a &quot;dark market,&quot; unregulated and without transparency, amounting to nothing more than contracts between two sophisticated parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Credit default swaps are not traded on an exchange. They aren't traded through a central counterparty, which means if one of those firms fails, among the consequences would be that the banks and others who had purchased credit insurance would be forced to write down tens of billions of dollars of value,&quot; Bernanke said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hempstead, N.Y. | John McCain assailed Barack Obama's character and campaign positions on taxes, abortion and more Wednesday night, hoping to transform their final presidential debate into a launching pad for a political comeback. &quot;You didn't tell the American people the truth,&quot; he charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unruffled, and ahead in the polls, Obama parried each charge, and leveled a few of his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One hundred percent, John, of your ads, 100 percent of them have been negative,&quot; Obama shot back in an uncommonly personal debate less than three weeks from Election Day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not true,&quot; McCain retorted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It absolutely is true,&quot; said Obama, seeking the last word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is currently running all negative ads, according to a study by the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But he has run a number of positive ads during the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 90-minute encounter, at a round table at Hofstra University, was their third debate, and marked the beginning of a 20-day sprint to Election Day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama leads in the national polls and in surveys in many battleground states, an advantage built in the weeks since the nation stumbled into the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With few exceptions, the campaign is being waged in states that voted Republican in 2004 - Virginia, Colorado, Iowa - and in many of them, Obama holds a lead in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain played the aggressor from the opening moments of the debate, accusing Obama of waging class warfare by seeking tax increases that would &quot;spread the wealth around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator also demanded to know the full extent of Obama's relationship with William Ayers, a 1960s-era terrorist, and the Democrat's ties with ACORN, a liberal group accused of violating federal law as it seeks to register voters. And he insisted Obama disavow last week's remarks by Rep. John Lewis, a Democrat, who accused the Republican ticket of playing racial politics along the same lines as segregationists of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Struggling to escape the political drag of an unpopular Republican incumbent, McCain also said, &quot;Sen. Obama, I am not President Bush. ... You wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama returned each volley, and brushed aside McCain's claim to full political independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I've occasionally mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people - on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities - you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's allegation that Obama had not leveled with the public involved the Illinois senator's decision to forgo public financing for his campaign in favor of raising his own funds. As a result, he has far outraised McCain, although the difference has been somewhat neutralized by an advantage the Republican National Committee holds over the Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He signed a piece of paper&quot; earlier in the campaign pledging to accept federal financing, McCain said. He added that Obama's campaign has spent more money than any since Watergate, a reference to President Nixon's re-election, a campaign that later became synonymous with scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama made no immediate response to McCain's assertion about having signed a pledge to accept federal campaign funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about running mates, both presidential candidates said Democrat Joseph Biden was qualified to become president, although McCain added this qualifier: &quot;in many respects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain passed up a chance to say his own running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, was qualified to sit in the Oval Office, though he praised her performance as governor and noted her work on behalf of special needs children. The Palins have a son born earlier this year with Down syndrome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama sidestepped when asked about Palin's qualifications to serve as president, and he, too, praised her advocacy for special needs children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he quickly sought to turn the issue to his advantage by noting McCain favors a spending freeze on government programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding if we're going to get serious in terms of research. ... And if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, we're not going to be able to do it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to differences on taxes and spending, McCain said Obama advocated trade policies that recalled those of Herbert Hoover, who presided over the start of the Great Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has called for tougher provisions in trade negotiations, arguing that is necessary to avoid undercutting the wages paid to American workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also said Obama has aligned himself with &quot;the extreme aspect of the pro-abortion movement in America&quot; and had voted present while in the Illinois Legislature on a measure to ban one type of procedure late in a woman's pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said the bill would have undermined Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that granted abortion rights, and had been opposed by the Illinois Medical Society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there's an exception for the mother's health and life, and this did not contain that exception,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain sarcastically paid tribute to &quot;the eloquence of Senator Obama. He's (for) health for the mother. You know, that's been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's allegation about class warfare stemmed from one of Obama's campaign appearances last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ohio on Sunday, Obama was approached by a man who said, &quot;Your new tax plan's going to tax me more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A video clip caught by Fox News shows Obama replying, &quot;It's not that I want to punish your success. I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you, that they've got a chance at success, too. And I think that when we spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain referred repeatedly to that voter, Joe Wurzelbacher, a plumber from Toledo, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wurzelbacher watched Wednesday night's debate and said he still thinks Obama's plan would keep him from buying the small business that employs him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's reference to Ayers reprised campaign commercials he has run to try and raise doubts about Obama's fitness to serve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayers, who was a member of the violent Weather Underground in the 1960s, hosted a meet-the-candidate event for Obama in an Illinois race many years later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Sen. McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me,&quot; Obama replied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">769 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're in the middle of a financial crisis, but most economists say there is a broader economic crisis still to come. The unemployment rate will shoot upward. Companies will go bankrupt. Commercial real estate values will decline. Credit card defaults will rise. The nonprofit sector will be hammered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time the recession is in full force, Democrats will probably be running the government. Barack Obama will probably be in the White House. Democrats will have a comfortable majority in the House and will control between 56 and 60 seats in the Senate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party will inherit big deficits. David Leonhardt, my colleague at The New York Times, estimates that the deficit will sit at about $750 billion next year, or 5 percent of GDP. Democrats had promised to pay for new spending with compensatory cuts, but the economic crisis will dissolve pay-as-you-go vows. New federal spending will come in four streams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, there will be the bailouts. Once upon a time, there were concerns about moral hazard. But resistance to corporate bailouts is gone. If Bear Stearns and AIG can get bailouts, then so can car companies, airlines and other corporations with direct links to Main Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, there will be more stimulus packages. The first stimulus package, passed early this year, was a failure because people spent only 10 percent to 20 percent of the rebate dollars and saved the rest. Martin Feldstein of Harvard calculates the package added $80 billion to the national debt while producing less than $20 billion in consumer spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi promises another package, and it will pass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, we're in for a Keynesian renaissance. The Fed has little room to stimulate the economy, so Democrats will use government outlays to boost consumption. Nouriel Roubini of New York University argues that the economy will need a $300 billion fiscal stimulus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has already promised a clean energy/jobs program that would cost $150 billion over 10 years. He's vowed $60 billion in infrastructure spending over the same period. He promises a range of tax credits - $4,000 a year for college tuition, up to $3,000 for child care, $7,000 for a clean car, a mortgage tax credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourth, there will be tax cuts. On Monday, Obama promised new tax subsidies to small business, which could cost tens of billions. That's on top of his promise to cut taxes for 95 percent of American households. His tax plans aren't as irresponsible as John McCain's, but the Tax Policy Center still says they would reduce revenues by $2.8 trillion over the next decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, there will be a health care plan. In 1960, health care consumed 5 percent of GDP. By 2025, it will consume 25 percent. In the face of these rising costs, Obama will spend billions more to widen coverage. Obama's plan has many virtues, but the cost-saving measures are chimerical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you add it all up, we're not talking about a deficit that is 5 percent of GDP, but something much, much, much larger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new situation will reopen old rifts in the Democratic Party. One the one side, liberals will argue (are already arguing) that it was deregulation and trickle-down economic policies that led us to this crisis. Fears of fiscal insolvency are overblown. Democrats should use their control of government and the economic crisis as a once-in-a-lifetime chance to make some overdue changes. Liberals will make a full-bore push for European-style economic policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the remaining moderates will argue that it was excess and debt that created this economic crisis. They will argue (are arguing) that it is perfectly legitimate to increase the deficit with stimulus programs during a recession, but that these programs need to be carefully targeted and should sunset as the crisis passes. The moderates will stress that the country still faces a ruinous insolvency crisis caused by entitlement burdens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama will try to straddle the two camps - he seems to sympathize with both sides - but the liberals will win. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past decade, liberals have mounted a campaign against Robert Rubin-style economic policies, and they control the congressional power centers. Even if he's so inclined, it's difficult for a president to overrule the committee chairmen of his own party. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we're going to see, in short, is the Gingrich revolution in reverse and on steroids. There will be a big increase in spending and deficits. In normal times, moderates could have restrained the zeal on the left. In an economic crisis, not a chance. The over-reach is coming. The backlash is next.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When John McCain and Barack Obama set off to run for president, they promised this would not be politics as usual. And given their political track records, there was reason to believe that. They have been unconventional politicians. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This campaign, though, looks very conventional at the moment. It's getting negative. No, scratch that. It's getting downright nasty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain warns of Obama's &quot;blind ambition&quot; and says Obama is &quot;too risky for America.&quot; Sarah Palin says Obama &quot;pals around with terrorists.&quot; Obama says that McCain is &quot;erratic in a crisis&quot; and &quot;a risk we just can't afford to take.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chicago Tribune had an interesting story on Friday that sought to quantify the negative campaigning. ... And McCain's is leading the game. A review by University of Wisconsin television ad-watchers found that &quot;nearly 100 percent of the McCain campaign's advertisements were negative&quot; during the week of Sept. 28 to Oct. 4. That compared with 34 percent of Obama's ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Widen the lens and you find that since the start of the general election campaign, 73 percent of McCain's ads and 61 percent of Obama's have been negative, the same researchers found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of this is to be expected. Political pros will tell you that negative campaigning is employed for one reason: it works. And it may work especially well this year, when a lot of voters are angry and distrustful of politicians. ... As Chris Lehane, a Democratic consultant, told a reporter: &quot;At the end of the day, campaigns are campaigns. In the last five days, it always comes down to a knife fight in a telephone booth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some McCain-Palin campaign events have turned truly ugly. There's enough fear in the nation. It doesn't need a presidential campaign that stokes more. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are decent and honorable men. They need to appeal to the best instincts of America, not the worst.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convicted felon Tony Rezko. Unrepentant terrorist Bill Ayers. And the race-baiting Rev. Jeremiah Wright. It is hard to think of any presidential candidate before Barack Obama sporting associations with three more execrable characters. Yet let the McCain campaign raise the issue, and the mainstream media begin fulminating about dirty campaigning tinged with racism and McCarthyite guilt by association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But associations are important. They provide a significant insight into character. They are particularly relevant in relation to a potential president as new, unknown, opaque and self-contained as Obama. With the economy overshadowing everything, it may be too late politically to be raising this issue. But that does not make it, as conventional wisdom holds, in any way illegitimate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has only himself to blame for the bad timing. He should months ago have begun challenging Obama's associations, before the economic meltdown allowed the Obama campaign (and the mainstream media, which is to say the same thing) to dismiss the charges as an act of desperation by the trailing candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain had his chance back in April when the North Carolina Republican Party ran a gubernatorial campaign ad that included the linking of Obama with Jeremiah Wright. The ad was duly denounced by The New York Times and other deep thinkers as racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was patently absurd. Had any white presidential candidate had a close 20-year association with a white preacher overtly spreading race hatred from the pulpit, that candidate would have been not just deemed unfit for office but written out of polite society entirely. Nonetheless, John McCain, with his overflowing sense of personal rectitude, joined the braying mob in denouncing that perfectly legitimate ad. In doing so, McCain unilaterally disarmed himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's political career was launched with Ayers giving him a fundraiser in his living room. If a Republican candidate had launched his political career at the home of an abortion-clinic bomber - even a repentant one - he would not have been able to run for dogcatcher in Podunk. And Ayers shows no remorse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do I think Obama is as corrupt as Rezko? Or shares Wright's angry racism or Ayers' unreconstructed 1960s radicalism? No. But that does not make these associations irrelevant. They tell us two important things about Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, his cynicism and ruthlessness. He found these men useful, and use them he did. Would you attend a church whose pastor was spreading racial animosity from the pulpit? Would you even shake hands with - let alone serve on two boards with - an unrepentant terrorist? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Americans would not. Yet Obama did, if not out of conviction, then out of expediency. He was a young man on the make, an unknown outsider working his way into Chicago politics. He played the game with everyone, without qualms and with obvious success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is not the first politician to rise through a corrupt political machine. But he is one of the rare few to then have the audacity to present himself as a transcendent healer, hovering above and bringing redemption to the &quot;old politics&quot; - of the kind he had enthusiastically embraced in Chicago in the service of his own ambition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, and even more disturbing, is the window these associations give on Obama's core beliefs. He doesn't share Wright's poisonous views of race nor Ayers' views, past and present, about the evil that is American society. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">But Obama clearly did not consider these views beyond the pale.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many years he swam easily and without protest in that fetid pond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now. Today, on the threshold of the presidency, Obama concedes the odiousness of these associations, which is why he has severed them. But for the years in which he sat in Wright's pews and shared common purpose on boards with Ayers, Obama considered them a legitimate, indeed unremarkable, part of social discourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you? Obama is a man of first-class intellect and first-class temperament. But his character remains highly suspect. There is a difference between temperament and character. Equanimity is a virtue. Tolerance of the obscene is not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Columbus, Ohio | Barack Obama is playing it safe. Leading in polls with 25 days to Election Day, the Democratic nominee is offering careful proposals to address the economic crisis while letting allies respond to John McCain's sharpest charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama now reads his speeches from teleprompters, reducing the chance of gaffes. He has not held a press conference in two weeks, although he has done several one-on-one interviews with national and local reporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He now refers to Republican John McCain as  &quot;my opponent&quot; more often than by name. And he offers carefully limited, comparatively noncontroversial remedies for the nation's financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publicly, Obama's aides say he keeps a calm demeanor and measured tone because he doesn't want to fuel the anguish and panic caused by the economic meltdown. Privately, they acknowledge there is no desire to shake up a campaign dynamic that is inching him closer to the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't like to yell,&quot; Obama told more than 10,000 people in Columbus on Friday, his fifth large rally in hotly contested Ohio in two days. He was referring to a sound-system glitch, but it could have been a metaphor for his home-stretch strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He's responding just right, and the polls are reflecting it,&quot; said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who campaigned with Obama this week and helped lead the counterattacks against McCain. When GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin spoke in Ohio on Thursday, Brown said, she spent too much time on issues such as Obama's ties to Vietnam War-era radical William Ayers, now a college professor in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People are saying, 'What about our jobs, what about the banking situation?' &quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday as McCain rolled out a new TV ad with his sharpest language yet about Ayers, the sharpest Democratic response came from Obama's running mate, Joe Biden, who told an audience in Springfield, Mo., that McCain is trying to  &quot;take the lowest road to the highest office in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is seeking a careful balance these days. He criticizes details of McCain's chief economic proposals, and he briefly and broadly disputes Republican attacks on his character, not getting into details. That seems to satisfy Democratic stalwarts who feel recent nominees were too slow to respond to character attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama devotes more time to explaining his own long-standing proposals for tax cuts and energy investments. On Friday, he added a temporary program of tax breaks, low-interest government and government-backed private loans for small businesses having trouble borrowing to meet payrolls, maintain inventories or expand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When this careful rhetoric threatened to bore crowds seeking rhetorical fireworks and when the economic problems turned into a crisis, he added more upbeat lines to his stump speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Now is not the time for fear,&quot; Obama said at every Ohio stop this week.  &quot;Now is the time for resolve and steady leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless asked, he does not mention McCain's and Palin's fiercest line of attack: that he has associated with Ayers, a former 1960s radical who helped found the violent Weather Underground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasingly, high-profile supporters take the sharper jabs at McCain before Obama comes on stage. On a sunny street with a few thousand people in Chillicothe, Ohio, on Friday, Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland played the part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The McCain-Palin campaign and some of their followers unfortunately want you to be afraid of Barack Obama,&quot; he said, adding that  &quot;others&quot; have spread untruths about the nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama does not leave all the heavy lifting to surrogates. Referring to McCain and Palin, he told the Chillicothe audience,  &quot;it's not hard to rile up a crowd by stoking anger and division.&quot; He said Americans want  &quot;someone who can lead this country&quot; in a time of economic crisis, not divide it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that McCain advisers have said their candidate will lose if the campaign's focus stays on the economy, Obama said:  &quot;So in the last couple of days, we've seen a barrage of nasty insinuations and attacks, and I'm sure we'll see much more over the next 25 days. We know what's coming. ... But it won't work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is playing it safe on policy, too, avoiding the far-reaching proposals that have caused McCain headaches. McCain's call this week for the government to buy bad home-loan mortgages at full face value and renegotiate them at a reduced price set off loud protests from conservatives and liberals alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's proposals have been more limited.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To keep officers, we must adjust their pay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently the Durham City Council voted in favor of raising the starting salary for new police officers by $4,000. While this raise is nice for the new guys, it left veteran officers who have worked long, hard hours trying to keep the city safe wondering why they were remaining in the Bull City when other agencies pay more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On average, the City of Durham loses officers at a rate of six per month and only replaces those officers at half that rate. If this trend continues, the department will soon be in the red as far as being fully staffed. While the raise in salary may help to decrease the amount of new officers that use the Durham police academy to get training, then go to better paying agencies, it has greatly upset the veteran officers who for the most part did not receive sufficient raises to address the problem of &quot;pay compression&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means salaries of new officers will quickly catch up with and may surpass those of officers who have put in several years of service. If the city wishes to retain its veteran officers, then it is imperative that the City Council address this situation now and make the necessary adjustments to the salaries of veteran officers to reflect their years of service.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've voted for Mayor Bill Bell twice, but he has received the last vote from me he will get because of his stance regarding police pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who follows this issue knows that Durham police are underpaid and understaffed. Our police force deserves better treatment from the City Council and its mayor. From Bell's public statements, it is obvious he won't go to bat for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City Council and downtown merchants' association can get all the bond money they want and build all the entertainment venues and baseball museums downtown they wish, but until the citizens feel safe going to downtown Durham, there will never be a profit earned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until we have sufficient officers on the street, downtown Durham will continue to be avoided after dark by folks with money to spend. Nor will there be appreciable riders on public transit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats to blame</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am getting sick of hearing the Democrats blaming the Bush Administration for the poor economy. I have news for them. The Iraq war funding is not the cause of the current financial situation. The fact of the matter is that the sub-prime leading/Fannie Mae mess is the primary problem and, who did we have overseeing these programs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least one of these individuals was having a homosexual relation with one of the executives at Fannie Mae. We even had one of our presidential candidates representing the ACORN group to put pressure (including court action) on the banking industry to increase the risky mortgage availability to people who could not possibly afford to make the payments on the mortgage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, lets get real folks. The primary cause of the bad economy is the result of programs put in place by Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. It appears that the Democrats who were responsible for overseeing the Fannie Mae situation were either receiving financial favors from Fannie Mae, romance, or both. How many members of the Democratic Congress received such favors or political contributions from Fannie Mae? Does anyone know the extent of this corruption?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't be conned</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among my fellow high school students (I'm 15), politics is generally treated as another sport to watch. You've got to choose your party and stick with it, cheering for your team and slighting the other team whenever you can. It's UNC vs. Duke, Yankees vs. Red Sox, Democrats vs. Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, this mindset seems to apply to adults as well. American politics are mainly a fa&acirc;??&szlig;ade, making it relatively simple for those with power to take advantage of the system by ripping us off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every message dealing with politics, whether a political ad or a letter to the editor, seems to fundamentally say the same thing. &quot;So-and-so is a liar and a moron, so you have to vote for his opponent!&quot; Excuse me, but just because someone is a bum you wouldn't trust with a nickel doesn't logically prove that someone else is the right person for the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voting for our representatives is a wonderful right. However, the point is not to get one of those cute &quot;I voted&quot; stickers. The act of voting, if one simply roots for one's team or is conned into choosing the lesser of two evils, does nothing but glorify this gigantic sports league.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Write in your preferred candidate, leave the space blank, or perhaps even run for office yourself. But by all means, say what you mean and mean what you say.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama can deliver</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This presidential election is perhaps the most pivotal of our lifetimes. It will determine if we have the courage as a country to make real change, to stand up to the status quo, to break barriers. Our choice will also determine if we have the resolve to solve the crises in our economy and with our energy supply, both of which are essential to our national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is clear that only one candidate -- Barack Obama -- has the vision and fortitude to tackle these immense problems by taking an environmental challenge like climate change and using its solution to spur economic recovery and ensure our national security. Obama understands that to solve our economic and energy crises, we will have to establish sound policy approaches that will simultaneously wean us off of foreign oil, address the challenge of climate change and stimulate our economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An approach that establishes a new market for greenhouse gas emissions will generate revenues that can pay for renewable energy incentives. It will also encourage spending on new technologies and renewable energy sources (both of which mean new homegrown jobs) and will discourage reliance on foreign oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is sound and forward-thinking policy that will propel us into a safe and prosperous future. And it is the type of policy and initiative that only Barack Obama can deliver, a man who showed courage by saying no to a gas tax holiday while his opponents pandered to politics.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | Already advertising at record levels, Barack Obama has scheduled a half-hour commercial for prime time on Oct. 29, six days before Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign officials said the campaign had secured a 30-minute block of time at 8 p.m. on CBS and NBC. CBS already was juggling its lineup to accommodate the Democratic presidential candidate, moving back an episode of &quot;The New Adventures of Old Christine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a vast purchase of commercial time is a multimillion-dollar expense, but Obama has been spending dramatically on ads, overshadowing rival John McCain and the Republican National Committee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Short political spots have been the traditional way for politicians to communicate with voters. But a prime-time, sitcom-length commercial would provide Obama an opportunity to make a closing argument to the entire country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a luxury to be able to afford that kind of communication,&quot; said Tad Devine, a Democratic media consultant who was a senior adviser to John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Obama has the ability to buy such a huge block of prime time is a testament to his prodigious fundraising. He has not been shy about spending it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, for instance, he spent $3.3 million in a single day of TV advertising. At that rate he will spend more than $90 million on ads through Election Day - more than all the money Republican rival John McCain has to spend on his entire fall campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's&nbsp;ad spending Monday totaled about $900,000 and the Republican National Committee weighed in with about $700,000 worth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All whopping numbers, but the disparity between Obama and the Republicans is so wide that it has allowed Obama to spend in more states than  McCain, to appear more frequently in key markets and to diversify his message by both attacking McCain and promoting his own personal story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With national and state polls showing him building a broader lead over McCain, Obama has switched to a more positive pitch. Last week, only 34 percent of his ads attacked McCain directly while virtually all of McCain's ads attacked Obama, according to a study by the Wisconsin Advertising Project at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Obama's most recent ads comes as McCain makes an issue of Obama's connections to 1960s radical Bill Ayers and as McCain's running mate, Sarah Plain, argues that Obama &quot;is not a man who sees America like you and I see America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad bespeaks Americana. In it, Obama recalls being a child, sitting on his grandfather's shoulders and waving an American flag as they watched astronauts return from a splashdown. &quot;And my grandfather would say, 'Boy, Americans, we can do anything when we put our minds to it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad offers a direct response to Palin. But it also illustrates Obama's continuing need as an African American to reassure voters about his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the Republican National Committee will start running a TV ad in Indiana and Wisconsin seeking to sow doubts about Obama's political upbringing, linking him to Ayers and other Chicago figures. &quot;The Chicago Way. Shady politics. That's Barack Obama's training,&quot; the ad says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boosted by an economy in crisis and a saturation of advertising, Obama has built up his margins over McCain in Democratic-leaning battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania and Michigan. He has tilted Republican-leaning states such as Colorado and New Mexico toward his side. And he has created contests in such reliably Republican states as Indiana, Virginia and North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain stopped advertising in Michigan, Obama leads in Pennsylvania and he has the edge in Ohio.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | Wall Street bounced higher and lower Wednesday trying to make up its mind about an unprecedented coordinated interest rate cut by central banks around the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end it settled on a familiar feeling - fear - and plunged again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Reserve, desperately trying to jump-start the lending that keeps the U.S. economy moving, dropped its closely watched federal funds rate to 1.5 percent. The cut from 2 percent took the rate to its lowest level in more than four years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Central banks in England, China, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland and the European Central Bank also cut rates after a series of high-stakes phone calls over several days between Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Dow Jones industrial average lost another 189 points, or 2 percent, to close at 9,258. It was the sixth straight day of losses for the Dow. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The index has shed more than a third of its value, nearly 5,000 points, since its all-time high, set one year ago Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dow opened down more than 200 points. Within an hour, it was up almost as much. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A late morning sell-off gave way to an afternoon rally, and the Dow was ahead for the day in the last half-hour of trading - then took a dive at the close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day's losses were lighter for the Nasdaq composite index and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500. And Wall Street as a whole fared far better than Asia, where some stock exchanges were down 9 percent, and Europe, where some lost 5 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed acted in concert with the European Central Bank to make emergency interest rate cuts after the Sept. 11 terror attacks in 2001. But Wednesday's cuts were unprecedented with the number of nations that participated, the Fed said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For millions of Americans, the Fed's cut means borrowing money becomes cheaper. Home equity loans, credit cards and other floating-rate loans all fluctuate depending on what the Fed does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other banks cut their prime rate by half a point to 4.5 percent, also the lowest in more than four years, after the Fed announced its decision early Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fed watchers believe the central bank might cut rates further when it meets later this month, and perhaps again in December, in hopes of cushioning the blow if the United States falls into recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if the financial crisis was put to bed today, that would still leave the economy in a probable recession,&quot; said economist Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One day after a presidential debate that focused heavily on the economy, both major candidates embraced the Fed's action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain described the crisis as global.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House welcomed the cooperation among central banks to battle the crisis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's important and helpful that central banks are working in a coordinated way to deal with stress in the financial system,&quot; spokesman Tony Fratto said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even that may not break the panicky mindset that has gripped investors across the world as jobs evaporate and retirement savings dry up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks may still be inclined to hoard cash, and until they decide to lend again the crisis is not likely to let up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underlining the seriousness of the situation, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday also agreed to provide faltering insurance giant American International Group Inc. with another loan, $37.8 billion on top of the $85 billion it proffered the troubled company last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moves came as major American retailers turned in dismal sales figures for the third quarter - further proof that consumer spending, the lifeblood of the economy, is sputtering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The turmoil will not end quickly and significant challenges remain ahead,&quot; Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told reporters at a preview of meetings later this week of the finance officials of the Group of Seven major industrial countries, the 185-nation International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The global credit crisis was expected to be the major agenda item at those talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paulson spoke after Asian and European markets wrapped up a bleak day, with investors fleeing stocks and worrying that neither the Fed nor other central banks could move fast enough to stop the turmoil, even considering the $700 billion U.S. bailout of financial institutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the Jan. 3 Iowa caucuses, John McCain said he had learned two lessons: &quot;One, you can't buy an election in Iowa, and, two, negative campaigns don't work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now playing to a wider audience, the McCain campaign is apparently rethinking lesson number two. It must hope negative campaigns will work better in the other 49 states than they do in Iowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is sinking in the polls, and, with the nation focused on the economy, is casting about for a way to get back in the game. So the campaign has gone negative, with one ad opening with the question &quot;Who is Barack Obama?&quot;, and then calling the Democrat &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;dishonorable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reinforcing the theme, GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin resurrected Obama's acquaintance with 1960s domestic terrorist William Ayers and his friendship with his former pastor, Jeremiah Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't long ago when both McCain and Obama spoke airily of how 2008 could introduce a new, more elevated kind of politics in which the candidates treated each other with respect and stuck to the issues. It all seems kind of innocent and laughable now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama called the attacks &quot;smears&quot; and pledged to stay on the issues. Nevertheless, his campaign hit back with a video that dredged up McCain's involvement in the Keating savings and loan scandal in the 1980s. Obama's aides tryed to paint McCain as erratic and hot-headed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A not-so-subtle subtext of the &quot;Who is Obama?&quot; tactic -- and linking him to a terrorist -- is to imply he may be secretly Muslim, although he is a Christian. Duke sociologist Jen'nan Read pointed out this could backfire. Because the message is that Muslims can't be trusted, it risks alienating Muslim voters who, because of their conservative views on abortion and homosexuality, tend to vote Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But rather than be surprised by the negativity, we should have seen it coming. As Mark McKinnon, a former advisor to McCain, told The New York Times, &quot;There are not a lot of things we can count on these days. But the sun will rise. The sun will set. And presidential campaigns will go negative.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">San Jose, Calif. | YouTube made a splash last fall when CNN engaged the video-sharing Web site to show mainstream Americans posing questions to candidates in the presidential primaries. Now the &quot;social news&quot; site Digg is bidding to enter the national psyche as well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backed by a fresh round of $28.7 million in venture funding last month, San Francisco-based Digg is embarking on a major expansion that aims to substantially raise the profile and reach of the 4-year-old start-up that claims more than 30 million unique visitors a month. Plans call for expansion domestically and globally, adding several new languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad-supported Web operation, free to users, is a kind of information clearinghouse that encourages people to post content found online - from trenchant journalism to silly videos - and invites them to rank the items in terms of perceived significance or entertainment value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Digg Chief Executive Jay Adelson pointed out that CBS News recently aired a pre-recorded feature in which anchor Katie Couric separately asked presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain, &quot;When is it appropriate to lie to the American public?&quot; The question, as Couric noted, was selected by the Digg community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The query, Adelson said, was an example of Digg's ability to tap &quot;the wisdom of the crowd.&quot; In the future, the process may seem less like a novelty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The more people that get added to the Digg system,&quot; Adelson said, &quot;the better the crowd wisdom functions. It becomes more and more relevant the bigger we get.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many media sites that create original content enable readers to click on small icons of Digg and its rivals - such as Del.icio.us, Reddit and StumbleUpon - allowing users to post the articles to those Web communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet skepticism abounds about the significance of the rankings on Digg. Forrester Research analyst Jeremiah Owyang, who tracks social media, said Digg doesn't practice so-called  &quot;crowd sourcing&quot; so much as tapping its most ardent participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Om Malik of tech blog GigaOM cites sobering data from the online metrics firm Quantcast. &quot;Digg's traffic is showing signs of plateauing,&quot; Malik wrote last week. &quot;What's troubling is that a mere 1 percent of its users (who can be labeled addicts) are generating 32 percent of the visits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Digg's new funding, however, represents a vote of confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Digg has really sunk its teeth&quot; into an audience of hard-core Internet users, Owyang said. &quot;Now it's time to expand into other markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Nedra Pickler</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abington, Pa. | Democrat Barack Obama used word of the nation's worst monthly job loss in over five years Friday to argue the policies of his Republican opponents &quot;are killing jobs in America every single day.&quot; Republican John McCain retorted that Obama's tax and spending plans won't solve the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government reported employers cut 159,000 jobs last month, the ninth straight month of job losses. The crowd gathered to hear Obama at a Pennsylvania high school football field booed when he told them the numbers and again when he told them McCain recently said the economy is fundamentally strong and has made great progress under President Bush. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illinois senator encouraged voters to change the Republican leadership in the White House that he said hasn't worked. He disputed McCain running mate Sarah Palin's claim in a debate Thursday night that his own spending plan would be a job killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Sen. McCain and his running mate talk about job killing, that's something they know a thing or two about,&quot; Obama said. &quot;Because the policies they've supported and are supporting are killing jobs in America every single day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours later at a town hall meeting in Pueblo, Colo., McCain himself said Obama's plans would hurt the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He wants higher taxes, more government, higher spending, and frankly that record is not something which has been good for America, and we won't let it happen,&quot; McCain said. The McCain campaign launched a new national TV ad Friday repeating his criticisms of Obama's tax plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is proposing tax increases only for those earning more than $250,000 but would cut taxes for those making less - details that McCain and Palin don't mention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their dispute came as Congress approved a $700 billion measure to bail out the financial industry. Both campaigns said their candidates called lawmakers on behalf of the bill. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus credited Obama with changing their minds, including Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Reps. Elijah Cummings and Donna Edwards, both Maryland Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said, &quot;He's made a number of calls today. We are not releasing specifics at this time.&quot; But Republican Rep. Sue Myrick of North Carolina, who switched her vote to favor the measure, said she hadn't heard from McCain. &quot;They told me he was going to call me. He didn't,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters upon landing in Flagstaff, Ariz., McCain took credit for helping push the bailout through Congress. Last week he briefly rearranged his campaign schedule to go to Washington as lawmakers began considering the package. He left to debate Obama but returned last weekend before the first House vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm glad I suspended my campaign and went back to Washington to bring - to help bring - House Republicans to the table,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Congress' passage of the bailout, there was no indication the Wall Street crisis would give way to other campaign issues and more economic woes could be ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in battleground Colorado, McCain defended the bailout, which he voted for in the Senate on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator said he is a &quot;proud opponent of waste and pork barrel spending,&quot; possibly a reference to pet projects and sweeteners tucked into the rescue measure to win more votes after the House defeated it Monday with 133 Republicans and 95 Democrats voting no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I also have to tell you that the government has to step in at this time and save Main Street from the challenges and the disaster that's looming,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, a member of the town hall audience asked why the government is bailing out Wall Street first instead of helping individual homeowners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that a lot of people view this as a 'bailout for Wall Street.' I'm not interested in helping Wall Street in any way,&quot; McCain said. He said rescuing the financial industry will give Americans confidence in the economy and help stabilize the housing market, which would eventually benefit homeowners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that grim economic backdrop, Obama is seeking to solidify his lead in national and battleground state polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama planned to continue to use the economy   and McCain's 90 percent support for Bush in the Senate to hammer his opponent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's advisers argued that Palin's debate performance quieted GOP critics and reassured other skeptics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain advisers also hope Congress' approval of the bailout will help turn the page to other issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say McCain will go after Obama by emphasizing liberal positions Obama has taken in Senate votes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. LOUIS | Under intense scrutiny, Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin stood her ground Thursday night against a vastly more experienced Joe Biden, debating the economy, energy and global warming, then challenging him on Iraq, &quot;especially with your son in the National Guard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alaska governor also noted that Biden had once said Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama wasn't ready to be commander in chief, &quot;and I know again that you opposed the move that he made to try to cut off funding for the troops and I respect you for that.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden responded that John McCain, too, had voted against funding, and said the Republican presidential candidate had been  &quot;dead wrong on the fundamental issues relating to the conduct of the war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clash over Iraq was the most personal, and pointed, of the only vice presidential debate of the campaign, one in which Palin repeatedly cast herself as a non-Washington politician and part of a  &quot;team of mavericks&quot; ready to bring change to a country demanding it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Maverick he is not on the important, critical issues,&quot; Biden shot back, referring to McCain. And he said Obama was the true candidate of change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin, governor of her state for less than two years, faced enormous challenges as she walked onto the debate stage at Washington University. After five weeks as McCain's ticket-mate, her poll ratings have begun dropping as even some conservatives question her readiness for high public office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her solo campaign events are few, and she has drawn ridicule for some of her answers in the few interviews she has granted - including her claim that Alaska's proximity to Russia gives her an insight into foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the opening moments of the debate, Democrat Biden sought to make McCain out as a straight-ahead successor to an unpopular President Bush.  &quot;He voted four out of five times for George Bush's budget, which put us a half-trillion dollars in debt and over $4 trillion in debt since he got here,&quot; Biden said of McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In return, Palin accused Biden of reciting the past rather than looking to the future.  &quot;Americans are cravin' that straight talk&quot; that McCain offers, she said midway in the 90-minute debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With one month until the election, polls show Obama with a small but perceptible lead, and Republican officials said earlier in the day that McCain had decided to pull out of Michigan, conceding the state to the Democrats. At the same time, his own aides said the campaign may soon begin to advertise in Indiana - a state that has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After intense preparation - including two days at McCain's home in Sedona, Ariz., Palin made only one obvious stumble, when she twice referred to the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan as  &quot;Gen. McClellan.&quot; His name is David McKiernan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As is her custom on the campaign trail, she spoke in familiar terms, saying  &quot;betcha&quot; rather than  &quot;bet you&quot; and  &quot;gonna&quot; rather than  &quot;going to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also spoke to the home folks.  &quot;Here's a shout-out&quot; to third graders at Gladys Wood Elementary School in Alaska. She said they would all receive extra credit for watching the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Can I call you Joe?&quot; she asked Biden as they shook hands before taking their places behind identical lecterns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He readily agreed she could - and she used it to effect more than an hour later.  &quot;Say it ain't so, Joe,&quot; she said as she smilingly criticized him at one point for focusing his comments on the Bush administration rather than McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden's burden was not nearly as fundamental as hers. Although he has long had a reputation for long-windedness, he is a veteran of more than 35 years in the Senate, with a strong knowledge of foreign policy as well as domestic issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For much of the evening, the debate unfolded in traditional vice presidential fashion - the running mates praising their own presidential candidate and denigrating the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin said Obama had voted to raise taxes 94 times - an allegation that Biden disputed and then countered. By the same reckoning, he said, McCain voted  &quot;477 times to raise taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They clashed over energy policy, as well, when Palin said Obama's vote for a Bush administration-backed bill granted breaks to the oil industry. By contrast, she said that as governor, she had stood up to the same industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden said that in the past decade, McCain had voted  &quot;20 times against funding alternative energy sources and thinks, I guess, the only answer is drill, drill, drill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The chant is,  'drill, baby drill,&quot; Palin countered quickly, unwilling to yield to Biden on that issue - or any other.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain looked gravely out at the audience as he leveled one of dozens of charges against Democrat Barack Obama during the first presidential debate of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year,&quot; McCain said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That's not true, John. That's not true,&quot; said Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And that's just a fact,&quot; McCain said.  &quot;You can look it up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking it up, however, it is largely untrue -- especially the inference that Obama set out to squeeze more taxes from wage earners. Nonetheless, the charge has been a staple of McCain's campaign ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The ad continues McCain's pattern of misrepresenting Senator Barack Obama's tax proposals,&quot; the organization Factcheck.org said in an analysis. The claim comes from a March Senate vote on whether to continue President Bush's tax cuts; Obama's own plan includes no increases for anyone earning below $250,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, Friday's matchup between McCain and Obama was less a presidential debate than a pair of side-by-side, long-playing campaign ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, like ads, the claims and counterclaims had elements of truth and falsehood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iraq and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain assailed Obama's plan to withdraw troops from Iraq on a timetable and send them to Afghanstan. McCain said that Adm. Michael Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has suggested that Obama's plan  &quot;is dangerous for America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That is not the case,&quot; Obama said.  &quot;What he said was a precipitous withdrawal would be dangerous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mullen said on FOX News in March that a  &quot;precipitous withdrawal ... would concern me greatly.&quot; But Mullen also favors more troops for Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil profits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John - this is undeniable -- oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April, McCain proposed $195 billion in annual tax cuts, including a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. Obama did not mention that the corporate tax cut would apply to businesses across the board, not just oil companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business Taxes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who wants to cut corporate taxes, said that U.S. businesses currently pay the second-highest tax rates in the world. Obama countered that loopholes allow businesses to pay  &quot;one of the lowest tax rates in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both claims are substantially correct. Only Japan imposes a higher corporate tax rate than the United States. At the same time, companies are often able to escape U.S. taxes altogether. Two-thirds of U.S. corporations pay no federal income taxes, a government report found last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health care</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said:  &quot;I want to make sure that we're not handing the health care system over to the federal government, which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obama's health care plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Obama does call for an expanded role for government in regulating health care, he would maintain the existing private insurance system. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANCHORAGE, Alaska | Seven of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's top aides defied subpoenas for their testimony Friday into possible abuse of power by the governor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's Chief of Staff Mike Nizich and six other aides failed to appear at a legislative hearing into whether Palin abused her power when she fired her public safety commissioner this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alaska Senate Judiciary Chairman Hollis French, D-Anchorage, waited 30 minutes Friday before reading a statement that the witnesses could be found in contempt when the full Legislature convenes in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alaska Attorney General Talis Colberg filed a lawsuit on behalf of the seven state workers Thursday challenging the subpoenas. He claims the committee has no jurisdiction to issue subpoenas in the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kennedy makes trip to hospital</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOSTON | Sen. Edward Kennedy, who has brain cancer, was taken by ambulance to a hospital Friday near his Cape Cod vacation home after complaining of feeling ill but returned home a few hours later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement issued by the 76-year-old senator's office attributed the episode to a change in medications. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John Kerry said his fellow Massachusetts Democrat was well and planned to watch Monday evening's presidential debate between John McCain and Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank's deposit goof brings charge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALTOONA, Pa. | A man was charged with theft after a bank accused him of not returning more than $280,000 mistakenly deposited into his account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herbert Starbird, 57, was charged Tuesday with theft and receiving stolen property, police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He allegedly spent more than half of the $280,276 he found in his account last fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First Commonwealth Bank also has filed a civil suit against Starbird. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank seized what was left when it discovered the error and wants Starbird to return more than $150,000 still missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'No paper trail'  for Stevens home </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON | While reviewing expense reports for a 2000 construction project, a bookkeeper for Alaska oil services giant VECO Corp. asked for an explanation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who was this work for, she asked? Why was it performed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cryptic note she received back included the instruction, &quot;No paper trail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal prosecutors say the note, introduced as evidence Friday at Sen. Ted Stevens' corruption trial, was part of a scheme by Stevens and VECO founder Bill Allen to conceal more than $250,000 in home renovations and other gifts that the contractor bestowed on the Senate's longest-serving Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bookkeeper Cheryl Boomershine testified Friday that VECO employees submitted invoices and expense reports for a project located in Girdwood, a ski town south of Anchorage where VECO didn't normally work.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who's responsible for the panic of 2008?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the gathering legend, it's one man: former Sen. Phil Gramm, the ex-John McCain adviser who lamented &quot;a nation of whiners&quot; a few months ago and therefore is fit to have responsibility for one of the nation's worst financial crises heaped on his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gramm's gravest alleged sin is pushing the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley bank deregulation bill. Barack Obama has identified the legislation as ground zero of the financial implosion, the deregulatory predicate for Wall Street's excess. As a Texas conservative who afflicted liberaldom for years before decamping to Wall Street, Gramm is easy to vilify. That doesn't make the case against him any less unjust. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law allowed commercial and investment banks to consolidate, repealing the New Deal-era Glass-Steagall Act that prevented banks from offering customers insurance, investment or commercial banking services. Gramm-Leach-Bliley tore down the artificial walls between financial institutions. Was this the disastrous mistake that it is now portrayed as on the stump? No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One, Democrats in good standing supported the final bill. Robert Rubin and Larry Summers, Clinton Treasury officials whom Obama relies on for advice, supported it. Joe Biden voted for it, it passed the Senate with 90 votes, and President Clinton signed it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two, the bill was a foregone conclusion. Europe already had so-called universal banking in which financial institutions could undertake varied operations. U.S. banks were finding loopholes in the law to keep up with foreign competitors and increasingly bumped up against the 60-year-old regulatory constraints. The Gramm bill just blessed the world as it was already evolving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three, the legislation appears to have alleviated the current crisis rather than making it worse. Big, diversified financial institutions have been weathering the crunch better than anyone else and have occasionally swooped in to lessen the pain. Bank of America acquired Merrill Lynch, which would have been impossible prior to Gramm's deregulation. Otherwise, Merrill would either have gone under or been bailed out by the taxpayers. Similarly, J.P. Morgan wouldn't have taken over Bear Stearns, and Barclays Bank wouldn't be considering buying Lehman Brothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, we've witnessed the end of the era of the large investment bank, with the dramatic decision of the last two firms standing, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, to transform themselves into traditional bank holding companies. The investment-bank model of relying on short-term markets for funding was no longer workable. Instead, Goldman and Morgan will rely more on less risky sources of funding, as regular banks do. Would we really want a 1930s law saying, &quot;No, sorry, you have to remain pure investment banks and go bust&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The root of this crisis is subprime loans lavished on people who couldn't truly afford their homes. Gramm makes an unlikely villain here because he always opposed the rush to give marginal borrowers mortgages .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the very word &quot;deregulation&quot; that galls Gramm's critics. But Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were practically arms of the government and still did more than any other institution to spread the bad debt before requiring a bailout themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's certainly possible to fault lax regulation. The Securities and Exchange Commission's 2004 decision to allow the investment banks to double their leverage looks foolhardy. But the mistakes and mania that created this crisis can't be attributed to one man. In other words, Barack Obama and every other Democrat should lay off their scapegoat of the hour. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. 'Off with his head!' she said without even looking around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- &quot;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the pressure of the financial crisis, one presidential candidate is behaving like a flustered rookie playing in a league too high. It is not Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Channeling his inner Queen of Hearts, John McCain furiously, and apparently without even looking around at facts, said Chris Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, should be decapitated. This childish reflex provoked The Wall Street Journal to editorialize that &quot;McCain untethered&quot; - disconnected from knowledge and principle - had made a &quot;false and deeply unfair&quot; attack on Cox that was &quot;unpresidential&quot; and demonstrated that McCain &quot;doesn't understand what's happening on Wall Street any better than Barack Obama does.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To read the Journal's details about the depths of McCain's shallowness on the subject of Cox's chairmanship, see &quot;McCain's Scapegoat&quot; (Sept. 19). Then consider McCain's characteristic accusation that Cox &quot;has betrayed the public's trust.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps an old antagonism is involved in McCain's fact-free slander. His most conspicuous economic adviser is Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who previously headed the Congressional Budget Office. There he was an impediment to conservatives, including then-Congressman Cox, who as chairman of the Republican Policy Committee persistently tried and generally failed to enlist CBO support for &quot;dynamic scoring&quot; that would estimate the economic growth effects of proposed tax cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, McCain's smear - that Cox &quot;betrayed the public's trust&quot; - is a harbinger of a McCain presidency. For McCain, politics is always operatic, pitting people who agree with him against those who are &quot;corrupt&quot; or &quot;betray the public's trust,&quot; two categories that seem to be exhaustive. McCain's Manichaean worldview drove him to his signature legislative achievement, the McCain-Feingold law's restrictions on campaigning. Today, his campaign is creatively finding interstices in laws intended to restrict campaign giving and spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By a Gresham's Law of political discourse, McCain's Queen of Hearts intervention in the opaque financial crisis overshadowed a solid conservative complaint from the Republican Study Committee, chaired by Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas. In a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, the RSC decried the improvised torrent of bailouts as a &quot;dangerous and unmistakable precedent for the federal government both to be looked to and indeed relied upon to save private sector companies from the consequences of their poor economic decisions.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This letter, listing just $650 billion of the perhaps more than $1 trillion in new federal exposures to risk, was sent while McCain's campaign, characteristically substituting vehemence for coherence, was airing an ad warning that Obama favors &quot;massive government, billions in spending increases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political left always aims to expand the permeation of economic life by politics. Today, the efficient means to that end is government control of capital. So, is not McCain's party now conducting the most leftist administration in American history? The New Deal never acted so precipitously on such a scale. Treasury Secretary Paulson, asked about conservative complaints that his rescue program amounts to socialism, said, essentially: This is not socialism, this is necessary. That non sequitur might be politically necessary, but remember that government control of capital </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">is</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government control of capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On &quot;60 Minutes&quot; Sunday evening, McCain, saying &quot;this may sound a little unusual,&quot; said that he would like to replace Cox with Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic attorney general of New York who is the son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo. McCain explained that Cuomo has &quot;respect&quot; and &quot;prestige&quot; and could &quot;lend some bipartisanship.&quot; Conservatives have been warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatives who insist that electing McCain is crucial usually start, and increasingly end, by saying he would make excellent judicial selections. But the more one sees of his impulsive, intensely personal reactions to people and events, the less confidence one has that he would select judges by calm reflection and clear principles, having neither patience nor aptitude for either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is arguable that, because of his inexperience, Obama is not ready for the presidency. It is arguable that McCain, because of his boiling moralism and bottomless reservoir of certitudes, is not suited to the presidency. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a sad monument to the sleaziness of this presidential campaign: Almost one-third of voters &quot;know&quot; that Barack Obama is a Muslim or believe that he could be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, the political campaign to transform Obama into a Muslim is succeeding. The real loser as that happens isn't just Obama, but our entire political process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Pew Research Center survey released a few days ago found that only half of Americans correctly know that Obama is a Christian. Meanwhile, 13 percent of registered voters say that he is a Muslim, compared with 12 percent in June and 10 percent in March. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I've traveled around the country, particularly to my childhood home in rural Oregon, I've been struck by the number of people who ask something like: That Obama - is he really a Christian? Isn't he a Muslim or something? Didn't he take his oath of office on the Quran?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In conservative Christian circles and on Christian radio stations, there are even widespread theories that Obama just may be the Antichrist. Seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Green, of the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, says that about 10 percent of Americans believe we may be in the Book of Revelation's &quot;end times&quot; and are on the lookout for the Antichrist. A constant barrage of e-mail and broadcasts suggest that Obama just may be it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The online Red State Shop sells T-shirts, mugs and stickers exploiting the idea. Some shirts and stickers portray a large &quot;O&quot; with horns, above a caption: &quot;The Anti-Christ.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To his credit, McCain himself has never raised doubts about Obama's religion. But a McCain&nbsp;commercial last month mimicked the words and imagery of the best-selling Christian &quot;Left Behind&quot; book series in ways that would have set off alarm bells among evangelicals nervous about the Antichrist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain himself is not popular with evangelicals. But they will vote for him if they think the other guy may be on Satan's side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, of course, Obama took his oath on the Bible, not - as the rumors have it - on the Quran. He is far more active in church than McCain is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Just imagine for a moment if it were the black candidate in this election, rather than the white candidate, who was born in Central America, was an indifferent churchgoer, had graduated near the bottom of his university class, had dumped his first wife, had regularly displayed an explosive and profane temper, and had referred to the Pakistani-Iraqi border ... .)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is happening, I think, is this: Religious prejudice is becoming a proxy for racial prejudice. In public at least, it's not acceptable to express reservations about a candidate's skin color, so discomfort about race is sublimated into concerns about whether Obama is sufficiently Christian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is this campaign to &quot;otherize&quot; Obama. Nobody needs to point out that he is black, but there's a persistent effort to exaggerate other differences, to de-Americanize him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raising doubts about a candidate based on the religion of his grandfather is toxic and profoundly un-American, cracking the melting pot we emerged from. Someday people will look back at the innuendoes about Obama with the same disgust with which we regard the smears of Al Smith as a Catholic candidate in 1928.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm writing in part out of a sense of personal responsibility. Those who suggest that Obama is a Muslim - as if that in itself were wrong - regularly cite my own columns, especially an interview last year in which I asked him about Islam and his boyhood in Indonesia. In that interview, Obama praised the Arabic call to prayer as &quot;one of the prettiest sounds on earth at sunset,&quot; and he repeated the opening of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This should surprise no one: The call to prayer blasts from mosque loudspeakers five times a day, and Obama would have had to have been deaf not to learn the words as a child. But critics, like Jerome Corsi, whose book denouncing Obama, &quot;The Obama Nation,&quot; is No. 2 on the New York Times best-seller list, quote from that column to argue that Obama has mysterious ties to Islam. I feel a particular obligation not to let my own writing be twisted so as to inflame bigotry and xenophobia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists need to do more than call the play-by-play this election cycle. We also need to blow the whistle on such egregious fouls calculated to undermine the political process and magnify the ugliest prejudices that our nation has done so much to overcome.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With less than six weeks to go, the 2008 presidential race is just around the corner. The polls show the two major candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain, running neck and neck. Who would have imagined such a close race?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America is mired in an ugly and divisive war in Iraq. The economy remains stagnant. The deficit has reached a record high. The mortgage crisis threatens millions of homeowners. One out of every five Americans lacks decent health care. Tens of thousands of small businesses face bankruptcy. Dozens of major banks and savings and loans are in danger of collapse. Gas prices are soaring. The nation's infrastructure is crumbling. Thousands of small farmers are struggling to maintain their family farms. And parents are turning cartwheels to send their kids to college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would seem, would it not, that Obama should have an insurmountable lead in the polls? After all, the same polls show President Bush with record low approval ratings. Indeed, millions of Americans say they are sick and tired of politics as usual. And yet, as the recent primary season demonstrates, millions more yearn for bold leadership and political change. How else would you explain the tens of millions of new voters who trooped to the polls to vote for what they hoped would be a change in direction?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of this should portend an Obama landslide, right? Wrong. For millions of Americans, this election is not about personal philosophy, public policy or even political ideology. It is about race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several polls have shown, quite clearly, that nearly 20 percent of the electorate say they would not vote for an African-American presidential candidate for any reason. For these voters, race is the paramount issue in the 2008 presidential election. Am I surprised? No. Why? Because bigotry is alive and well in every corner of our nation. It defines who we are and how we view each other. It affects who gets what jobs, how much we are paid, where we live, what schools we send our kids to, whether we are able to purchase decent health care, and how we are treated by the justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racism permeates every aspect of American life. It is still America's dirty little non-secret. So why are we surprised by the closeness of the presidential race? Race has always decided the winners and losers in the American political system. What is surprising, however, are the record number of voters who are able to see beyond race -- who see this election as an opportunity to take back our country and reshape our future. Despite everything the Bush administration has done to undermine traditional American values, most Americans still believe in liberty, equality, opportunity and acceptance of diversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is, we are better than our leaders. Perhaps that is why we are so disillusioned by our government. Most Americans want to climb the shoulders of leaders who speak to our better selves. And despite Sen.McCain's claims to the contrary, this election is not about experience. It is about race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experience is a nebulous word. We ascribe our own meanings to it. For example, Sen. Obama received a juris doctorate from the Harvard Law School, served as a community organizer, taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago, practiced law for nearly a decade, served as a state senator in the Illinois Legislature, and today represents the people of that state in the United States Senate. Does this sound like a candidate who lacks experience? Hardly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what about Sen. McCain? He attended the U.S. Naval Academy, volunteered to serve in Vietnam, was shot down and taken prisoner, served in the U.S. House of Representatives from Arizona, and presently serves in the U.S. Senate. The two candidates come from very different places. But both have extensive experience in and out of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, it's not about experience. Despite the Arizona senator's claim, his record bespeaks a politician who has backed President Bush 90 percent of the time. A politician who has flip-flopped on the few issues over which he disagreed with the president, and a candidate who chose to link arms with the evangelicals and far-right wing of his party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If experience were really the issue, he would not have selected Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In truth, the 2008 presidential election is about race and racism. Hasn't the time come, at long last, where we can finally see beyond the &quot;color of one's skin to the content of one's character&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, we face a litany of challenges, far too many to list. Are we really willing to surrender the future to our baser instincts? The clock is ticking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe, just maybe, things will prove different this time. Once and for all, it is time for the American people to repudiate the politics of hate, bigotry, and extremism.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. How would a bailout of distressed mortages work?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Absent details, it's hard to say exactly. During the savings and loan crisis, the Resolution Trust Corp. acquired the defaulted mortgages, foreclosed real estate and other assets of nearly a thousand failed savings &amp; loans and slowly sold them off, restoring order and stability to the system. Sen. John McCain's proposal doesn't seem as sweeping, and it would not wait until banks failed. The new agency would work with troubled financial companies and help to identify problems. In extreme cases, the government could take control of the companies and their assets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. Who would pay?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. There clearly would be some exposure for taxpayers. The exact cost would depend on how many companies are  &quot;rescued&quot; or taken over, and how far home prices fall. Resolving the S&amp;L crisis took six years and $125 billion in taxpayer money - roughly equal to $200 billion in today's dollars. Some economists have suggested cleaning up the present mess could cost more than that. But McCain economic adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin suggested it might not be as expensive, because problems would be identified before failures occurred, unlike in the S&amp;L crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. Who is supporting such an approach?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. In addition to McCain's plan and consideration by the administration, such an approach is being advocated by some leading members of Congress as a more effective, and ultimately less expensive, way of dealing with the problem than the present piecemeal approach. Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, a top economic adviser to Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama, has backed such an approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. What has the government done so far to try to stabilize the worst financial turmoil since the Great Depression?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. The U.S. government has already taken actions that required more than $600 billion of taxpayers' money: Up to $200 billion overall was made available to mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when the government seized them earlier this month; insurer American International Group Inc. was given an $85 billion, two-year loan, in exchange for giving the government right to a nearly 80 percent stake in AIG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, as part of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s takeover of Bear Stearns Cos. in March, the Federal Reserve provided a $29 billion loan. And in a new  &quot;Hope for Homeowners&quot; program starting Oct. 1, the Federal Housing Administration can insure up to $300 billion in refinanced mortgages for troubled borrowers - if the existing investor voluntarily agrees to take a loss on the loan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raleigh | All of a sudden, North Carolina matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It hasn't for decades in presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Democrat Barack Obama made an aggressive play for this traditionally GOP state and polls showed the race tightening. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That forced Republican John McCain to defend his turf or risk ceding the Southern state - and its 15 electoral votes - to Democrats for the first time in 32 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, just seven weeks before the election, North Carolina has become a general-election battleground, one of 13 states where both candidates are competing with television commercials and campaign staff on the ground. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They clearly see the threat,&quot; Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said after McCain's campaign intensified its efforts here. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They can profess that they're not concerned. But their spending and their actions belie&quot; that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Schmidt, McCain's chief strategist, insists the campaign is unconcerned: &quot;It's just one more state where the Obama campaign has allowed its hubris to dictate spending decisions. John McCain will win North Carolina, and soon you will see the Obama camp withdraw from North Carolina like you have seen them withdraw from other states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public polling shows a competitive race, though private surveys for both Republicans and Democrats give McCain an edge of anywhere from 3 to 8 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Time/CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Wednesday showed the race virtually tied at 48 percent for McCain, 47 percent for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenge for Obama may have increased after McCain selected Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, a choice that has energized conservatives. At a recent Republican gathering in Cary for veterans, the mere mention of Palin's name drew thunderous applause while McCain's name elicited a tepid response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not that thrilled about McCain,&quot; said James Arscott, 66, a National Guard veteran and a Republican. &quot;That is, I wasn't thrilled about McCain until Sarah Palin came about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Democratic loyalists acknowledge that it is difficult to imagine North Carolina voting for Obama, who would be the country's first black president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would be stunned,&quot; said Tim Rohde, 51, a Democrat from Raleigh. &quot;But it would be amazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It takes 270 electoral votes to claim the White House. Typically, candidates compete for them in upward of two dozen states early in a general election only to see those that historically aren't swing states drop out of contention by the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposite has occurred with North Carolina. Look no further than the state's population spurt - and its origins - to understand why Obama thinks he has a shot this year, and why McCain isn't taking it for granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state has seen steady growth over the past four years as transplants from the more liberal Northeast were drawn to the region for jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White-collar workers have poured into Charlotte's financial hub in the south, while recent college graduates and their young families have been drawn to plentiful jobs and quality education in the academic Research Triangle encompassing Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retirees concerned about health care and the environment have settled on both sides of the state, from the eastern coastline to the western mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're a state that's changing, and we're a state that's growing,&quot; said Paul Shumaker, a Republican consultant based in Granite Falls. &quot;Everyone has to realize and take into account that we're rapidly evolving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added Gary Pearce, a Raleigh-based Democratic consultant: &quot;We have a black man that we can seriously talk about winning North Carolina. That's a huge change. The fact that he's competitive here says it all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter registration rolls illustrate the shifting tide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Board of Elections records show that Democratic registrations have risen 7 percent since the start of 2008, while Republican registrations grew about 1 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are now about 40 percent more Democrats than Republicans in North Carolina, although members of both state parties tend to be more conservative than their national counterparts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Registrations among blacks, a pivotal part of the Democratic base, are up almost 10 percent while white registrations are up 4 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of registrations for voters who don't claim a political party jumped 11 percent this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats control the North Carolina governor's office and have solid majorities in both legislative chambers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National races are different, though: Republicans have won the presidential vote for three decades and the GOP now holds both Senate seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican analysts express confidence that McCain will carry the state, and that rural blue-collar voters in the eastern flatlands and western mountains who typically vote Democratic in down-ballot races will come through in the end for the GOP nominee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These analysts recall how George W. Bush comfortably won the state twice, and how Democrats couldn't win it even when John Edwards, then a North Carolina senator, was the vice presidential nominee in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edwards did help shave a half-point off the GOP's 13-point margin of victory from 2000. Democrats hope a confluence of factors will help them make even bigger inroads this time, perhaps erasing the GOP's edge altogether. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say Obama's work during his hard-fought primary race with Hillary Rodham Clinton established a large local volunteer network and served to register, and ultimately turn out, unprecedented numbers of black and young voters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine for a minute that attending the Republican convention in St. Paul, sitting in a skybox overlooking the convention floor, were observers from Russia, Iran and Venezuela. And imagine for a minute what these observers would have been doing when Rudy Giuliani led the delegates in a chant of &quot;drill, baby, drill!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll tell you what they would have been doing: the Russian, Iranian and Venezuelan observers would have been up out of their seats, exchanging high-fives and joining in the chant louder than anyone in the hall - &quot;Yes! Yes! Drill, America, drill!&quot; - because an America that is focused first and foremost on drilling for oil is an America more focused on feeding its oil habit than kicking it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why would Republicans, the party of business, want to focus our country on breathing life into a 19th-century technology - fossil fuels - rather than giving birth to a 21st-century technology - renewable energy? As I have argued before, it reminds me of someone who, on the eve of the IT revolution - on the eve of PCs and the Internet - is pounding the table for America to make more IBM typewriters and carbon paper. &quot;Typewriters, baby, typewriters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, we're going to need oil for many years, but instead of exalting that - with &quot;drill, baby, drill&quot; - why not throw all our energy into innovating a whole new industry of clean power with the mantra &quot;invent, baby, invent&quot;? That is what a party committed to &quot;change&quot; would really be doing. As they say in Texas: &quot;If all you ever do is all you've ever done, then all you'll ever get is all you ever got.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I dwell on this issue because it is symbolic of the campaign that John McCain has decided to run. It's a campaign now built on turning everything possible into a cultural wedge issue - including even energy policy, no matter how stupid it makes the voters and no matter how much it might weaken America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I respected McCain's willingness to support the troop surge in Iraq, even if it was going to cost him the Republican nomination. Now the same guy, who would not sell his soul to win his party's nomination, is ready to sell every piece of his soul to win the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to disguise the fact that the core of his campaign is to continue the same Bush policies that have led 80 percent of the country to conclude we're on the wrong track, McCain has decided to play the culture-war card. Obama may be a bit professorial, but at least he is trying to unite the country to face the real issues rather than divide us over cultural differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Washington Post editorial on Thursday put it well: &quot;On a day when the Congressional Budget Office warned of looming deficits and a grim economic outlook, when the stock market faltered even in the wake of the government's rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, when President Bush discussed the road ahead in Iraq and Afghanistan, on what did the campaign of Sen. John McCain spend its energy? A conference call to denounce Sen. Barack Obama for using the phrase 'lipstick on a pig' and a new television ad accusing the Democrat of wanting to teach kindergartners about sex before they learn to read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some McCain supporters criticize Obama for not having the steel in his belly to use force in the dangerous world we live in today. Well, I know this: In order to use force, you have to have force. In order to exercise leverage, you have to have leverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know how much steel is in Obama's belly, but I do know that the issues he is focusing on in this campaign - improving education and health care, dealing with the deficit and forging a real energy policy based on building a whole new energy infrastructure - are the only way we can put steel back into America's spine. McCain, alas, has abandoned those issues for the culture-war strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who cares how much steel John McCain has in his gut when the steel that today holds up our bridges, railroads, nuclear reactors and other infrastructure is rusting? McCain talks about how he would build dozens of nuclear power plants. Oh, really? They go for $10 billion a pop. Where is the money going to come from? From lowering taxes? From banning abortions? From borrowing more from China? From having Sarah Palin &quot;reform&quot; Washington - as if she has any more clue how to do that than the first 100 names in the D.C. phonebook?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sorry, but there is no sustainable political/military power without economic power, and talking about one without the other is nonsense. Unless we make America the country most able to innovate, compete and win in the age of globalization, our leverage in the world will continue to slowly erode. Those are the issues this election needs to be about, because that is what the next four years need to be about.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Golden, Colo. | John McCain and Barack Obama traded increasingly barbed insults along with prescriptions for the ailing economy Tuesday as financial fears shoved aside lipstick on pigs and every other political issue in a blink with just weeks left in the long presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ad by Democrat Obama sneered: &quot;How can John McCain fix our economy if he doesn't understand it's broken?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getting even more personal, Republican McCain retorted:  &quot;Sen. Obama saw an economic crisis, and he's found a political opportunity. My friends, this is not a time for political opportunism; this is a time for leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain commented as he and running mate Sarah Palin addressed a rally late Tuesday in Vienna, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verbal dueling showed the importance both candidates put on the issue of the economy as the continuing financial meltdown on Wall Street has driven all other issues out of the news. Both campaigns now believe the candidate who manages to wrest control of the issue and gain voters' confidence could well be the next president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day, McCain called for a crisis commission, while Obama laughed that off as &quot;the oldest Washington stunt in the book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This isn't 9/11,&quot; Obama told a noisy crowd of more than 2,000 at the Colorado School of Mines, dismissing the idea of a need for study. &quot;We know how we got into this mess. What we need now is leadership that gets us out. I'll provide it. John McCain won't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, campaigning in Florida, promised reforms, too, to expose and end the &quot;reckless conduct, corruption and unbridled greed&quot; that he said had caused the financial crisis on Wall Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bewildering turmoil has shaken Americans' confidence, erased hundreds of billions of paper wealth for U.S. stockholders and led McCain and Obama to forsake other controversies and scramble back to the economy as the primary concern of voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential campaign had taken an odd turn to side issues - Alaska's &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot; and moose-hunting, Obama's crack about lipstick on a pig - after McCain's surprise pick of Alaska Gov. Palin as his running mate. There was a fascination with huge crowds attracted by Palin. But the collapse and merger of some of Wall Street's legendary companies forced a return to reality seven weeks before the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do the voters think?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Obama now are trusted equally on the economy, with 34 percent of voters naming each as the candidate who would do a better job dealing with what is easily the country's top worry, according to an Associated Press-Yahoo News poll conducted last week. Previously, Obama had had a solid advantage on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain wasn't sticking to economics on Tuesday. His comments grew more personal as the day wore on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He criticized the Illinois senator for taking donations from executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - the mortgage giants taken over by the government last week - and for putting former Fannie Mae CEO Jim Johnson in charge of his vice presidential search. The Arizona senator also chastised Obama for missing an economic stimulus vote, even though McCain himself missed a vote - and the possibility of breaking a Senate tie - a day earlier on a broader package. Obama voted for that package.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Wall Street and the nation's housing woes, Obama called the crisis &quot;the most serious financial situation in generations.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | Who's to blame?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government should have done more - or did it do too much? Alan Greenspan encouraged a housing boom that was destined to collapse. The White House and Congress were lax in overseeing the captains of finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People bought homes they couldn't afford. Investors eagerly bought mortgage-backed securities they didn't understand. Human nature was a guiding force in markets that were first driven by greed and then shaken by fear. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It turns out there's lots of blame to go around for the spreading financial crisis. And political hay to be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats accused the Bush administration on Monday of being inattentive to the growing financial storm. Presidential nominee Barack Obama blamed  &quot;the economic philosophy&quot; that he said Republican rival John McCain shares with Bush. Obama supports expanding the Federal Reserve's oversight powers and toughening rules for all financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who contends economic fundamentals are still sound, took aim at highly compensated Wall Street chieftains and an &quot;outdated and ineffective patchwork quilt&quot; of regulations. He, too, promised to replace those rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His running mate, Sarah Palin, had a broader target. The Alaska governor suggested that all of &quot;Washington&quot; had been dozing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you been asleep at the switch and ineffective?&quot; Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson was asked at a White House news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not looking back. I'm looking forward,&quot; he replied. He said the campaigns could &quot;fight it out&quot; and make their own cases to the American people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, financial markets around the world tumbled as the deepening U.S. financial crisis took its biggest casualties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In rapid-fire succession over the past three days: Investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings filed for bankruptcy protection, and fellow longtime Wall Street institution Merrill Lynch agreed to peddle itself in a fire sale to Bank of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the world's largest insurance company, American International Group Inc., faced possible restructuring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What had happened?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some seeds of the current crisis were planted in the late 1990s, when Congress and President Clinton reshaped the financial landscape. They removed Depression-era barriers between commercial banks and investment firms and allowed the creation of financial behemoths where, years later, the risks of underwriting risky subprime mortgages were somewhat hidden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A chief author of that law was Phil Gramm, then a Republican senator from Texas and until recently one of McCain's top economic advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain voted for a Senate version of the bill but did not vote on the final package. Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden voted against the Senate version but for the final compromise that was signed by Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Leach, an Iowan who was chairman of the House Banking Committee when Congress enacted the overhaul, said he believes the current problems stem mostly from lawmakers' unwillingness to more closely regulate either the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or investment banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That has led to a proliferation of &quot;new Wall Street instruments that came to be sliced and diced to the advantage of short-term profit-taking but long-term liabilities,&quot; Leach said in an interview. &quot;Wall Street became better at sales than at financial judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem will end up in the laps of the new president and the next Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proposals are afoot in both parties to clamp down with new regulations. Bush's treasury secretary, Paulson, is the architect of a proposed package of tougher regulations for investment banks, including giving more oversight powers to the Federal Reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paulson has been in the forefront of government efforts to keep the crisis from worsening, along with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. The two oversaw the government-sponsored sale of investment bank Bear Stearns to J.P. Morgan Chase in March and the U.S. seizure of Fannie and Freddie earlier this month.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | With chaos rocking financial markets, John McCain assailed &quot;greed and corruption&quot; on Wall Street and promised to clean it up, while Barack Obama blamed White House policies and said his opponent would only deliver more of the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential candidates struggled on Monday to seize control of the issue voters say is most important - the economy - with Republicans and Democrats saying the man who succeeds may well win the election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in a dizzying day of speeches and statements, neither White House hopeful offered any fresh ideas for turning things around. Instead each relied on the same vague, though vastly different, pitches he has sounded over the past few months for fixing what ails the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they didn't emphasize that they are part of the Congress that has done little to head off the crisis. McCain is a four-term Arizona senator, Obama a first-termer from Illinois.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bemoaning &quot;the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression,&quot; Democrat Obama faulted Republican McCain's domestic policy agenda as the same as President Bush's -  &quot;one that says we should just stick our heads in the sand and ignore economic problems until they spiral into crises.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain declared in a new TV ad, &quot;Our economy is in crisis. Only proven reformers John McCain and Sarah Palin can fix it&quot; - though he also told voters in Jacksonville, Fla., &quot;The fundamentals of our economy are strong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While presidents - and candidates of the party occupying the White House - often take credit for good economies and try to avoid blame for bad ones, financial crises nearly always have multiple causes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home loans became more affordable a few years ago when the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low. Politicians of all stripes encouraged home ownership. But lightly regulated financial outfits began slicing and dicing the resulting mortgages into securities and selling them to investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually, it all began collapsing, prices dropped, people started losing their homes and Wall Street went into a spin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the backdrop with some seven weeks left in the campaign, and both Obama and McCain are trying to find a message that resonates with anxious voters who are fretting about their retirement nest eggs, home mortgages and job security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courting working class voters who gave him grief in the Democratic primary, Obama sounded an I-feel-your-pain note.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama lamented Republican policies over eight years that he said &quot;encouraged outsized bonuses to CEOs while ignoring middle-class Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's words were sympathetic as well. &quot;America is in a crisis today,&quot; he said - then added: &quot;The economic crisis is not the fault of the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some in the markets, he said, &quot;have treated Wall Street like a casino.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While they focused on the topic that voters say matters most, the two campaigns  also continued to assail each other Monday on character issues. The Democratic vice presidential nominee, Joe Biden, said McCain was &quot;launching a low blow a day.&quot; McCain's campaign, in turn, accused Obama of spouting &quot;false talk about change&quot; and hurling insults to cover up his record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, even that increasingly personal griping took a back seat as Obama and McCain maneuvered for an edge on the economy with stocks tumbling as investors reacted to the latest Wall Street turmoil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has led for months on the question of who would best handle the economy, but some polls show that his advantage has dwindled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | In the latest campaign ad opposing him, Democratic congressional candidate Larry Kissell looks like he's standing on a dark and lonely stage as he declares his opposition to oil drilling off the coast of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That would be an especially fitting backdrop these days for drilling opponents on the campaign trail and in the halls of Congress. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was an acceptable stance on energy policy as recently as a few months ago has become a less tenable political position going into election season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's extraordinary how quickly the politics of the issue have changed,&quot; said Bill Holman, director of state policy at Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions. &quot;There was a bipartisan consensus in North Carolina for the last 20 years against offshore oil and gas development. And in the last few months, there's been a big shift among all the political leaders on the issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the current federal moratorium on drilling expiring Sept. 30, both the House and Senate are expected to take some action as soon as this week. At least some expansion of drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf is in play, likely off the coast of the Carolinas, Virginia and Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even the people who were totally against it and were saying 'never, ever' are now on board because they know the public wants it,&quot; said Rep. Sue Myrick, a Charlotte Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the politicians who haven't flipped completely on whether to drill off the East Coast are presenting much more nuanced views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kissell, the school teacher who is trying to oust Rep. Robin Hayes, a Republican, has a more complicated position than Hayes' ad allows. Kissell says his position is &quot;drill here, drill now,&quot; though by &quot;here&quot; he means the United States, not North Carolina. He wants oil companies to use the leases they already have in the Gulf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Elizabeth Dole, R-N.C., who as recently as June opposed drilling off North Carolina, is running an ad attacking her challenger, state Sen. Kay Hagan, D-Guilford, for the same position. Hagan's campaign says she would support drilling as part of a broader energy compromise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the national trail, chants of  &quot;drill, baby, drill&quot; greet the GOP presidential ticket. But even Sen. John McCain, the Republican nominee, opposed extending the area where drilling is allowed until recently. Aside from gas hitting $4 a gallon, another pivotal moment in the widespread political sea change was this summer when Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois suggested he wouldn't rule out expanded coastal drilling, said Roger Handberg, a political scientist at the University of Central Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., conceded to a modified position on drilling last week after Republicans spent most of August complaining about the Democratic majority's inaction on energy policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans are trying to elevate the issue because they think they're on the right side of public opinion, said Andrew Taylor, a political science professor at N.C. State University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A July survey of 648 likely N.C. voters by Public Policy Polling showed that 54 percent support drilling off the state's coast and 26 percent are opposed. But they're split evenly on whether drilling would have any immediate effect on gas prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said addressing the nation's energy future can't be boiled down into 30 seconds, but he doesn't object to the campaign ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not if it makes us do the right things,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1.7 billion acres of the Outer Continental Shelf, the continent's fringe of coastal waters, holds 60 percent of the nation's undiscovered oil and 40 percent of its natural gas, the federal Minerals Management Service estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But 85 percent of the shelf is off-limits to exploration because of congressional and presidential bans. The agency estimated last year that the East Coast holds 48 percent of the undiscovered natural gas and 21 percent of the oil. No active leases are now in place along the East Coast.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | Without offering a recommendation, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Sunday the government faces tough choices as it tries to help arrange a rescue of Lehman Brothers without using public money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cautioned that more major U.S. financial institutions may fail in the future, but the government should not protect them all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weight of the housing and credit crises, he added, &quot;is in the process of outstripping anything I've seen&quot; and has yet to run its course. &quot;It will continue to be a corrosive force until the price of homes in the United States stabilizes,&quot; perhaps next year, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immediate challenge for the Bush administration is resolving the fate of Lehman Brothers. Global fears intensified over the weekend that Lehman's collapse would stagger markets and undercut confidence in the U.S. financial system. The field of possible buyers has narrowed; how to finance the rescue was the key issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany's finance minister appealed for a resolution before Asian markets opened today, and more discussions involving officials from the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department were expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're trying to do it in a different manner&quot; than the Bear Stearns model, Greenspan noted. The Fed in March agreed to provide a loan of nearly $29 billion as part of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s takeover of the firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reason is obvious from seeing the effect of the bailout of Bear Stearns. When Bear Stearns was bailed out, it drew a line under that level of firm, implying that anything that was larger than that firm was capable of getting federal assistance,&quot; Greenspan said in a broadcast interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he said, &quot;if you generalize that, it is very clear that that is an unsustainable situation in the financial markets.&quot; The government cannot set a floor below these firms, Greenspan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential nominees, Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama, favor a private solution to Lehman's troubles, aides said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has acted aggressively in taking over the struggling mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in addition to the Bear Stearns rescue. The fallout from risky investments is dragging down companies such as American International Group Inc., the world's largest insurer, and Washington Mutual Inc., the nation's biggest savings bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's recognize that this is a once-in- a-half-century, probably once-in-a-century type of event&quot; - the worst &quot;by far&quot; in his career, Greenspan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no question that this is in the process of outstripping anything I've seen, and it still is not resolved and it still has a way to go. And indeed, it will continue to be a corrosive force until the price of homes in the United States stabilizes. That will induce a series of events around the globe which will stabilize the system,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His best guess for that happening is early 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With more financial companies under stress, Greenspan said he suspects more institutions will fail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But in and of itself, that does not need to be a problem. It depends on how it is handled and how the liquidations take place. And indeed we shouldn't try to protect every single institution. The ordinary course of financial change has winners and losers,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some types of institutions - financial ones in particular - are so essential to the economy that they cannot be allowed to fail, Greenspan said. He did not seem to put the auto industry in that category, declining to endorse a request by Detroit's car companies for Congress to provide money for a $25 billion loan program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot think of a list which is longer than those who would have similar such desires and justifications for government help,&quot; Greenspan said. Such assistance &quot;draws on our scarce savings supply,&quot; undermines growth and causes economic stagnation, a danger to a democracy, he added.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c9">Many voters not really so well informed</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing Democrats and Republicans alike agreed about in their vastly different conventions: The American voter will not only decide but decide wisely. But does the electorate really know what it's talking about? Plenty of things are hurting American democracy - gridlock, negative campaigning, special interests - but one factor lies at the root of all the others, and nobody dares to discuss it. American voters, who are hiring the people who'll run a superpower democracy, are grossly ignorant. Here are a few particularly bogus claims about their supposed savvy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Our voters are pretty smart. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You hear this one from politicians all the time, even John McCain, who promises straight talk, and Barack Obama, who claims that he's not a politician (by which he means that he'll tell people what they need to hear, not what they want to hear). But by every measure social scientists have devised, voters are spectacularly uninformed. They don't follow politics, and they don't know how their government works. According to an August 2006 Zogby poll, only two in five Americans know that we have three branches of government and can name them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political scientists Michael Delli Carpini and Scott Keeter, surveying a wide variety of polls measuring knowledge of history, report that fewer than half of all Americans know who Karl Marx was or which war the Battle of Bunker Hill was fought in. Worse, they found that just 49 percent of Americans know that the only country ever to use a nuclear weapon in a war is their own. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, many voters can tell you who's ahead and who's behind in the horse race. But most of what they know about the candidates' positions on the issues - and remember, our candidates are running to make policy, not talk about their biographies - derives from what voters learn from stupid and often misleading 30-second commercials, according to Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Bill O'Reilly's viewers are dumber than Jon Stewart's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberals wish. Democrats like to think that voters who sympathize with their views are smarter than those who vote Republican. But a 2007 Pew survey found that the knowledge level of viewers of the right-wing, blustery &quot;The O'Reilly Factor&quot; and the left-wing, snarky &quot;The Daily Show&quot; is comparable, with about 54 percent of the shows' politicized viewers scoring in the &quot;high knowledge&quot; category.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what about conservative talk-radio titan Rush Limbaugh's audience? Surely the ditto-heads are dumb, right? Actually, according to a survey by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, Rush's listeners are better educated and &quot;more knowledgeable about politics and social issues&quot; than the average voter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. If you just give Americans the facts, they'll be able to draw the right conclusions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, no. Many social scientists have long tried to downplay the ignorance of voters, arguing that the mental &quot;shortcuts&quot; voters use to make up for their lack of information work pretty well. But the evidence from the past few years proves that a majority can easily be bamboozled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, after months of unsubtle hinting from Bush administration officials, some 60 percent of Americans had come to believe that Iraq was behind the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, despite the absence of evidence for the claim, according to a series of surveys taken by the PIPA/Knowledge Networks poll. A year later, after the bipartisan, independent 9/11 Commission reported that Saddam Hussein had had nothing to do with al-Qaida's assaults on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, 50 percent of Americans still insisted that he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Voters today are smarter than they used to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, by most measures, voters today possess the same level of political knowledge as their parents and grandparents, and in some categories, they score lower. In the 1950s, only 10 percent of voters were incapable of citing any ways in which the two major parties differed, according to Thomas Patterson of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. By the 1970s, that number had jumped to nearly 30 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what makes these numbers deplorable: Education levels are far higher today than they were half a century ago, when social scientists first began surveying voter knowledge about politics. (In 1940, six in 10 Americans hadn't made it past the eighth grade.) Schooling alone doesn't translate into better educated voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Young voters are paying a lot of attention to the news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, no. Despite all the hoopla about young voters - the great hope of the future! - only one news story in 2001 drew the attention of a majority of them: 9/11. Some 60 percent of young voters told Pew researchers that they were following news about the attack closely. (Er, 40 percent</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">weren't?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) But none of the other stories that year seemed particularly interesting to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six years later, Pew again measured public knowledge of current events and found that the young (ages 18 to 29) &quot;know the least.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And some other statistics are even more alarming. How many young people read newspapers? Just 20 percent. But surely today's youth are getting their news from the Internet? Sorry. Only 11 percent of the young report that they regularly surf the Internet for news. Maybe Obama shouldn't be relying on savvy young voters after all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Shenkman, an associate professor of history at George Mason University, is the author of &quot;Just How Stupid Are We? Facing the Truth About the American Voter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dover, N.H. | Belittling John McCain as a relic of the disco age, Democrat Barack Obama pushed his campaign Friday to a new level of counter-punching &quot;on the issues that matter&quot; and directed his running mate to be tougher on their Republican opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes come as national polls find McCain and his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, pulling ahead of Obama and Joe Biden, prompting some jittery Democrats to implore them to fight back harder, and Obama's camp to pledge &quot;speed and ferocity&quot; in that effort. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I'm not going to be making up lies about John McCain,&quot; Obama told undecided voters in Dover. But he dipped into history, citing the oft-repeated phrase: &quot;If you don't stop lying about me, I'm going to have to start telling the truth about you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's what we're going to do,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dover resident Glenn Grasso asked Obama, &quot;When and how are you going to start fighting back against attack ads and the smear campaigns?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our ads have been pretty tough,&quot; Obama replied. &quot;I'm going to respond with the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has called Palin a &quot;phenomenon&quot; and acknowledged she's given her ticket a boost. But his aides say McCain is vulnerable to new criticisms because he has stretched the truth in recent comments and ads, and because Palin was shaky on foreign policy in an ABC News interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the first day of the rest of the campaign,&quot; Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said in a statement Friday. &quot;We will respond with speed and ferocity to John McCain's attacks and we will take the fight to him, but we will do it on the big issues that matter to the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plouffe said Biden &quot;will be integral to that effort, both in pushing back on the lies that we'll continue to see from our opponents, and in keeping the debate focused on delivering for everyday Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newest Obama TV ad gets personal and makes a none-too-subtle dig at McCain's age. It shows McCain at a hearing in the early 1980s, wearing giant glasses and an out-of-style suit. Other images include a disco ball, clunky phone, outdated computer and Rubik's Cube. &quot;Things have changed in the last 26 years,&quot; the announcer says, &quot;but McCain hasn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He admits he still doesn't know how to use a computer, can't send an e-mail, still doesn't understand the economy, and favors $200 billion in new tax cuts for corporations, but almost nothing for the middle class,&quot; the commercial says. McCain has said he relies on his wife and staff to work the computer for him and that he doesn't use e-mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The non-partisan Tax Policy Center says McCain's proposed corporate tax cuts would total about $231 billion over four years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says McCain's proposals for individual tax rates &quot;would primarily benefit those with very high incomes.&quot; It says many fewer households &quot;at the bottom of the income distribution would get tax cuts, and those tax cuts would be small as a share of after-tax income.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad closes with a photo of McCain standing with President Bush. &quot;After one president who was out of touch,&quot; the announcer says, &quot;we just can't afford more of the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Dover on Friday, Obama rebutted McCain's claims that he would raise taxes on working-class families. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I pledge that under my plan, no one making less than $250,000 a year will see any type of tax increase,&quot; he said. &quot;Not income tax, not capital gains taxes, not any kind of tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nearly 3,000 people who died when hijackers commandeered four passenger jets on Sept. 11, 2001, were remembered Thursday, as President Bush dedicated the first national memorial to the victims and the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates came together in a moment of silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a ceremony at the Pentagon, where 184 people were killed, Bush recalled how the &quot;doomed airliner plunged from the sky, split the rock and steel of this building, and changed our world forever.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His voice cracking, he noted that  there has not been another attack on our soil in 2,557 days&quot; and said he hoped that future generations of Americans with  &quot;no living memory&quot; of the attacks would conclude that  &quot;we did not tire, we did not falter and we did not fail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A memorial can never replace what those of you mourning a loved one lost,&quot; he told the audience, estimated at 15,000 people, that included many family members and friends of those who died at the Pentagon that day.  &quot;We pray that you will find some comfort amid the peace of these grounds. We pray that you will find strength in knowing that our nation will always grieve for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York City, where 2,751 people were killed when American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 slammed into the World Trade Center towers, causing the buildings to collapse, presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama walked with Mayor Michael Bloomberg and McCain's wife, Cindy, to a temporary memorial site. They laid roses at a reflecting pool at the base of Ground Zero and paused, bowing their heads in silence. They also greeted a group of survivors, first responders and family members of the people who died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In honor of the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil, both campaigns suspended television advertising for the day. The two men appeared Thursday night at Columbia University at a forum on national service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement posted on his campaign Web site, Obama recalled that on that tragic day,  &quot;Americans across our great country came together to stand with the families of the victims, to donate blood, to give to charity, and to say a prayer for our country. Let us renew that spirit of service and that sense of common purpose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before traveling to New York, McCain spoke at a remembrance ceremony at a field near Shanksville, Pa. - the spot where United Airlines Flight 93, with 40 passengers and crew aboard, crashed after what investigators have concluded was an uprising against the four hijackers. In his remarks, the Arizona senator noted that the plane's intended target was believed to be the U.S. Capitol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Hundreds, if not thousands, of people would have been at work in that building when that fateful moment occurred, and been destroyed along with a beautiful symbol of our freedom,&quot; he said.  &quot;They and, very possibly, I owe our lives to the passengers who summoned the courage and love necessary to deny our depraved and hateful enemies their terrible triumph.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Pentagon ceremony, former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who helped people flee the building after the crash, fought off tears as he talked about how  &quot;a great building became a battlefield.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He mourned the Pentagon employees who  &quot;one morning kissed their loved ones goodbye, went off to work and never came home,&quot; and the passengers on American Airlines Flight 77, which had left Washington Dulles International Airport barely an hour before the crash,  &quot;who in the last moments made phone calls to loved ones and prayed to the Almighty before their journey ended not far from where it began.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was here that their fates were truly merged forever,&quot; he said.  &quot;They fell side by side as Americans. And make no mistake, it was because they were Americans that they were killed here in this place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members and friends of those who died at the Pentagon took solace in the ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I just couldn't come back here right after it happened,&quot; said Pam Thornton, whose son died at the Pentagon.  &quot;Now, being here around everybody else who has had people they love die makes it easier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doris Brunelle, who lost her brother, said she hoped that the memorial reminds others of the sacrifice people made on that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Freedom is not free,&quot; she said while waiting to see her brother's bench.  &quot;We should thank God when we wake up in the morning that we are still free and alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to think of a presidential campaign with a wider chasm between the seriousness of the issues confronting the country and the triviality, so far anyway, of the political discourse. On a day when the Congressional Budget Office warned of looming deficits and a grim economic outlook, when the stock market faltered even in the wake of the government's rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, when President Bush discussed the road ahead in Iraq and Afghanistan, on what did the campaign of Sen. John McCain spend its energy? A conference call to denounce Sen. Barack Obama for using the phrase &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; and a television ad accusing the Democrat of wanting to teach kindergartners about sex ... </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's supposedly offending remark was not only not offensive - it also was not directed at Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. &quot;The other side, suddenly, they're saying 'we're for change too,' &quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;You can put lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig.&quot; With a woman on the ticket, apparently all references to cosmetics - or pork of the non-bridge variety, for that matter - are forbidden. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter that Mr. McCain used the lipstick-on-a-pig phrase himself, referring to (female) Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's health-care plan, or that (female) former McCain aide Torie Clarke wrote a book with that title. In the heat of a campaign, operatives will pounce on any misstep and play to the referees over any arguable foul. ... certainly the Obama campaign has not been above such tactics. But this cynical use of the gender card is unusually silly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The kindergarten sex ad, exhuming an argument that Republican Alan Keyes used against Mr. Obama in his 2004 Senate race, was equally ridiculous. &quot;Obama's one accomplishment?&quot; the narrator asks. &quot;Legislation to teach 'comprehensive sex education' - to kindergartners. Learning about sex before learning to read? Barack Obama: wrong on education. Wrong for your family.&quot; As a state senator, Mr. Obama voted for - though he did not sponsor - a measure that set out standards for non-mandatory sex and health education. It required that instruction be &quot;age and developmentally appropriate&quot; and allowed parents to have their children opt out. To call this an accomplishment seems a departure for a campaign that was insisting just last week that Mr. Obama had no legislation to his credit, conveniently ignoring his significant work on a lobbying reform bill. ... John McCain is a serious man who promised to wage a serious campaign. Win or lose, will he be able to look back on this one with pride? Right now, it's hard to see how.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | John McCain's campaign keeps telling voters that Sarah Palin opposed a federally funded Bridge to Nowhere when the facts are otherwise. It accuses Democrat Barack Obama of calling Palin a pig, which did not happen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in a political culture accustomed to truth-stretching, McCain's skirting of facts has stood out this week. It has infuriated and flustered Barack Obama's campaign, and campaign pros are watching to see how much voters disregard news reports noting factual holes in the claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That voter reaction could help determine who wins this presidential election and influence the strategies of future campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and his running mate Palin, the Alaska governor, were defiant this week in the face of fact-checking news reports. Day after day she said she had told Congress &quot;no thanks&quot; to the so-called Bridge to Nowhere, a rural Alaska project that was abandoned when critics challenged its costs and usefulness. For nearly a week, major news outlets had documented that Palin supported the bridge when running for governor in 2006, and she turned against it only after it became an embarrassment to the state and federal dollars had been pulled back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain-Palin campaign made at least three other aggressive claims this week that omitted key details or made dubious assumptions to criticize Obama. It equated lawmakers' requests for money for special projects with corruption, even though Palin has sought nearly $200 million in such &quot;earmarks&quot; this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It produced an Internet ad implying that Obama had called Palin a pig when he used a familiar phrase, which McCain also has used, about putting &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; to try to make a bad situation look better. McCain supporters said Obama was slyly alluding to Palin's description of herself as a pit bull in lipstick, but there was nothing in his remarks to support the claim. Obama accused the GOP campaign of &quot;lies and phony outrage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lipstick wars were fully engaged when the McCain campaign produced another ad saying Obama favored &quot;comprehensive sex education&quot; for kindergartners. The charge triggered the sort of headlines becoming increasingly common in major newspapers and wire services monitoring the factual content of political ads and speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ad on Sex Education Distorts Obama Policy,&quot; was the headline on a New York Time</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">s</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> article Thursday. &quot;McCain's 'Education' Spot is Dishonest, Deceptive,&quot; the Washington Post's &quot;Fact Checker&quot; article said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major news outlets have written such fact-checking articles for years. &quot;But in the last two election cycles, the very notion that the facts matter seems to be under assault,&quot; said Michael X. Delli Carpini, an authority on political ads at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication. &quot;Candidates and their consultants seem to have learned that as long as you don't back down from your charges or claims, they will stick in the minds of voters regardless of their accuracy, or at a minimum, what the truth is will remain murky, a matter of opinion rather than fact.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After frenzied back-to-back national conventions, tens of millions of Americans have now been introduced to Alaska's governor and reintroduced to two very different presidential candidates. No matter who is left standing in November, the election promises to be brutal and historic. Democrats must convince voters that on the issues, McCain-Palin will be a four-year extension of George W. Bush's reign. But they must consider other matters as well:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Change: Americans want change, but not uncertainty. Bush's 2004 mantra of &quot;Steady Leadership in Times of Change&quot; suggests that simplicity and clarity frequently trump complexity and nuance. Obama must be more pragmatic, concrete and less idealistic, cerebral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Shift gears: What worked in the Democratic primaries will not work in the general election. Undecided voters don't want to be part of a movement. Like millions of others, they are worried. They want problems addressed with practical solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Bread and butter: Voters want change from a leader they are comfortable with, one who understands their largely middle-class concerns. Obama's speeches, interviews, and Q A's must deal with bread-and-butter issues. His words must be focused, crisp, and down-to-earth. If like Gore and Kerry, he talks too much, too long--he'll lose. The &quot;best candidates&quot; often don't win elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Framing: Benefiting from the Sarah Palin phenomena, Republicans are controlling the national dialogue. The choice of Palin was among the most daring &quot;Hail Mary&quot; plays in modern American politics, but the gamble may not pay out. Democrats should not be distracted by Republican ploys, but should relentlessly drill home their key messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Visual imagery: Constantly link Bush's picture with McCain's in TV ads. Connect viewers' anxiety and disappointment to McCain. TV footage shows Bush-McCain praising each other, hugging, or laughing like old pals. Use the footage until Nov. 4 as Bush's failures are cited matter-of-factly. Most people don't want an extension of Bush policies. Voters must see McCain-Bush as interchangeable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Outside the box: The campaign must better anticipate the inventive, shape-shifting tactics of Steve Schmidt and his ad guru, Fred Davis. Their audacity and creativity have served them well. NYU journalism professor Jay Rosen recently described the McCain campaign's shameless ingenuity, &quot;When realities uncovered are directly in conflict with prior claims, consider the option of keeping the claims and breaking with reality.&quot; President Bush has mastered this technique; Schmidt and Davis are also skilled practitioners. Democrats must immediately challenge all Republican disassembling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* VP Palin: Don't attack Palin, but document her. At warp speed, the Republicans are molding her into a charismatic everywoman. Highlight her facts: against a woman's right to choose, against initiatives to address global warming, against progressive sex education for teenagers, for creationism in the classroom, etc., etc. As hordes of reporters are discovering in Alaska, her novice record is full of cronyism and political expediency. Her suitability for VP, a heartbeat away, is highly problematic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Words matter: There is great power in repeating a few truisms, such as &quot;Eight years of Bush is enough&quot; and &quot;McCain is a 90 percent Bush supporter.&quot; Use resonant phrases, not eloquent paragraphs. Highlight McCain's behavior and record as unpredictable, erratic, and risk-loving. Characterize Obama as steady, hopeful, smart and determined to change Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So will Democrats be disciplined and shrewd enough to win this imminently winnable race? Even with recounts and hanging chads, we should know by mid-December.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of us have ever lived through an election at a time when 80 percent of voters think the country is headed in the wrong direction. But now that we're in the thick of it, a few things are clear. From voters, the demand is: Surprise Me Most. For candidates, the lesson is: Weirdness Wins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last winter, Barack Obama succeeded by running a weird campaign. He wasn't just a normal politician aiming for office, he was going to cleanse the country of the baby-boom culture war mentality. In his soaring speeches, he denounced the mores of both the Clinton and Bush eras and made an argument for unity and hope over endless partisan warfare. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But over the course of the spring, Obama's campaign got less weird. The crucial pivot came when he failed to seize on McCain's offer to do a series of joint town-hall meetings across the country. Those meetings would have elevated the race and shown that Obama is willing to take risks in order to truly change the way things are done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Obama's speeches became more conventional, more policy-specific and more orthodox. His Denver acceptance speech was different from his Iowa speeches. It was more traditionally anti-Republican and pro-Democratic. In the speech's crucial contrast Obama declared: &quot;It's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America. You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is easy to see why Obama might tack this way. Democrats have a huge advantage in a straight-up issue contest. McCain is vulnerable on health care and the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by campaigning in this traditional way, Obama ceded the weirdness edge to McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The old warrior jumped right in. Think about how weird last week was. The Republican convention was one long protest against the way the Republicans themselves have run Washington. McCain's convention speech barely mentioned his own party. His vice presidential nominee came out of the blue and seems totally unlike the regular crowd of former eighth-grade class presidents who normally dominate public life. McCain's campaign ideology, exemplified in a new ad released on Monday, is not familiar conservatism. It's maverickism - against the entrenched powers and party orthodoxies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it all worked. McCain got a huge post-convention bounce in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the campaign has become a battle between two different definitions of change. The Obama camp has become the champion of policy change - after eight years of failed Bush-McCain policies, it is time for different, Democratic ones. The McCain campaign is the champion of systemic change - after two decades of bickering and self-dealing, its time to shake up the whole system in order to get things done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama change is more responsible and specific, but it has all the weirdness of a Brookings Institution report. (Not that there's anything wrong with that.) The McCain promise of change is comprehensive and vehement, though it's hard to know how it would actually work in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will still be hard for McCain to win in this environment, but his emphasis on broad systemic change may appeal to swing voters. Independent voters do not believe the country's problems can be solved merely by replacing Republicans with Democrats. They cast a pox on both houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the maverick theme allows McCain to talk directly about character. Obama can hint at his values when he describes his tax cuts and health care plans, but he is indirect. Most voters, especially ones who decide late, vote on character over policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I were advising the candidates, I'd tell them to double down on weirdness. Obama needs to occasionally criticize his own side. If he can't take on his own party hacks, he'll never reclaim the mantle of systemic change. Specifically, he needs to attack the snobs who are savaging Sarah Palin's faith and family. Many liberals claim to love working-class families, but the moment they glimpse a hunter with an uneven college record, they hop on chairs and call for disinfectant. Obama needs to attack Bill Maher for calling her a stewardess and the rest of the coastal condescenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I were McCain, I'd make the divided government argument explicit. The Republicans are intellectually unfit to govern right now, but balancing with Democrats, they might be able to do some good. I'd have McCain tell the country that he looks forward to working with congressional Democrats, that he is confident they can achieve great things together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates probably won't take this kind of advice. But remember: Weirdness wins. Surprise me most.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norfolk, Va. | Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama on Wednesday accused Republican John McCain's campaign of using &quot;lies and phony outrage and Swift-boat politics&quot; in claiming he used a sexist comment against vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling it &quot;the latest made-up controversy by the John McCain campaign,&quot; Obama responded to the Republicans' charge that he was referring to Palin when he used the phrase &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; at a campaign stop Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't care what they say about me. But I love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies and phony outrage and Swift-boat politics. Enough is enough,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's reference to Swift boating was to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, an outside group that in 2004 made unsubstantiated allegations about Democratic nominee John Kerry's decorated military record in Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his initial comments Tuesday, Obama was delivering a dissertation about McCain and President Bush - not Palin - when he used the lipstick aphorism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, his reference to the Alaska governor later on was a defense of her strong belief in religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lipstick maxim is hardly new to either Obama or McCain. The Democrat has used it in the past, and McCain repeated the folksy metaphor when he criticized Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton on health care. McCain was never accused of being sexist when he uttered those words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the day, during an appearance on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman,&quot; the host jokingly asked Obama: &quot;Have you ever actually put lipstick on a pig?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The answer would be no, but I think it might be fun to try,&quot; Obama said. He said it was all part of the &quot;silly season in politics&quot; as the campaign heats up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama used the reference as he criticized McCain's policies as similar to those of Bush, saying: &quot;You can put lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig. You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change. It's still going to stink after eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign immediately jumped on the comments, arguing they were directed at Palin, the GOP's first woman on a presidential ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her acceptance speech last week, she had referred to herself in a joke about lipstick being the only difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accusing Obama of &quot;smearing&quot; Palin in &quot;offensive and disgraceful&quot; comments, the McCain campaign demanded an apology. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign on Wednesday issued an Internet ad that said Obama was talking about Palin and said of Obama: &quot;Ready to lead? No. Ready to smear? Yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign has accused the GOP camp of engaging in a &quot;pathetic attempt to play the gender card.&quot; The campaign noted two other instances of McCain using the phrase &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; and its use by other Republicans such as House Minority Leader John Boehner and Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the fight dominating television news shows Wednesday morning, Obama responded before beginning a discussion of education at a Norfolk high school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What their campaign has done this morning is the same game that has made people sick and tired of politics in this country. They seize on an innocent remark, try to take it out of context, throw up an outrageous ad because they know that it's catnip for the news media,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Has there ever been a more peculiar presidential campaign than John McCain's?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the cuckoo bird, which lays its eggs in the nests of other species - and in the colors of their own eggs, no less - McCain has brazenly swiped Barack Obama's &quot;hope&quot; and &quot;change&quot; themes, terms Republicans had elaborately disdained until the pulse behind the words began to show some endurance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican nominee managed to talk his way through the Republican convention without mentioning the Republican incumbents, neither George Bush nor Dick Cheney, by name. (He did once cite a certain &quot;president of the United States,&quot; which may be taken as referring to, uh, umm? well, you know: Bush.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now, a campaign commercial for the Republican candidates boasts of McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin that &quot;He battled Republicans and reformed Washington. She battled Republicans and reformed Alaska.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are to take it, then, that the two are credentialed for election by their established ability to fight Republicans. This would seem to be, actually, a terrific commercial for Barack Obama, who is a Democrat and whose heart as a result would likely be more into the task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You have to hold a little compassion for McCain in this muddle. He doesn't dare run on the Republican record of the last eight years. The president has an approval rating just a tick better than cholera's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush pushed us into a needless, grinding war in Iraq that has cost us going on 4,500 dead, is headed, some economists calculate, toward $3 trillion in real money and trashed our international standing on a fling of kidnappings, endless detentions and torture and thus squandered the very considerable strategic advantages of U.S. soft power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That historic miscalculation cost us victory in Afghanistan, the actual frontline against terrorism, and has left the U.S. military so worn out and worn down that it is questionable we can redeem the neglect there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Republican Congresses offer no better a foundation for McCain. They were enthusiastic partners with Bush in polities and practices that turned a budget surplus into record deficits, putting us so deeply in hock to China that we could end up scrubbing woks in a Hong Kong restaurant if Beijing ever calls our paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millions are losing their homes. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two great struts of the mortgage market, are in federal receivership. Banks approach the failure rate of a geriatric ward. Unemployment is steadily rising, jobs are evaporating, workers have increased their productivity but have seen their incomes deteriorate, the money spread between the rich and everybody else has widened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So get this: Republicans are putting forward a ticket billing itself as anti-Republican - in hopes of retaining Republican power. And who knows? Maybe the cheeky proposition that the answer to Republican misfeasance is more Republicans will sell. It is doing well so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But whatever the outcome, let's pause to savor the moment. It is historic. McCain is the first ever third-party candidate licensed to run against a major political party by that party itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Move over, Alice. We're all falling down the rabbit hole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kansas City, Mo. | The Pentagon this past spring launched its so-called Minerva initiative - a hunt for more information on the Chinese military, ways to marginalize al-Qaida, new anti-terror strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty years ago, it might have been top-secret stuff. Today, the military is asking everyone for help - and will post the results in full public view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's another example of a new world of problem-solving that seeks answers in the public square. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense Secretary Robert Gates calculates that the transparency of Minerva is also its strength, that by looking to everyone for advice and letting the crowd weigh in on the results, the communal know-how will be that much richer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be no room for 'sensitive but unclassified,' &quot; Gates said in an April speech to university presidents about the project. If it were cloaked in secrecy, he warned, &quot;you could end up with mediocre, uninventive results.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientific or commercial, civilian or military, business or hobby, there is a new emphasis on sharing problems and ideas in ever more public ways in hopes of hitting on more brilliant solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Self-styled inventors are weighing in - for cash and intrinsic satisfaction - to solve puzzles vexing industry and government. Aspiring entrepreneurs are seeking fortune not by hoarding ideas but by sharing them. Spurred both by the endless interactivity made simple by the Internet and the all-ideas-welcome culture it has nurtured, an explosion of what one author calls &quot;crowdsourcing&quot; is offering new ways to get things done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When former tennis pro Steve Timperley learned of a budding new system for handicapping tennis players - a method clubs could use to better match players of similar abilities - he chose not to hold the idea close to the vest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, he put it to a team in the University of Missouri-Kansas City's New Venture Challenge Competition to work out the kinks and develop a business plan that might bring his Tencap Tennis to market. In turn, that team opened its strategy to other business people for critique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Timperley has about 3,000 players in the Kansas City area entered into the handicapping database and is set to use Facebook-like social networking elements to spread the tennis match-up gospel. Soon, he hopes to sell to tennis clubs across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ultimate goal is that everybody makes more money,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Tencap keeps private the clever algorithms that give players a strong idea about who might make good competition - an advance on an old system that relies on subjective scores by tennis pros - the firm's development in some ways takes a cue from the idea of open-source software and its reliance on interactivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mother of the open-source world is the Linux computer operating system fathered by Linus Torvalds in 1991 with help from developers around the world. Linux source code is open to anyone, and people fiddle with it all the time. They then share their improvements with other computer programmers and, by and large, the most elegant improvements take hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the open-source world,&quot; said Rice University computer scientist Dan Wallach, &quot;respect is earned, not assigned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recently collaborated on open-source software designed for voting machines. It's technology that Wallach believes will instill more trust in the elections by providing transparency to ballot counting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such open-source models have already driven commerce. Take Internet search giant Yahoo, which runs atop a Linux operating system. The company continually has its programmers working to remove bugs from Linux and shares those fixes with the rest of the world. Because Yahoo's refining of the computer code continues to improve the operating system, more people outside the company stay on the same Linux path. And because many of them improve the system as well, Yahoo gets use of those upgrades for free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Software is ideally suited for the ongoing collaboration. The 1s and 0s of binary calculations form an international language. The problems can be massive, and they can be broken down into bits for programmers - both professional and self-styled - to ponder. It has also inspired an open-source model to other arenas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians have even gotten in on the act. Barack Obama's primary race got a boost when will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas put his rousing &quot;Yes We Can&quot; speech to music in a video that became a YouTube sensation one week last fall. John McCain wants the government to offer $300 million to anyone who can create a battery robust enough to replace the internal combustion engine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Research Council recently suggested the National Science Foundation make its resources stretch further by using prize money to untangle riddles rather than just farming out work to one researcher at a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Fort Leavenworth, the Army and Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Center is experimenting with blogs as a way for troops to share tips more freely, and is soliciting papers from anyone with some deep thinking about topics ranging from how the U.N. can cope with insurgency in Colombia to the Albanians immigrating illegally into Kosovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of what we do with counterinsurgency is not classified,&quot; said Maj. Niel Smith. &quot;The enemy wouldn't gain an advantage from understanding how we understand what's going on. ... Sharing information just leverages what we know.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who would you rather have a beer with?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In presidential politics, that simple question has become a litmus test for a candidate's likability and, it follows, his likelihood of getting elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, according to a Zogby/Williams Identity Poll, 57 percent of undecided voters said they would rather toss back a beer with President George W. Bush than with Democratic nominee John Kerry (even though Bush doesn't drink). During last spring's Democratic campaign, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama chugged beer to counter charges of elitism. (Obama made one Raleigh, N.C., bartender very happy by tipping $18 for a $2 glass of Pabst.) More recently, washingtonpost.com blogger Chris Cillizza called Obama running mate Joseph Biden &quot;the kind of guy voters can imagine themselves having a beer with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd have a beer with any of them. The real question is, which beer? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain's wife, Cindy, is chairwoman of an Anheuser-Busch distributorship, so an appropriate tipple for him might be Budweiser American Ale, the St. Louis company's latest attempt to court craft-beer drinkers. Bud American Ale is more middle-of-the-road than maverick, with caramel malt dominating the flavor, a crisp, dry finish and a touch of fruity hops. It's pleasant enough, but the PR material goes a bit overboard in asserting that &quot;Budweiser American Ale defines a new standard of ale - The American Ale.&quot; That will come as news to the brewers of Liberty Ale and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, who set the parameters for American-style pale ale a generation ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ad hype, like campaign speeches, shouldn't be taken too seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has his own beer connection. In Kenya, his father's birthplace, drinkers of a cut-rate brand called Senator Keg have unofficially renamed it  &quot;Obama Beer&quot; to celebrate the Democratic candidate's rise to prominence. Senator Keg isn't exported here, but you can buy another Kenyan brand, Tusker. This European-style golden lager honors George Hurst, co-founder of Kenya Breweries, who was gored to death by a bull elephant. The name is almost an omen for Obama, who will have to dodge another elephant, the GOP pachyderm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's extend this fantasy game further. Suppose you could have a beer with any U.S. president, living or dead. Who would be your barmate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My one criterion: The president must enjoy the beer as much as I do. That narrows the field to three: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Grover Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington was a home-brewer. One of his recipes, for a molasses-based brew, is preserved in the New York Public Library. Later in life he acquired a taste for porter, ordering up to  &quot;three gross&quot; bottles at a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jefferson was an oenophile, but when the War of 1812 cut off supplies of European wines, he turned to beermaking with an unbridled enthusiasm, producing up to 200 gallons a year of a wheat-based ale at Monticello. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamsburg AleWerks, a microbrewery in the former Virginia capital, brews a Washington's Porter, full of roasty and bittersweet chocolate flavors, and a spritzy, golden Colonial Wheat Ale. Brewery manager Charles Haines acknowledges that these are not re-creations of old recipes. He says his porter, brewed with seven malts, is more complex than the versions Washington would have quaffed (and it contains no molasses). As for his wheat beer, Haines explains that golden-colored ales brewed with lightly toasted grains were unknown in Jefferson's era: &quot;They roasted grain in ovens, they did it in skillets. Everything was brown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grover Cleveland was our only president to serve non-consecutive terms (1885-1889 and 1893-1897). While rising through the political ranks in Buffalo, he was a frequenter of bars and a prodigious consumer of lager. He groused of the White House fare:  &quot;I must go to dinner. I wish it was to eat a pickled herring, a swiss cheese and a chop at Louis' (his favorite saloon) instead of that French stuff I shall find.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I were clinking glasses with Grover today, I'd choose a pre-Prohibition-style lager, maybe Participation Lager from Magic Hat Brewing in South Burlington, Vt. It's brewed with 20 percent flaked maize for extra smoothness, but it has a firm malt body and a landslide of flowery Hallertau and Columbus hops. This special-release brew is available only in the Participation Variety 12-Pak, on sale through Election Day.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dayton, Ohio | The presidential nominees, Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama, are confronting an abbreviated general-election campaign season, the product of the late national conventions and a boom in early-voting arrangements in tightly contested states. This shortened timetable is forcing both campaigns to recalibrate the pace of television advertisements, accelerate voter turnout operations and tailor the candidates' traveling schedules to accommodate states where voting is imminent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it is just eight weeks until Election Day, even that schedule overstates how much time the candidates have to win over voters.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 30 states allow some form of early voting, forcing the campaigns to deal with a rolling series of Election Days. Iowa, a crucial state, will begin voting on Sept. 23, less than three weeks after the end of the Republican convention marked the traditional start of the general-election sprint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's unprecedented, a whole new way of looking at elections,&quot; said Tad Devine, a Democratic strategist who is not involved with either campaign. &quot;A combination of the late conventions and the way early voting is becoming even earlier around the country is going to have a big, big impact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides to McCain, R-Ariz., and Obama, D-Ill., are devising state-by-state advertising strategies so that their close-the-deal messages - typically kept in reserve until the last 10 days before Election Day - are released to coincide with when people are reaching their final decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The old advertising formula was to begin after Labor Day with soft biographical advertisements introducing the candidate, followed by commercials drawing contrasts with the other side, and closing with the strongest argument. But that formula is obsolete, aides to both candidates said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The traveling schedules of the candidates, spouses and running mates are being adjusted so they front-load the time spent in states where, practically speaking, there is not much time before people begin to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Obama and McCain were in Ohio on Tuesday, on-the-ground evidence of the fact that this state will for the first time permit early voting in presidential elections. Voting starts Sept. 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter turnout operations that once would not have kicked into high-gear until the weekend before Election Day are about to be revved up and will remain in operation to accommodate the elongated period of early voting, posing new expenses and complications. The campaigns are using computer models - studying past voting trends along with consumer and demographic data - to try to identify people most likely to be early voters, and press them to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are now less than 30 days from people voting,&quot; said Steve Hildebrand, a senior adviser to Obama. &quot;Easily one-third of the people are going to vote before Election Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the truncated general-election season, campaign aides said they were going to have make triage decisions sooner about what states the nominees will actually compete in. The ambitious battleground presented by Obama's aides, of at least 18 states, may soon get whittled down in deference to a calendar that does not leave that many days for campaigning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With deceptively little time left, it is now unlikely that McCain will go to, say, New Jersey, or that Obama will visit Georgia, early wish-list states for the two candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And given the time constraints, complicated by the fact that the three presidential debates are going to eat up campaign time in the weeks ahead, there is less time for a candidate to recover from a mistake or catch up should either Obama or McCain experience a major breakthrough at one of those debates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It fundamentally changes two things: timing and budgets,&quot; said Mike DuHaime, the political director for McCain. &quot;You need to close the deal earlier for some voters, and Election Day can be spread out over weeks. That means your get-out-the-vote costs are more than ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager, said: &quot;This is an enormously compressed time frame. This thing is really getting down to the wire. You can't look at this like there's 57 days until Election Day. We start having Election Day right around the corner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shortened campaign season means that both campaigns have more money to spend on a per-week or per-day basis; thus, the $84 million that McCain is receiving in his federal campaign subsidy will go a lot further in a 60-day campaign than it would have gone in, say, 2000 when the general election campaign lasted 81 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the exception of one campaign, 2004, this 60-day general election campaign is the shortest since the new Republican Party held its convention in 1856. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, unlike 2004, the two parties held their conventions in consecutive weeks toward the end of the summer, making the general election that much more concentrated for both of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early voting is a relatively new phenomenon in American politics, and its influence varies widely by region. But significantly, Southwest states that have emerged as central McCain-Obama battlegrounds this year - Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico - are hotbeds of early voting, as is Florida, where 1 million people have already requested a ballot. But early voting is less prevalent in contested Eastern states like New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Virginia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samuel Augustus Maverick, Texas rancher of the 1840s, is proudly sitting up in his grave. His name, which has become an eponymous American word, was cited repeatedly at last week's unexpectedly enthusiastic Republican convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been called a maverick,&quot; John McCain told his rounded-up party. &quot;Sometimes it's meant as a compliment; sometimes it's not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True enough: Old Sam Maverick's friends said he refused to brand his cattle because it was cruel to animals; competing ranchers said it let him round up and claim all the unbranded cattle in the neighborhood. In an era that has sophisticates displaying designers' initials, the Americanism maverick now means &quot;one who bears no man's brand,&quot; or in McCain's evocation of Thoreau's metaphor, &quot;marches to the beat of his own drum.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">New York Times</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">' Op-Ed page editors yanked this former speechwriter back into harness to assess convention speeches, so here goes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Democrats' gathering in Denver, the best burst of unremarked writing was the loving introduction of Sen. Joe Biden by his son: powerful testimony to the lifelong fidelity of a father after family tragedy. The TV camera's reaction shot of Michelle Obama wiping authentic tears from her eyes and cheeks was to me the convention's most moving image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As opined in this space last week, Barack Obama's speech the final night brought hosannas from the faithful, but - encumbered by its pretentious stadium setting - did not meet his high rhetorical standard. About the only member of the punditariat who agreed that this season's emperor of oratory was short on clothes that night was David Broder of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Washington Post</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who had the unfair advantage of being objective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came the maverick ticket with its takeover of the change game. Sen. Joe Lieberman, avoiding Obama's error of playing to the multitude of partisans present, looked straight at the camera and spoke effectively to fellow Democrats and independents at home about McCain's coalition-building work in the Senate. Joe faces heavy punishment for his courage from a vindictive Democratic leader, Sen. Harry Reid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the St. Paul convention was hit by Hurricane Sarah and her admirable family. The cliche is that - faced by part of a party long troubled by McCain's different drumming - the governor of Alaska was able to &quot;energize the base&quot; of social conservatives. The more salient fact is that her skillful speech and joyful demeanor was even more impressive than Obama's introduction to the Democratic Party four years ago. The establishment-shaking candidate was a happy warrior in the glare of major-league scrutiny. Most of the huge, uncommitted audience at home enjoyed this strong woman's national audition; the first test of McCain's gamble paid off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though her &quot;lipstick&quot; ad lib got the laugh (and may have offended pit-bull fanciers), she forcefully delivered a Sorensenesque line that crystallized the choice this year's voters face: &quot;There are those who use change to promote their careers. And then, there are those, like John McCain, who use their careers to promote change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain acceptance speech reads better than it was read. The straight talker never has been a smooth orator, but his homely, unprofessional speaking style has a way of underscoring his depth of character. The key word in this campaign is &quot;trust,&quot; and with McCain, what you see is what you get.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One purpose of a speech accepting nomination is to press a candidate's key strength. That called for McCain to set aside his longtime reluctance to recount publicly his wartime suffering. He was careful not to claim to be owed anything by his country; on the contrary, many viewers learned for the first time of how he was &quot;blessed because I served in the company of heroes,&quot; and was affected for the better by his searing wartime experience, which made him readier to command in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other purpose was to turn the tables on the early campaign &quot;narrative.&quot; Experience is a useful opening political argument - but it looks backward. &quot;Experience counts&quot; was Richard Nixon's static slogan in 1960, but &quot;let's get the country moving again&quot; - John Kennedy's winning phrase - looked ahead. That's the outlook McCain chose to adopt in his speech, which was strong on tomorrow's education needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In willingly taking up the two-edged sword of maverickism; in spelling out his frequent fights against the sclerotic, cozy two-party establishment; in zinging that &quot;big-spending, do-nothing, me-first-country-second Washington crowd&quot;; in choosing an exciting new running mate even as Obama was splashing about in the news media adulation of his smoothly delivered acceptance extravaganza, McCain stiffly stole the clothes of change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That last paragraph befits a speechwriter's peroration, not the soberly sage, almost bipartisan analysis I originally intended. Note the incidental pop at &quot;media adulation,&quot; a red flag to the arugula-munching &quot;panjandrums of the opinion media,&quot; in Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s phrase, gleefully waved by Sarah Palin and most other Republican convention speakers. McCain, who reveled in media-darlingism eight years ago, did not participate in such shooting at literate fish in a barrel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one whose only claim to coinage fame is in Spiro Agnew's 1970 &quot;nattering nabobs of negativism,&quot; I have an attack dog in that fight (though not a maligned pit bull).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But here's a question: In light of public opinion of most opinion journalists being down around that of Congress, is it smart politics to bash the news media?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Agnew, and later Nixon, ultimately were forced to resign, conventional wisdom now holds that their blast at &quot;elitism&quot; backfired; but it probably played a part in Nixon's 49-state re-election landslide in 1972. By curtailing the &quot;instant analysis&quot; and having elected opposition leaders on TV to answer presidential addresses, the press back then took much of the punch out of the administration attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, by slamming back furiously today, some of those mainstreaming or blogging in the news media just might be helping to make their critics' point. We can hope that the winners in tomorrow's alliteration wars will be the pleasant Pollyannas of positivism.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Paul, Minn. | They embody four uniquely American stories. They offer messages of transformation with two distinct world views. They pursue one goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama and their respective running mates, Sarah Palin and Joe Biden, begin the final eight weeks of their historic and remarkably close presidential contest ready to rewrite national politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race, gender and age barriers are at stake. A shifting political landscape will take the fight to previously ignored states. Advertising will suffocate the airwaves with intensely negative exchanges. Debates could be as decisive as the final Carter-Reagan debate of 1980. And more money will be spent by the hour in politics than ever before. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed with a bigger bankroll and a partisan Democratic advantage, Obama is competing in more states than John Kerry did in 2004, including typically Republican states such as Virginia and North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon, strategists predict, the number of states in play will narrow to nine or 10, resembling past elections with Virginia the new battleground in the mix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Election Day closes in, they say, McCain needs to shore up his position in previous Republican states and hope the only states left in play are Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whoever wins two out of those three will probably win the election,&quot; said Scott Reed, a Republican strategist who managed Bob Dole's 1996 campaign and is close to the McCain camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and McCain march into the fall campaign with their parties newly unified - tasks they accomplished by each reaching out to a female political figure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama sits atop a mountain of advantages. President Bush and the Republican Party remain highly unpopular, Democrats have displayed greater intensity, Obama has expanded the electorate, and he has set huge records for political money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, however, has managed to remain far more popular than his party or his president. Independent voters and even some Democrats remain unsure about Obama, either because of his race or his rapid rise from obscurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while Obama's election would represent a monumental milestone for the nation by putting the first black man in the White House, Palin gives voters a chance to make history, too, by electing the first woman as vice president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates targeted 11 states with advertising last week. They are Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Missouri, North Carolina, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. McCain and the Republican National Committee also are up with an ad in Minnesota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, however, has expanded the field for now, placing ads in Indiana, Michigan, Montana, and North Dakota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Timing is also crucial. Five battlegrounds - North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Missouri and Michigan - begin distributing absentee ballots between Sept. 19 and Sept. 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain must ensure that a state like Montana, which voted for Bush 59-39 percent over Kerry in 2004 doesn't flip. But the state has two Democratic senators and a Democratic governor. He must shore up North Dakota and hold on to other states Bush won such as Nevada and Colorado, where there's been a growth in the population of Democratic-leaning Hispanic voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The secret of the next 30 days is to get these traditional Republican states back in our column,&quot; Reed said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It won't be easy. Obama has the financial resources to keep those states competitive, forcing McCain to divert money he will desperately need in tossup states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin will be McCain's ambassador to vulnerable Republican &quot;red&quot; states. She'll cross paths with Biden in small cities and rural hamlets in Pennsylvania and Ohio in competition for working class white men and women. McCain would be free to promote himself as a maverick and independent in states such as New Hampshire and in the suburbs and ex-urbs where independent and undecided voters might live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Obama will face each other in debates three times, each lasting 90 minutes and one conducted in a town hall format. The first opportunity to see the two candidates side by side will be Sept. 26, at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Miss., with domestic policy as the sole subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has the upper hand going in, with polls showing voters trust Obama more than McCain to fix the economy. If the race is tied as the debate begins, Obama could help change the dynamic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice presidential debates aren't decisive, but can put a campaign on the defensive. The public is likely to tune in to the Oct. 2 Biden-Palin debate for the novelty of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next two debates favor McCain. On Oct. 7 they will meet at Washington University in St. Louis for a town hall styled meeting on any subject. McCain likes the format and uses it regularly on the stump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week later, the two will meet at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., to discuss foreign policy. In polls, McCain leads Obama on questions of defense and who would best deal with Iraq. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terre Haute, Ind. | Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama said Saturday that any government takeover of troubled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must put the interests of taxpayers and homeowners first. His opponent, GOP nominee John McCain, said it was essential to restructure the mortgage giants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any action we take must be focused not on the whims of lobbyists and special interests worried about their bonuses and hourly fees, but on whether it will strengthen our economy and help struggling homeowners,&quot; Obama told reporters after a campaign stop in Indiana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stopped short of making detailed proposals, saying &quot;we need to carefully address&quot; the possible impact on community and regional banks. &quot;But we must not allow government intervention to protect investors and speculators who relied on the government to reap massive profits,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Colorado, McCain said, &quot;today we're looking at a federal bailout of our home loan agencies.&quot; His running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, said a &quot;McCain-Palin administration will make them smaller and smarter and more effective for homeowners who need them.&quot; She did not elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said in an interview for CBS' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Face The Nation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be aired Sunday that the mortgage giants need to be restructured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that we've got to keep people in their homes,&quot; McCain said. &quot;There's got to be restructuring, there's got to be reorganization, and there's got to be some confidence that we've stopped this downward spiral. It's hard, it's tough, but it's also the classic example of why we need change in Washington. It's an example of cronyism, special interest, lobbyists, a quasi-governmental organization where the executives were making hundreds of - some billion dollars a year while things were going downhill, going to hell in a hand-basket. This is the kind of cronyism, corruption, that's made people so justifiably angry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, talking of possible changes to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, said: &quot;We can't have a situation in which, during boom times, management and investors are soaking up huge profits, taking extraordinary risks, and thinking to themselves that if they get into trouble because of these risky investments that somehow the taxpayers are going to be there to bail them out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What took place at the two institutions, he said, &quot;was in many instances irresponsible,&quot; even if it was legal. &quot;They were boosting profits as a priority,&quot; he said, which produced management bonuses. &quot;I think that has led to some of the problems,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama restated his call for a second stimulus package this year, which would involve a tax rebate for individuals and aid to states for education, health care and other costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can the super-rich former governor of Massachusetts - the son of a Fortune 500 CEO who made a vast fortune in the leveraged-buyout business - really keep a straight face while denouncing &quot;Eastern elites&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can the former mayor of New York City, a man who, as USA Today put it, &quot;marched in gay pride parades, dressed up in drag and lived temporarily with a gay couple and their Shih Tzu&quot; - that was between his second and third marriages - really get away with saying that Barack Obama doesn't think small towns are sufficiently &quot;cosmopolitan&quot;? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can the vice presidential candidate of a party that has controlled the White House, Congress or both for 26 of the past 28 years, a party that, Borg-like, assimilated much of the D.C. lobbying industry into itself - until Congress changed hands, high-paying lobbying jobs were reserved for loyal Republicans - really portray herself as running against the &quot;Washington elite&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, they can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, He Who Must Not Be Named - Mitt Romney mentioned him just once, Rudy Giuliani and Sarah Palin not at all - gave a video address to the Republican National Convention. John McCain, promised President Bush, would stand up to the &quot;angry left.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's no doubt true. But don't be fooled either by McCain's long-ago reputation as a maverick or by Palin's appealing persona: the Republican Party, now more than ever, is firmly in the hands of the angry right, which has always been much bigger, much more influential and much angrier than its counterpart on the other side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's the source of all that anger?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of it, of course, is driven by cultural and religious conflict: Fundamentalist Christians are sincerely dismayed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Roe vs. Wade</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and evolution in the curriculum. What struck me as I watched the convention speeches, however, is how much of the anger on the right is based not on the claim that Democrats have done bad things, but on the perception - generally based on no evidence whatsoever - that Democrats look down their noses at regular people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus Giuliani asserted that Wasilla, Alaska, isn't &quot;flashy enough&quot; for Obama, who never said any such thing. And Palin asserted that Democrats &quot;look down&quot; on small-town mayors - again, without any evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the GOP is selling, in other words, is the pure politics of resentment; you're supposed to vote Republican to stick it to an elite that thinks it's better than you. Or to put it another way, the GOP is still the party of Nixon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the key insights in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Nixonland</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the new book by the historian Rick Perlstein, is that Nixon's political strategy throughout his career was inspired by his college experience, in which he got himself elected student body president by exploiting his classmates' resentment against the Franklins, the school's elite social club. There's a direct line from that student election to Spiro Agnew's attacks on the &quot;nattering nabobs of negativism&quot; as &quot;an effete corps of impudent snobs,&quot; and from there to the peculiar cult of personality that not long ago surrounded George W. Bush - a cult that celebrated his anti-intellectualism and made much of the supposed fact that the &quot;misunderestimated&quot; C-average student had proved himself smarter than all the fancy-pants experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when Bush turned out not to be that smart after all, and his presidency crashed and burned, the angry right - the raging rajas of resentment? - became, if anything, even angrier. Humiliation will do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can McCain and Palin really ride Nixonian resentment into an upset election victory in what should be an overwhelmingly Democratic year? The answer is a definite maybe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By selecting Barack Obama as their nominee, the Democrats may have given Republicans an opening: the very qualities that inspire many fervent Obama supporters - the candidate's high-flown eloquence, his coolness factor - have also laid him open to a Nixonian backlash. Unlike many observers, I wasn't surprised at the effectiveness of the McCain &quot;celebrity&quot; ad. It didn't make much sense intellectually, but it skillfully exploited the resentment some voters feel toward Obama's star quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, the experience of the years since 2000 - the memory of what happened to working Americans when faux-populist Republicans controlled the government - is still fairly fresh in voters' minds. Furthermore, while Democrats' supposed contempt for ordinary people is mainly a figment of Republican imagination, the GOP really is the Gramm Old Party - it really does believe that the economy is just fine, and the fact that most Americans disagree just shows that we're a nation of whiners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Democrats can't afford to be complacent. Resentment, no matter how contrived, is a powerful force, and it's one that Republicans are very, very good at exploiting.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">York, Pa. | Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said Thursday that Republicans at their national convention are attacking him to avoid talking about the sagging economy and housing problems that voters care about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're hearing an awfully lot about me - most of which is not true - but you're not hearing a lot about you,&quot; Obama said. &quot;You haven't heard a word about how we're going to deal with any aspect of the economy that is affecting you and your pocketbook day-to-day. Haven't heard a word about it. I'm not exaggerating. Literally, two nights, they have not said a word about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illinois senator told voters that the GOP convention speakers are spending all their time talking about politics, not about issues that matter to voters. He criticized the Republicans for not addressing the economic distress or housing foreclosures that have grown during the Bush administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking with reporters later, Obama dismissed the idea that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the GOP's vice presidential candidate, had been criticized unfairly because of her gender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The notion that many questions about her work in Alaska is somehow not relevant to her potentially being vice president of the United States doesn't make too much sense to me,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I assume she wants to be treated the same way guys are treated, which means their records are under scrutiny. I've been through this for 19 months. She's been through this for, what, four days so far?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by workers at a factory here about Palin's attacks on him Wednesday night, Obama replied, &quot;I'll let Gov. Palin talk about her experience. I'll talk about mine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, when reporters pressed him about Palin, Obama noted that his opponent is Republican John McCain, not the GOP vice presidential pick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the way, I've been called worse on the basketball court. It's not that big a deal,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York | More than 40 million people tuned in to the Republican convention Wednesday to hear vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin introduce herself to voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That audience rivaled the one for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama last week. Nielsen Media Research estimated 37.2 million people watched Palin on either ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel or MSNBC. PBS estimated it had four million viewers for the speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Obama had 38.4 million viewers on the commercial networks, topping 40 million with PBS and C-SPAN added in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are bigger audiences than the &quot;American Idol&quot; finale or Academy Awards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | Back in late February, when Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin met Sen. John McCain for the first time at a convention of U.S. governors, the two dished about a number of things, but mostly earmarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We just talked about earmark reform and how it's going to happen,&quot; Palin said shortly after she attended a breakfast for Republican governors featuring McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since McCain announced last week that she would be vice presidential running mate, his campaign has worked to paint Palin as a crusader who took on two of the most successful appropriators in the history of Congress: her fellow Republicans and titans of Alaska politics, Sen. Ted Stevens and Rep. Don Young. But Palin also sought earmarks, both as a governor and a small-town mayor - a position that is at odds with McCain's zero tolerance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My position has been in trying to read that writing on the wall, and understanding there's going to be reform, we can either put our heads in the sand and ignore the reforms that are coming,&quot; she said in a February interview. &quot;Or we can be proactive and get Alaska in the position of being more productive, contributing more and becoming less reliant on the federal government.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike McCain, though, Palin has not been a purist on earmarks. As Alaska governor, she sought and obtained hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarks for the state, and as mayor of Wasilla, she hired lobbyist and former Stevens staffer Steve Silver to steer federal money to her town.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Laurel, Miss. | Fabiola Pena considered running away from her factory job when she realized she was being targeted in a federal immigration raid. She was deterred when she noticed the helicopters hovering overhead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But helicopters were not what shocked Pena the most on her last, fateful day at Howard Industries, the largest employer in this small Southern city. It was the black co-workers who clapped and cheered as Pena and hundreds of other Hispanic immigrant laborers were arrested and hauled away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said we took their jobs, but I was working from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.,&quot; said Pena, 21, a day after the raid last week that resulted in the arrest of 595 illegal immigration suspects. &quot;I didn't see them working like us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The raid at Howard Industries, an electronic transformer manufacturer, was the largest of its kind in many years, and it exposed some of the rawest emotions that fuel the illegal immigration debate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also carried out during an odd period of political limbo: Polls suggest that for voters, the immigration issue has been eclipsed by the sputtering economy, and neither of the two major presidential candidates has made much of the topic during the election season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Bush administration winds down its tenure in Washington, it has made efforts to step up immigration enforcement, especially after Congress failed last year to pass a sweeping overhaul of the nation's immigration laws. Since then, thousands of people have been arrested in raids at dozens of facilities, generating considerable controversy: Immigrant advocates have howled over the coarse treatment of suspects and the breakup of families, while anti-immigrant groups say the raids allow for the long-overdue enforcement of existing laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the raids might not have much of a future after the swearing in of Republican John McCain or Democrat Barack Obama, both of whom have staked out moderate-to-liberal stances on immigration reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the next president ends or curtails raids like the one at the Howard plant, it will not sit well with many residents of Laurel. It was welcomed by a number of native-born residents in this manufacturing hub of about 25,000 people that has been transformed in recent years by the influx of Hispanic workers, many of whom are likely undocumented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They need to go and do this in every little town,&quot; Tonya Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson, a 30-year-old black, said that over the years she had applied numerous times for a job at the company, a locally-owned transformer manufacturer that employs about 4,000 people. Jackson never received a callback. The raid, she said, was a welcome purge of illegal Hispanic laborers who had taken jobs they didn't deserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been here all our lives,&quot; she said.  &quot;And it seems like they have just arrived and are getting the nice cars and the good homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That puts her at odds with Obama, a senator from Illinois. The Democratic nominee's Web site describes the raids as &quot;ineffective&quot; measures that have &quot;placed all the burdens of a broken system onto immigrant families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear if the raids would increase or decrease under a Republican administration headed by McCain. Like Obama, the senator from Arizona wants to create a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and beef up border security (McCain, of late, has emphasized that real border security must come before first).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some illegal immigration opponents worry that enforcement efforts like the raids will have to decline once illegals are offered a path to citizenship, since government will be focusing more on accommodating immigrants than punishing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration advocacy groups, meanwhile, are just as worried that McCain, who has tinkered with his views on immigration, could continue the raids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crackdown in Laurel upended the new reality here. The old lumber town, about two hours northeast of New Orleans, boasts a few stately mansions and other remnants of a quaint southern past. More recently, the city has been transformed by restaurants and grocery stores catering to Hispanic immigrants who came to work at the transformer factory and nearby chicken plants. The city's population in 2000 was about 18,000, according to census figures, but the Hispanic newcomers have helped raise that number by thousands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their arrival created some tension in town, with blacks and whites suspecting that undocumented workers were taking the few available jobs and depressing wages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week's raid, part of a two-year investigation of Howard Industries, was triggered by a complaint from a union member, said Barbara Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency conducting the probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 595 people arrested, about 106 were released and outfitted with monitoring devices until their trial date. Among them was Pena, who was freed so that she could care for her 2-year-old daughter. A number of 17-year-old workers were put into the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. The rest were taken to a detention center in Jena, La., about four hours away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight workers face criminal identity theft charges, but most were charged with noncriminal immigration violations and face possible deportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gonzalez said no managers were arrested in the raid. She noted, however, that the case remains open. Opponents of raids often complain that workers bear a disproportionate brunt of the punishment, while the people who hire them are sometimes overlooked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howard Industries officials declined to comment; in a statement, they noted that the company performs &quot;every check allowed&quot; to ascertain their applicants' immigration status. After the raid, the company erected a notice on a billboard on 16th Avenue, a busy commercial thoroughfare: &quot;Howard Industries is now hiring!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The raid, along with rumors of further enforcement actions, has sent a wave of fear through the Hispanic community. A number of workers have skipped their shifts at the poultry plants. Mexican restaurants refused to open their doors, with one citing an unexplained  &quot;plumbing problem&quot; in a sign to customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There ain't a Mexican place open in this town,&quot; said Mark Childress, 49, as he went to a taqueria next to the supermarket, only to find it closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Childress, a Laurel native, said he was not upset by the Hispanic immigration wave, but others said they were glad to see it being rolled back. James Warren, 33, worked at the Howard plant for a few months in 2000. But he quit in frustration over the low wages and the fact that no one on his shift spoke English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was long overdue,&quot; Warren said of the raid.  &quot;Everybody knew what was going on in there. There weren't a lot of white or black people left in there anymore; it was all Mexicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With both presidential candidates pledged to giving illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship, Warren couldn't imagine the raids continuing past the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Peniel Christian Church, one night last week, about two dozen Hispanic immigrants were milling around. Some held hands in a circle and prayed. A few were waiting for lawyers; others were unaffected by the raid, but too scared to go home. Children ran through the pews, oblivious to their parents' grief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These people are not terrorists, communist or criminals,&quot; said Pastor Roberto Valez, 58, a native of Puerto Rico. &quot;They are here because they are hungry and in search of a better life, and they were caught working.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pena, the 21-year-old mother, said that not everyone treated her poorly. She said that her supervisor, a black woman, stood by her side and consoled her during the raid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She even called my mother to let her know what happened,&quot; Pena said, &quot;But it was in English and my mother had no idea what she was trying to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's one of those campaign tactics that makes voters' heads spin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly, Republicans were giving Hillary Rodham Clinton respect, suggesting she should have been Barack Obama's running mate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a John McCain&nbsp;commercial, an announcer asked:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She won millions of votes but isn't on his ticket. Why?.... For speaking the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wait a second. Isn't this the same Hillary that Republican partisans love to vilify as the near-personification of evil? If she was on the ticket, would the GOP be praising her for &quot;speaking the truth&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No way. Apparently there's only one area where Clinton's opinions can be trusted, and that's criticizing Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not like Republicans had only the highest praise for their candidate in the primaries. Mitt Romney, for example, was being touted as a running mate for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in January, Romney accused McCain of misrepresenting Romney's position on Iraq, and called it &quot;dirty tricks&quot; and &quot;reprehensible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said Romney left Massachusetts with high taxes and deficits, and that he lacked the experience to be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after the primaries, a switch is flipped, and all that is forgotten. Unless it suits your purposes, of course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Olympic gold medal in basketball was redemption for the U.S. program and its players, but it was another kind of payback for Doug Collins, the father of Chris Collins, the Duke assistant coach who also helped mentor the U.S. team in Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doug Collins played on the U.S. team in the 1972 Olympics in Munich that was denied a gold medal by questionable officiating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Team USA was up 50-49 over the Soviets with three seconds remaining in the championship game. But after time ran out, the referees gave the Soviets another chance, saying they should have received a time out. But when the second attempt to win failed, they were given yet another try. This time, the refs said the clock wasn't reset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the third try, the Soviets scored and won. The Americans couldn't believe their gold medal had been stolen. The players were so incensed they refused to accept the silver medal. The pain has never gone away, but it diminished a bit when, 36 years later, LeBron James hung his gold medal around Doug Collins' neck. It was a sweet, and well-deserved, gesture. Doug Collins and his '72 teammates also win this week's Durham Grit Award. No reviews will be allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The food police are on the prowl again, although this time the badges may be a little suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cancer Project, which the Associated Press variously referred to as &quot;pro-vegetarian&quot; and an &quot;anti-meat advocacy group,&quot; created a stir this week with a TV commercial aimed at hot dogs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial shows kids eating hot dogs in a school cafeteria. One boy says he was &quot;dumbfounded when the doctor told me I have late-stage colon cancer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heart-wrenching, right? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Couple problems here, though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One, the kid (thankfully) doesn't have colon cancer. The Cancer Project says it was only a dramatization, but that seems a bit weasly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, as the AP reported, the study it was dramatizing was done on adults, not children -- and there's considerable skepticism among nutritionists that moderate hot-dog consumption is going to cause serious health problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An occasional hot dog isn't going to increase that risk (of cancer),&quot; Colleen Doyle, the American Cancer Society's nutrition director, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, noting the approach of Labor Day, you probably shouldn't feel any unease about slapping a hot dog or two on the grill to commemorate the unofficial end of the summer season.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain decided on a running mate early Thursday, and one top prospect, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, abruptly canceled numerous public appearances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator will appear with his No. 2 at an Ohio rally on Friday, aides said, though they provided no details on McCain's pick. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without explanation, Pawlenty called off an Associated Press interview at the last minute, as well as other media interviews in Denver, site of the Democratic National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others believed to be in contention for the No. 2 slot on the GOP ticket included former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who was meeting with donors throughout California, and Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who was vacationing on New York's Long Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, too, was still a possibility, as was the idea that McCain would choose a dark horse from any number of names that have circulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fueling speculation that McCain would choose either Pawlenty or Romney or another conservative Republican, two GOP officials said they believed McCain had picked a traditional candidate. They based their conclusion on the fact that the campaign, which once had put the party on notice to prepare for the possibility of an unconventional candidate, does not have preparations in place to curb the fallout from a right flank that certainly would revolt if Ridge, an abortion-rights backer, or Lieberman, a former Democrat, was on the ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In front of Pawlenty's private home in Eagan, a southern St. Paul suburb, more than two dozen people - including a man wearing a Barack Obama T-shirt - mingled and watched the number of satellite TV trucks grow. A pair of media helicopters flew above, but it appeared no one was home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the governor's mansion in St. Paul, eight to 10 journalists were on stakeout. Two young girls walked out briefly, then went back into the mansion, which is protected by iron gates. Pawlenty has two young daughters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he and his wife, Cindy, boarded a plane in Phoenix bound for Dayton, Ohio, reporters shouted a barrage of questions at the senator about whether he'd made up his mind. McCain wasn't biting. He flashed a double thumbs-up and boarded the plane. In an interview aired Thursday morning, McCain said he still hadn't made up his mind. Far from quieting speculation, this only fueled it as he sought to siphon attention from Democrat Barack Obama's acceptance of the presidential nomination in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months, McCain's vice presidential search process has been kept closely held by a small group of his advisers. But details have been trickling out this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This includes word from two Republicans that McCain met with his senior advisers Wednesday to discuss the pick, conflicting information about whether or not he had settled on a choice, and the campaign's announcement it would air a one-evening-only TV ad in battleground states around when Obama will be giving his prime-time acceptance speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the merits of selecting Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Joe Biden, D-Del., as his running mate, Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., made a huge tactical, strategic and political error in snubbing the most obvious candidate for vice president, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y. Obama looks surly, petty and selfish - and Clinton looks like a gracious loser who will live to fight the political game another day. The convention has been consumed by gossip about just why Obama didn't even consider her for the second slot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the public excuses are lame, and the inside story as it is coming out does not indicate the serious thought that he should have given to such an important decision. Senior Obama strategist David Axelrod said that Clinton would not be a &quot;good fit&quot; for the presidential candidate, as though Obama were merely trying on a pair of gloves. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others repeated the standard mantra that she was too emblematic of the status quo that Obama seeks to shatter. So we are to believe that Biden, a six-term senator who himself ran for president this year but got whipped in the Iowa primary, is a really fresh face with fresh ideas who embodies political change?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, something else was going on here. And it's probably not pretty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It looks as though Obama simply didn't have the courage to compete any more against the star power of his chief rival - and her husband. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not a good omen for standing up against tough world leaders with their own power and congressional leaders of both parties who are not inclined to march to his orders. Obama has an ambitious social and political agenda that will require shaking many sturdy trees in the political establishment if he is to succeed. The changes he supposedly represents will not come easily. How can he do this if he can't stand up to a woman who nearly beat him? His failure to select her is a sign of weakness, not strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tension among angry Clinton supporters at the Democratic National Convention could have been avoided if he had not treated her so cavalierly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign has its own, partisan explanation for this unnecessary dust-up enroute to a hoped-for united Democratic ticket. It has been running a commercial titled &quot;Passed Over,&quot; which asks the obvious question - why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It then repeats some of her primary campaign attacks on Obama and concludes: &quot;For speaking the truth.&quot; Actually, while they both traded jabs, she was not nearly as nasty as she could have been (avoiding the worst examples of his long devotion to that scary minister Rev. Jeremiah Wright, for instance) and certainly kinder than the Republicans are prepared to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another theory, advocated by many Hillary supporters, is that Bill is the basic problem. He was deeply offended by the Obama campaign's sly inferences that he might be racist - particularly since his political and personal record on civil rights has been progressive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary herself has been keeping her opinions to herself. But she has reportedly suggested to the Obama campaign they could cool it with Bill by simply acknowledging his policy accomplishments and efforts at racial reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Obama regularly beats up on bad policies of the past, without distinguishing the eight years under Clinton from the subsequent eight under Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton produced a budget surplus, good times and some progressive legislation. Bush spent the surplus on tax cuts for the rich, driving the economy into a tailspin. He waged an unnecessary war that lost American lives for an uncertain purpose, based on doctored intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's high-handed behavior ignores that old adage - it's better to keep your rivals spitting from inside the tent to the outside rather than from outside in. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a lesson here, but Obama has never learned it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denver | Sen. Hillary Clinton takes the stage at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday, a potentially pivotal moment that could help determine whether the party unifies behind Sen. Barack Obama or continues to harbor divisions that might help Republican Sen. John McCain take the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton stressed anew Monday that she supports Obama and wants the 18 million people who voted for her in the primaries to transfer their allegiance as well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are here for one purpose: to give the party momentum going into the general election so that come November, Barack Obama will become the president of the United States,&quot; she told supporters at a Denver hotel Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet signs of trouble for Obama persisted heading into her speech. About half of Clinton's supporters are still not sold on Obama, polls show, with some leaning his way and others saying flat out they'll vote for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain rushed out a new ad featuring a Clinton supporter saying she'd now vote for the Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a proud Hillary Clinton Democrat,&quot; said Debra Bartoshevich, a Wisconsin nurse who was removed as a convention delegate after she said she would cast her vote for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She had the experience and judgment to be president,&quot; Bartoshevich said in the ad. &quot;Now, in a first for me, I'm supporting a Republican, John McCain. I respect his maverick and independent streak, and now he's the one with the experience and judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also dispatched to Denver one of his most prominent female supporters, former Hewlett-Packard chairman and chief executive Carly Fiorina, to drive the point home. &quot;The Democratic Party is ... still divided,&quot; Fiorina said. &quot;They are not coalesced behind Barack Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton told delegates Monday that they should ignore McCain's&nbsp;ad. &quot;John McCain is sending a message,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm here to tell you my name is Hillary Clinton. And I do not support this message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A USA Today/Gallup Poll shows that fewer than half of Clinton supporters, 47 percent, are solidly behind Obama. Another 23 percent said they'd support Obama but might change their minds, and 30 percent said they'd vote for McCain. Obama will need every one of those votes if the November election is as close as the polls now suggest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has to do better,&quot; said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Polling Institute at Quinnipiac University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he wants to win the election, he needs to get the vast majority of Hillary supporters. Her strongest support is where he's weakest: white, working-class men and women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's camp was confident she'd use her Tuesday prime-time speech to deliver an enthusiastic call to support Obama. Ultimately, they said Monday, they think her supporters will come to Obama - though they conceded it might not happen this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no stronger surrogate for Sen. Obama among Sen. Clinton's supporters than Sen. Clinton,&quot; said senior Obama adviser and family friend Valerie Jarrett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we are confident as we come through this convention that our party will come together ... It might take a little time for some people to come around ... But we can't let the few voices distort the vast majority of her supporters that I do believe support Sen. Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.: &quot;Many are coming our way. ... It will take a little longer.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">644 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama has been flailing in response to the McCain campaign's new aggressiveness, consumed by crying foul. He's gone from hopemonger to whinemonger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hypersensitive and defensive, Obama seems obsessed with campaign tactics. This not only plays into the notion that he isn't tough enough, it keeps him from engaging forcefully on substance, especially on domestic issues where he has an advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the way ahead for Obama, don't look to his tetchy stump performances, but to his paid advertising. Obama's TV ads have taken clear aim at one of John McCain's vulnerabilities - the Republican offers less direct tax relief to the middle class.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's spots say he'll put &quot;the middle class first,&quot; that he'll &quot;cut taxes for working families,&quot; that he has &quot;a plan that cuts taxes for middle-class families three times as much as John McCain would,&quot; and under McCain, &quot;100 million Americans get no tax relief at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though their image is a shambles, Republicans are sending onto the field a presidential candidate who perhaps has the least to offer middle-class voters on taxes since the first George Bush in 1992. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, Bush lost that year to a Democrat promising only to raise taxes on &quot;the rich&quot; and to cut them for the middle class - exactly Obama's position now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his primary campaign, McCain had to endorse the extension of the Bush tax cuts he voted against in the Senate. But they have turned into a trap. Because Obama also wants to extend the middle-class aspects of the Bush cuts, McCain is left alone plugging for extending the cuts on higher earners. The same McCain who &quot;in good conscience&quot; opposed the original Bush package because it was too skewed to upper-income groups now is supporting a package that, relative to Obama's plan, is even more skewed to the top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not to mention the Bush tax cuts have the obvious branding problem of the moniker &quot;the Bush&quot; tax cuts. McCain might be worse off if they were called &quot;the Hoover&quot; tax cuts, but not by much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has gamely tried to play offense on taxes, although the Obama plan is a diminishing target. Obama has steadily focused his tax increases on families making $250,000 a year or more. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one ad, McCain had to reach back to an Obama vote on a budget resolution to accuse him of wanting to increase the taxes of people making as little as $42,000 a year - never mind that Obama plans to cut their taxes now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's middle-class tax cuts are a dog's breakfast of credits and giveaways. McCain's camp is right that the proposals are pandering, and that the Obama approach taken in its totality - higher taxes on investment, health-care mandates, massive new spending, etc. - will dampen growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when it comes to the economy, it's a cost-of-living election, with health-care costs and energy prices eroding workers' wages. This is why McCain's new support for offshore drilling has had such resonance. On the tax front, he offers families a doubling of the dependent exemption from $3,500 to $7,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sounds like a lot, but people down the income scale don't pay enough in income taxes for the exemption to make much of a difference, and for everyone else, McCain fully phases it in only in 2016. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless McCain finds a way to get more relief to middle-class families, he has an enormous weakness. Policy doesn't win or lose elections alone, but it can interact powerfully with a candidate's narrative. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Obama's best defenses against the notion that he's a celebrity-candidate aloof from average Americans is a tax plan that says he feels their pain. One of McCain's greatest risks of being branded &quot;Bush III&quot; and just a typical Republican is a tax plan crafted long ago by George W. Bush and tilted toward upper-income brackets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain can still adjust, and he'd better. Obama can't be counted on to complain all the way to November.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denver | On the eve of the Democratic National Convention, Barack Obama said Sunday that he hoped a week of political speechmaking would persuade reluctant middle-class voters to swing behind his bid for the White House, while Republicans sought to stir discontent among Hillary Rodham Clinton's supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton was having none of it. In a gesture of unity, Obama's rival in the bruising battle for the nomination was expected to release the delegates she won in primaries and caucuses, telling them in midweek they are now free to join her in supporting the victor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, bidding to become the first black president, campaigned through swing-state Wisconsin, then flew home to Chicago to work on the acceptance speech he will deliver before 75,000 partisans on the convention's closing night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previewing the week ahead, he said he hoped convention viewers would conclude, &quot;He's sort of like us. He comes from a middle-class background, went to school on scholarships. He and his wife had to figure out child care and how to start a college fund for their kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton outpolled Obama among working-class voters in many states through the winter and spring, and Sen. John McCain and the Republicans have worked relentlessly in more recent weeks to depict the Illinois senator as an elitist who is out of touch with blue-collar concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Democrats descending on their highly fortified convention city, party officials worked energetically to assure a harmonious week. Thousands of blue signs that read simply &quot;Unity&quot; were stockpiled inside the Pepsi Center for distribution to convention delegates at whatever moment Obama's high command deemed appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on a unanimous vote, the party's credentials committee restored full voting rights to delegations from Florida and Michigan. Both states were stripped of their voting rights earlier in the year in retaliation for holding primaries before party rules allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all Democrats know we are full partners,&quot; said Chris Edley Jr., a member of the panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats were meeting with public opinion polls giving Obama a modest advantage at best in the race to become the nation's 44th president. McCain has been on the political offense in recent weeks, and he has successfully cut into what had been a slightly more comfortable lead for the Democrat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Democratic unity was uppermost in the minds of Obama's aides, McCain had other ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican presidential contender's campaign readied a television commercial - there was no immediate evidence it had been broadcast - suggesting Obama had snubbed Clinton when he picked Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden as his vice presidential running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She won millions of votes but isn't on the ticket. Why? For speaking the truth,&quot; says the ad, which also shows Clinton criticizing Obama during their protracted battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former first lady has praised Biden's selection. In response to the ad, spokeswoman Kathleen Strand noted that Clinton &quot;has said repeatedly that Barack Obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country, getting us out of Iraq and expanding access to health care. John McCain doesn't. It's interesting how those remarks didn't make it into his ad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With McCain trying to use Clinton to divide the Democrats, Obama strongly defended his vice presidential choice, a selection that seemed designed to fill a gap in his own foreign policy resume while appealing to blue-collar voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's got the passion to lift up middle-class Americans, he hasn't forgotten his working-class roots, he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up,&quot; Obama told reporters before boarding his plane in Eau Claire, Wis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opening night convention program - featuring an appearance by Michelle Obama - was scripted to reach out to the same segment of the electorate. Officials said her remarks would present her husband - the son of a white mother from Kansas and a black father from Kenya who later left the family - as anything but elite. Barack Obama's half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, and Michelle Obama's older brother, Craig Robinson, also will have roles in the convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's address is the centerpiece of Tuesday's session, and given her appeal during the primaries, her remarks could prove pivotal to Obama's chances of success in the fall.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case you're wondering which books to read this fall, Michael Moore has a suggestion: Don't read any.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not the new fiction by Toni Morrison or Philip Roth or Stephen King. Not that policy book by Sen. Barack Obama, whom Moore is supporting for president; or Bob Woodward's latest on the Bush administration; or Thomas Friedman's manifesto on the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not even a little paperback meant as a handbook to the political campaigns. It's called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Mike's Election Guide 2008</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and it's written by a certain Academy Award-winning filmmaker and well known agitator named Michael Moore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There really is no time for any frivolity. People are already working two jobs to put gas in the tank, so they can drive from the first job to the second job. People need to spend as much of their free time as possible for candidates,&quot; says Moore, who believes that electing progressives will improve the economy, and in the long run, enable people to read more. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would rather you go and work for a local candidate then read my book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A multibillion-dollar industry has been built around such &quot;frivolity,&quot; and if Moore is looking for an argument - as he often is - he can begin with the team at Grand Central Publishing that's releasing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Mike's Election Guide</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Grand Central publisher Jamie Raab says she agrees with him &quot;on the issues, and on the importance of the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I don't agree about reading his book. If people are going to vote wisely, they need to understand what's at stake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booksellers, including officials at Amazon.com and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc., say the releases look surprisingly strong for a time when the public will supposedly be too preoccupied to care. Barnes &amp; Noble fiction buyer Sessalee Hensley says the literary work is as good as any in recent years, while Amazon's senior books editor, Brad Parsons, finds a &quot;nice mix&quot; of fiction and nonfiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some books might even appeal to two people likely to be among the busiest on Earth this fall: Obama, the Democrats' presumptive nominee, and his presumed opponent, Sen. John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has said he's a fan of John Updike, who will be releasing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Widows of Eastwick</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, his sequel to the best-selling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Witches of Eastwick</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Three writers cited favorably by Obama will have novels out: Marilynne Robinson, whose </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Home</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a companion to her Pulitzer Prize-winning </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Gilead</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; Morrison, with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A Mercy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, set on a plantation in the 17th century; and Roth, whose  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Indignation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> takes place on a Midwestern college campus in the 1950s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other anticipated titles include Kate Atkinson's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">When Will There Be Good News?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - the new literary crime thriller from the author of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Case Histories</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Wally Lamb, author of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">She's Come Undone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, has completed his first novel in a decade, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Hour I First Believed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Pulitzer Prize winner E. Annie Proulx has a new story collection, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Fine Just the Way It Is</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Booksellers also are hopeful about  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">2666</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, by the late Chilean author Roberto Balano, whose </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Savage Detectives</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a critical and commercial success last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I expect you'll see a lot of editorial excitement from us on that book,&quot; Parsons says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some fiction fits right into an election year, such as Christopher Buckley's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Supreme Courtship</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a satire of the judicial branch, and Curtis Sittenfeld's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">American Wife</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which fictionalizes first lady Laura Bush. Sittenfeld, author of the best seller </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Prep</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, continues a tradition of novelists imagining the private lives of American leaders, like such recent works as Pulitzer Prize winner Robert Olen Butler's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Intercourse</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a story collection that includes a peek into the bedroom of the current first couple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this world of celebrity, blogs and entertainment gossip television, we are intensely aware of public figures who perform the same function as mythological figures did in an earlier period,&quot; Butler says. &quot;It's our own private lives writ large.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought it was absolutely brilliant,&quot; Hensley said of Sittenfeld's book. &quot;When I first started to read it, I thought, 'Oh, it was going to be a hatchet job.' But I enjoyed it anyway. I was amazed with what she could do with so few pages at the beginning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Familiar names such as King, Michael Crichton, Candace Bushnell, Gregory Maguire, Dennis Lehane, Nelson DeMille, David Baldacci and Vince Flynn will be back. Sister Souljah has written a sequel to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Coldest Winter Ever</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which helped kick off the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Urban Lit</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> phenomenon. Anne Rice has a new book, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Called Out of Darkness</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a memoir that details her Christian faith and its influence on her vampire novels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publishers did hold some books until after Election Day, such as Patrick Tyler's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">World of Trouble</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a history of presidents and the Middle East that Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux will publish in December. Around the same time, Collins will release </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">My Word is My Bond</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a memoir by actor Sir Roger Moore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We just felt the media coverage would benefit from a clearer field postelection, and that is looking increasingly true,&quot; says Steve Ross, president and publisher of Collins, a HarperCollins division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three September releases that won't be overlooked: Obama's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Change We Can Believe In</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a policy book and collection of speeches; Woodward's fourth volume about the Bush administration; and Friedman's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Hot, Flat and Crowded</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, his first since the million-selling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The World Is Flat</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Topical works are scheduled from Moore, Paul Begala and Ann Coulter. Topical thoughts will be transmitted from ancient times through Garry Wills' translation of epigrams by the Roman satirist Martial, including a couplet that reads like an ode to campaign fundraising: &quot;I did not ask wealth for my own/It was just to make my rival groan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scholastic Inc., the U.S. publisher of the Harry Potter books, starts a new series this fall, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The 39 Clues</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 10 planned novels by 10 different authors, packaged with multimedia games, contests and trading cards, enhanced by a movie deal with Steven Spielberg.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richmond, Va. | Democrat Barack Obama on Thursday depicted John McCain as rich, out of touch and less a foreign-policy expert than he claims - part of the increasingly negative tone of the presidential hopeful's message as he tries to fight the perception that his campaign has stalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two national polls released Wednesday showed McCain has drawn almost even with Obama in the last few weeks, thanks to an aggressive new tone and a series of negative campaign commercials painting Obama as a tax raiser who is ill-prepared to lead in a dangerous world. That, in turn, has prompted Obama to step up his rhetoric against McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both an NBC News/</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Wall Street Journal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> poll and a CBS News/</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">New York Times</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> survey found Obama leading McCain by just 3 percentage points, 45 to 42 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a town hall meeting here, Obama was introduced by Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, widely believed to be on the short list of possible vice presidential contenders. The two met privately for about 15 minutes before the campaign appearance, and Kaine batted away questions about his prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to let the campaign speak for the campaign,&quot; Kaine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to supporters, Obama chided McCain for an interview he gave to the Politico Web site where he said he didn't know how many homes he owns. McCain's wife, Cindy, is an heiress to a large beer distributorship whose wealth is estimated to be at least $100 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're like me, and you've got one house, or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they don't lose their home, you might have a different perspective,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Rogers, a McCain spokesman, responded, saying: &quot;We're delighted to have a debate on judgment with Barack Obama, who bought his own million-dollar mansion in a shady deal with a convicted felon. Sen. Obama is obviously frustrated and abandoning his 'politics of hope' for negative personal attacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's gaffe was a lucky break for the Illinois senator, an Ivy League-educated millionaire who has battled GOP efforts to depict him as elitist and out of touch with working-class concerns. He and his wife, Michelle, own a home in Chicago purchased for $1.65 million in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also struck a defensive tone, saying that despite his limited experience on the national stage he has shown better judgment on foreign affairs than has McCain. The Arizona senator has run television ads casting Obama as a lightweight celebrity unready to be commander in chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against John McCain's anytime. Anytime,&quot; Obama said. He insisted the war in Iraq - which McCain strongly supported - was a mistake and that the so-called troop surge McCain championed has not produced the political reconciliation needed to achieve lasting peace there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think an objective analysis would say I've been right a lot more than he has, for all his years in Washington,&quot; Obama said, adding that he would consult with knowledgeable foreign policy advisers as president, including Republicans like Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel and Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also said McCain had no record of leadership on education policy or energy, which has emerged as a central issue in the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the Illinois senator also let on that he wasn't fully comfortable in the role of negative campaigner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the tactics of Karl Rove, Obama branded President Bush's longtime political adviser a leader of &quot;the politics of insult&quot; that had paralyzed Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who goes around spending all their time insulting people?&quot; Obama asked, even though he'd spent the better part of an hour talking tough on McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's dysfunctional, partly because of the politics of Karl Rove. and he's proud of it,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raleigh | Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama sharpened his message Tuesday night in Raleigh, seeking to tie the nation's troubled economy around the neck of his Republican opponent, John McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said the middle class was struggling, that housing foreclosures were the highest since the Great Depression and that gas prices were too high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Raise your hands,&quot; Obama said. &quot;How many people think you are better off than you were eight years ago?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a chorus of boos from the 2,500 people at the Exposition Building at the North Carolina State Fairgrounds. No hands were raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's North Carolina appearance came at a critical juncture. Obama is set to name his vice presidential choice during the next several days and is preparing for his nominating convention next week when Democrats gather in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidate has also been honing his message, stressing the country's economic problems under a Republican administration, as well as becoming more pointed in his criticism. The Illinois senator tried to cast doubt on McCain's reputation as a maverick, saying he voted with President Bush 90 percent time, and was now adopting Bush's political tactics. He also linked McCain to lobbyists and oil companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what their strategy is going to be,&quot; Obama said &quot;They are going to say, 'He is young and he's got a funny name and he's not patriotic enough.' We've seen this campaign before. They have been running this movie for a long time. It works for Republicans because it feeds into the real cynicism that people have about government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was Obama's second post-primary stop in North Carolina, each one in Raleigh, where Obama hopes to reach the high-tech workers and the transplants in the Triangle. Obama said the Bush administration has been &quot;anti-science.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has also been reaching out to more rural voters, talking about McCain's opposition to the farm bill that recently passed Congress. Obama had hoped to make a bus tour of eastern North Carolina on Tuesday, wending his way to Raleigh. But the plan was scratched when Obama's plane had difficulty leaving Orlando, Fla., because of Tropical Storm Fay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is making a major gamble in North Carolina - as well as Virginia and Georgia - by plowing considerable resources into states that have voted Republican in recent presidential races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has spent more than $2 million on television ads in North Carolina, has opened 16 campaign offices and reportedly has 150 paid staffers in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's North Carolina effort pales by comparison. McCain, for example, has run no commercials exclusively in the state. He has yet to have a public post-primary visit to the state, although he met privately with evangelist Billy Graham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear that Obama's gamble is paying dividends. A new poll, commissioned by the Civitas Institute, a Raleigh-based conservative organization, showed McCain leading Obama in the state, 46-40 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey of 600 voters was conducted August 14-17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The average for recent polls in North Carolina shows McCain with a 47-43 percent lead over Obama.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | The rich may be different for John McCain and Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On almost every issue, the two presidential candidates have staked out opposing positions. Their contrasting views on wealth surfaced during their back-to-back appearances in Southern California on Saturday night, when each was asked to define &quot;rich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama did not hesitate. &quot;I would argue that if you are making more than $250,000, then you are in the top 3, 4 percent of this country,&quot; he said. &quot;You are doing well.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain took a far more discursive approach to answering the question, but ultimately settled on a dramatically higher figure: &quot;I think if you're just talking about income, how about $5 million?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona Republican quickly added that he was &quot;sure that comment will be distorted,&quot; and his campaign said Sunday that he was joking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, the remark highlighted the candidates' disparate outlooks. Analysts who study income distribution said the answers appeared to reflect shifting political calculations more than economic reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, economists said in interviews Sunday, neither candidate was wrong - because there are no agreed-upon definitions for the terms that describe income segments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be fair to both of them, 'rich' is an adjective,&quot; said James P. Smith, a senior economist at the Rand Corp., a nonpartisan think thank based in Santa Monica,Calif. &quot;Economic science is not going to tell you that  'this' is the cutoff point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the $5 million level, Smith said, includes &quot;almost nobody.&quot; Experts said that of all the households in the nation, fewer than one-tenth of 1 percent have an annual income of $5 million or more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Goldstein, an economist for the Conference Board, a business-research group based in New York, said he would define &quot;rich&quot; as income around $500,000 or more. &quot;If you set the bar at half a million, you're talking about the top 1 percent of taxpayers. If you think about the last eight years, those are the folks who have benefited the most.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most ordinary Americans tend to massage the definitions of such terms in an attempt to crowd themselves into what many consider the least offensive category.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you do surveys, 95 percent of people think they are middle-class,&quot; said Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that has analyzed the candidates' tax proposals. &quot;This is including people who are objectively quite poor and people who are objectively quite rich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burman added: &quot;I guess it says something nice about America that rich people don't want to act like they're better than anybody else, and poor people don't like complaining about how tough it is to pay their bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates' answers may stem, in part, from their finances: From 2000 to 2004, before he began earning substantial royalties from his books, Obama and his wife reported income of between $207,000 and $275,000 on their tax returns. By contrast, McCain's wife's wealth has been estimated at more than $100 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But their positions were likely also driven by their tax policies. The Illinois Democrat has proposed tax hikes on individuals with incomes exceeding $250,000, while the Arizona Republican has declared his intention to extend the tax cuts begun by President Bush and make new cuts to corporate tax rates - both moves that would benefit the very wealthy. An analysis by the Tax Policy Center has calculated that the middle income earners would get a $325 tax cut from McCain's proposed changes to the tax code, while the top 20 percent would have their taxes reduced by $6,500.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Raleigh | Under a scorching sun, hundreds of people lined up recently in a parking lot here to pick up free back-to-school supplies being distributed by a local radio station. Bobbing among the shade umbrellas were a handful of workers for Sen. Barack Obama, carrying clipboards and voter registration forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday night, others fanned out at a movie screening for surfers in Wrightsville Beach. They descended on a street festival in Asheville. When oil companies posted record profits, Obama supporters showed up at gas stations here with registration forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the relentless heat, and midsummer lull, the Obama campaign is mobilizing in North Carolina. The state is one of half a dozen once-solid Republican bastions, including Georgia, Indiana and Virginia, where Democrats now sniff opportunity to expand the electoral map. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They hope that North Carolina's supersonic growth, especially among high-tech workers here in Research Triangle Park, will help change voting patterns that are decades old. But the Obama strategy relies on a surge among black voters and young people, two groups that have not turned out in great numbers in recent elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To that end, the Obama organization has been conducting an intense registration drive, appearing wherever people gather, as well as singling out potential voters in neighborhoods and online, and reaching out to undecided voters. It has also reactivated the extensive volunteer network it built before crushing Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton here in the May primary, and it is already running television commercials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain's campaign, by contrast, has been barely visible. But his camp says it is getting in gear, and it has history on its side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Carolina has not voted for a Democrat for president since Jimmy Carter in 1976. Even with a North Carolinian, John Edwards, on the ticket in 2004, the Democrats lost here in a landslide. But they say the state is ripe this year for picking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The dynamics here are different than they ever have been,&quot; said Marc Farinella, Obama's state director, pointing to the influx of about 600,000 people since 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Obama campaign would take advantage of this through an aggressive ground game, and would speak to both affluent workers and those upended by trade policies that have cost the state tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs. The campaign will also try to exploit McCain's opposition to a $300 billion farm bill approved by Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The race here will wind up being very tight,&quot; Farinella said. &quot;But I believe we'll wind up ahead - we've got the volunteers, the excitement, his call for economic change, the trade issue. A lot of these things make North Carolina fertile territory for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's political director and deputy campaign manager, Mike DuHaime, said the state was still fundamentally conservative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't disavow that on paper this could be closer than last time, and Obama is spending money,&quot; he said. &quot;My question is, can you move this 13, 14 points from where you were when you had a North Carolinian on the ticket?&quot; a reference to the vote spread in 2004 when Edwards and Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts lost to President Bush, 56 percent to 43.6 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The average of the latest polls here, as of Wednesday, showed McCain with a lead of 4.3 percentage points over Obama, a difference that is barely significant statistically. One unknown with a black candidate on the ballot here is whether voters are telling pollsters the truth about how they intend to vote. Another is whether Edwards' recently admitted affair will create a backlash against Democrats. Obama has spent more than $1.9 million on television commercials here since mid-June. He has opened 16 offices in the state since early July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His blueprint calls for deploying 625 teams, of four to six volunteers each, to blanket the state's 2,762 electoral precincts. So far, more than half the teams are in place, each with captains who are committed to contributing at least 10 hours a week. Almost 6,000 volunteers are actively engaged to some degree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama headquarters in Chicago would not confirm the number of paid staff it had in the various states, but the number in North Carolina is believed to be close to the estimated 150 it has deployed in another battleground state, Missouri, where McCain is two points ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, the McCain campaign, which has less money, is relying heavily for resources on the state party and the Republican National Committee. With their help, the McCain campaign opened its office here in the capital on Monday, and six others in the last two weeks. It has a dozen paid staff members, and has spent nothing on local television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic registration in the state is soaring, with 45,000 new registrants since May, and 7,000 new Republicans. About 44,000 have registered as unaffiliated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Bartlett, executive director of the State Board of Elections, said he expected more than 6 million people to be registered by the fall and that 4 million to 4.2 million would vote, up from 3.5 million who voted in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts say the key here for Obama will be raising the percentage of blacks who vote and winning over more whites than Democrats have previously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Definitely, there is the real potential for black voters to become a more substantial part of the electorate this year, and that's what it will take,&quot; said Tom Jensen, a Democratic pollster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2000, blacks made up 17.3 percent of the vote, and in 2004 they made up 18.6 percent, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections. To win this year, by Jensen's calculations, Obama needs blacks to make up 23 percent of the electorate while also winning at least 35 percent of the white vote. Others say he may need more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the rate of black registration (up 9.8 percent over 2004) is outpacing white registration (up 4.6 percent), but at the current rate blacks would make up only 20 percent of the electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Barr of Georgia, who is running for president as a Libertarian, may be a factor here in draining white votes from McCain. That could be a boon to Obama and might mean he could win with less than 50 percent of the total.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raising the percentage of white voters could be a challenge for him, as it was in the primaries. In 2004, Kerry won about 32 percent of the state's white vote, Jensen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Obama's positions, like his view that affirmative action should be applied by class, not race, and that the death penalty is acceptable in some cases, may appeal to these voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other positions, like his support for some regulation of guns, could prove more problematic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The jury is still out on Obama,&quot; said Gov. Mike Easley, a Democrat who supported Clinton. &quot;They're watching. He's new. Everyone is trying to figure out, 'Who is this guy?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said Obama could win by focusing on economic issues.  &quot;If people see Barack Obama watching out for them on the economy,&quot; Easley said, &quot;they'll vote for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Democrats often win state and local elections in North Carolina, they have a harder time at the national level. Usually they are perceived as more liberal than most North Carolinians, said Ferrel Guillory, an expert on Southern politics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, particularly on the bedrock issues of &quot;guns, God and gays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats who get elected in North Carolina are not Northeastern liberal Democrats,&quot; he said. In states like North Carolina, the McCain campaign is likely to make the cultural divide the fault line in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democrats who are successful in North Carolina and Virginia and other conservative states tend to be centrists and moderates, especially on the Second Amendment,&quot; DuHaime of the McCain camp said. &quot;No one would describe Obama as a centrist.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain recently tried to underscore his seriousness about pushing through a new energy policy, with a strong focus on more drilling for oil, by telling a motorcycle convention that Congress needed to come back from vacation immediately and do something about America's energy crisis. &quot;Tell them to come back and get to work!&quot; McCain bellowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sorry, but I can't let that one go by. McCain knows why. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was only five days earlier, July 30, that the Senate was voting for the eighth time in the past year on a broad, vitally important bill - S. 3335 - that would have extended the investment tax credits for installing solar energy and the production tax credits for building wind turbines and other energy-efficiency systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the wind and solar industries depend on these credits - which expire in December - to scale their businesses and become competitive with coal, oil and natural gas. Unlike offshore drilling, these credits could have an immediate impact on America's energy profile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain did not show up for the crucial vote July 30, and the renewable energy bill was defeated for the eighth time. In fact, John McCain has a perfect record on this renewable energy legislation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has missed all eight votes over the past year - which effectively counts as a no vote each time. Once, he was even in the Senate and wouldn't leave his office to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCain did not show up on any votes,&quot; said Scott Sklar, president of The Stella Group, which tracks clean-technology legislation. Despite that, McCain's campaign commercial running during the Olympics shows a bunch of spinning wind turbines - the very wind turbines that he would not cast a vote to subsidize, even though he supports big subsidies for nuclear power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama did not vote July 30 either - which is equally inexcusable in my book - but he did vote on three previous occasions in favor of the renewable-energy legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Congress has failed eight times to renew them is largely because of a hard core of Republican senators who either don't want to give Democrats such a victory in an election year or simply don't believe in renewable energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What impact does this have? In the solar industry today there is a rush to finish any project that would be up and running by Dec. 31 - when the credits expire - and most everything beyond that is now on hold. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider the Solana concentrated solar power plant, 70 miles southwest of Phoenix in McCain's home state. It is the biggest proposed concentrating solar energy project ever. The farsighted local utility is ready to buy its power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But because of the Senate's refusal to extend the solar tax credits, &quot;we cannot get our bank financing,&quot; said Fred Morse, a senior adviser for the American operations of Abengoa Solar, which is building the project. &quot;Without the credits, the numbers don't work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 2,000 construction jobs are on hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Efird is president of Suntech America - a major Chinese-owned solar panel maker that actually wants to build a new factory in America. They've been scouting the country for sites, and several governors have been courting them. But Efird told me that when the solar credits failed to pass the Senate, his boss told him: &quot;Don't set up any more meetings with governors. It makes absolutely no sense to do this if we don't have stability in the incentive programs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the biggest canards peddled by Big Oil is that, &quot;Sure, we'll need wind and solar energy, but it's just not cost effective yet.&quot; They've been saying that for 30 years. What these tax credits are designed to do is to stimulate investments by many players in solar and wind so these technologies can quickly move down the learning curve and become competitive with coal and oil - which is why some people are trying to block them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Richard K. Lester, an energy-innovation expert at MIT, notes, &quot;The best chance we have - perhaps the only chance&quot; of addressing the combined challenges of energy supply and demand, climate change and energy security &quot;is to accelerate the introduction of new technologies for energy supply and use and deploy them on a very large scale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, he argues, will take more than a Manhattan Project. It will require a fundamental reshaping by government of the prices and regulations and research-and-development budgets that shape the energy market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without taxing fossil fuels so they become more expensive and giving subsidies to renewable fuels so they become more competitive - and changing regulations so more people and companies have an interest in energy efficiency - we will not get innovation in clean power at the scale we need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is what this election should be focusing on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everything else is just bogus rhetoric designed by cynical candidates who think Americans are so stupid - so bloody stupid - that if you just show them wind turbines in your Olympics ad they'll actually think you showed up and voted for such renewable power - when you didn't.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DURHAM -- Barack Obama's aides say the Illinois senator can become the first Democratic Party presidential candidate to carry North Carolina since 1976 by focusing on the economy and capitalizing on the field organization he's built here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the right people, right priorities and right backdrop, it's not such a stretch,&quot; Marc Farinella, Obama's state director, said Wednesday in a conference call with reporters. &quot;This is a battleground state. We're going to win it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The confident talk from the Obama campaign came as it prepared to roll out a new television ad attacking presumptive Republican Party nominee John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-second spot will begin airing today. It will rip McCain for lining up behind President George W. Bush's position in 95 percent of the votes he cast last year in Congress, and for supporting continuation of the Iraq war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, Obama would put &quot;the middle class first&quot; by ending the war responsibly, improving schools and eliminating tax breaks for oil companies, according to a script of the ad released by his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farinella and Obama National Political Director Patrick Gaspard said the Democrat's campaign has already spent about $2 million on television spots in North Carolina. This is &quot;one of 18 states where we have a robust advertising program,&quot; Gaspard said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign is also busy training volunteers and intends to have forces active in every voting precinct in the state. Already, it has organized in 93 counties and has &quot;more than 5,850 volunteers doing work,&quot; Farinella said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's North Carolina field organization was one of the keys to his May 6 primary win over fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton. His win here that night effectively settled the party's nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls now show McCain with about a 4 percentage-point lead over Obama in this state, an edge within or close to the margin of error for most surveys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter their partisan preference, local observers agree Obama could win the state outright, like former President Jimmy Carter in 1976, or at the very least make things tight enough to force McCain to divert resources from other battlegrounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key is that anywhere from half to nearly two-thirds of the people who've been talking to pollsters say the economy is the country's most pressing issue, said John Hood of the GOP-leaning John Locke Foundation and Tom Jensen of Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hood believes voters' chief concern is inflation, more specifically the price of gasoline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With trends in consumer sentiment and fuel markets lining up almost exactly, &quot;it's the single most important number in American politics today,&quot; Hood said. &quot;You either have a credible message on that issue, or you don't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's aides on Wednesday addressed the point briefly, mentioning that the Exxon Mobil Corp. reported a $12 billion profit in April, May and June. But they also stressed that Obama and McCain have serious differences about trade and farm policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hood wasn't impressed by that move, saying trade and farming aren't &quot;what people are up in arms about.&quot; He said Obama could more profitably attack Bush administration easy-money policies that have fostered price increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jensen, however, said job losses definitely remain a concern, alongside fuel prices, for people worried about the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said that by invoking trade, Obama's emulating congressional candidates like U.S. Rep. Heath Shuler, D-11th, and Larry Kissell, the Democrat running against U.S. Rep. Robin Hayes, R-8th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By picking up on those issues, Obama could cut into the usual Republican margin in rural counties and pave the way for a win based on his showing in the cities, Jensen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pulling off both ends of that strategy is a must, he added. &quot;If he can't cut his losses with rural white voters, where Democrats tend to get slammed, he can't win,&quot; Jensen said, adding that he thinks Obama has about a 40 percent chance of winning here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hood is in the camp that thinks the Obama campaign is trying to bait McCain, though he also thinks that could work the Democrat to within a couple of percentage points of the lead come October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that point, McCain would have to respond, because given the GOP's presidential winning streak in North Carolina, this isn't a state he can afford to lose, Hood said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Obama can beat McCain here, &quot;the whole thing is over,&quot; Hood said. &quot;If he beats McCain in North Carolina, he's absolutely the president of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RALEIGH | Republican gubernatorial candidate Pat McCrory is airing a television advertisement about offshore drilling in part to challenge an ad from an outside group. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Charlotte mayor on Wednesday unveiled the first TV ad of his general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ad, McCrory said he supports deep-sea oil exploration as well as conservation. It says his challenger, Democratic Lt. Gov. Beverly Perdue, is 100 percent opposed to drilling. Perdue says the ad is untrue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCrory campaign strategist Jack Hawke says the campaign is paying $150,000 to run the ad for 10 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is designed in part to neutralize an ad by the Democratic-funded Alliance for North Carolina. Its ad criticizes McCrory's stand on the minimum wage and community college tuition but doesn't mention drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Easley talks up Obama strategy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RALEIGH | Barack Obama's presidential campaign says it's spent at least $2 million on television ads in North Carolina in its attempt to win the state in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama state campaign director Marc Farinella confirmed the amount Wednesday. He joined the campaign's national political director and Gov. Mike Easley in a conference call to talk about Obama's strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Democrat hasn't won North Carolina's electoral votes since 1976. But Obama has identified North Carolina as one of 18 battleground states where it's spending money on TV advertising early in the general election campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Easley said Obama will win because he understands the interconnection between education and a strong economy and Republican John McCain doesn't.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's almost as if they take pride in being ignorant,&quot; Barack Obama mused the other day, blasting Republicans for ridiculing his exhortation to the nation to make sure its tires are properly inflated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ah, behold the open-mindedness and cross-partisan understanding. Remember two years ago when Obama was only a media darling and not yet The Anointed One? Back then, his appeal was the extraordinary sensitivity he had for the views of others. He wrote a best-selling campaign book called The Audacity of Hope that was carefully unaudacious in its on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand weighing of the issues of the day, giving the impression that nothing pained him so much as not being able to agree with the other side, though he thoroughly understood and respected its arguments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That iteration of Obama was tossed under the bus long ago (no word on whether the tires were adequately inflated). It's been replaced by an Obama who ... between pauses gazing regally into the middle-distance during his orations ... betrays a dismissive contempt for all differences of opinion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody really thinks that Bush or McCain have a real answer for the challenges we face,&quot; he said, responding to a John McCain attack ad. Nobody does? Are all those people who vote Republican simply delusional? Or are they pretending to believe things that they really don't to conceal unseemly motivations ... power-hunger, bitterness, racism?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most elemental act of political civility is to concede the good motives of your opposition. Obama lately can't even muster that. Of course, sharp elbows will inevitably be thrown in a hotly contested election, but it's no accident that Obama's comments reading his opposition out of polite company ... or almost entirely out of existence ... came in response to mockery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is now such a puffed-up figure that he's vulnerable to the pinprick of ridicule. The most devastating hits against him in the Democratic primaries were made by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Saturday Night Live</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which made fun of him as an earnest empty suit propped up by a fawning media. Having failed to get much traction against Obama heretofore, the McCain campaign scored recently with a pointed but lighthearted ad comparing him to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton and the distribution of tire gauges to mock his tire-pressure comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent,&quot; Obama said of the tire gauges, suggesting that the making-fun particularly bothered him. Of the Spears/Hilton ad, Obama complained: &quot;They got me in an ad with Paris Hilton. You know, [I] never met the woman.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if the McCain campaign were literally suggesting that he and Paris coordinate on their Sidekicks about what clubs they're going to frequent after a long day of campaigning. Hilton, in contrast, got the joke and went up with a Web ad lampooning McCain that was defter and more effective than Obama's earnest plaint.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has to be hard for Obama to maintain a sense of proportion. First, it has become Democratic dogma that in reply to any Republican attack, a Democratic candidate has to hit back twice as hard. This makes it impossible to calibrate a response ... the only option becomes the nuclear option. Second, given the idolatry of the press and his most fervent supporters, Obama would need prodigious reserves of humility to keep from taking himself too seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the question of tire pressure, he was wrong when he said that properly inflating tires would save enough gas to make up for whatever oil we might get from more offshore drilling. But it's his critics who are ignorant (and proud of it!).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Obama is displaying the audacity of haughty. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first question I asked John McCain and then Barack Obama was: How do you feel about the tone and direction of the campaign so far?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No surprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men pronounced themselves thoroughly frustrated by the personal bitterness and negativism they have seen in the two months since they learned they would be running against each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very sorry about it,&quot; McCain said in a Saturday interview at his Arlington, Va., headquarters. &quot;I think we could have avoided at least some of this if we had agreed to do the town hall meetings&quot; together, as he had suggested, during the summer months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, in a phone interview Wednesday from Elkhart, Ind., argued that &quot;the classic tit-for-tat campaigning&quot; of recent weeks &quot;is part of the politics of the past that we have to move beyond.&quot; Ironically, having turned down McCain's proposal for weekly joint town halls, Obama argued that the formal debates, starting in late September, may refocus the campaign on real issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back on June 4, McCain proposed 10 joint town halls before screened audiences of uncommitted independent voters across the country. Obama countered by offering two such sessions this summer, one on Independence Day and one in August, and the idea died. Then Obama said he would participate only in the three debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, the first scheduled for Sept. 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the idea of joint town meetings was scrapped, the campaign has featured tough and often negative ads and speeches. They culminated last week with an exchange in which Obama said that McCain and his supporters were calling attention to the Democrat's unusual name and the fact that &quot;he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign in turn accused Obama of playing &quot;the race card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the interviews, both candidates expressed indignation at what was being said of them. &quot;I'm not going to be smeared,&quot; McCain declared. &quot;I went through that once and I'm not going to do it again. ... If anybody says I'm a racist ... I'm not going to stand for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama insisted that he had never made such an accusation. And he condemned McCain for suggesting that &quot;I would rather lose a war to win a political campaign. That is patently offensive. When his campaign ran an ad suggesting that I had refused to visit wounded troops because I couldn't have TV cameras with me, reporters immediately said that was patently false. ... I'm not going to sit back and let my record be distorted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked Obama if he had any regrets now about turning down McCain's early June invitation to start the joint appearances back then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said, &quot;I think the notion that somehow as a consequence of not having joint appearances, Senator McCain felt obliged to suggest that I'd rather lose a war to win a campaign ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also argued that &quot;We responded with an offer of doing five debates, rather than the traditional three, which the McCain campaign declined.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My general point,&quot; Obama continued, &quot;is that both the conventions and the debates will offer formats for Senator McCain and myself to make our best case to the American people at a time when the American people will be paying attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And ultimately, the best corrective to overly negative campaigns are the American people, who are not interested in a lot of bickering, but are interested in who's got the best answers for the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think everybody would agree to that last point.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | With Barack Obama stepping off the playing field for a weeklong Hawaiian vacation, John McCain's campaign released three new attack ads Friday, signaling that the senator from Arizona would use the void to continue pummeling the character of his rival for the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's trip to Hawaii, where he spent much of his youth, comes after a week in which his Republican opponent dominated the news with his negative assault. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama aides said the senator from Illinois is maintaining his lead in polls and will not be goaded into responding with character attacks of his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the assaults on him continued Friday, with new television ads and a radio spot portraying Obama as a lightweight celebrity intent on raising taxes across the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Life in the spotlight must be grand,&quot; a female announcer declares to paparazzi-like images of Obama and adoring chants in the background. &quot;But for the rest of us, times are tough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That advertisement and a Spanish-language ad and radio spot claim Obama voted to raise taxes on families earning just $42,000, a claim based on his vote for a nonbinding, Democratic budget resolution that allows all of President Bush's tax cuts to expire in 2011, something Obama has promised he would not let happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan called the ad &quot;a lie&quot; and &quot;part of the old, tired politics of a party in Washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain aides showed little concern for such niceties. &quot;Like it would have crossed our minds to let up on the guy just because he's on vacation?&quot; asked Charles R. Black Jr., one of McCain's top advisers, as McCain flew from Iowa to Arkansas on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Democrats are increasingly worried that trying to debunk the McCain attacks will not be enough, particularly with the candidate on vacation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee mocked Obama with &quot;Barack Obama's Hawaii Travel Guide,&quot; noting the elite prep school he attended on scholarship and highlighting a Chevron station selling gasoline for $4.78 a gallon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama did counter by airing a radio advertisement in Ohio taking McCain to task over the fact that his campaign manager lobbied on behalf of a German freight-shipping company, DHL, that is laying off more than 8,000 Ohioans and moving its operations to Kentucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an issue-based counterattack to McCain's character assault is not enough, worried Democrats say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It literally is the same old Democratic, consultant-driven politics,&quot; said Matt Stoller, a Democratic political consultant and blogger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the same attempt not to tell a story about the country and the other guy, but to prove you're right, like an academic debating seminar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign challenged Obama's&nbsp;ad in a conference call with Wilmington, Ohio, resident Mary Houghtaling, who in July tearfully challenged McCain to help with the job losses, then Friday praised the Republican while castigating Obama and calling for his campaign to take the radio ad off the air. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospice founder, whose husband is a pilot for DHL facing a layoff, joined in the attack, saying that &quot;Obama's going to be in Hawaii, swimming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Obama off the stage, the Democratic National Committee next week will try to take up the slack, delivering birthday cakes on the Aug. 14 anniversary of Social Security to McCain and Republican state headquarters and hitting McCain's support for carving out private investment accounts from fixed Social Security benefits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the DNC plans to hold what it calls a national day of action to paint McCain as a captive of Exxon Mobil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the media attention on McCain's ads, Obama campaign manager David Plouffe argued that the most important event of the campaign this week was McCain's trip to Ohio amid coverage of his and lobbyist-turned-campaign manager Rick Davis' role in helping DHL take over U.S.-based Airborne Express, and the subsequent loss of Ohio jobs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not since Iago and Othello obsessed on the comely Cassio, not since Richard of Gloucester killed his two nephews, not since Nixon and Johnson glowered at the glittering JFK, has there been such an unseemly outpouring of boy envy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Clinton, Jesse Jackson and John Edwards have all been crazed with envy over the ascendance of the new &quot;It&quot; guy, Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike his wife, Bill Clinton - the master of fake sincerity - still continues to openly begrudge his party's betrothed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by Kate Snow of ABC News in Africa whether Obama was ready to be president, Clinton gave a classic Clintonian answer: &quot;You could argue that no one's ever ready to be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As always, the Big Dog was more concerned with himself - asserting that he's not a racist - than his party. Bill Clinton is not a racist. We can posit that. But he did play subtle racial politics in the primary. It's way past time for him to accept the fact that there's a new wunderkind in town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as Bill Clinton looks at Obama and sees his own oblivion, so does Jesse Jackson. As Shelby Steele wrote in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Wall Street Journal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Jackson and his generation of civil rights leaders &quot;made keeping whites 'on the hook' the most sacred article of the post-'60s black identity,&quot; equality pursued by manipulating white guilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now John McCain is pea-green with envy. That's the only explanation for why a man who prides himself on honor, a man who vowed not to take the low road in the campaign, having been mugged by W. and Rove in South Carolina in 2000, is engaging in a festival of juvenilia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator who built his reputation on being a brave proponent of big solutions is running a schoolyard campaign about tire gauges and Paris Hilton, childishly accusing his opponent of being too serious, too popular and not patriotic enough. Even his own mother, the magical 96-year-old Roberta McCain, let slip that she thought the Hilton-Spears ad was &quot;kinda stupid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's 2000 strategist, John Weaver, was equally blunt with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Newsweek</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s Jonathan Alter: &quot;It's hard to imagine America responding to 'small ball' when we have all these problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of McCain's old pals in the Senate are cringing at what they see as his soulless transformation into what he once scorned. &quot;John's eaten up with envy,&quot; said one. &quot;His image of himself was always the handsome, celebrity flyboy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now somebody else is the celebrity,&quot; the colleague continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For McCain, being cool meant being a rogue, not a policy wonk; but Obama manages to be a cool College Bowl type, which must irk McCain, who liked to play up his bad-boy cool. Now the guy in the back of the class is shooting spitballs at the class pet and is coming off as more juvenile than daring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around the McCain campaign, they grouse that Obama &quot;hasn't bled.&quot; He hasn't bled literally, in military service, just like W., the last holder of an E-ZPass who sped past McCain. And he hasn't paid his dues in the Senate, since he basically just stopped by for directions to the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a new senator, Obama was not only precocious enough to pounce on turf that McCain had invested years in, such as campaign finance lobbying, ethics reform and earmarks. When Obama did reach across the aisle for a mentor, it was to the staid Richard Lugar of Indiana, not to the salty Republican of choice for Democrats, McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Illinois freshman took back a private promise to join McCain's campaign finance reform effort, McCain told his aide Mark Salter to &quot;brush him back.&quot; Salter sent an over-the-top vituperative letter to Obama. &quot;I guess I beaned him instead,&quot; Salter told </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Newsweek</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s Howard Fineman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain could dismiss W. as a lightweight, but he knows Obama's smart. Obama wrote his own books, while McCain's were written by Salter. McCain knows he's the affirmative action scion of admirals who might not have gotten through Annapolis without being a legacy. Obama didn't even tell Harvard Law that he was black on his application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain upbraids Obama for being a poppet, while he's becoming a puppet. His mouth is moving but the words coming out belong to his new hard-boiled strategist, Steve Schmidt, a Rove protege, nicknamed &quot;The Bullet&quot; for his bald pate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schmidt has turned Mr. Straight Talk into Mr. Desperate Straits. It's not a good trade.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York | Pop culture sure moves quickly. Just last week, Paris Hilton was so 20 minutes ago. And John McCain was drawing snickers from pop culture aficionados for choosing her and another relative has-been, Britney Spears, in his attack ad against Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now, with Hilton's cheeky video riposte to the McCain&nbsp;ad thrusting her back into our collective consciousness, she's current again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so the head spins: Does that mean John McCain is now cutting edge?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe. One thing, though, is clear: Politicians have long used pop culture references to bring a little spark to their campaigns, and it's a risky business. When you hit it just right, it can work wonders. But you'd better make sure you're up to date. Otherwise, a campaign can be accused of being, well, so 20 minutes ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is what pop culture scholars and humorists have been saying about whoever dreamed up McCain's Paris-Britney ad, which, you'll recall, juxtaposed images of the two with footage of Obama feted by adoring crowds in Berlin, suggesting Obama's celebrity was of the same inconsequential nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris Hilton and Britney Spears? &quot;Circa 2003!&quot; quipped Daniel Kurtzman, editor of the about.com political humor page. Marty Kaplan, a media analyst and a former Democratic speechwriter, imagined the ad had been dreamed up &quot;by some aging boomer at the campaign, late at night, surrounded by old issues of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political satirist Andy Borowitz, meanwhile, could only note that this was the same candidate who calls his opponent &quot;Dr. No&quot; - a reference to Obama's response to McCain's energy proposals. &quot;A 1962 James Bond movie - the kids today oughtta love that!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In seriousness, many have pointed out that McCain's&nbsp;ad, and a second one using Charlton Heston's Moses to mock Obama's soaring rhetoric, amount to a clever trick: turning what are some of Obama's greatest strengths into negatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Spears-Hilton ad, especially, has been roundly criticized for being either unfair, illogical or trivial, and not just by those with Democratic leanings. John Weaver - a former top McCain aide, now estranged from the candidate - has publicly called it &quot;childish&quot; and said: &quot;This tomfoolery needs to stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hilton, though, was game for a little tomfoolery herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her video, posted on the comedy site Funny or Die, the doe-eyed hotel heiress says, &quot;Hey America, I'm Paris Hilton, and I'm a celebrity, too.&quot; Since that &quot;wrinkly white-haired guy&quot; put her in one of his ads, she says, lounging in a leopard-print swimsuit with keyhole cutouts and metallic pumps, &quot;I guess that means I'm running for president.&quot; She fuses McCain's and Obama's energy talking points into her own succinct hybrid proposal, then announces she's off to find a VP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that she had the last word. &quot;Paris Hilton might not be as big a celebrity as Barack Obama, but she obviously has a better energy plan,&quot; said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this back-and-forth between a socialite most famous for a jail term and a sex video and the man who might be president could seem, to some, a dangerous blurring of the lines between pop culture and politics. But those who study such things say these lines have long been blurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we produce in this country more than anything is pop culture,&quot; said Todd Boyd, professor of popular culture at USC. It's natural, he said, that the two worlds sometimes merge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pop culture references in campaigns haven't always involved celebrities. Walter Mondale in a 1984 debate took the inventive step of channeling a well-known commercial. Of rival Democrat Gary Hart's policies, he asked: &quot;Where's the beef?&quot; It was, of course, the slogan of the classic Wendy's ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as far back as 1952, Dwight D. Eisenhower used newfangled Walt Disney animation in a groundbreaking TV ad - still viewable on YouTube - for his campaign against Adlai Stevenson. But arguably the most famous pop culture reference in a campaign - exquisite in its succinctness - was Richard Nixon's 1968 four-word appearance on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intoning the show's catch phrase, &quot;Sock it to me?&quot; (Nixon added the question mark.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 1992, candidate Bill Clinton knew how valuable it would be to play the saxophone on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Arsenio Hall Show.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And these days, it's a virtual rite of passage for candidates to appear on the late-night shows - sometimes, they even announce their candidacies on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when a politician veers into the attack mode of humor, it's more controversial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you get into mockery, that's where you potentially do more harm than good,&quot; Kurtzman noted.McCain himself has defended his recent ads as humorous. Whether he'll do more remains to be seen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe he can take a page from Paris Hilton's book. Of her VP options, she says in her video, &quot;I'm thinking Rihanna.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris-Rihanna '08? That could be cutting edge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Youngstown, Ohio | Democrat Barack Obama blamed Republican energy policies for some of the nation's economic woes Tuesday as his GOP rival John McCain advocated a large expansion of nuclear power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates roamed the economically depressed Rust Belt touting their energy plans as concerns about $4-a-gallon gasoline and job losses have emerged as the presidential campaign's hottest issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who has had some difficulty connecting with working-class whites, told an audience in a Youngstown, Ohio, high school gym that the Bush energy policy, crafted in large part by Vice President Dick Cheney, an ex- oilman, tilted to provide tax breaks and favorable treatment for Big Oil and that McCain would expand oil industry tax breaks by $4 billion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has proposed an excess profits tax on Big Oil to finance a $1,000-per-family energy rebate to deal with the high cost of gasoline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil giant Exxon-Mobil &quot;makes in 30 seconds what the typical Ohio worker makes in a year,&quot; Obama said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need more jobs and economic development. Why don't we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work? Nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside Detroit, McCain became the first presidential candidate in recent memory to tour a nuclear plant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His energy proposals include building 45 nuclear power plants by 2030 to reduce the nation's reliance on oil imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. Obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants 'doesn't make sense for America.' He also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing. I couldn't disagree more. I have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants. That means new jobs, and that means new energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug-in electric cars, we need electricity to plug into,&quot; McCain said at the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, nuclear power alone is not enough. Drilling alone is not enough. We need to do all this and more. That is why I am calling for an 'all of the above' approach.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Obama, McCain has  multibillion-dollar long-term plans to reduce oil imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With polls showing increasing numbers of voters favoring oil drilling off the U.S. coast, Obama has scrambled in recent days to add new elements to his overall long-term energy policy of promoting fuel-efficient autos and developing alternate energy sources. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dropped his total opposition to more oil drilling if a limited, environmentally careful offshore plan would help pass a long-term energy bill, and he reversed himself to advocate release of oil from the nation's strategic reserve to help drive down gasoline prices in the short run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Obama emphasized the key role of Cheney in Bush's energy policy, Republicans were quick to point out a contradiction in his criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Bush, he had an energy policy. He turned to Dick Cheney and he said, 'Cheney, go take care of this,' &quot; Obama said. &quot;Cheney met with renewable-energy folks once and oil and gas (executives) 40 times. McCain has taken a page out of the Cheney playbook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama himself voted for a 2005 energy bill backed by Bush that included billions in subsidies for oil and natural gas production, a measure Cheney played a major role in developing. McCain opposed the bill on grounds it included billions in unnecessary tax breaks for the oil industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has said the Illinois senator supported the legislation because it included huge investments in renewable energy. And Obama aides emphasized on Tuesday that Obama at the time had voted for an amendment to strip the legislation of the tax breaks for the oil and gas industries. When the amendment was defeated, he voted for the overall measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said, &quot;Barack Obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for Big Oil that he's campaigning against today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continuing to criticize McCain's energy program at an afternoon town hall at Baldwin Wallace College in Berea, Ohio, Obama noted that his own energy policy had won the support of oilman T. Boone Pickens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;T. Boone Pickens is about as conservative a guy as there is. That's a serious Republican. Oil man. Driller. He says we can't drill our way out of the problem. I think he knows more about it than John McCain,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pickens said Monday he was &quot;strongly encouraged by Sen. Obama's speech on America's energy future. Foreign oil is killing our economy and putting our nation at risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pickens has been on a $58 million publicity tour to promote his plan to erect wind turbines in the Midwest to generate electricity, replacing the 22 percent of U.S. power produced from natural gas. The freed-up natural gas then could be used for transportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also produced a new TV ad that emphasized his independent streak to counter Obama's charges that he's the same as President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Washington's broken. John McCain knows it. We're worse off than we were four years ago,&quot; says the ad. &quot;He's the original maverick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only McCain has taken on big tobacco, drug companies, fought corruption in both parties,&quot; the ad says. &quot;He'll reform Wall Street, battle big oil, make America prosper again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's all about arugula, this presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain camp has been telling us that as a way, I suppose, of suggesting that Barack Obama should be dismissed as, well, just not one of us - not a real American. (After all, wasn't he born in Hawaii or some other Asian country?) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCainians have been in a tizzy lately about arugula. You could Google it up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authentic Americans apparently eat iceberg lettuce, if they're wussy enough to eat any greens at all. And never mind that arugula, which sounds ritzier than it is, is in the produce bins of just about every grocery store and is common in restaurants' house salads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, it is being declaimed, marked himself off from real people by mentioning arugula while discussing farm economics, as an example of a product that, cheap from the field but pricey at the store, leaves most of its profit in the hands of middlemen. Arugula! OMG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This assault by arugula is part of a broader campaign from McCain to turn his opponent in the minds of voters into a creature at once exotic and flimsy, certainly not a firmly stitched part of the American quilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same game that was run with great success against Al Gore eight years ago and against John Kerry four years back. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be a bit of a surprise coming from John McCain, who promised better. But, then, that was before he imported operatives from Karl Rove's political chop-shop into his works, at the urging of Republican heavyweights worried that McCain was flopping. The specialty of the Bush-Rove campaigns was character assassination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gore was ridiculed as a smarty pants, with the implied assumption that the last sort of person Americans should want as their president was someone thoughtful and knowledgeable. Providence and Bush have spared the nation from that fate for the last eight years. To do in Gore, the Bush campaign worked up a catechism of Gore's crazy boasts and lies - remember inventing the Internet? - every one of which was either a lie itself or grossly misleading. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the many newspapers whose investigations exposed the political fraud couldn't stop themselves from repeating the claims, demurrer forgotten, throughout the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Kerry, a much-decorated Navy veteran of the Vietnam war, was smeared as nearly a traitor by a slanderous campaign that attacked his service, even as the Navy, reviewing its files, reaffirmed his record. To boot, Kerry was ridiculed for knowing French and giggled at for silly-billy windsurfing, in fact a strenuous sport but one largely alien to the Great Plains and the mountain states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So now McCain&nbsp;commercials pair Obama with photos of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, although he has never been known to go clubbing without underpants. The point is to dismiss him as just another celebrity which, oddly, only calls attention to his popularity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a current offering on McCain's YouTube site ridicules Obama as - ha-ha - &quot;The One,&quot; a preening, messianic pretender, like Charlton Heston, no less, playing Moses, thunderbolts and all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forget any hope this campaign might be better than the last two. John McCain has chosen to present himself for the presidency with the sneers, and in the ever-mocking voice, of Rush Limbaugh.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; Pg. 7A</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">761 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gee, I wonder why, if you have a black man running for high public office - say, Barack Obama or Harold Ford - the opposition feels compelled to run low-life political ads featuring tacky, sexually provocative white women who have no connection whatsoever to the black male candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spare me any more drivel about the high-mindedness of John McCain. You knew something was up back in March when, in his first ad of the general campaign, McCain had himself touted as &quot;the American president Americans have been waiting for.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was nothing subtle about that attempt to position Obama as the Other, a candidate who might technically be American but who remained in some sense foreign, not sufficiently patriotic and certainly not one of us - the &quot;us&quot; being the genuine red-white-and-blue Americans who the ad was aimed at.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, McCain has only upped the ante, smearing Obama every which way from sundown. On Wednesday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Washington Post</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ran an extraordinary front-page article that began:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For four days, Sen. John McCain and his allies have accused Sen. Barack Obama of snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him, despite no evidence that the charge is true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence? McCain needs no evidence. His campaign is about trashing the opposition, Karl Rove-style. Not satisfied with calling his opponent's patriotism into question, McCain added what amounted to a charge of treason, insisting that Obama would actually prefer that the United States lose a war if that would mean that he - Obama - would not have to lose an election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, from the hapless but increasingly venomous McCain campaign comes the slimy  Britney Spears and Paris Hilton ad. The two highly sexualized women (both notorious for displaying themselves to the paparazzi while not wearing underwear) are shown briefly and incongruously at the beginning of a commercial critical of Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee targeted Harold Ford with a similarly disgusting ad in 2006 when Ford, then a congressman, was running a strong race for a U.S. Senate seat in Tennessee. The ad, which the committee described as a parody, showed a scantily clad woman whispering, &quot;Harold, call me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both ads were foul, poisonous and emanated from the upper reaches of the Republican Party. (What a surprise.) Both were designed to exploit the hostility, anxiety and resentment of the many white Americans who are still freakishly hung up on the idea of black men rising above their station and becoming sexually involved with white women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racial fantasy factor in this presidential campaign is out of control. It was at work in that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">New Yorker</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cover that caused such a stir. (Obama in Muslim garb with the American flag burning in the fireplace.) It's driving the idea that Obama is somehow presumptuous, too arrogant, too big for his britches - a man who obviously does not know his place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has to endure these grotesque insults with a smile and heroic levels of equanimity. The reason he has to do this - the sole reason - is that he is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So there he was this week speaking evenly, and with a touch of humor, to a nearly all-white audience in Missouri. His goal was to reassure his listeners, to let them know he's not some kind of unpatriotic ogre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama told them: &quot;What they're going to try to do is make you scared of me. You know, he's not patriotic enough. He's got a funny name. You know, he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills, you know. He's risky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The audience seemed to appreciate his comments. Obama was well-received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain didn't appreciate them. RACE CARD! RACE CARD! The McCain camp started bellowing, and it hasn't stopped since. With great glee bursting through their feigned outrage, the campaign's operatives and the candidate himself accused Obama of introducing race into the campaign - playing the race card, as they put it, from the very bottom of the deck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever you think about Obama, he does not want the race issue to be front and center in this campaign. Every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for McCain. So I guess we understand McCain's motivation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, it's frustrating to watch McCain calling out Obama on race. Obama has spoken more honestly and thoughtfully about race than any other politician in many years. McCain is the head of a party that has viciously exploited race for political gain for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's obviously more than willing to continue that nauseating tradition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When John McCain assumed the mantle of presumptive Republican nominee, he laid out a clear game plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Americans want more respectful campaigns,&quot; he said this spring. With that in mind, McCain's campaign manager pledged - in writing - that the GOP message would focus on the Arizona senator's vision, leadership and experience. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They forgot to mention Britney Spears and Paris Hilton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second-rate starlets steal the show in one of McCain's new campaign ads, which suggests that Barack Obama is a celebrity - not a serious political candidate. What, precisely, the former law professor-turned-U.S. senator has in common with celebutantes who make headlines for failing to don underwear remains an open question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questioning Obama's level of experience is fair game. But McCain has laid down a nasty marker, making clear that with more than three months to go, this will be ugly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second McCain&nbsp;ad distorts Obama's reasons for canceling a visit with wounded soldiers, noting that the Democrat  &quot;made time to go to the gym.&quot; (Strangely, the commercial then shows Obama shooting hoops with American troops.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Absent from both commercials is a sense of McCain's vision, leadership or experience. In recent weeks, McCain lamentably has more often turned his attention to mocking his opponent rather than making a sustained case for his own candidacy. ... </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain does voters a disservice by creating a caricature of his opponent instead of explaining their many differences on issues. ...</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DCVB report tells us little about city's crime problem</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest propaganda from the Durham Convention and Visitors Bureau (DCVB) is a publication titled, &quot;2007 Crime Comparative.&quot; The purpose of the study reads like a true marketing spin document since &quot;it is designed to put crime reduction efforts into perspective ...&quot; Also, reading the DCVB vision statement; &quot;It's the defender of Durham's image and brand and guardian of its unique sense of place&quot; raises questions on the accuracy and unbiased nature of this Durham crime report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DCVB study compares Durham to 10 other Southeast communities with similar population and socioeconomic makeup and concludes that Durham ranks low in violent crime. But DCVB is reporting an &quot;average&quot; crime ranking which is of itself a meaningless statistic. People are not victims of &quot;average&quot; crimes, but of actual ones. Much more meaningful crime statistics are the actual number of crime offenses committed in Durham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The N.C. Department of Justice published an annual summary report titled &quot;Crime in North Carolina - 2007.&quot; Actual Durham crime rates are a mixed result. Murders and burglaries increased in Durham in 2007. But other crimes are on the decrease. Overall, violent and property crime rates decreased 2 percent from 2006-2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DCVB does a disservice to Durham's citizens by publishing an unenlightening and frankly, misleading &quot;study&quot; on Durham's crime rate. Also, The Herald-Sun does a disservice to its readers by acting as a DCVB mouthpiece by parroting whatever propaganda is floated and not doing the due diligence of good investigative reporting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ad was scandalous</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It now seems the John McCain campaign has hit a new low. It ran a TV ad debasing Barack Obama and calling him a &quot;rock star.&quot; It also pictured him with two &quot;star&quot; females -- both white, both young and both of whom have been in trouble recently. Even a senior Republican strategist called the latest ad a &quot;wild swing at Obama&quot; that reflects McCain's campaign's &quot;increasing bitterness&quot; and the lack of &quot;any coherent strategy to elect McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Whoopi Goldberg the only one who has picked up on the subliminal, racist strategy of showing Obama with two sexy white women? Maybe as the campaign really gets underway, the Republicans will pull out the real racist card and not be so subtle about it. I do not put it beyond them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, it seems McCain has forgotten an old adage that says: &quot;If the only way you can look good is to make the other guy look bad, then something is wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil spills were meaningful</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James B. Smith, who in a July 30 letter winningly called us &quot;a nation of liars,&quot; claims that there were no meaningful oil spills resulting from hurricanes Katrina and Rita. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, about 740,000 gallons of oil were spilled from offshore facilities during Katrina and Rita. Maybe that's not much to our letter writer, but it seems like a lot of oil to me. It does pale in comparison with the 8 million gallons of oil released by the same storms from inland facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter writer further claims that only a tiny fraction of offshore oil is spilled, but that statistic ignores the fate of the rest of the oil. We burn most of it -- out of the tailpipe and up the chimney. Every gallon of gasoline burned spews 19 pounds of carbon dioxide into our atmosphere. In the short 150 years that we have been using petroleum for fuel, atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased to the highest level seen for the last 400,000 years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's awfully early for John McCain to be running such a desperate, ugly campaign against Barack Obama. But I guess it's useful for Democrats to get a reminder that the Republican Party plays presidential politics by the same moral code that guided the bad-boy Oakland Raiders in their heyday: &quot;Just win, baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest bit of snarling, mean-spirited nonsense to come out of the McCain camp was the accusation, leveled by campaign manager Rick Davis, that Obama had &quot;played the race card.&quot; He did so, apparently, by being black. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, at a campaign stop in Missouri, Obama had predicted that Republicans would try to &quot;make you scared of me. You know, 'he's not patriotic enough, he's got a funny name,' you know, 'he doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills.' &quot; So what does Davis do? He promptly tries to make voters scared of Obama by feigning outrage over the presumptive Democratic nominee's &quot;divisive, negative, shameful and wrong&quot; remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course the McCain campaign isn't really offended that the first black major-party candidate for president in American history might mention this distinction from time to time. The idea is to slow Obama down before he runs away with this thing, and the weapon of choice is handfuls of mud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember St. John the Reformer, who promised a high-minded campaign and said he wouldn't question his opponent's patriotism? Clearly, he's been replaced by an evil twin. The switch seems to have taken place during his opponent's world tour, when Obama's prescriptions for Iraq and Afghanistan began to look prescient - and McCain's began to look irrelevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain kept saying that Obama &quot;doesn't understand&quot; the war zones - even though the president of Afghanistan, the prime minister of Iraq and even U.S. military officials on the ground seemed to think Obama understood both situations quite well. McCain then resorted to the outrageous charge that Obama &quot;would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign.&quot; I think that qualifies as an allegation that Obama is &quot;not patriotic enough,&quot; don't you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, the McCain campaign has sharply escalated its rhetorical attacks - making blatantly false claims, for example, about a canceled visit with injured troops in Germany. The blitz has been successful in focusing attention on McCain. Much less clear is whether voters really want to elect Don Rickles as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The low point, so far, is McCain's bizarre ad that flashes images of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears before showing Obama in Berlin addressing the multitudes. In what promises to be a major attack theme, the ad derides Obama as &quot;the biggest celebrity in the world&quot; - an attempt to turn Obama's popularity into some kind of fatal flaw. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a classic attempt to take a positive and turn it into a negative, as was done with John Kerry's heroic service in Vietnam by the odious Swift boat campaign. All this gnashing and flailing would be laughable if it weren't so purposeful. The aim is to portray Obama as handsome and popular but insubstantial. Oh, and not that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">we</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would ever mention such a thing, but did you notice that Obama had the audacity to mention that he's African-American?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has been quick to respond with new television ads accusing McCain of practicing the &quot;old politics.&quot; Kerry's unhappy experience showed that this kind of define-your-opponent blitzkrieg, however ridiculous, has to be answered immediately - and in kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negative campaigning is not a pretty thing, and it should be beneath John McCain to stoop so low. But Democrats would be foolish to forget that sometimes it works.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York | Have you ever thought about bringing an 8-foot-tall burning torch to a political rally? What about drinking John McCain-brand juice?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those gestures may sound creepy today, but burning torches were one of the first examples of American campaign memorabilia in the 1800s. And presidential nominees in the 1960s had their names emblazoned on juice cans, including Barry Goldwater's &quot;gold water&quot; - &quot;The right drink for the conservative taste.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't all witch-hunting and thirst-quenching; there was plenty of potty humor, too. In fact, early American campaign memorabilia makes today's wry slogans on T-shirts look tame. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some trinkets were signs of the times never to be seen again, like the McKinley parasol, the Eisenhower cigarette pack and the Kennedy paper dress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others have evolved. The political button may have gotten its start as coat buttons like the ones made to commemorate Washington's inauguration in 1789, said Sara Henry, deputy director and chief curator of the Museum of the City of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This brass button says 'Long live the president,' and this one has his initials in the middle,&quot; she said, pointing to the encased artifacts. The buttons are part of the exhibit &quot;Campaigning for President: New York and the American Election,&quot; which is open at the museum through Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was not until the middle of the 19th century when all white men got the vote - as opposed to just land owners - that political parties used memorabilia to &quot;sell&quot; candidates to the masses, Henry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tall torches adorned with photos of candidates were passed out during rallies and parades to light the dark streets. Paper lanterns decorated with a candidate's picture, a rare item because most burned, were also used for campaigning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Henry Harrison, elected in 1841, is said to be the first candidate to actively campaign for president, said Larry Bird, curator of the Division of Politics and Reform at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. In addition to torch poles topped with his signature log cabin, the campaign made domestic items such as women's brushes and sewing boxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was plenty of negative campaigning, too. One of the earliest examples at the New York exhibit is the Grover Cleveland and Allen Thurman chamber pot from 1888. Then there are the William McKinley pigs. Playing on the phrase, &quot;In a pig's ass, I'd vote for McKinley,&quot; the little pigs have a hole at the rear that you can look through and see a picture of McKinley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You do see a lot of potty humor in American politics,&quot; Henry said. &quot;We haven't included a lot of it in the exhibit because much of it is just so juvenile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Jennings Bryan, a candidate from about 1896 to 1913 and known for his long speeches, was frequently represented by a coffin along with the phrase, &quot;Talked to death.&quot; And then there's the McKinley doll. The porcelain and cloth doll, when held upright, is McKinley. When turned upside down, it's an African-American baby, referring to the accusation he fathered an illegitimate black child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1944, a poster impugned vice presidential candidate Harry Truman on the basis of his Southern background by drawing him in a Ku Klux Klan outfit. More functional items are the Reagan slippers, the comb to &quot;Comb Nixon out of your hair,&quot; and the Kerry flip-flops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The post-World War II era was the heyday of memorabilia, says Bird. &quot;I like Ike&quot; nylon stockings were created at a time when women started to expose more of their legs. And as technology advanced, so did the political button, which started off as a lithograph printed directly on metal, says Mort Berkowitz, who has thousands of buttons going back to the 1800s and is also known as &quot;the Button Man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the '60s came the quirky juices like Goldwater's and the Lyndon Johnson juice can - &quot;A drink for health care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was political but also social,&quot; Bird said. &quot;That's what's changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When campaigning on television became standard, the focus began to shift. Buttons got bigger, presumably to play to the TV cameras. Candidates spent more money on commercials than tchotchkes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bird recalls being unable to get a button at the New Hampshire campaign office for Democratic candidate Paul Simon in 1988, although he could watch a video of the candidate's biography. &quot;If I'm a candidate, I'd rather have a million people wearing my button than I would have someone just watch my television commercial,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's impossible to know which products from today's campaigns will be collector's items, although we may go ahead and decide that the Barack Obama thong was a bad idea. But Bird says despite all the changes, the underlying purpose always remains the same: to feel a part of it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a need for people who want to participate to have material with which to express themselves,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orlando, Fla. | Republican candidate John McCain's presidential campaign is cynical, not racist, in its efforts to distract voters from real issues, Democratic rival Barack Obama said Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In no way do I think that John McCain's campaign was being racist,&quot; Obama said in his first meeting with reporters since predicting that McCain and other Republicans would try to scare voters because Obama looks unlike &quot;all those other presidents on the dollar bills&quot; - most of them older white men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think they're cynical,&quot; he said. &quot;And I think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the McCain campaign's claim that Obama had &quot;played the race card&quot; - one McCain spokesman had suggested that McCain was being painted as a racist - Obama called the criticism an attempt to alter the campaign's focus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added of the Republicans' approach: &quot;They're very good at negative campaigning. They're not so good at governing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Canaveral, Fla. | Sen. Barack Obama said on Saturday that he would reluctantly consider accepting some new offshore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico in exchange for stripping oil companies of tax breaks and extending several tax credits to spur the search for alternative fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Senate Republicans appear to have dropped their insistence on opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has until now opposed any new offshore drilling. But in a wide-ranging news conference Saturday morning, he noted that there have been &quot;very constructive&quot; talks in recent days, and he applauded an $84 billion plan unveiled by a group of Republican and Democratic senators to permit such drilling while supporting an effort to convert most vehicles to using alternative fuels in the next 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise, where I have to accept some things that I don't like in order to get energy independence, that's something I will have to consider,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, he cautioned that he is not yet &quot;ready to sign off on any approach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to Obama's shift, the campaign of Sen. John McCain, his Republican opponent, who favors an aggressive expansion of offshore drilling on every coast, quickly accused the Democrat of flip-flopping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | Democratic candidate Barack Obama on Saturday backed away from rival John McCain's challenge for a series of joint appearances, agreeing only to the standard three debates in the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, when a McCain adviser proposed a series of pre-convention appearances at town hall meetings, Obama said, &quot;I think that's a great idea.&quot; In summer stumping on the campaign trail, McCain has often noted that Obama had not followed through and joined him in any events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's reversal on town hall debates is part of a play-it-safe strategy he's adopted since claiming the nomination and grabbing a lead in national polls. Advisers to the Illinois senator, speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss strategy, say Obama is reluctant to take chances or give McCain a high-profile stage now that Obama's the front-runner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c6">McCain asks congressman Cantor for records</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richmond, Va. | U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia has been asked for &quot;personal documents&quot; by John McCain's campaign, a Republican knowledgeable with the discussions said Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cantor, 45, the chief deputy minority whip in the House, has been mentioned among several Republicans as a possible running mate for McCain, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican familiar with the conversations between Cantor and the McCain campaign said Cantor has been asked to turn over documents, but did not know specifically what records were sought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because neither the McCain campaign nor Cantor's office wishes to discuss the running mate selection process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | It is a tradition at many kitchen tables to yell at the newspaper. At John McCain's kitchen table, it is becoming a tradition to yell at one paper in particular: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The New York Times</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest dustup centered on the editorial board's back-to-back criticisms of McCain, one dispatch accusing him of taking the low road and another contending that he was playing politics with race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second editorial, which appeared on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Times</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Web site, said McCain's ads conjured up loaded racial images and raised the specter of O.J. Simpson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The presumptive Republican nominee has embarked on a bare-knuckled barrage of negative advertising aimed at belittling Mr. Obama,&quot; the editorial board wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response from the McCain campaign was equally cutting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the shareholders of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The New York Times</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ever wonder why the paper's ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking, they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the paper's editors to any slight, real or imagined, against their preferred candidate,&quot; said McCain campaign spokesman Michael Goldfarb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldfarb compared the editors to a blogger &quot;sitting at home in his mother's basement and ranting into the ether between games of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; Pg. 8E</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">801 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently the Web site Politico asked Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, why she was blocking attempts to tack offshore drilling amendments onto appropriations bills. &quot;I'm trying to save the planet; I'm trying to save the planet,&quot; she replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm glad to hear it. But I'm still worried about the planet's prospects. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, Pelosi's remark was a happy reminder that environmental policy is no longer in the hands of crazy people. Remember, less than two years ago Sen. James Inhofe - a conspiracy theorist who insists that global warming is a &quot;gigantic hoax&quot; perpetrated by the scientific community - was the chairman of the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond that, Pelosi's response shows that she understands the deeper issues behind the current energy debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most criticism of John McCain's decision to follow the Bush administration's lead and embrace offshore drilling as the answer to high gas prices has focused on the accusation that it's junk economics - which it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A McCain campaign ad says that gas prices are high right now because &quot;some in Washington are still saying no to drilling in America.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's just plain dishonest: the U.S. government's own Energy Information Administration says that removing restrictions on offshore drilling wouldn't lead to any additional domestic oil production until 2017, and that even at its peak the extra production would have an &quot;insignificant&quot; impact on oil prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's even more important than McCain's bad economics, however, is what his reversal on this issue - he was against offshore drilling before he was for it - says about his priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back when he was cultivating a maverick image, McCain portrayed himself as more environmentally aware than the rest of his party. He even co-sponsored a bill calling for a cap-and-trade system to limit greenhouse gas emissions (although his remarks on several recent occasions suggest that he doesn't understand his own proposal). But the lure of a bit of political gain, it turns out, was all it took to transform him back into a standard drill-and-burn Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the planet can't afford that kind of cynicism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In themselves, limits on offshore drilling are only a modest-sized issue. But the skirmish over drilling is the opening stage of a much bigger fight over environmental policy. What's at stake in that fight, above all, is the question of whether we'll take action against climate change before it's utterly too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true that scientists don't know exactly how much world temperatures will rise if we persist with business as usual. But that uncertainty is actually what makes action so urgent. While there's a chance that we'll act against global warming only to find that the danger was overstated, there's also a chance that we'll fail to act only to find that the results of inaction were catastrophic. Which risk would you rather run?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Weitzman, a Harvard economist who has been driving much of the recent high-level debate, offers some sobering numbers. Surveying a wide range of climate models, he argues that, overall, they suggest about a 5 percent chance that world temperatures will eventually rise by more than 10 degrees Celsius (that is, world temperatures will rise by 18 degrees Fahrenheit). As Weitzman points out, that's enough to &quot;effectively destroy planet Earth as we know it.&quot; It's sheer irresponsibility not to do whatever we can to eliminate that threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now for the bad news: sheer irresponsibility may be a winning political strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's claim that opponents of offshore drilling are responsible for high gas prices is ridiculous - and to their credit, major news organizations have pointed this out. Yet McCain's gambit seems nonetheless to be working: public support for ending restrictions on drilling has risen sharply, with roughly half of voters saying that increased offshore drilling would reduce gas prices within a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence my concern: if a completely bogus claim that environmental protection is raising energy prices can get this much political traction, what are the chances of getting serious action against global warming? After all, a cap-and-trade system would in effect be a tax on carbon (though McCain apparently doesn't know that), and really would raise energy prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only way we're going to get action, I'd suggest, is if those who stand in the way of action come to be perceived as not just wrong but immoral. Incidentally, that's why I was disappointed with Barack Obama's response to McCain's energy posturing - that it was &quot;the same old politics.&quot; Obama was dismissive when he should have been outraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So as I said, I'm very glad to know that Nancy Pelosi is trying to save the planet. I just wish I had more confidence that she's going to succeed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesse Jackson must have been forgiven by the Obama campaign and welcomed into its inner circle. Because it sure seems as if he's giving the campaign advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to a McCain&nbsp;ad knocking him as a world celebrity, Barack Obama essentially accused the McCain campaign of race-baiting. It was a hair-trigger resort to the charge of racism of the sort that Jackson built a career on, making himself radioactive and anathema to the political center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 24 hours, Obama had lurched his carefully crafted brand in Jackson's direction. And for what? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain&nbsp;ad intersperses footage of Obama's massive political rally in Germany with images of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton before asking &quot;is he ready to lead?&quot; It's rare that a political candidate is criticized for being too popular, but that's the import of the ad, and its inclusion of Spears and Hilton has been called even by McCain sympathizers &quot;stupid,&quot; &quot;childish&quot; and &quot;juvenile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the McCain&nbsp;ad had a serious point, one the Obama campaign obviously felt it couldn't ignore. Obama can be as arrogant, gassy and remote as other members of the country's aristocracy of fame. If this celebrity framework is successfully imposed on Obama, the entire repertoire of Obamania -- the mass rallies, the soaring eloquence, the picturesque cool of the candidate himself -- risks becoming a liability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement Obama repeated three times, he said what George Bush and John McCain are &quot;going to try to do is make you scared of me. You know, he's not patriotic enough. He's got a funny name. You know, he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.&quot; Translation: Bush and McCain are going to go all Bull Connor on me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither has done any such thing, of course. McCain has distanced himself from attacks with the remotest hint of racial undertones. When a talk-radio host mentioned Obama's middle name several times in the course of an introduction of McCain at a rally, McCain roundly denounced him. When the North Carolina Republican Party ran an -- entirely aboveboard -- ad linking Obama with his longtime pastor Jeremiah Wright, McCain loudly objected. Obama's charge is a flat-out smear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterward, an Obama spokesman implausibly insisted the dollar-bills comment was not about race: &quot;What Barack Obama was talking about was that he didn't get here after spending decades in Washington.&quot; This is rich. George Washington didn't serve in Washington either, given that the capital of the country was first New York and then Philadelphia. His path to the presidency went through Trenton, Valley Forge and Yorktown (granted, quite different than Obama's). As for the other presidents, neither Abraham Lincoln, nor Andrew Jackson, nor U.S. Grant was a Washington time-server prior to winning the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama clearly was talking about race. He said much the same thing in Berlin: &quot;I don't look like the Americans who've previously spoken in this great city.&quot; Did he merely mean that he has better-fitting suits and a slimmer frame?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama apparently has been spoiling to throw out the race charge. When he won the North Carolina primary, he said McCain would &quot;play on our fears&quot; and &quot;exploit our differences.&quot; In June, he said Republicans were going to run against him saying: &quot;He's young and inexperienced, and he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama hopes to use the racism card to inhibit all criticism of him, with the presumed cooperation of the press. But there's a much larger downside. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's race is a political advantage so long as it is sold in a post-racial context. If his background is a symbol of how we can get beyond the poisoned atmosphere of both racism and the hyperactive, opportunistic charges of racism, it's a boon to his change-and-unity candidacy. That's why Jesse Jackson expressing a desire to perform emergency surgery on Obama was a priceless assist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Obama could throw it away in a fit of self-destructiveness worthy of ... dare we say it, Britney Spears?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | Playing the &quot;race card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means trying to exploit the most explosive political issue in this year's presidential contest, hoping it will help your candidate and hurt the other guy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain brought up the issue Thursday - but accused Barack Obama of starting it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said Obama, the first black candidate with a serious chance of winning the White House, was playing politics with race by claiming Republicans will try to scare voters by saying he &quot;doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subject of race had been almost taboo in the general election campaign, at least in public, with both sides fearing its destructive force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm disappointed that Senator Obama would say the things he's saying,&quot; McCain told reporters in Racine, Wis. The Arizona senator said he agreed with campaign manager Rick Davis' statement earlier that &quot;Barack Obama has played the race card, and he played it from the bottom of the deck. It's divisive, negative, shameful and wrong.&quot; The aide was suggesting McCain had been wrongfully accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In turn, Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said, &quot;We weren't suggesting in any way he's using race as an issue&quot; but that McCain &quot;is using the same, old low-road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day earlier and in response to a hard-hitting McCain&nbsp;commercial, Obama argued that President Bush and McCain have little to offer voters so Republicans will resort to a strategy of fear to keep the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What they're going to try to do is make you scared of me,&quot; Obama said. &quot;You know, he's not patriotic enough, he's got a funny name, you know, he doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He didn't explain the comment. But it evoked images of past presidents who grace U.S. paper money, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson and Ulysses S. Grant. All were white men, and all but Grant were older than Obama when elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama long has talked about his physical appearance in speeches, but McCain advisers argue he crossed a significant line by accusing the GOP of scare tactics and alluding to his own race in the same breath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The back-and-forth was the latest spike in a contest that's grown increasingly negative despite pledges by both Obama and McCain to run aboveboard campaigns. The daily rhetoric has turned red-hot as both maneuver for advantage and polls show the race competitive three months before the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 46, Obama is serving his first Senate term and working to overcome concerns of voters that he's not ready to be president. McCain is trying to stoke the notion that the Democrat is too inexperienced to make the judgments necessary to lead a country in times of war and economic straits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show a close contest nationally and in key battleground states, including electoral prizes like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. The political environment after two Bush terms tilts heavily in the Democrats' favor, but voter skepticism about Obama has helped keep the contest within McCain's reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days, McCain has been going after Obama with new fervor, painting him as not ready to lead and too liberal for the country. It's an aggressive approach reminiscent of GOP operative Karl Rove, who orchestrated Bush's back-to-back victories in part by tearing down Democratic opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, several of Rove's former rank-and-file are in elevated roles in McCain's campaign, and it shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening a new front Wednesday, the GOP campaign rolled out a hard-hitting commercial that uses pictures of 20-something stars Britney Spears and Paris Hilton to suggest that Obama is little more than a media darling who is unqualified to be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's the biggest celebrity in the world, but is he ready to lead?&quot; the ad asks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign countered with its own ad that called McCain's charges &quot;baloney&quot; and &quot;baseless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Thursday, Obama steered clear of race as he chided McCain, saying: &quot;So far, all we've been hearing about is Paris Hilton. I do have to ask my opponent: 'Is that the best you can do? Is that what this election is really all about? Is that worthy of the American people?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At campaign headquarters in Chicago, Obama's campaign unveiled a new Web site that accuses McCain of &quot;negative attacks and false charges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Wisconsin on Thursday, McCain expressed pride in his &quot;celebrities&quot; ad but also had words of praise for his rival after a questioner at a town hall meeting said Obama &quot;terrifies me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I respect and admire Sen. Obama. We just have stark differences,&quot; McCain replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Campaigns are tough, but I'm proud of the campaign we have run,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm proud of the issues we have tried to address with the American people. ... All I can say is we are proud of that commercial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaign manager Plouffe retorted later, in a conference call with reporters, &quot;We can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think there's anything substantive about this latest ad, do not think it's something that John McCain should be proud of.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's see if I've got this straight. Barack Obama is a U.S. senator, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and his party's candidate for president of the United States - and yet it was somehow presumptuous of him to meet with foreign leaders last week during his trip to the Middle East and Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll say this about Obama. He sure raises people's hackles. I've never seen anyone so roundly criticized for such grievous offenses as giving excellent speeches and urging people of different backgrounds to take a chance on working together. How dare he? And 200,000 people turned out to hear him in Berlin. Unforgivable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man has been taken to task for promoting hope, threatened with mutilation by Jesse Jackson for suggesting that a lot of black fathers could do better by their kids and had his patriotism called into question because he wants to wind down a war that most Americans would dearly love to be rid of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain can barely stop himself from sputtering at the mere mention of Obama's name. He actually ran an ad blaming Obama for high gasoline prices. Even Republicans had a good laugh at that one. And yet Obama continues to treat McCain respectfully. As far as personal character is concerned, Obama has scored very well, indeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What remains to be seen, now that the overseas tour is over, is whether Team Obama can play offense here at home and pile up enough points to win this election. McCain has been a surprisingly inept candidate (riding on a golf cart with Poppy Bush was almost as deadly an image as the helmeted Mike Dukakis bouncing around in a tank), but he has stayed within striking distance. This is not your ordinary election. Obama will have to turn people on big-time just to win by a little. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And for all the tedious talk about timelines and what the surge in Iraq has or has not accomplished, the top three issues in this campaign are still the economy, the economy and the economy. Americans are losing jobs, losing the equity in their homes, losing their retirement nest eggs, and tragically, in increasing numbers, actually losing the family home itself. This is the issue on which Obama long since should have pounced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent survey found that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe that the social contract of the 20th century - in which the government, employers and the society as a whole pulled together to see that those who worked hard and played by the rules were afforded the basic necessities of daily life and a shot at the American dream - &quot;appears to be unraveling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 80 percent of those who responded to the survey, conducted for the Rockefeller Foundation and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Time</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> magazine, said they faced greater financial risks now than in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This anxiety is pervasive, and it was clearly evident recently when Phil Gramm, then John McCain's key economic adviser, callously remarked that we were suffering from a &quot;mental recession&quot; and that the U.S. had become &quot;a nation of whiners.&quot; The Obama crowd should have instantly seen the Gramm gaffe for what it was, a gift from the political gods. They should have run with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The word is that an economic offensive may finally be coming from the Obama campaign. Anna Burger, the secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union, was part of a wide-ranging group of advisers on economic issues who met with Obama in Washington on Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has very serious policies, not sound bites, for addressing the long-term and short-term issues that are having such a dramatic effect on people who are working and trying to make ends meet,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Translating those ideas into a compelling economic narrative for his campaign - something Obama has not yet done - is the key to defeating John McCain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aurora, Colo. | John McCain's presidential campaign on Wednesday released a withering television ad comparing Barack Obama to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, suggesting the Democratic contender is little more than a vapid but widely recognized media concoction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign quickly responded with a commercial of its own, dismissing McCain's complaints as &quot;baloney&quot; and &quot;baseless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's&nbsp;ad, titled &quot;Celeb&quot; and set to air in 11 battleground states, intercuts images of Obama on his trip to Europe last week with video of twenty-something pop stars Spears and Hilton - both better known for their childish off-screen antics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's the biggest celebrity in the world, but is he ready to lead?&quot; the voiceover asks, noting the Illinois senator's opposition to offshore oil drilling and suggesting he would raise taxes if elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the latest effort by the GOP hopeful to cast Obama as a lightweight with little experience in leadership or governing. It also was risky for McCain's campaign to both acknowledge Obama's worldwide fame and depict it as a weakness rather than a strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning in Missouri, Obama said the ad was the latest example of McCain's negativity - a theme his campaign has tried to stress lately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He doesn't seem to have anything positive to say about me, does he?&quot; Obama said. &quot;You need to ask John McCain what he's for, not just what he's against.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also said the link to Hilton shows Republicans are leaving no stone unturned in their attempts to tarnish him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've never even met the woman,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign ad, released hours after McCain's, shows images of the Arizona senator with President Bush and accuses McCain of practicing &quot;the politics of the past.&quot; The campaign said it could air as soon as Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the second Obama&nbsp;ad in as many days responding to negative spots by McCain. But it was unclear how broadly the campaign intended to run it. The campaign typically identifies states where its ads air, but on Wednesday only said this ad would appear &quot;in some markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain did not mention the ad at a town-hall meeting in Colorado, but reiterated many of his complaints about Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The beauty of his words have attracted many people, especially among the young to his campaign,&quot; McCain told workers at Wagner Equipment, which rents and sells heavy farm machinery. &quot;My concern with Sen. Obama is with issues big and small. What he says and what he does are often two different things.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politically, John McCain should be a candidate for involuntary committal - he's a danger to himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If McCain is going to have a chance, he needs to run an un-McCain-like campaign, more negative than he'd prefer, more focused on domestic policy and less freewheeling: Think of a Republican Hillary Clinton circa this year's Ohio and Pennsylvania primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain surely would be more comfortable running a race emphasizing character, national security and a few pet causes such as earmarks. But he has to leave his comfort zone - something he may resist because he labors under an outdated self-image. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain often seems to think of himself as he was back in 2000: a political phenomenon who was the fresh face on the national scene, beloved of the press. A conspiracy of circumstances - most important, the passage of time - has seen all his former star qualities (and then some) assumed by Barack Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this hadn't yet occurred to McCain, Obama's overseas trip - with all three network anchors slavishly in tow - should have brought it home good and hard. McCain's campaign was reduced to running a Web video spoofing the media's love for Obama, echoing a complaint once made about the sycophantic coverage of McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain still has been insisting on bantering with the press in sessions that recall the glory days of the &quot;Straight Talk Express&quot; eight years ago, even though he often distracts from his campaign's own message. His campaign can't afford such ramshackle self-indulgence in these, the most trying of circumstances for any Republican. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A McCain comeback has to begin in a deconstruction of Obama as too risky to be president, executed in a traditional, block-and-tackle campaign (of the sort McCain has never yet been able to run). The playbook is partly provided by Hillary Clinton, who found her voice in lunch-bucket appeals to working-class white and Hispanic voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She did not, of course, defeat Obama, but McCain ought to be encouraged by how close she came. For a contemporary Democrat, Hillary ran a center-right campaign; she talked of blowing Iran to smithereens, downed shots of Crown Royal and appealed frankly to blue-collar whites. These mostly substanceless gestures conveyed a sense of toughness that endeared Hillary to her working-class voters and highlighted a vulnerability of the polished but aloof Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has a higher natural toughness quotient than Hillary. But he has never spoken persuasively to economic concerns, which - for all the focus on the Middle East - will predominate this year. As Obama dazzled overseas, McCain's campaign made a feint toward frontally engaging him in the economic debate, hitting him with a negative ad on his opposition to domestic drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is necessary, but not enough, to take these kinds of shots at Obama. McCain's campaign needs a unifying theme, and one less abstract than &quot;country first.&quot; Here again, he should take a page from Hillary, offering a conservative version of her occasional theme of a &quot;fighter for you.&quot; In particular, he should be fighting for middle-class Americans against ineffectual government and tax-and-spend liberalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has to give voice to the anger and frustration of the American public. He has to complain that Washington is broken and argue that both parties have let voters down. In 2000, he was the feisty - even angry - crusader against Washington and the status quo. He needs to find that old populist mojo again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it must be harnessed in a tight, hard-hitting campaign uncharacteristic of McCain. This year, simply letting McCain be McCain is a formula for failure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Los Angeles | Tavis Smiley is all wound up. His voice is rough from too much vocalizing, but the host of public television's Tavis Smiley talk show and public radio's The Tavis Smiley Show is on an oratorical roll about race, politics, and his fellow African-American, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no such thing in America as race transcendence, and Obama's going to find that out real soon,&quot; says Smiley, leaning into his words. As he sermonizes, he sheds suit jacket, tie and belt in succession, getting comfy in his spacious suite at KCET in Los Angeles after taping two installments of Tavis Smiley. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the peaceful vibe inside his sanctuary, with its African masks and scented candle, Smiley frowns. &quot;There's no such thing as 'post-racial' in America, because if you push the envelope too far, you're going to hear about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smiley should know. For months he has been the object of an Internet firestorm for his perceived negative comments about Obama on commercial radio's syndicated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Tom Joyner Morning Show</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smiley found himself between race and a hard place when he criticized Obama on-air for choosing not to appear on Smiley's annual State of the Black Union cablecast on C-SPAN in February. Smiley's remarks sparked a blaze of invective by African-American bloggers, who questioned Smiley's loyalty, motives and ego.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 12 years as a fixture on Joyner's show, Smiley delivered his final commentary June 26. Smiley insists his departure was not a reaction to the flak, but rather a decision that he had been on Joyner's show long enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just because Barack Obama is black, doesn't mean he gets a pass on being held accountable on issues that matter to black people,&quot; Smiley says. &quot;I'm not an Obama critic or a McCain critic. The term itself is dismissive and insulting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Smiley - a multimedia entrepreneur who is an important voice in the African-American community, who owns his TV and radio shows, who has authored 11 books and created the nonprofit Tavis Smiley Foundation to empower youth - the disparagement by black bloggers still stings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His dilemma is also emblematic of the media conundrum of the moment for black and white journalists alike: how to responsibly and sensitively address the issue of race and couch coverage of the likely first-ever run for the White House by a major-party nominee who is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have an awkward history about how to talk about race in the nation and in newsrooms,&quot; says Gwen Ifill, senior correspondent for PBS' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and author of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, slated for publication early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't see any hesitancy about addressing it,&quot; Ifill says.  &quot;But I do think we are all searching for the language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Bohrman, CNN's Washington bureau chief, agrees.  &quot;It's still a sensitive topic, but I think the door's been opened to the conversation ... Whether or not that conversation will happen in a reasonable or superficial way - I don't think anyone has a real sense of how it will play out right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smiley will broadcast his talk show live to select markets from the Democratic convention in Denver Aug. 25-28 and the Republican convention in St. Paul, Minn., Sept. 1-4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I want to do what I always try to do, which is to be authentic in my coverage,&quot; Smiley says.  &quot;I'm an advocacy journalist, not a journalist in the traditional sense. I believe my role in the media is to get people to re-examine the assumptions they hold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That challenge is not always obvious on Smiley's talk show. In its five-year run  &quot;Tavis Smiley&quot; has included a stew of both stars and politicos, from Obama, last fall, and Hillary Clinton in February, to Harrison Ford, Dustin Hoffman, and hip, young-skewing musical guests such as Ne-Yo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is Smiley's role as vigilant media inquisitor - and never mind political correctness - that he seems to relish most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is what I do - asking critical questions,&quot; Smiley says.  &quot;Now some of you regard it as keeping a brother down, holding a brother back. Because you regard it that way, you don't understand that this is the role that I've always played.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kennebunkport, Maine | Republican John McCain worked on Monday to wrestle the spotlight from rival Barack Obama's tour of Iraq by insisting he was right and the Democrat was wrong about the war and releasing a new critical ad blaming higher gas prices on his opponent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Obama toured the war zones trailed by U.S. network TV anchors, McCain ridiculed him from afar during a visit with the first President George Bush at his summer home on the Atlantic. At the same time, the Republican contender released an eyebrow-raising new ad flatly blaming the Illinois senator for higher gasoline prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican and Democratic presidential contenders have differed sharply over Iraq. Obama has said he would withdraw U.S. troops from combat there over 16 months while reinforcing the U.S. effort against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. McCain has resisted any timetable for withdrawal, insisting that victory in Iraq is a necessary precursor to success in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any withdrawal of troops from Iraq &quot;must be based on conditions on the ground,&quot; McCain told reporters as he stood beside the 84-year-old former president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator disparaged Obama as &quot;someone who has no military experience whatsoever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you win wars, troops come home,&quot; McCain said. &quot;He's been completely wrong on the issue. ... I have been steadfast in my position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Afghanistan, McCain said, &quot;I've always said it's long and tough and hard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to Iraq, &quot;We've succeeded. We're not succeeding, we've succeeded,&quot; McCain said later at a fundraiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain told reporters he didn't care if Obama's trip was stealing attention and &quot;doesn't in the slightest undercut&quot; his own message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elder Bush declined to advise McCain on the two wars, noting that he no longer follows every headline each day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No advice,&quot; Bush said. &quot;My respect for him knows no bounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush would not criticize either McCain for advocating oil drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf nor his son for rescinding his own 1992 presidential order banning such offshore drilling. Increasing domestic production was important, Bush said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a TV ad on national cable and in 11 states, McCain pushed his support for offshore drilling as the remedy for rising gas prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And even though McCain opposes drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and during his 2000 presidential run opposed lifting the offshore drilling moratorium, his ad clearly tries to blame rising prices on support for the moratorium by Obama, a first-term Illinois senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the price readout on a lonely gas pump rolls over to $5, the announcer asks, &quot;Who can you thank for rising prices at the pump?&quot; Rising from the background is the sound of a crowd chanting:  &quot;Obama, Obama, Obama.&quot;  A smiling Obama appears on the screen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally the announcer says:  &quot;One man knows we must now drill more in America and rescue our family budgets. Don't hope for more energy, vote for it. McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PORTSMOUTH, Ohio | The system for funding Social Security is &quot;a disgrace&quot; because it forces young workers to pay into a program that is unlikely to benefit them in its current form, Republican John McCain said this week, wading into politically touchy territory. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many other politicians, McCain often questions the long-term viability of the government retirement program. But he raised eyebrows with an unusually harsh assessment Monday at a town-hall forum in Denver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by a young woman if she is likely to receive Social Security benefits someday, McCain said it was unlikely &quot;unless we fix it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Americans have got to understand that we are paying present-day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in America today,&quot; he said. &quot;And that's a disgrace. It's an absolute disgrace, and it's got to be fixed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFL-CIO ad  criticizes McCain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON | The AFL-CIO plans to begin airing an ad in six presidential battleground states on Thursday that features a Vietnam combat veteran criticizing John McCain's stance on the war in Iraq and on veterans issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is part of a new union political effort to reach the 2.1 million military veterans or active-duty personnel who are members of the AFL-CIO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every vet respects John McCain's war record,&quot; Navy veteran Jim Wasser says in the ad. &quot;It's his record in the Senate that I have a problem with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wasser, an electrician from Illinois, served with John Kerry aboard Navy Swift Boats in Vietnam and helped the Massachusetts senator rebut attacks on his war record during the 2004 presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merkel uneasy  over Obama plans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BERLIN | German Chancellor Angela Merkel has signaled unease over the prospect of a possible speech by Democrat Barack Obama at Berlin's historic Brandenburg Gate, a spokesman said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merkel has &quot;only limited understanding for using the Brandenburg Gate as an election campaign backdrop, as it were, and has expressed skepticism about pursuing such plans,&quot; Thomas Steg, a spokesman for the chancellor, told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Steg stressed that the chancellor is &quot;very happy&quot; for Obama to visit Germany and meet her and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign has refused to provide specifics on his plans during an upcoming visit to Europe and the Middle East, including the candidate's interest in a possible event at the Brandenburg Gate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Obama looks forward to his visit to Germany and his opportunity to meet with the chancellor,&quot; Obama spokesman Bill Burton said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Probably the capital's best-known monument, the gate was once a symbol of Germany's Cold War division and now stands for its reunification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the gun clubs of Northern Virginia to the sports bars of Capitol Hill - wherever D.C.-area Republicans gather - you hear the question: &quot;Where's Murphy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Murphy&quot; is Mike Murphy, the GOP strategist who masterminded John McCain's 2000 primary race against George Bush, helping McCain come close to pulling off an amazing upset. Murphy was then chief strategist for Mitt Romney's successful Massachusetts governor run in 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murphy remained close to both men, and as a result sat out the GOP nominating contest this past year, not wishing to work against either of them. It was widely assumed, though, that if either McCain or Romney won the nomination, the winner would bring Murphy on board for the general election. So far it hasn't happened. I believe it soon will. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hasten to disclose that Murphy is a friend. I should also disclose that when I called to say I had heard he might well be signing on with McCain, he went Sergeant Schultz on me, saying nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But here's what I gather from acquaintances and sources in and around the McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is frustrated. He thinks he can beat Obama (politicians are pretty confident in their own abilities). But he isn't convinced his campaign can beat Obama's campaign. He understands that his campaign has failed to develop an overarching message. Above all, McCain is painfully aware that he is being diminished by his own campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This last point is galling. McCain has been a major figure in American public life for quite a while. And yet his campaign has made him seem somehow smaller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So McCain decided it was time for a campaign shake-up. He moved the lobbyist Rick Davis aside. He seemed to put Bush-Rove alum Steve Schmidt more or less in charge. But the full plan, as I understand it, was - and is - to have Schmidt, a good operative and tactician, take over day-to-day operations at headquarters, while bringing Murphy on to travel with McCain and as chief strategist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murphy's arrival would mean a fair amount of turmoil. The current McCain campaign is chock full of GOP establishment types, many of whom aren't great fans of the irreverent Murphy. Murphy's also made no secret of his low opinion of the Bush-Rove political machine that has produced many of these operatives. And Murphy hasn't made his possible entry into the campaign smoother by telling a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">New York Times</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reporter the other day that &quot;the depressingly self-absorbed McCain campaign machine needs to get out of the way&quot; of its candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Jeb Bush - whose winning Florida gubernatorial campaigns Murphy guided - was with McCain in Mexico City. I'm told he argued that the time to bring on Murphy is now. McCain didn't disagree. And so I expect that in the next couple of weeks we'll learn that Murphy is coming on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why Murphy? As observers of the 2000 effort know, he has a deep rapport with McCain - including an ability to tell him when he's made a mistake. He's a creative campaign tactician and an imaginative ad maker - but his great skill has always been an ability to find a clear theme for his candidates, as he did for McCain in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign this year desperately needs a message and a narrative that is both appropriate for the candidate and for the times. With Murphy in charge, McCain will have the campaign team he wants. Then all they'll have to do is come from behind to win against a superior organization, more money, a gifted candidate and a Democratic-tilting electorate. Oh well: no challenge, no glory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philadelphia | With four months left until Election Day, the electoral map is tilted in Barack Obama's favor, giving him more paths to win the presidency than John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential contest is being fought largely on what has been Republican turf, with Obama leading or running even in such states as Ohio, Virginia and Colorado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that continues, it should work to Obama's advantage, although McCain hopes to thwart his rival by removing Michigan and Pennsylvania from the Democratic column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tilt of the race is evident in looking at the tossup states. According to the nonpartisan Web site, realclearpolitics.com, there are 11 of them. And just two - Michigan and New Hampshire - were won by John Kerry in 2004. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest are Bush states, including such longtime GOP strongholds as Indiana and North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager, looks at the political map and sees &quot;a huge range of possibilities to get to 270,&quot; the winning number of electoral votes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told reporters recently that he is &quot;simply not going to wake up on (Election Day) worried about one state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A confident Obama spent all of last week in states that Bush took twice - Missouri, Ohio, Colorado, North Dakota and Montana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Obama wins everywhere the Democrats won four years ago, he'd have 252 electoral votes and could go over the top by taking Ohio or Florida or a combination of smaller states in the West, South and Midwest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for McCain, unless he can make inroads into Democratic turf, he'll spend the autumn playing defense, trying to hold off Obama in the red states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the view of Republican strategists, McCain's distinctive political profile and Obama's relative weakness with working-class whites give the Arizona senator a shot at Michigan and Pennsylvania, both of which have gone Democratic four times in a row.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No doubt the environment is very challenging for Republicans by just about every measure,&quot; said Michael DuHaime, senior adviser for political operations at the Republican National Committee. &quot;Given that, it's encouraging that we have a candidate with the ability to bring in independents, moderate Republicans and swing Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot can change between now and Nov. 4. Still to come are the vice-presidential selections, the conventions, the debates, as well as changes in the price of oil, the state of the economy, and the war in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the national race is mid-to-high single digits for Obama, as it seems right now, it'll be an Electoral College blowout or close to it,&quot; said Peter Brown, analyst for the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, which surveys swing states. &quot;But if it narrows, the electoral geography gets much more interesting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the current Electoral College outlook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For both campaigns, no region looms larger. Two states, Ohio and Michigan, figure to be key.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Republican has won the presidency without Ohio. Ever. If Obama can take it this year - and he did not do well in the Ohio primary - it's hard to see how McCain can win the White House. Some polls have Obama ahead there now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's Michigan, home to the original &quot;Reagan Democrats.&quot; Of all the big states Kerry captured in 2004, it looks to be the most promising for McCain now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was hurt there by the dispute over party rules that led him to skip the Michigan primary. It's must-win; he has a slim lead in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In pursuit of his hopes of expanding the playing field, Obama has designs on two unlikely midwestern targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One is Indiana, which has voted Democratic only once since 1936; the polls are even there. Another is North Dakota, which Obama won big in the caucuses. He has television commercials on the air in both states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama seems comfortably ahead in Wisconsin and Minnesota; both were battlegrounds in recent elections, going narrowly Democratic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also has strong prospects in Iowa, the state that propelled him to his party's nomination. In the whole country, it is the 2004 Republican state most likely to turn Democratic in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns have targeted Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado, mountain-state battlegrounds in the last two presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These three states have just 19 electoral votes among them. But they figure to be crucial in a tight race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry would be president if he had carried them four years ago; he lost all three by a total of 127,011 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said analyst Brown: &quot;To me, these states plus Iowa, provide the most plausible path to victory for Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush drew 40 percent of the Hispanic vote nationally four years ago. That and his his success among rural white voters allowed him to carry the three states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's strategists believe that his years of dealing with western issues, plus his familiarity with Latino concerns and his support for legalizing many undocumented immigrants, should help in the states, all of which border his native Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is favored in California, Oregon and Washington. McCain should win Idaho, Utah and Wyoming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign, though, believes it has an opening in Montana. The state has a moderate Democratic governor and elected its second Democratic senator, Jon Tester, two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every state in the region voted Democratic in 2004, and a repeat performance is not out of the question. At this point, only two states seem in play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One is New Hampshire. Even though it has only four electoral votes, Obama thought enough of its importance to let it host his big unity appearance with Hillary Rodham Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Hampshire voted for Kerry four years ago and has become more Democratic since. But it also happens to be McCain's second political home; this year, he staked his entire candidacy on winning its Republican primary. He won the 2000 primary as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other battleground is Pennsylvania, which has seen both McCain and Obama twice in the last few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Pennsylvania, McCain can take heart from the closeness of the Kerry-Bush race in 2004 and the thumping Obama received in the primary this spring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama ran poorly in the culturally conservative western counties - where a Democrat needs to hold his own in the fall - and not as well as he'd hoped in the Philadelphia suburbs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain will target both areas; he knows that it's hard for a Democrat to get to 270 without Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statewide polls give Obama the lead, despite the damage he inflicted on himself by describing small-town Pennsylvanians as &quot;bitter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also is promising an effort in New Jersey. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts wonder how much time and money he'll actually invest on a state that has been solidly Democratic in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question here has to do with demographics. Can Obama, an African-American, break the Republicans' lock on a region that is home to half of the nation's blacks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last two elections, Democrats have failed to carry a single southern state. But Obama is within range of McCain in at least three - Florida, North Carolina and Virginia; campaign manager Plouffe has expressed high hopes for Georgia, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama aims to boost black voter registration and turnout throughout the region. By some estimates, there are 600,000 eligible but unregistered black voters in Georgia alone. And he has some appeal to younger, better-educated southern whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it will take more than that for him to win in the South. Thomas Schaller, a scholar of southern politics, argues that the region's white vote would serve as a &quot;formidable counterbalance&quot; to an energized black vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The more blacks there are in a southern state, the more likely the white voters are to vote Republican,&quot; Schaller, a professor at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, wrote in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">New York Times</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> op-ed piece last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, he wrote, helps explain why Mississippi, with the nation's largest black population in percentage terms, is one of the most solidly Republican states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia, with its growing and affluent Washington suburbs, is where McCain might be most vulnerable. The state has elected two straight Democratic governors and is expected to send a second Democrat to the Senate this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looking at the rest of the South, it would take a pretty seismic shift for any of those states to flip,&quot; said DuHaime, the Republican strategist. &quot;They were double-digit wins for President Bush (in 2004) and are all trending Republican at the state level.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama sells the Democratic Party short. He talks about his fundraising success as if his donors were part of a spontaneous movement of small-money enthusiasts who cohered around himself. In fact, Democrats have spent years building their donor network. Obama's fundraising base is bigger than John Kerry's, Howard Dean's and Al Gore's, but it's not different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in other recent campaigns, lawyers account for the biggest chunk of Democratic donations. They have donated about $18 million to Obama, compared with about $5 million to John McCain, according to data released on June 2 and available on the OpenSecrets.org. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who work at securities and investment companies have given Obama about $8 million, compared with $4.5 for McCain. People who work in communications and electronics have given Obama about $10 million, compared with $2 million for McCain. Professors and other people who work in education have given Obama roughly $7 million, compared with $700,000 for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Real estate professionals have given Obama $5 million, compared with $4 million for McCain. Medical professionals have given Obama $7 million, compared with $3 million for McCain. Commercial bankers have given Obama $1.6 million, compared with $1.2 million for McCain. Hedge fund and private equity managers have given Obama about $1.6 million, compared with $850,000 for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you break it out by individual companies, you find that employees of Goldman Sachs gave more to Obama than workers of any other employer. The Goldman Sachs geniuses are followed by employees of the University of California, UBS, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, National Amusements, Lehman Brothers, Harvard and Google. At many of these workplaces, Obama has a three- or four-to-one fundraising advantage over McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he is swept up in rhetorical fervor, Obama occasionally says that his campaign is 90 percent funded by small donors. He has indeed had great success with small donors, but only about 45 percent of his money comes from donations of $200 or less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real core of his financial support is something else, the rising class of information-age analysts. Once, the wealthy were solidly Republican. But the information age rewards education with money. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many smart high achievers who grew up in liberal suburbs around San Francisco, L.A. and New York, went to left-leaning universities like Harvard and Berkeley and took their values with them when they became investment bankers, doctors and litigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political analysts now notice a gap between professionals and managers. Professionals, like lawyers and media types, tend to vote and give Democratic. Corporate managers tend to vote and give Republican. The former get their values from competitive universities and the media world; the latter get theirs from churches, management seminars and country clubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trends are pretty clear: Rising economic sectors tend to favor Democrats while declining economic sectors are more likely to favor Republicans. The Democratic Party (not just Obama) has huge fundraising advantages among people who work in electronics, communications, law and the catchall category of finance, insurance and real estate. Republicans have the advantage in agribusiness, oil and gas and transportation. Which set of sectors do you think are going to grow most quickly in this century's service economy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amazingly, Democrats have cultivated this donor base while trending populist on trade, by forsaking much of the Clinton Third Way approach and by vowing to raise taxes on capital gains and the wealthy. If Obama's tax plans go through, those affluent donors could wind up giving more than 50 percent of their income to the federal government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They've managed to clear these policy hurdles partly by looking out for tort lawyers and other special groups. But mostly they have taken advantage of the rivalry between the two American elites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past several years, the highly educated coastal rich have been engaged in a little culture war with the inland corporate rich. This is a war over values, leadership styles and social networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Socially liberal knowledge workers naturally want to see people like themselves at the head of society, not people who used to run Halliburton and who are supported by a vast army of evangelicals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Democrats are elected, this highly educated class will have much more say over policy than during the campaign. Undecided voters sway campaigns, but in government, elites generally run things. Once the Republicans are vanquished, I wouldn't hold your breath waiting for that capital gains tax hike or serious measures to expand unionization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past few years, people from Goldman Sachs have assumed control over large parts of the federal government. Over the next few, they might just take over the whole darn thing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be clear: Barack will support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Obama spokesman Bill Burton, Oct. 24, 2007</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was then: Democratic primaries to be won, netroot lefties to be seduced. With all that (and Hillary Clinton) out of the way, Obama now says he'll vote in favor of the new FISA bill that gives the telecom companies blanket immunity for post-9/11 eavesdropping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back then, in the yesteryear of primary season, he thoroughly trashed the North American Free Trade Agreement, pledging to force a renegotiation, take  &quot;the hammer&quot; to Canada and Mexico, and threaten unilateral abrogation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the hammer is holstered. Obama calls his previous NAFTA rhetoric  &quot;overheated&quot; and essentially endorses what one of his senior economic advisers privately told the Canadians: The anti-trade stuff was nothing more than populist posturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor is there much left of his primary season pledge to meet  &quot;without preconditions&quot; with Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. There will be  &quot;preparations,&quot; you see, which are being spun by his aides into the functional equivalent of preconditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's long march to the center has begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And why not? What's the downside? He won't lose the left, or even mainstream Democrats. They won't stay home on Nov. 4. The anti-Bush, anti-Republican sentiment is simply too strong. Election Day is their day of revenge -- for the Florida recount, for Swift-boating, for all the injuries, real and imagined, dealt out by Republicans over the last eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Normally, flip-flopping presidential candidates have to worry about the press. Not Obama. After all, this is a press corps that heard his grandiloquent Philadelphia speech -- designed to rationalize why  &quot;I can no more disown (Jeremiah Wright) than I can disown my white grandmother&quot; -- then wiped away a tear and hailed him as the second coming of Abraham Lincoln. Three months later, with Wright disowned, grandma embraced and the great  &quot;race speech&quot; now inoperative, not a word of reconsideration is heard from his media acolytes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worry about the press? His FISA flip-flop elicited a few grumbles from lefty bloggers, but hardly a murmur from the mainstream press. Remember his pledge to stick to public financing? Now flush with cash, he is the first general-election candidate since Watergate to opt out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some goo-goo clean-government types chided him, but the mainstream editorialists who for years had been railing against private financing as hopelessly corrupt and corrupting, evinced only the mildest of disappointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, The New York Times expressed a sympathetic understanding of Obama's about-face by buying his preposterous claim that it was a pre-emptive attack on McCain's 527 independent expenditure groups -- notwithstanding the fact that (a) as Politico's Jonathan Martin notes,  &quot;there are no serious anti-Obama 527s in existence nor are there any immediate plans to create such a group&quot; and (b) the only independent ad of any consequence now running in the entire country is an AFSCME-MoveOn.org co-production savagingMcCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, Obama's U-turn on public financing was not done for ideological reasons, it was done for Willie Sutton reasons: That's where the money is. It nonetheless betrayed a principle that so many in the press claimed to hold dear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As public financing is not a principle dear to me, I am hardly dismayed by Obama's abandonment of it. Nor am I disappointed in the least by his other calculated and cynical repositionings. I have never had any illusions about Obama. I merely note with amazement that his media swooners seem to accept his every policy reversal with an equanimity unseen since the Daily Worker would change the party line overnight -- switching sides in World War II, for example -- whenever the wind from Moscow changed direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth about Obama is uncomplicated. He is just a politician (though of unusual skill and ambition). The man who dared say it plainly is the man who knows Obama all too well.  &quot;He does what politicians do,&quot; explained Jeremiah Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it's time to throw campaign finance reform, telecom accountability, NAFTA renegotiation or Jeremiah Wright overboard, Obama is not sentimental. He does not hesitate. He tosses lustily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why, the man even tossed his own grandmother overboard back in Philadelphia -- only to haul her back on deck now that her services are needed. Yesterday, granny was the moral equivalent of the raving Reverend Wright. Today, she is a featured prop in Obama's fuzzy-wuzzy get-to-know-me national TV ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not a flinch. Not a flicker. Not a hint of shame. By the time he's finished, Obama will have made the Clintons look scrupulous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Culver City, Calif.| The video blasted across the Internet, drawing political blood from Sen. John McCain within a matter of days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Produced here in a cluttered former motel behind the Sony Pictures lot, it juxtaposed harsh statements about Islam made by the Rev. Rod Parsley with statements from McCain praising Parsley, a conservative evangelical leader. The montage won notice on network newscasts this spring and ultimately helped lead McCain, the likely Republican presidential nominee, to reject Parsley's earlier endorsement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In previous elections, an attack like that would have come from party operatives, campaign researchers or the professional political hit men who orbit around them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the 2008 race, the first in which campaigns are feeling the full force of the changes wrought by the Web, the most attention-grabbing attacks are increasingly coming from people outside the political world. In some cases they are amateurs operating with nothing but passion, a computer and a YouTube account, in other cases sophisticated media types with more elaborate resources but no campaign experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it was with the Parsley video, which was the work of a 64-year-old film director, Robert Greenwald, and his small band of 20-something assistants. Once best known for films like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Xanadu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (with Olivia Newton-John) and the television movie </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Burning Bed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (with Farrah Fawcett), Greenwald shows how technology has dispersed the power to shape campaign narratives, potentially upending the way American presidential campaigns are fought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greenwald's McCain videos, most of which portray the senator as contradicting himself in different settings, have been viewed more than 5 million times - more than McCain's own campaign videos have been downloaded on YouTube.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you had told me we would have hit 1 million, I would have told you you were crazy,&quot; said Greenwald, who said he had no ties to the Democratic party or Sen. Barack Obama's campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago, the Internet was a Wild West that caused the occasional headache for the campaigns but for the most part remained segregated from them. This year, the development of cheap new editing programs and fast video distribution through sites like YouTube has broken down the barriers, empowering a new generation of largely unregulated political warriors who can affect the campaign dialogue faster and with more impact than the traditional opposition research shops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already there are signs that these less formal and more individual efforts are filling a vacuum created by a decline in activity among the independent advocacy groups - so-called 527s and similar operations - that have played a large role in negative politics in the last several election cycles. Especially on the conservative side, independent groups have reported trouble raising money, and some of the biggest players from 2004 have signaled that they will sit it out this time around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shift has by no means gone unnoticed by the campaigns. And while strategists in both parties suspect that traditional political operatives affiliated with the campaigns or parties frequently pose as independent grassroots participants by hiding behind anonymous Web identities, few have been caught this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change has added to the frenetic pace of this year's campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's politics at the speed of Internet,&quot; said Dan Carrol, a strategist for Obama who was one of the young bulls on Bill Clinton's vaunted rapid response team in 1992. &quot;There's just a lot of people who at a very low cost can do this stuff and don't need a memo from HQ.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That would seem to apply to people like Robert Anderson, a professor at Elon University whose modest YouTube site features videos flattering of Obama and unflattering to McCain, or Paul Villarreal, who from his apartment in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., has produced a harsh series of spots that attack Obama and makes some claims that have been widely debunked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The better-circulated political videos have generally come from people with some production experience. One of the most widely seen anti-Obama videos was created by Jason Mitchell, who produces evangelical Christian programming in Durham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Four years ago I would just be a  'political activist,&quot;' Mitchell said. &quot;Now, they call me a 'communications political strategist,' and that's only because of the Internet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitchell, 29, said his cash expenses to make and distribute the segment were about $50, a fraction of the roughly $100,000 that it would cost to broadcast a 30-second spot on a television news program with an audience of a few million, like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Meet the Press</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;That's dirt cheap for an ad,&quot; Mitchell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Web-based attacks proliferating, campaigns are leaving behind the assumption that to respond to highly negative or false accusations is to needlessly publicize them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | The Supreme Court's landmark decision Thursday striking down the District of Columbia's gun ban will have wide-ranging legal, political and public safety consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More lawsuits will be filed, probably lots of them. Some gun laws will survive, while others will fall. The decision will help showcase the Supreme Court as a potential issue in the 2008 presidential campaign and will put some other politicians on the spot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most immediately, the court's 5-4 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller poses myriad questions for which answers are still a work in progress. Here are some of them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. Does this eliminate all gun restrictions?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court's majority, stressed that the Second Amendment doesn't guarantee an &quot;unlimited&quot; right to bear arms. Scalia cited as legitimate long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, as well as bans on carrying firearms into schools and government buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laws imposing &quot;conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms&quot; probably also are safe, Scalia wrote, adding that his list of Second Amendment-friendly gun restrictions &quot;does not purport to be exhaustive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. But the ruling will extend beyond Washington, D.C.'s, gun ban, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Yes, although not right away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest federal compilation of state and local firearm laws is some 458 pages long, and it was published in 2005, so it's not up to date. Boston, Chicago and Denver, for instance, ban the possession and sale of assault weapons. Los Angeles and San Francisco ban the sale of .50-caliber handguns. Oakland, Calif., bans the sale of ultra-compact handguns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An untold number of these existing laws will be subject to challenge. This will take time and money as lawsuits are filed and ordinances are revised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the very least,&quot; the American Bar Association predicted in a legal filing, &quot;(a) shift in the law will prompt years of litigation regarding the constitutionality of statutory, regulatory and administrative provisions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. Will the ruling allow those who are arrested or convicted on gun charges to challenge their cases?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Virtually every defense attorney&quot; whose client is facing &quot;a gun count&quot; in the indictment is obligated to seek dismissal, said Jack King, a D.C. attorney and the director of public affairs for the National Association of Criminal Defense lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact could be extensive because many of the gun charges are linked to drug raids, he said, adding that, &quot;Very often guns go with drugs in this town.&quot; Fifteen percent of state inmates and 13 percent of federal inmates carried a handgun during commission of their crimes, according to Bureau of Justice Statistics figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. Will federal gun laws be affected?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Potentially yes, although most firearm regulations are at the state or local level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress has passed a number of firearms laws, such as a since-expired assault weapon ban written in 1993. Only time will tell which gets challenged next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I fear that the District's policy choice may well be just the first of an unknown number of dominoes to be knocked off the table,&quot; Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in dissent, adding that resulting litigation will &quot;surely give rise to a far more active judicial role.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. What kind of gun laws probably will survive?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Narrowly tailored laws may be safe, along with laws that target the most sophisticated weaponry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scalia and the court's majority stress D.C.'s &quot;absolute&quot; prohibition of handguns and the fact that the District &quot;totally bans&quot; such firearms. Presumably, laws that have a narrower focus will have a better chance in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court also noted that the Second Amendment right to bear arms may be limited to those weapons &quot;in common use at the time&quot; the amendment was written. In other words: no rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Although this certainly doesn't mean only 18th century flintlocks may be legally owned, the court stressed that sawed-off shotguns as well as &quot;M-16 rifles and the like may be banned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. How about Washington, D.C., itself?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Most immediately, the court orders the D.C. government to issue a firearm license to Richard Heller, the District resident who challenged the gun ban. The gun ban itself, Mayor Adrian Fenty said Thursday, technically will remain on the books for at least &quot;several weeks.&quot; In the meantime, Fenty said, he has ordered D.C. police to &quot;implement an orderly process for allowing qualified citizens&quot; to register handguns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. How will this decision play politically in this election year?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. In the short term, the decision highlights the importance of the Supreme Court, and offers a wedge issue for political operatives. In the long run: Who knows?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumptive Republican presidential candidate John McCain instantly embraced the decision, while his Democratic opponent, Barack Obama, offered a more nuanced view seemingly designed to minimize differences on the volatile gun issue. Obama stressed that, like the court's majority, he believes that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to bear arms. Obama sidestepped other parts of the decision, saying simply that it offers &quot;much needed guidance&quot; to officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one of the Supreme Court's most closely watched decisions of the year, and one of 11 decided on a narrow 5-4 margin, the gun case may be Exhibit A in the importance of electing a candidate who's likely to appoint at least one new justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Below the presidential level, operatives will exploit the ruling, particularly in congressional districts where gun rights are taken seriously. &quot;Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, D-N.H., found herself on the losing end of the Supreme Court's ruling today, as her liberal opposition to Second Amendment rights was defeated,&quot; the National Republican Congressional Committee declared shortly after the decision was announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. How will interest groups fare?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Pro-gun and anti-gun groups could both benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controversy has a way of mobilizing activists, enhancing fundraising and giving volunteers a jolt of adrenalin. The fresh court, legislative and public relations challenges empowered by the court's ruling could guarantee years of full employment. As Alan Gottlieb of the small Second Amendment Foundation put it Thursday, &quot;Our work has only just begun.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question isn't whether race will be an issue in the general election campaign between Barack Obama and John McCain. Race is already an issue, even if largely confined to the shadow world of implication and coded language. Obama is now dragging the race issue into the sunlight -- a move that has to be considered both risky and inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I say inevitable because the fact of Obama's race isn't something that voters could possibly miss, whatever they think about it. The riskiness of dealing openly with race is every bit as obvious as Obama's skin color: A new Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that three of every 10 Americans acknowledge having &quot;at least some feelings of racial prejudice.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other findings in the survey suggest that the distance between blacks and whites in this country has narrowed; nearly eight of 10 whites say they have a  &quot;fairly close personal friend&quot; who is black, for example, while barely more than half of whites reported having black friends when the question was asked in 1981. Still, the poll suggests that as far as we've come, we have a long way to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, speaking at a fundraiser in Jacksonville, Fla., Obama made what can only be described as a pre-emptive strike.  &quot;It is going to be very difficult for Republicans to run on their stewardship of the economy or their outstanding foreign policy,&quot; he said.  &quot;We know what kind of campaign they're going to run. They're going to try to make you afraid. They're going to try to make you afraid of me.  'He's young and inexperienced, and he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ultimately, I think the American people recognize that old stuff hasn't moved us forward. That old stuff just divides us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party has a problematic history on race, beginning with Nixon's  &quot;Southern strategy.&quot; The era when the likes of the late Lee Atwater could overtly use race as a wedge issue are long gone. Today, any appeal to latent racial prejudice would have to be more subtle -- the suggestion that there's something of the  &quot;other&quot; about Obama, that he might not share traditional American values, that there's some question about his love of country. Given the steadfast patriotism that African-Americans have displayed since the nation's founding, none of this makes any historical sense. But it's more about the vibe than the reality, and the fact is that voters are attuned not just to what a presidential candidate says, but also how the candidate makes them feel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Obama has given his opponents little ammunition, they have focused on those who are close to him, beginning with his former pastor. Now some critics have turned to Obama's  &quot;feisty&quot; wife, whose image as a tall, strong, confident black woman can perhaps be made to seem threatening to some people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there are voters who absolutely won't support Obama because of his race, there's not much he can do about it. But at least he can blow away all the smoke. He has served notice that he doesn't intend to be Swift-boated. The Obama campaign made another move on this front last week when it began running a new television ad in a number of battleground states, including some, such as Georgia and North Carolina, that Republicans have long considered safe. In the ad, which is more about the candidate's character than his policies, Obama speaks of his personal history and delivers a paean to traditional American values -- while the viewer sees old family photos of his mother, who was white, and her parents, who helped raise him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to see the ad's iconography as anything but a reminder that while Obama is self-identified as African-American, he is biracial. He is a black man who speaks with great affection and admiration for his white grandparents. The message: Race may be thorny, but it's no match for love.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not easy trying to be a major-party presidential nominee and a political maverick at the same time. So John McCain is finding out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His prospects for defeating Democrat Barack Obama in November rely in large part on how well he handles the two roles and the inevitable tensions between them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the presumptive Republican nominee, McCain needs to hold onto the party's base voters, most of whom admire President Bush. As maverick, he must reach out to independents and Democrats, many of whom consider the incumbent a failure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events of the past week show the difficulty involved in performing both parts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, he unveiled a new ad that portrayed himself as maverick:  &quot;John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming ... five years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the day was over, though, he declared his support for lifting the federal moratorium on offshore oil drilling. This new position, which was more in keeping with his party's mainstream, was embraced within hours by George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Frank Luntz, a pollster with Republican roots:  &quot;McCain's independence is the only hope he has of winning the presidency, and it helps whenever he can draw contrasts with the president. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;John McCain isn't George Bush,&quot; Luntz said.  &quot;They're very different people with a different ideology, a different approach to governing, different experiences. But McCain cannot win if he's seen as more of the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator prevailed in the primaries largely because his party's voters decided that his reputation for independence made him their best option - against a political landscape colored by a sagging economy, an unpopular war and a more unpopular president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if McCain is too much the maverick or opens too much distance between himself and the president (even with Bush's low approval rating), he risks alienating Republican loyalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., who supports McCain after initially opposing him, wrote this year that conservatives have reason to  &quot;worry about where McCain's passions lie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Stephen Hess, who has advised three Republican administrations:  &quot;McCain has been a maverick; they can't take that away from him. But going forward, he's at the head of a long army, and the army's called the GOP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The polls indicate the independent image that defined McCain during his run for the Republican nomination eight years ago - an image that has broad appeal - is not as strong as it once was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the ABC News/Washington Post poll asked voters whether they thought a President McCain would chart a new course or offer the same leadership as Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 3-2, they picked the Bush option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters value McCain's experience and his national-security credentials, according to the polls, particularly when they compare him with Obama. But the majority no longer sees McCain as his own man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the polls, he seems to get no credit whatsoever for the bipartisan work that he has done,&quot; said Bill Carrick, a Democratic strategist based in California.  &quot;And the Republican base is still a little suspicious of him because he has been seen as a maverick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain recently said he was confident the electorate eventually would come to see him as he sees himself: as a conservative Republican with an independent streak.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the battle is finally joined. Without further ado, here are some utilitarian tips for Barack Obama and John McCain, offered in the spirit of helping each reach full potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five things Obama needs to do:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tell his American story. A lot of people, particularly those who tune into politics only at the eleventh hour, still think this guy is just a Muslim (wrong) with a funny name who hails from the Ivy League. Obama needs to stress his rags-to-riches narrative, his childhood stint on food stamps, his inspirational grandma, and the paternal kin who fought in World War II. Low-information voters help swing national elections; Obama needs to make them more comfortable. Which means he should ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wave the flag. He can't outduel a guy who got his arms broken in a POW prison cell, but he needs to put his own spin on what it means to be a patriot. He needs to flesh out what he has said already: Those who seek to repair America's flaws are motivated by love of country. As he said in a speech last winter, &quot;Loving your country shouldn't just mean watching fireworks on the Fourth of July. Loving your country must mean accepting your responsibility to do your part to change it.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bond with working-class whites. He doesn't necessarily need to win this Hillary Clinton constituency; no Democratic candidate has won a majority of working-class whites since 1964. If Obama can minimize his losses with these voters, he can win in November; it's worth noting that Al Gore in 2000 lost working-class whites by 17 percentage points and won the popular vote anyway. Obama needs to deliver fewer pretty speeches and demonstrate that he understands their lives (assuming he can exude the requisite empathy) and can talk in practical terms about their kitchen-table concerns. Which means he should ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paint McCain as Bush Redux. Economic anxiety is rampant; Bush is now the most unpopular president in the history of the Gallup poll; and McCain's big economic idea is to cut corporate taxes and make permanent Bush's tax cuts for the most-affluent Americans. Plus, McCain insists he'll balance the budget by the end of his first term. Obama needs to ask McCain which domestic programs he would slash to make it all happen. He needs to convince swing voters that, at a time when the Republican brand is badly damaged, McCain is just another orthodox Republican, not the independent-minded maverick he claims to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talk about the Supreme Court. To woo disgruntled Hillary women, millions of whom are suburban liberals, Obama needs to stress that a President McCain might well nominate the judge who would finally tip the scales against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Roe v. Wade</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - and tilt the court even more rightward for the next generation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for McCain:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preach the virtues of divided government. Since the Democrats are a cinch to retain or expand their control over the House and Senate, he needs to sell himself as the guy who'd check and balance their excesses. Independent swing voters, who are wary of one-party rule and who tend to like McCain anyway, might warm to that pitch. McCain needs to run against the Democratic Congress (giving him an &quot;outsider&quot; argument) and suggest that Obama, with his liberal Senate voting record, would conspire with lawmakers to provide (in McCain's current words) &quot;the wrong kind of change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talk constantly about Iraq. On paper, it's supposed to be McCain's weakness, but polls show that Americans, even while opposing the war, favor McCain slightly over Obama to handle it best. A war hero with two decades of experience clearly gets more creds than a guy only four years removed from the Illinois legislature. McCain needs to exploit this edge; for instance, he needs to keep reminding swing voters he was an early supporter of the &quot;surge&quot; - which has improved conditions militarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hire a speech coach. Fast. Readers with insomnia should go online and call up McCain's Tuesday night speech from Louisiana. As a sleep aid, it's swifter than Ambien. The TV contrast between McCain and Obama was embarrassing. McCain needs to get at least marginally better if he expects to move a nation. He has smartly invited Obama to join him in a series of town-hall meetings. McCain is far more effective in conversational forums than on a podium. Obama would do him a big favor by saying yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Push the maverick theme. McCain can't draw independents - and perhaps grab a crucial share of the Hillary women - unless he sells himself as the antithesis of a Bush Republican. He needs to stress his occasional departures from GOP orthodoxy (his concern for global warming, his support for path-to-citizenship immigration reform), and advertise himself as a fighter for the underdog. He needs to pound these themes, if only to mask the fact that, according to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Congressional Quarterly,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he voted the Bush position on Senate bills 95 percent of the time in 2007 and 100 percent of the time so far in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio, Ohio, Ohio. McCain needs to pour disproportionate resources into the Buckeye bailiwick - traditionally the most Republican of the Rust Belt states, although it has been trending blue at the state level. The winner in '08 may well be the guy who takes two of three among Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio. McCain looks stronger in Florida, and Obama should win Pennsylvania. That makes Ohio the potentially pivotal state - as it was in 2004. I'm scratching the surface, of course. Both candidates need to stop making factual errors (memo to McCain: the Sunnis and the Shiites are different; memo to Obama: your uncle didn't liberate Auschwitz). Both need to pick good running mates. Both must make clear that no more loony pastors will be tolerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if they both perform at their best, perhaps we can look forward to a cliff-hanger Election Night. Assuming our nerves can handle it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | Barack Obama is abandoning public financing for his presidential campaign, reversing his earlier stance in bold certainty he can raise millions more on his own as the first major-party candidate to bypass a system that was hurried into place after the Watergate scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrat has shattered fundraising records during the primary season, and he promptly showed off his financial muscle Thursday with his first commercial of the general election campaign. The ad, a 60-second biographical spot, will begin airing Friday in 18 states, including historically Republican strongholds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though it opens him to charges of hypocrisy, Obama's fundraising decision was hardly a surprise, given his record in raising money from private sources. Some $85 million in public money is available to each major party nominee for the fall campaign if they agree to forgo other contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Obama's decision, Republican candidate John McCain said his campaign will take public financing and added that he wasn't worried about being outspent in the fall campaign. McCain has lagged far behind Obama in fundraising throughout the contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Obama was going back on a promise to the public. &quot;I strongly feel that Senator Obama ought to review his commitment not to me, but to the American people, which he has gone back on,&quot; the Arizona senator said at a campaign appearance in St. Paul., Minn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, long a proponent of tougher campaign finance laws, had committed to taking the public funds if his Democratic opponent did, too. By keeping his promise, he also gets another issue to use against Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has proven himself to be a prodigious fundraiser who could easily raise more than the public fund supplies. And while he and his advisers know McCain and other Republicans will criticize his decision, they understand that issues of campaign finance do not rank high in most voters' minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama will draw attention to his finances again Friday, when his campaign files its May fundraising report with the Federal Election Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's decision represents a significant milestone in the financing of presidential campaigns. President Bush was the first candidate to reject public financing of primaries when he ran in 2000. But no candidate has ignored the general election funds since the law setting up the presidential finance system was approved in 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not an easy decision, and especially because I support a robust system of public financing of elections,&quot; Obama told supporters in a video message Thursday. &quot;But the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken, and we face opponents who've become masters at gaming this broken system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain sharply rebuked the Illinois senator Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This election is about a lot of things. It's also about trust,&quot; McCain said. &quot;It's about keeping your word.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, Obama filled out a questionnaire where he vowed to &quot;aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election.&quot; But since clinching the Democratic nomination earlier this month, Obama has not broached the subject with McCain. The only discussion occurred about two weeks ago between Obama's and McCain's lawyers,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama lawyer Robert Bauer said he discussed the public financing issue for 45 minutes on June 6 with McCain counsel Trevor Potter. In interviews and e-mails, both Bauer and Potter agree that Bauer raised concerns about McCain having a head start because he had secured the nomination in early March and Obama did not until June 3. Potter said he told Bauer that given Obama's fundraising &quot;I was sure there would be no McCain advantage by the end of the summer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That meeting, Potter said, &quot;was not part of any negotiation&quot; on public financing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was no aggressive pursuit of negotiations with the McCain campaign, there was no pursuit, period, of negotiations with the McCain campaign,&quot; Potter added later in a conference call with reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a breakfast with reporters Thursday, Bauer said that after his meeting with Potter, &quot;It became clear to me, and I reported to the campaign, that there really wasn't a basis for further discussion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several campaign finance watchdog groups voiced dismay at Obama's decision, with Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer noting that the conditions Obama had initially set for accepting public funds had been met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat who has worked with McCain on campaign finance laws in the past, praised Obama for his support of current campaign finance legislation, but added: &quot;This decision was a mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama raked in more than $265 million as of the end of April. Of that, nearly $10 million was for the general election, reserved for spending after the party's national convention in August. McCain had raised nearly $115 million by the end of May, eligible for spending before the convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain filed his May fundraising report Thursday with the Federal Election Commission, showing he raised $21 million during the month and started June with $31.5 million cash on hand. McCain had announced those numbers earlier this month. He spent a total of $11.7 million in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, Obama's clear financial advantage over McCain is offset in part by the resources of the Republican National Committee, which has far more money in the bank than the Democratic National Committee. Both national parties can spend money on behalf of the presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said McCain and the Republican National Committee are fueled by contributions from Washington lobbyists and political action committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we've already seen that he's not going to stop the smears and attacks from his allies running so-called 527 groups, who will spend millions and millions of dollars in unlimited donations,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite that claim, few Republican-leaning groups have weighed into the presidential contest so far. In fact, Obama allies such as MoveOn.org are the ones that have been spending money on advertising against McCain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LENGTH: 60 seconds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AIRING: Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Virginia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCRIPT: Barack Obama: &quot;I'm Barack Obama. America is a country of strong families and strong values. My life's been blessed by both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was raised by a single mom and my grandparents. We didn't have much money, but they taught me values straight from the Kansas heartland where they grew up. Accountability and self-reliance. Love of country. Working hard without making excuses. Treating your neighbor as you'd like to be treated. It's what guided me as I worked my way up taking jobs and loans to make it through college. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's what led me to pass up Wall Street jobs and go to Chicago instead, helping neighborhoods devastated when steel plants closed. That's why I passed laws moving people from welfare to work, cut taxes for working families and extended health care for wounded troops who'd been neglected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I approved this message because I'll never forget those values, and if I have the honor of taking the oath of office as president, it will be with a deep and abiding faith in the country I love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KEY IMAGES: Opens with Obama speaking directly to viewers, a flag pin on his lapel. Photographs from different stages of Obama's life flash onto the screen. One shows Obama, who is seeking to be the first black president, as a child in his white mother's arms. In another, Obama as a young man sits on a bench between his white grandparents. Photographs from later in life show him as a college student, leaning nonchalantly against a pillar and clutching a book. In another, he is a community organizer in a shirt and tie addressing a meeting. Images of a series of houses in a working-class neighborhood stream by. Other images show him on the campaign trail, including sitting with people around a table, speaking to a soldier and chatting with a senior citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANALYSIS: Obama seeks to introduce himself to voters and address some of his political vulnerabilities as he opens his general election advertising campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In images, the son of a white Kansas mother and a black Kenyan father tries to remind voters of his mixed-race; no pictures of his father are shown and Obama doesn't mention him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, in both words and pictures, emphasizes his modest, middle-class upbringing. It's both an effort to counter the notion that the Harvard-educated, Chicago resident is an elitist and an attempt to connect with working-class voters who largely preferred rival Hillary Rodham Clinton during the primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the ad, Obama emphasizes his love of country, and wears a flag on his lapel as he seeks to reassure voters about his commitment to the country and counter questions about his patriotism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By focusing on family and core values, Obama is trying to show voters of all stripes Democrats, independents, and Republicans that they have much in common. These issues transcend political preferences and Obama is seeking to win over independents and some Republicans unhappy with eight years of Republican rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign chose to run the ad in traditional battleground states as well as some that have reliably voted for Republican presidential candidates in the past several elections, including Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Indiana, Montana, and North Dakota. The intention is to test Obama's theory that his appeal allows him to make Democrats competitive in states that the party typically ignores and, thus, give Democrats better chances to rack up the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also possible that Obama is simply on the air in these states to see whether he can move poll numbers. If so, he likely would choose to stay on the air to compete in the state. At the very least, Obama can force McCain, who lags in fundraising, to spend money in states Republicans long viewed as safe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON | A defiant Barack Obama said Tuesday he would take no lectures from Republicans on which candidate would keep the U.S. safer, a sharp rebuke to John McCain's aides who said the Democrat had a naive, Sept. 10 mind-set toward terrorism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These are the same guys who helped to engineer the distraction of the war in Iraq at a time when we could have pinned down the people who actually committed 9/11,&quot; Obama told reporters aboard his campaign plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the same kind of fear-mongering that got us into Iraq ... and it's exactly that failed foreign policy I want to reverse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain takes hit at windfall taxes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOUSTON | Republican John McCain called for a clean break from Bush administration energy policies on Tuesday, then promptly pivoted to accuse campaign rival Barack Obama of supporting recycled measures that failed in the past</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Tax relief just isn't change he can believe in,&quot; said the Republican presidential nominee-in-waiting, mocking his opponent's campaign slogan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's bid to chart a middle course on a major issue hit a bump, though, when he criticized Obama for proposing a windfall profits tax despite saying last month he would consider the same proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech in energy-producing Texas, McCain said the United States needs more oil than during the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, yet produces less. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, he warned, a single successful terror attack at an oil installation could plunge the country into an  &quot;economic crisis of monumental proportions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With President Bush's poll ratings at historically low levels, McCain often emphasizes his differences with the current administration, and he coupled his speech with the release of a new television commercial drawing attention to his call for cutting back on the pollutants that cause global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain included little in the way of new proposals in his speech. He called for reform of the laws governing the oil futures trading market, and drew a standing ovation when he repeated his day-old support for an end to the federal moratorium on offshore oil drilling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He favors allowing states to decide whether to explore offshore waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama promises tuition tax credit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAYLOR, Mich. | Democrat Barack Obama recalled Tuesday paying off his own mountain of student loan debt and promised struggling college students help to pay for school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said he would give students a $4,000 tax credit to help pay tuition and fees in exchange for 100 hours of community service. The campaign said the program would cost $10 billion a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You get a hand living your dreams, and then you help your fellow citizens live theirs,&quot; the Illinois senator told a group of students in a courtyard at Wayne County Community College. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain aims ad at Cuban-Americans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI | Republican presidential candidate John McCain is airing a radio ad aimed at Cuban-American voters saying his top priority is the release of political prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad features a man who spent 28 years in Cuban prison, Roberto Martin Perez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The harsh reality is that millions of my fellow Cuban citizens are prisoners in their own country,&quot; Martin Perez says.  &quot;Rather than resume relations with (Cuban President) Raul Castro, John McCain wants first and foremost for all political prisoners to be released.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Los Angeles | Pop quiz: Why has John Cusack jumped into the political arena with a video saying John McCain is a clone of President George W. Bush who would continue policies the actor says benefit war profiteers? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know my opinion doesn't matter more than anyone else's, and I just make films,&quot; he said in a phone interview Wednesday. &quot;But I do feel you have to speak out, and that's what I'm doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-second video, which went out to members of the liberal political activist group MoveOn.org on Wednesday, began airing on television Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In it, Cusack offers a &quot;pop quiz&quot; to voters, asking them among other things: &quot;Who supports keeping our troops in harm's way in Iraq but not the bipartisan G.I. bill of rights to support them when they return home?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Bush both do, Cusack says, adding, &quot;Bet you can't tell them apart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost to air the ads is $45,000. They will appear nationally on the Bravo cable channel and in Washington, D.C., on CNN, MSNBC and Comedy Central.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his latest film, the war satire </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">War Inc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Cusack makes no secret that he believes the Iraq war was created to profit private businesses like Blackwater Worldwide, Bechtel Corp. and others that hold war-related contracts worth millions of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not going to pretend this thing in Iraq was some kind of free market utopia to spread the gospel of democracy through the Middle East,&quot; he said from London, where he's at work on another project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cusack says he supports Democrat Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he has made such films as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">War Inc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and last year's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Grace is Gone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in which he plays the husband of a soldier killed in Iraq, Cusack notes this has been his first such video for MoveOn.org.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everybody knows that the very first rule in picking a vice presidential nominee is to do no harm. Really, you can choose anybody. How dumb would you feel if it turned into an embarrassment? This is why the careful, modern candidate sets up a screening system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now ask yourself: How dumb would you feel if you got in trouble over your selection for the vice presidential screener? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama is having the first post-primary crisis, a moment in which the only conceivable response is: What was he thinking?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Johnson, who resigned Wednesday as the leader of the Obama vice presidential selection committee, is an old Washington hand who had helped Walter Mondale and John Kerry with the same task. His aura of experience was apparently not diminished one whit by the fact that both the candidates he assisted lost and that one of them ran into embarrassing controversies over his running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immediate cause of Johnson's downfall was a charge that he had been given a sweet deal on three home loans by the head of the Countrywide Financial Corp., which Obama had criticized for its role in the subprime lending crisis. Since Countrywide seems to hold the mortgage on every house in the United States, it is also disliked by many, many Americans on general principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, not so bad. As Obama pointed out, you cannot really expect a presidential candidate to set up a committee to vet the people who are going to be on the vetting committee. Although you can bet that by 2012, that will become standard operating procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there's all this other stuff. Johnson is the former head of Fannie Mae, which under his direction, according to regulators, engaged in accounting practices that were, at best, sloppy. At the same time, he sat on the boards of five different corporations, where he appeared to serve as cheerleader for the theory that corporate executives deserve to be paid obscene amounts of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does someone go up to Barack Obama, who once sponsored a bill to curb excessive executive compensation, and say - &quot;You know the vice presidential search committee? For chairman, how about Jim Johnson? Remember, the guy who tried to give the head of UnitedHealth Group $1.4 billion in stock options?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Johnson quit on Wednesday, the McCain headquarters issued a statement saying that the fact he had been selected in the first place raised &quot;serious questions about Barack Obama's judgment.&quot; This does not seem like a great avenue of attack for a campaign in which a large chunk of the top staff was recently dismissed for being lobbyists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although McCain has, so far, not demonstrated that he can manage anything more challenging than a backyard barbecue, that still does not make the Johnson situation look any better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keep in mind that the head of the vice presidential vetting committee is not a job for which there are a limited number of qualified candidates. You could appoint a hero firefighter or a nun to be the public face of the search. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You hire experts to do the background checks. The other two committee members, Caroline Kennedy and a former deputy attorney general, could have managed on their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But no, we have to have a seasoned wise man whose high standing among the movers and shakers of the nation's business and political elite seemed to hinge on the fact that he feels every single one of them deserves more money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talk about unnecessary disasters. It's like having your career ruined because you invited the wrong person to host a party in honor of your nephew's godparents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gentle spirits may decide that it's a good thing that the Obama campaign is getting this sort of thing out of the way early. Crueler ones may note that at least they can't blame this one on Hillary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than falling into complete depression at such an early point in the game, let's work under the assumption that the people involved were so tired that they didn't know what they were doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before the final primaries, I was in South Dakota talking to George McGovern, who is the gold standard when it comes to disastrous vice presidential selections. If Obama ever asked him for advice, McGovern said, he'd tell him to avoid exhaustion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got that advice from Barry Goldwater. He said watch out for fatigue. That's when you make mistakes,&quot; McGovern added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One ridiculous decision doesn't mean that Obama won't be a good candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it does suggest that he needs to take a long nap.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | More than a year after Congress pledged to curb pork barrel funding known as earmarks, lawmakers have gone on another spending binge, directing billions toward organizations and companies in their home districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earmark spending in the House's defense authorization bill alone soared 29 percent last month, from $7.7 billion last year to $9.9 billion now, according to data compiled by Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan watchdog group in Washington, D.C. The Senate bill has not been approved, but the proposal includes an increased number of earmarks, though for a slightly lesser total cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both parties talk a good game on cutting earmarks, but at first opportunity the House larded up,&quot; said Stephen Ellis, vice president of the watchdog group. &quot;This is just another broken promise.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think of a way to spend money on defense, and it could easily be among the hundreds of projects added quietly to the House and Senate spending plans this spring. Many of the earmarks serve as no-bid contracts for the recipients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Requests include $204,000 for an infantry platoon battle course from Sens. Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor, both Arkansas Democrats; $2.2 million for nanofluids for advanced military mobility from Rep. Geoff Davis, R-Ky.; $98 million for a Northrop Gumman project to develop an aircraft sensor suite, from Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and Mel Martinez, R-Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambliss was a part of another bipartisan group of lawmakers who also requested allocating $497 million to United Technologies, Lockheed Martin and Pratt &amp; Whitney for &quot;advanced procurement or line close down costs,&quot; the watchdog group's data show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tens of millions more are directed at lawmakers' state universities, sometimes for research of metals, composites and other technology. That includes $2.5 million for development of three-dimensional integrated circuit research at Boise State. East Carolina University will get $3 million for &quot;superstructural particle evaluation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest surge has occurred under Democratic leadership of Congress, but it is difficult to compare earmark spending to Republican-controlled Congresses because there was no disclosure requirement until last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, all sides have racked up some big requests in the defense authorization bills. In the Senate, Lieberman led the way with his participation in 14 requests worth more than $292 million, some of them involving more than one lawmaker, the watchdog group data shows. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., made 48 requests, many with colleagues, worth more than $198 million. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sens. Jeff Sessions and Elizabeth Dole led Republicans by participating in requests totalling $188 million and $182 million, respectivelly. Leading earmarkers in the House include Democrats Solomon Ortiz of Texas and Neil Abercrombie of Hawaii and Republicans Duncan Hunter of California and Robin Hayes of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earmark spending has a long history, and some lawmakers said it is a constitutional right for Congress to control the government's purse. Proponents note that earmarks often provide funding to organizations doing good work that otherwise would never get a dime from Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other lawmakers contend that the standard practice on Capitol Hill of slipping in earmarked extras - often at the behest of lobbyists working for corporations, universities and other beneficiaries - is fostering an atmosphere of dirty politics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said the budget system almost demands that lawmakers use earmarks to win support from voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his colleagues also award earmarks with the expectation they will generate campaign contributions from happy recipients and their lobbyists, a dynamic that Taxpayers for Common Sense describe as the  &quot;pay-to-play system.&quot; Lawmakers often boast of the earmarks they have obtained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data compiled by the watchdog group show that 60 percent of the members of the House Armed Services Committee who arranged earmarks also received campaign contributions from the companies that received the funding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost all the members of the committee received campaign contributions from companies that got earmarks this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's corrupting. It's a much bigger problem than the sum of its parts. It's much more than just waste,&quot; said Flake, who has openly criticized both Republican and Democratic colleagues for questionable earmarked projects.  &quot;One good defense earmark can yield tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate also relies on earmarks, though not quite so heavily. The number of earmarks in the Senate defense authorization bill rose sharply from 309 to 435, though the overall spending declined slightly this year to $5.4 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The requests by Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, included earmarks to General Motors, whose executives have recently donated $29,000 to the senator, according to the watchdog group. Levin's office did not respond to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of earmarks is not going to go away anytime soon. Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill,, the presumptive Democratic nominee for the White House, disclosed in March that he had sought $740 million in earmarks over the past three years, about a third of which received funding. He has also proposed legislation requiring better disclosure of earmarks before they're approved. GOP rival Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., one of the sharpest earmark critics in Congress, has made it a point to buck the trend and avoid asking for earmarks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; Pg. 10A</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">513 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's frustrating enough when gas prices soar due to the unseen forces of global supply and demand. But it's downright unfair when Wall Street speculators contribute to rising prices at the pump. There's growing evidence that investors looking to make a fast buck are causing oil prices to rise faster than can be explained by ordinary market forces. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress ... can help to ease this problem, because it helped to create this monster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December 2000, Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which was signed into law by President Clinton just before he left office in January 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few people realized at the time that a loophole had been tucked into this 262-page bill at the last minute by then-Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. It came to be known as the &quot;Enron Loophole,&quot; and it allowed Enron and other large energy traders to be exempt from federal oversight of over-the-counter transactions in energy markets. Enron is no more, but the loophole lives on. It has allowed massive growth of unregulated trading on energy futures markets, where investors essentially &quot;bet&quot; on the price of oil at a certain date in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commodities markets ordinarily allow commercial buyers of goods that people need, such as corn, pork and energy products, to lock in a price for later delivery of those commodities. But in the unregulated environment spawned by the Enron Loophole, speculators increasingly treat commodities as if they were stocks. These investors don't want to take delivery of the oil after they &quot;buy&quot; it; they just want the price to rise so they can make a huge profit. As the dollar weakens, oil becomes an even more attractive investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The details of these types of trades are largely hidden. Some contracts are negotiated between parties who don't need to disclose them. Some contracts are made overseas, beyond the limited oversight of U.S. regulators. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As speculators flock to oil, they are creating artificial demand for the commodity, which drives up the price. Nobody knows how much speculators are adding to the cost of gasoline, but some analysts believe it's as much as 50 percent of recent increases. ... </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the federal authority responsible for regulating such trading, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is virtually powerless to step in. The CFTC needs the regulatory authority and the staffing to make sure these markets are transparent and monitored. Congress should give this weakened agency the tools it needs to do its oversight job effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presumptive presidential nominees, Sens. Barack Obama, D-Ill., and John McCain, R-Ariz., ... have chosen to pander to voters with politically popular ploys - McCain with a gas-tax &quot;holiday&quot; and Obama with a windfall profits tax on oil companies. Neither idea will likely affect prices at the pump in a meaningful way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, lawmakers should close the loophole that gave rise to heightened market speculation. Commodities are products that consumers need for their daily existence, and those markets shouldn't be so vulnerable to greedy manipulation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON | Jim Johnson, a manager of Democrat Barack Obama's vice presidential search team, resigned Wednesday amid criticism over his personal loan deals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jim did not want to distract in any way from the very important task of gathering information about my vice presidential nominee, so he has made a decision to step aside that I accept,&quot; Obama said in a statement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson, the former chairman of mortgage lender Fannie Mae, received loans with the help of the CEO of Countrywide Financial Corp., which is part of a federal investigation in the midst of the subprime mortgage crisis.  The story was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain had accused Obama of hypocrisy for speaking out against Countrywide's tactics while his vetter got favorable rates on three home mortgages totaling $1.7 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson served on Obama's vetting team with two prominent Democratic attorneys - former Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder and Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of the late President John F. Kennedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign declined to answer questions about whether Johnson would be replaced or if the vetting process will be left to Holder and Kennedy, who have not been involved in a vice presidential search before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's goal: Cut casualties in Iraq </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHILADELPHIA | Avoiding casualties in Iraq is more important than bringing troops home, Republican John McCain said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appearing on NBC's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Today</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">show</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain was asked if he has a better estimate for when U.S. troops could leave Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, but that's not too important,&quot; McCain said. &quot;What's important is casualties in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Americans are in South Korea. Americans are in Japan. American troops are in Germany. That's all fine. American casualties, and the ability to withdraw. We will be able to withdraw. ... But the key to it is we don't want any more Americans in harm's way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer was in keeping with McCain's long-stated argument that as Iraqis take more control of security in their country, the number of killed and wounded U.S. soldiers should decline. He has said he could envision troops withdrawing about 2013 but has refused to fix a date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who in 2004 entertained the idea of having McCain as a running mate, responded on behalf of the Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is unbelievably out of touch and inconsistent with the needs and concerns of Americans, and particularly the families of the troops who are over there,&quot; Kerry said. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fervent supporters of Barack Obama like to say that putting him in the White House would transform America. With all due respect to the candidate, that gets it backward. Obama is an impressive speaker who has run a brilliant campaign - but if he wins in November, it will be because our country has already been transformed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's nomination wouldn't have been possible 20 years ago. It's possible today only because racial division, which has driven U.S. politics rightward for more than four decades, has lost much of its sting. And the de-racialization of U.S. politics has implications that go far beyond the possibility that we're about to elect an African-American president. Without racial division, the conservative message - which has long dominated the political scene - loses most of its effectiveness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take, for example, that old standby of conservatives: denouncing Big Government. Last week John McCain's economic spokesman claimed that Barack Obama is President Bush's true fiscal heir, because he's &quot;dedicated to the recent Bush tradition of spending money on everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the truth is that the Bush administration's big-spending impulses have been largely limited to defense contractors. But more to the point, the McCain campaign is deluding itself if it thinks this issue will resonate with the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Americans have never disliked Big Government in general. In fact, they love Social Security and Medicare, and strongly approve of Medicaid - which means that the three big programs that dominate domestic spending have overwhelming public support. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Ronald Reagan and other politicians succeeded, for a time, in convincing voters that government spending was bad, it was by suggesting that bureaucrats were taking away workers' hard-earned money and giving it to you-know-who: the &quot;strapping young buck&quot; using food stamps to buy T-bone steaks, the welfare queen driving her Cadillac. Take away the racial element, and Americans like government spending just fine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But why has racial division become so much less important in American politics? Part of the credit surely goes to Bill Clinton, who ended welfare as we knew it. I'm not saying that the end of Aid to Families With Dependent Children was an unalloyed good thing; it created a great deal of hardship. But the &quot;bums on welfare&quot; played a role in political discourse vastly disproportionate to the actual expense of AFDC, and welfare reform took that issue off the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another large factor has been the decline in urban violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the historian Rick Perlstein documents in his terrific new book </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Nixonland</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, America's hard right turn really began in 1966, when the Democrats suffered a severe setback in Congress - and Ronald Reagan was elected governor of California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause of that right turn, as Perlstein shows, was white fear of urban disorder - and the associated fear that fair housing laws would let dangerous blacks move into white neighborhoods. &quot;Law and order&quot; became the rallying cry of right-wing politicians, above all Richard Nixon, who rode that fear right into the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But during the Clinton years, for reasons nobody fully understands, the wave of urban violence receded, and with it the ability of politicians to exploit Americans' fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true that Sept. 11 gave the fear factor a second wind: Karl Rove accusing liberals of being soft on terrorism sounded just like Spiro Agnew accusing liberals of being soft on crime. But the GOP's credibility as America's defender has leaked away into the sands of Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me add one more hypothesis: Although everyone makes fun of political correctness, I'd argue that decades of pressure on public figures and the media have helped drive both overt and strongly implied racism out of our national discourse. For example, I don't think a politician today could get away with running the infamous 1988 Willie Horton ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, the campaign against misogyny hasn't been equally successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the way, it was during the heyday of the baby boom generation that crude racism became unacceptable. Obama, who has been dismissive of the boomers' &quot;psychodrama,&quot; might want to give the generation that brought about this change, fought for civil rights and protested the Vietnam War a bit more credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, none of this guarantees an Obama victory in November. Racial division has lost much of its sting, but not all: You can be sure that we'll be hearing a lot more about the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and all that. Moreover, despite Hillary Clinton's gracious, eloquent concession speech, some of her supporters may yet refuse to support the Democratic nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Obama does win, it will symbolize the great change that has taken place in America. Racial polarization used to be a dominating force in our politics - but we're now a different, and better, country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, this isn't exactly the party I'd planned, but I sure like the company,&quot; Clinton, 60, told cheering supporters at the National Building Museum in Washington as she suspended her campaign and endorsed Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The way to continue our fight now . . . is to take our energy, our passion, our strength and do all we can to help elect Barack Obama the next president of the United States.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her reluctant departure from the campaign - she waited four days after Obama clinched the nomination - marked more than just the end of her long quest for the presidency and what would have been a unique husband-wife dynasty in the White House.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the better part of two decades, Bill and Hillary Clinton were the leading lights of the party, often pushing against the party's liberal left wing, their bare-knuckle politics adding the words  &quot;war room&quot; and &quot;vast right wing conspiracy&quot; to the campaign dictionary, their personal lives a magnet for investigation, imagination and speculation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it's not the end of the Clinton era, it is on hiatus,&quot; said Larry Gerston, a political scientist at San Jose State University in California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She could come back, of course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronald Reagan lost a close Republican nomination battle to Gerald Ford in 1976, and then won it and the White House four years later. John McCain lost the Republican nomination in 2000 and won it this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 18 million votes in this year's Democratic primaries, Clinton built a broad coalition with support from women, Hispanics and working class whites.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's true in policy - where the Clintons started pushing against the party's more liberal left wing on issues in the early 1990s, when Bill Clinton pushed for welfare reform and free trade, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She ran this year, first as a pro-military hawk, criticizing Obama's vow to meet with foreign dictators and his proposal to raise Social Security taxes on those who make more than $100,000 a year.</SPAN></P>

I endorse him and throw my full support behind him and I ask of you to join me in working as hard for Barack Obama as you have for me,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York senator, who came closer than any woman in history ever has to winning a major party presidential nomination, was joined by her mother, her husband and their daughter, Chelsea.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although we weren't able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it has about 18 million cracks in it, and the light is shining through like never before,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON | With his Democratic foe now certain, Republican John McCain is deploying dozens of staffers into battleground states, boasting of improved fundraising and expanding his advertising into some of the most competitive terrain of the general election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm running for president to keep the country I love safe,&quot; the Arizona senator says in a new commercial unveiled Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizationally, McCain's 10 regional campaign managers were in place across the country - and building up their staffs - as of Sunday and the Republican National Committee named nine field directors a day later. By the end of the month, the McCain-RNC political operation plans to be running in 17 states, with 76  &quot;Victory Centers,&quot; 94 regional and state campaign staffers, and 145 RNC staffers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, campaign advisers say the joint political team will number some 500 people. They are dismissing the grumbling of some Republicans that perhaps the campaign has been too slow to increase its organization and, perhaps, squandered its three-month head start while the Democratic primary continued. Financially, McCain and the RNC also reported significant fundraising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has held dozens of fundraisers across the country over the past three months, including three in Florida this week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of May, McCain and the RNC raised a combined $45 million and had a total of $85 million cash on hand. Obama has been a prolific fundraiser and had $46.5 million in hand at the end of April (he has not announced his May fundraising). But the DNC has not done as well fundraising, collecting nearly $5 million in may and ending the month with $4 million in the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, with Obama as the titular head of the Democratic Party, the national committee is now likely to see its fundraising improve dramatically.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rising in the Senate on May 13, Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat, explained: &quot;I rise to discuss rising energy prices.&quot; The president was heading to Saudi Arabia to seek an increase in its oil production, and Schumer's gorge was rising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saudi Arabia, he said, &quot;holds the key to reducing gasoline prices at home in the short term.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore arms sales to that kingdom should be blocked unless it &quot;increases its oil production by one million barrels per day,&quot; which would cause the price of gasoline to fall &quot;50 cents a gallon almost immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can a senator, with so many things on his mind, know so precisely how the price of gasoline would respond to that increase in the oil supply? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schumer does know that if you increase the supply of something, the price of it probably will fall. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is why he and 96 other senators recently voted to increase the supply of oil on the market by stopping the flow of oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects against major physical interruptions. Seventy-one of the 97 senators who voted to stop filling the SPR also oppose drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One million barrels is what might today be flowing from ANWR if in 1995 President Clinton had not vetoed legislation to permit drilling there. One million barrels produce 27 million gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventy-two of today's senators - including Schumer, of course, and 38 other Democrats, including Barack Obama, and 33 Republicans, including John McCain - have voted to keep ANWR's estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil off the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Schumer, according to Schumer, is complicit in taking $10 away from every American who buys 20 gallons of gasoline. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democracy,&quot; said H.L. Mencken, &quot;is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The common people of New York want Schumer to be their senator, so they should pipe down about gasoline prices, which are a predictable consequence of their political choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also disqualified from complaining are all voters who sent to Washington senators and representatives who have voted to keep ANWR's oil in the ground, and who voted to put 85 percent of America's offshore territory off-limits to drilling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Minerals Management Service says that restricted area contains perhaps 86 billion barrels of oil and 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas - 10 times the oil and 20 times the natural gas Americans use in a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drilling is under way 60 miles off Florida. The drilling is being done by China, in cooperation with Cuba, which is drilling closer to South Florida than U.S. companies are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANWR is larger than the combined areas of five states (Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware) and drilling along its coastal plain would be confined to a space one-sixth the size of Washington's Dulles Airport. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Offshore? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed or damaged hundreds of drilling rigs without causing a large spill. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has not been a significant spill from an offshore U.S. well since 1969.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the more than 7 billion barrels of oil pumped offshore in the past 25 years, 0.001 percent - that is one-thousandth of 1 percent - has been spilled. Louisiana has more than 3,200 rigs offshore - and a thriving commercial fishing industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Gusher of Lies: The Dangerous Delusions of &quot;Energy Independence</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; Robert Bryce says Brazil's energy success has little to do with its much-discussed ethanol production and much to do with its increased oil production, the vast majority of which comes from off Brazil's shore. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Investor's Business Daily</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reports that Brazil, &quot;which recently made a major oil discovery almost in sight of Rio's beaches,&quot; has leased most of the world's deep-sea drilling rigs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 2006, two U.S. companies announced that their &quot;Jack No. 2&quot; well, in the Gulf 270 miles southwest of New Orleans, had tapped a field with perhaps 15 billion barrels of oil, which would increase America's proven reserves by 50 percent. Just probing four miles below the Gulf's floor costs $100 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress' response to such expenditures is to propose increasing the oil companies' tax burdens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America says to foreign producers: We prefer not to pump our oil, so please pump more of yours, thereby lowering its value, for our benefit. Let it not be said that America has no energy policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington | The John McCain-Barack Obama election looks like one of the clearest choices in years, but history also shows that presidential contests rarely unfold along logical paths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The competition at first glance is a quick study in contrasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is 71, a Vietnam War veteran who's trying to become the oldest person ever elected to a first term. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's 46, a native of Hawaii and a one-time Chicago community organizer who's trying to become the first black person to win the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is a usually loyal Republican with an independent streak; he's voted with his party 88.3 percent of the time in the current Congress, well above his Republican colleagues' average. He likes the idea of making President Bush's tax cuts permanent and thinks the Iraq war remains a vital U.S. interest and a noble cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is a fiercely loyal Democrat with his own independent thoughts. He's voted with his party 96.4 percent of the time since January 2007. He regards the Iraq war as a tragic mistake and wants to cut taxes for the middle and poorer classes while raising them on the wealthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is a 25-year veteran of Congress. Obama's been in the Senate only 3  1/2, and a lot of that time was spent campaigning for the White House - and missing votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates face problems, some obvious, some historic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both still need to unify their parties. Obama lost most of the year's big battleground states in Democratic contests and did poorly among older white voters, many of whom have said they'll give McCain a look.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, though, still isn't the darling of his party's conservative wing; long after his major rivals left the race, he rarely got more than 75 percent of the Republican primary votes in late spring primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both also are fighting history, which shows that November voters don't simply go down checklists and contrast candidates' stands on policy questions. Decisions often are driven by passion about an issue or an image that's been burned in their minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three passions seem to be dominant so far this year, and all offer advantages to Obama: ending the Iraq war, restoring a sense of economic security and ousting the Republican Party from the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war's approval rating was 30 percent in the latest CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll. Bush's job approval was 28 percent. Economic anxiety is higher than at any time since 1991, and $4 a gallon gasoline isn't helping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama will pound home the idea that &quot;a vote for McCain will be seen as a public acceptance of the idea we can stay there (in Iraq) awhile,&quot; said John Fortier, a political analyst at Washington's American Enterprise Institute, a center-right research center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The war was his launching pad during the primaries,&quot; said Carl Pinkele, a professor of politics and government at Ohio Wesleyan University. &quot;It should continue to be a strong asset.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Obama and McCain are close in most national polls. Gallup's daily tracking polls have had them in a virtual tie for the past week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps that's partly because to many voters, Obama remains an uncertain figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, &quot;McCain can pull out his record and show where he has clear positions,&quot; said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain stressed Obama's lack of experience, as well as his liberal voting record, in a speech Tuesday in New Orleans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a few years on my opponent,&quot; McCain said, &quot;so I am surprised that a young man has bought into so many failed ideas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them: &quot;He seems to think government is the answer to every problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, Obama will say that McCain represents a third Bush term and would push the same radical policies that have led to the Iraq quagmire, the sluggish economy, high oil prices and global disdain for the United States.</SPAN></P>
