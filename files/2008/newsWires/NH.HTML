</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans will choose today between two clear and distinct agendas. John McCain proposes more freedom, choice and prosperity. Barack Obama offers less of each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain would rejuvenate America's moribund economy by halving the capital gains and dividend taxes from 15 percent to 7.5, chopping the globally uncompetitive corporate tax from 35 percent to 25, and letting today's 45 percent death tax settle at 15 percent on estates above $5 million. He also has proposed letting Americans choose either today's 67,204-page tax code or a voluntary flatter, simpler tax with two rates of perhaps 25 and 15 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama would stuff a pillow over the face of America's bedridden economy by boosting capital gains and dividend taxes from 15 percent to 20. He would hike top income tax rates from 33 and 35 percent to 36 and 39.6 percent. He also would maintain the 35 percent corporate tax and a 45 percent death tax on estates above $3.5 million. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama promises &quot;tax cuts&quot; to 95 percent of Americans, even though 44 percent of filers pay $0 in income taxes. A shifting target of taxpayers would finance these transfer payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you make $250,000 a year or less, we will not raise your taxes,&quot; Obama declared last July 8. &quot;We will cut your taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Oct. 25, Obama's threshold slipped. &quot;If you have a job, pay taxes and make less than $200,000 a year, you'll get a tax cut,&quot; he said in a commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VP nominee Joe Biden told Scranton, Pa.'s WNEP last week that tax cuts &quot;should go to middle-class people -- people making under $150,000 a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's interesting how their definition of rich has a way of creeping down,&quot; McCain said last month in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wherever Obama's vacuum nozzle lands, he should unplug it. Tax hikes are foolish in boom times and idiotic when the gross domestic product shrinks 0.3 percent, as it did last quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain would revolutionize health care by establishing an individual market, so Americans could own and control their insurance. They could buy across state lines and transport coverage from job to job, to school, to home-based business or wherever. Americans could stop keeping thankless positions at thoughtless companies solely to remain insured. McCain would offer $2,500 refundable tax credits for individuals and $5,000 for families to help purchase coverage that suits their needs, not The Man's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama offers a potpourri of paternalistic options, from keeping employer-provided coverage to buying a government-run plan from his National Health Insurance Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Insurance sold in the Exchange would be guaranteed issue and community rated,&quot; warns National Center for Policy Analysis president John Goodman. &quot;This means people would be able to wait until after they get sick to insure, and they would be able to do so without any financial penalty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coverage costs have soared in states that impose these unforgiving regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is America, the most resourceful country on Earth,&quot; VP nominee Sarah Palin told Toledo, Ohio, voters last Wednesday in a superb energy-policy address. &quot;We can drill, and refine, and mine, enrich, reprocess, invent, build, conserve, grow and use every available means to regain our independence (on energy).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain-Palin's &quot;all of the above&quot; approach would include fast-tracking 45 atomic power plants for construction by 2030. McCain also has promised Iowa corn farmers that they can kiss goodbye their costly, distorted, environmentally ruinous ethanol program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama wants a windfall profits tax -- a disincentive to new oil production. He says he now favors offshore drilling. But watch Democrats exhume the just-expired offshore-drilling moratorium. Obama even sponsored legislation to prohibit expanded high-tech maps and measurements of sub-oceanic hydrocarbons. He also would increase mandated ethanol production 67 percent by 2030 -- never mind the global chaos ethanol triggered by turbo-charging corn prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the economy gasping, America needs greater freedom, broader choices, lower taxes and cheaper energy. John McCain's congruent policies will spur prosperity. Barack Obama's contrary proposals will stymie it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up or down?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You decide.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">966 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long early lines at some New Hampshire polling places suggested that the predicted heavy turnout for Tuesday's election is happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Manchester, where officials said they expected turnout to exceed the 94 percent in the last presidential election, a worker stepped outside the Ward 2 polling place just before the 6 a.m. opening to see a line of about 100 stretching around a curve and into the parking lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My God, look at the people,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machinist Nicholas Diaz, 44, showed up almost an hour early to be first in line. He voted for Republicans in the top races, though he said he trusts both presidential candidates to do right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small-business owner Robert Tubbs, 52, chose Democrat Barack Obama, who would be the first black president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's easily the proudest vote I ever made,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's huge. It opens up this country for everyone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, whose presidential hopes were resurrected in the 2000 and 2008 New Hampshire presidential primaries, was hoping that Tuesday would be a replay of this year's primary: a upset victory for him and a painful and unexpected defeat for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain sounded more like a lovesick teenager than a 72-year-old presidential candidate last month when he told a New Hampshire audience, &quot;I love you. ... I'm asking you to come out one more time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, meanwhile, has been warning against overconfidence, citing his New Hampshire primary loss to Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in January despite polls showing him with a solid lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For those who are getting a little cocky, I've got two words for you: New Hampshire,&quot; he said last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excitement over the presidential race somewhat overshadowed the state's other races, including the bitter rematch between Republican Sen. John Sununu and Democrat Jeanne Shaheen. Sununu portrays the former governor as a &quot;taxing machine&quot; in one ad; she portrays him as President Bush's equally-evil twin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six years ago, when Bush was still popular, Sununu defeated Shaheen by 4 percentage points. This time around, Shaheen had the twin advantages of Obama's coattails and demographic shifts that have boosted Democrats. A recent study by the University of New Hampshire estimated that about one-quarter of the electorate has changed since 2002, with both young voters and newcomers to the state more likely to identify themselves as Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Registered independent David Lamarre-Vincent, executive director of the New Hampshire Council of Churches, illustrated the closeness of the Senate race outside the polls in Concord Tuesday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a real close call for the Senate seat because in dealing with John Sununu in the last couple year, he has been accessible and a critical listener, and when he doesn't agree with you, he will just tell you in a non-hostile fashion. On the war, he's voted several times in the wrong way, but he'll still talk to you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll probably make this decision when I'm in the booth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issues, Shaheen, 61, of Madbury, has pushed for making health care more accessible and affordable, ending the war in Iraq and promoting alternative energy. But she focused much of her energy on trying to link Sununu to the unpopular president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu, 44, of Waterville Valley, has cast himself as a leader on the housing crisis, the economy and the environment who has stood up to his party when necessary to protect taxpayers and civil liberties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1st Congressional District, first-term Democrat Shea-Porter was in a rematch with former Rep. Jeb Bradley, the Republican she defeated in 2006. The Iraq war was the top issue that year, and the nationwide wave of anti-Republican sentiment helped carry Shea-Porter's low-budget, grass-roots campaign to victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the two have sparred over how to bolster the economy, fix the lending crisis and control federal budget deficits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bradley, 56, of Wolfeboro, has criticized Shea-Porter for voting to reverse Bush's tax cuts for upper income Americans and says any tax increase during tough economic times will further slow the economy. Shea-Porter, 55, of Rochester, favors cutting taxes for small businesses and the middle class, while eliminating tax breaks for big corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2nd Congressional District, first-term Democrat Paul Hodes faced political newcomer Jennifer Horn, a Republican who argued that smaller government and lower taxes are the key to economic health. Though she has worked in the health insurance and media industries, Horn, 44, of Nashua, said raising five children has provided her with all the experience she needs to understand the problems facing the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hodes, 57, of Concord, pointed to examples of how he has not only understood but solved some of those problems. He counts as his major achievements creating a commission to steer economic development and federal funding to northern New Hampshire, and Michelle's Law, which guarantees that sick college students won't lose their health insurance if they leave school to seek treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the quietest major race, both Democratic Gov. John Lynch and his Republican challenger, state Sen. Joe Kenney, pitched themselves as the best one to steer the state through tough economic times over the next two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lynch, 55, of Hopkinton, points to his two terms as proof of his ability to manage state finances without an income or sales tax, and says the budget cuts he has made already show voters that he will make more as needed to keep the budget balanced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenney, 48, of Wakefield, argues that Lynch has led the state on a spending spree that will transform frugal New Hampshire and force enactment of an income or sales tax. But voters either haven't heard Kenney's argument or aren't buying it: polls showed Lynch far ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libertarian candidates are on the ballot in all the top races, and independent Ralph Nader was on the presidential ballot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Manchester, where officials expected turnout to exceed the 94 percent in the last presidential election, a worker stepped outside the Ward 2 polling place just before the 6 a.m. opening to see a line of about 100 stretching around a curve and into the parking lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My God, look at the people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machinist Nicholas Diaz, 44, who said the economy is his top issue, voted for Republicans, including Sen. John McCain for president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm pretty sure he realizes we can't continue on this route,&quot; he said of McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small-business owner Robert Tubbs, 52, chose Democrat Barack Obama, who would be the first black president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's easily the proudest vote I ever made,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's huge. It opens up this country for everyone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Durham, a long line of people, some of whom had waited hours for polls to open, cast 375 ballots in the first 40 minutes, more than usually are cast in the first hour of past presidential elections, town moderator Christopher Regan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls around the state were crowded at midday, and another surge was expected in the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of New Hampshire sophomore Kenlyne Exume, 19, said that as an African American she felt a sense of pride in voting for Obama but also trepidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm nervous, she said. &quot;If he doesn't win, it would seem to me and my brothers and sisters that America is not ready for a black president no matter how well-educated or intelligent the candidate is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joan Wolfe, 42, a Republican who is a wife and tutor on the side, came to the polls in Keene with strong feelings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My main issue today is to make votes that protect the lives of the unborn children. Until this country protects the rights of all children, things will continue to get worse,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, whose presidential hopes were resurrected in the 2000 and 2008 New Hampshire presidential primaries, was hoping that Tuesday would be a replay of this year's primary: an upset victory for him and a painful and unexpected defeat for Obama.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you believe recent election polls, Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama is ahead in New Hampshire by 25 ... by 18 ... by 11 ... by 5 ...by 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or maybe not at all -- if you factor in the margin of error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like watching the stock market these days,&quot; said state GOP Party Chairman Fergus Cullen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bombarded by polls in newspapers and on television and the Internet, voters often take away what they want from them, according to voters, pollsters and political observers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ones that show them close are the ones I believe,&quot; said Bedford's Walter Scott, lunching Thursday at J.W. Hill's Sports Bar &amp; Grille in Manchester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pollsters agree on their greatest challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the biggest problem you're having in election polling: who's going to show up,&quot; said Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two UNH polls released last week showed different party breakdowns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One poll, conducted from Oct. 25 to last Monday, had 42 percent of respondents say they were registered undeclared, 31 percent Democratic and 27 percent Republican. That poll had Obama leading, 58 to 33 percent, over Republican nominee John McCain, with a 3.8 percentage point margin of error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second poll, conducted Monday through Wednesday, had 40 percent registered undeclared, 31 percent Republican and 29 percent Democratic. That poll pegged the race 54 to 36 percent, with a 3.9 percentage point margin of error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, Manchester pollster Dick Bennett released a poll that had 35 percent registered undeclareds, 33 percent Republicans and 32 percent Democrats. His poll had Obama ahead, 56 to 41 percent, with a 4 percentage point margin of error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Polls are a rough guesstimate of what the election is at any given point in time,&quot; Smith said. &quot;It's a fuzzy snapshot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither pollster weights his poll by a predetermined percentage of voters based on party registration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Part of the reason is, we don't make any assumptions of what the electorate's going to look like,&quot; Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith said research done by him and two UNH colleagues shows that about a third of all potential voters are new to the state's electoral process since 2000, many of them recent arrivals from Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those new voters are about 10 percent more Democratic than the established voters in the past,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you think there are more polls this year, you would be correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Web sites, such as realclearpolitics.com and fivethirtyeight.com, act as clearinghouses for the explosion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But averaging all the polls in a given state doesn't necessarily give voters an accurate portrayal of what's going on politically, according to Jennifer Donahue, political director at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't just take a whole zoo of animals and put them all in one cage and expect them to work out together,&quot; said Donahue, who has appeared frequently on MSNBC and CNN this election cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bennett said human nature takes hold when viewing polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most people who are interested in polls have their own biases and are looking for polls that support their biases,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith said every household in the state with a telephone land line has an equal chance of being selected. And when someone picks up a phone, he or she is asked to turn it over to the adult with the most recent birthday to keep the sample random, Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it's &quot;getting harder and harder&quot; to get people to answer the phone or agree to be surveyed, but poll callers will try up to eight times to reach specific homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A frequent complaint is that pollsters don't reach cell-phone users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bennett said his firm's polling includes numbers assigned to cell phones. Smith said research shows little difference in the overall voting results when exclusive cell users are mixed with land-line users. And New Hampshire has a small percentage of exclusively cell households, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A survey of exclusive cell-phone users by the Pew Research Center in June showed respondents supported Obama over McCain 61 to 32 percent. But when land-line and cell users were combined, the spread became a 48-40 Obama advantage. A standard land-line survey showed the race at 46-41 Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January, voters and candidates received a cautionary lesson on polling. Some TV commentators and reporters had been writing the political obituary for Obama's main Democratic rival, Sen. Hillary Clinton, based on polling prior to the New Hampshire Primary. A Zogby poll released on primary day had her trailing by 13 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton topped Obama, 39 to 37 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a &quot;lag time when events occur in a campaign and when polls pick them up,&quot; Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Iowa caucuses took place on a Thursday, followed by a New Hampshire debate Saturday night and Clinton's emotional meeting with voters in Portsmouth on Monday before Granite Staters voted Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As recently as the Sunday before the primary, Smith's UNH poll cautioned that about 20 percent of those expecting to vote in the Democratic primary remained undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking back on the Democratic primary, state Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley said, &quot;I think it gives people a healthy skepticism about the polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donahue said pundits and reporters need to be careful to put polls in perspective, providing the margin of error and the number of undecideds rather than flatly stating Candidate X enjoys a 2 percentage point lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think horse races are fun at the track, but I think as much interest the press does have in polls, they have to be used responsibly,&quot; Donahue said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a state where one political season seemingly runs into the next, many voters, including Joe O'Connor of Windham, said they're fed up with polling, campaign commercials and phone calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, O'Connor checked the Internet for the latest poll updates before meeting a friend for lunch Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm ready for it to be over, but I want to see where my guy's at,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A usually elusive 60-40 Senate majority is the Democrats' target in Tuesday's election. They are certain to make gains even if they fall short of those magic numbers needed to break Republican choke holds on their aqenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Senate candidates will benefit from any coattail effect a big Obama victory might bring, as well as from the already weak economy and an unpopular war. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Math also favors Democratic Senate candidates this year. With 35 of the Senate's 100 seats on the ballot Tuesday, Democrats have fewer at risk than do Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After picking up six seats in the 2006 midterm elections to wrest control from Republicans, Democrats have the barest of Senate majorities 51 seats under their control, including two occupied by independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they are overwhelmingly favored to pick up GOP-held seats in Virginia, New Mexico and Colorado, three states where Republican senators are retiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And many Republican incumbents running for re-election are in difficult races. Included in that group is Ted Stevens of Alaska, the longest-serving Republican senator in history who was convicted earlier this week on seven corruption counts. He's high on the list of top Democratic pickup opportunities, even though Alaska has long been a solid Republican state. Stevens spurned pleas by John McCain and party leaders to step aside rather than stay in the race against Democratic challenger Mark Begich, the mayor of Anchorage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on the list of endangered Republicans: Sens. Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina; John Sununu of New Hampshire; Norm Coleman of Minnesota; Gordon Smith of Oregon; Saxby Chambliss of Georgia; Roger Wicker of Mississippi and possibly even Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Democratic-held seats appear in jeopardy, and just one Democratic senator, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, faces a challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have spent heavily in Louisiana, and the GOP's candidate, state Treasurer John Kennedy, is within reach. But recent polls suggest otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Democrats are taking full advantage of the Obama campaign's organizing skills and registration drives, especially in battleground states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've worked hand in glove with the Obama campaign,&quot; said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., chairman of the National Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to a filibuster-proof majority, &quot;It's hard to get to that 60 and I don't want to oversell it,&quot; Schumer said. &quot;But I do think we're going to pick up a large number of seats and that's going to make Democrats very happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a mirror reflection of that optimism, Republicans are glum. Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, says there's no question that the top of the ticket is affecting Senate races, along with the financial crisis. &quot;It's a fairly toxic atmosphere out there&quot; for Republicans, he suggests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He acknowledged that Democrats could still exercise firm control by just coming close to the 60 votes: &quot;I think if the Democrats get to 57 or 58 seats, on a lot of issues they will be able to override a Senate filibuster, because they seem to be able to pick off a few Republicans on a lot of the particular issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shifting political landscape is no more dramatic than in the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In North Carolina, Dole who served in both the Nixon and Reagan administrations and is the wife of 1996 GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole looked at first like a safe bet in her bid for a second term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But revelations that she has spent little time in North Carolina in the past year have allowed Democratic newcomer Kay Hagan, a state senator with financial backing from national Democrats, to make the race one of the nation's most competitive. A late-in-the-race Dole ad suggesting her rival has ties to an atheist group may have backfired. Hagan, who is a Presbyterian Sunday school teacher, took offense and threatened to go to court for a &quot;cease-and-desist&quot; order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In next-door Virginia, another red state won by Bush in 2000 and 2004, Obama has made an aggressive effort and is leading in recent polls. Former Democratic Gov. Mark Warner, a Senate candidate, has a commanding lead in polls over another former Virginia governor, Republican Jim Gilmore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Georgia, incumbent Republican Chambliss looked like another sure winner. But he's being forced into a tight race by Democrat Jim Martin, a former state representative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What changed? A heavy Obama organizing campaign in the state, as in the rest of the South, has resulted in the registration of hundreds of thousands of new voters. In addition, Chambliss angered conservatives by voting for the $700 billion financial bailout bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Chambliss appears slightly ahead, a spirited challenge from a third-party candidate could throw the election to a high-profile Dec. 2 runoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This race looks quite interesting in a way that it didn't a month ago,&quot; said Merle Black, an Emory University political science professor who specializes in southern politics. If the race is forced into a runoff, &quot;Georgia will be the center of the political universe for about a month,&quot; Black said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other close races:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mississippi, where Wicker, the appointed GOP incumbent, is holding a slim lead to fill the remaining four years of the retired Trent Lott's term. Former Democratic Gov. Ronnie Musgrove is making the race more competitive than first anticipated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kentucky, where McConnell, the GOP Senate leader, is being heavily targeted by national Democrats. Although McConnell is favored to hold the seat, the Democratic pressure has kept him in his home state instead of helping other GOP candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minnesota, where Democrat Al Franken, the former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; writer and actor, appears to have pulled ahead of Republican Sen. Norm Coleman in a closely fought contest. In a recent development, a Texas businessman claimed in a lawsuit that he was forced by a political benefactor of Coleman to funnel $75,000 to an insurance company that employs Coleman's wife. Coleman on Friday denied the allegation as &quot;false and defamatory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospects that Obama might win the White House and Democrats gain an effective filibuster-proof majority is not lost on the nation's business community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has poured $30 million into an issue-ads campaign arguing against what it considers would be an antibusiness Congress under a Senate firmly controlled by Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that with a Democratic president, the focus on the Senate becomes even more pronounced, because the Senate will really be the arbiter of the final outcome of legislation,&quot; said Bill Miller, the chamber's political director.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given Jeanne Shaheen's aggressive advertising, you'd think Sen. John Sununu is George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic former governor, in a bitter rematch with the freshman Republican senator, rarely says one man's name without the other. A campaign commercial aired by national Democrats morphs the president's face into the senator's. One, Shaheen suggests, equals the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John Sununu was with me from the beginning,&quot; Bush proclaims in a Shaheen ad. Six of 10 ads on her Web site either mention Bush or feature him with Sununu. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aligning a Republican with the unpopular, lame duck president is as common this election year as the ups and downs of the stock market. But in New Hampshire, the only state in the country to vote for Bush in 2000 and switch to Democrat John Kerry in 2004, the tactic fits right in with the electorate's leftward trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen leads Sununu by 6 percentage points, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll of 600 likely voters conducted Oct. 22-26 by landline telephone. Tellingly, only 14 percent of those in the state approve of the job Bush is doing and only 8 percent say the country is moving in the right direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a long way from their first matchup in 2002. Back then it was a good thing for Sununu to be aligned with Bush. The president was still basking in the political glow from his unwavering response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The economy was healthy and the war in Iraq was still on the planning table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Shaheen was struggling to find a politically acceptable way to overhaul the state's school funding system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That November, Sununu beat her, 51 percent to 47 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fast-forward six years and their fortunes are almost reversed. McCain, who won the state's GOP presidential primaries in 2000 and 2008, is now struggling to wrest the state's four electoral votes from Democrat Barack Obama, sucking media attention from the Senate race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In any other cycle this would be a really exciting race because it is so close and they are combative,&quot; said Wayne L'Esperance, a political science professor at New England College, where the candidates interrupted and talked over each other during a recent debate. &quot;But because we're so focused on this amazing presidential race with a very, very popular Democrat and John McCain, who's a favorite son of New Hampshire, I think a lot of folks have forgotten about this race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Hampshire's Senate race is one of the closest-watched in the country for what it says about the status of the GOP and the prospect that a Shaheen win might help Democrats close in on the 60-vote majority required to quash Republican filibusters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans across the country are arguing in the election's final days that voting Democrats into a governing majority would wreak further havoc on the economy and shut down checks and balances when they are most needed. Democrats counter that one-party rule might mean a quicker fix for the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New Hampshire, both candidates have strong name recognition and plenty of money, and they're both dogged, if not particularly dynamic, campaigners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen entered the race as the favorite last fall, but Sununu closed the gap over the summer. It widened again around the same time polls started showing Obama opening a lead over McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, said that's no coincidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both of these candidates are really at the mercy of the presidential election,&quot; he said of Sununu and Shaheen. &quot;It's going to be difficult for them to break through on their own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are trying, however. And rather than focus on the next president, both candidates are using the current occupant of the White House to make their case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen has been relentless in her efforts to link Sununu to Bush and what she describes as the president's failed policies on everything from the economy to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu, in turn, is reminding voters that Shaheen once supported Bush on the war on terror and his tax cuts with an ad that replays a clip of Shaheen saying &quot;I'll stand with President Bush&quot; over and over. He argues that Shaheen has a history of shifting her positions for political gain, offering as another example the former governor's wavering and ultimate opposition to the financial industry rescue plan Congress recently passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">L'Esperance said Sununu has had to run against his own party to some extent, emphasizing that he's &quot;his own guy.&quot; More often than not, Shaheen has been on the offensive, leaving Sununu to defend his record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the professor said Sununu's efforts to tag Shaheen as a typical tax-and-spend Democrat may prove effective, especially given the concern over the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As much as we may in New Hampshire talk about becoming a blue state, there's still that very strong fiscal conservative streak in voters here,&quot; he said. &quot;You try to appeal to their sense of: 'Wait a minute, taxes? That's a dirty word in New Hampshire.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PORTSMOUTH -- At a time when public support is mounting for capping carbon dioxide on power plants and more federal regulations are expected, Powerspan Corp. is preparing to begin the first demonstrations of its ECO2 technology, a system that attaches to coal-fired power plant stacks and traps CO2. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A one megawatt pilot-scale unit installed at the R.E. Burger Plant in Ohio under operation of FirstEnergy Corp. will go online next month and trap 20 tons of CO2 a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powerspan, a Portsmouth company started in 1994, added 30 jobs this year to grow to 85 employees and has more projects on the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company is conducting studies for $200 million commercial-scale demonstrations of ECO2 at Antelope Valley Station in North Dakota under Basin Electric Power Cooperative and the WA Parish plant in Texas under NRG Energy, operational in 2012 and able to trap a million tons of CO2 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powerspan wants to use the demonstrations to sell the ECO2 to larger 500-megawatt plants that yield 5 million tons of CO2 a year, CEO and cofounder Frank Alix said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carbon dioxide emissions from power plants are unregulated at the federal level, but that could soon change and supercharge sales of the company's multi-million dollar technologies, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We anticipate that CO2 legislation will be passed in the next administration, whether Senator (Barack) Obama or Senator (John) McCain becomes President,&quot; Alix said. &quot;A number of legislative proposals have been introduced in the Senate and House, some of which call for 80 percent reduce in greenhouse gas emission by 2050.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alix started Powerspan Corp. in 1994 and put into operation the first phase of its core technology, the ECO or Electro-Catalytic Oxidation unit, a 50-megawatt unit that removes nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates, on one of R.E. Burger's two 156-megawatt coal-fired boiler stacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company to date has raised $60 million through private equity including The Beacon Group of New Jersey, FirstEnergy Corp. of Ohio, NGEN Partners LLC. of New York, Calvert Group of Maryland, Rockport Capital Partners of Boston, Fluor Corp. of Texas, and Angeleno Group of Calif.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powerspan, founded in 1994 as Zero Emissions Technology Inc., was renamed Powerspan Corp. in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Feeley, a technology manager at National Energy Technology Lab, said a handful of companies, including Alstom Corp. of France, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America Inc. of New York, and Babcock and Wilcox Co. of Virginia, are developing CO2 capture technologies, but so far none has &quot;been commercially demonstrated at a 500-megawatt power plant and been shown to perform up to specs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A national radio report one recent morning in- sinuated that Republi- can John McCain was pulling back from fully contending for votes in Colorado because he had cut back on advertising expenditures there while Democrat Barack Obama had increased his spending. The report never mentioned that McCain is abiding by a public campaign-fi nancing law that Obama also promised to abide by but then renounced. While the pro-Obama news media dwell on Sarah Palin's new clothes, Obama is in fact running the most expensive Presidential campaign in history.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is outspending his opponent by a huge margin never before seen in modern elections. He has so much money that one political columnist wrote last week that Obama's only problem may be trying to spend it all before Nov. 4. As with other unpleasant facts in his record, Obama fi nds excuses for his actions. Having promised to abide by the public-spending cap, he says he broke it because he &quot;knew'' that conservative groups would make independent ad buys to &quot;smear'' him. In fact, far-left groups have been the ones making the big ad buys, to denigrate John McCain. In the last few weeks of the campaign, people in so-called battleground states are seeing television and radio ad ratios of as much as six-to-one for Obama. It is little wonder that much of the election polling refl ects that dominance. But in New Hampshire, at least, independent-minded voters have proved before that it takes more than money and honey to win their vote. They know that John McCain has shown his own independence and has broken with his own political party on matters of principle. It will be interesting, and important, to see if his &quot;Country First'' message can somehow prevail over an avalanche of paid advertisements and uncritical coverage from Obama's adoring media fans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PERHAPS MORE than any group of voters in the country, Granite Staters are accustomed to election banter. But at this point, even they are growing weary of the attacks between Barack Obama and John McCain's campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interviews with a sampling of New Hampshire residents indicates that the negativity of the political races -- especially the presidential election -- is turning them off. It's not enough to keep them home on election day, but enough to have them tune out when attack ad after attack ad appears on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These voters say the candidates would do better to stop the negativity and begin presenting specific plans, in a straightforward way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's unbelievable,&quot; said Marcia Devine of Sandown. She, for one, is threatening a write-in vote -- for her cat, &quot;Buster del Gato.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More seriously, Devine said &quot;it's unconscionable not to vote,&quot; but this 60-year-old self-described &quot;Haight-Ashbury person&quot; -- a reference to the hippies of the late 1960s -- is unhappy with both Obama and McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been horrible,&quot; said Devine, who said she &quot;owns my own business cleaning houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know the English are good at slinging mud, and now I think we've somewhat perfected it here,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Devine said the candidates, instead of speaking to big crowds, &quot;need to go to neighborhoods like mine and see how much we are suffering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronald Gagnon, a 66-year-old retiree from Hooksett, said the negative television ads, besides being bothersome, are giving him no answers to his questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I want to know is, how the hell are we going to get out of this (economic) mess that we're in?&quot; he said. &quot;I've got to live the rest of my life and everything is going up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gagnon, who said he lives in a modular home, said, &quot;I'm not crazy about either&quot; of the presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're always cutting each other up,&quot; not only in advertising, but also during the three debates, he said. &quot;Nothing I'm hearing satisfies me right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A middle-aged woman from Windham who asked not to be named said the campaign rhetoric is far too negative, &quot;but if you're watching, you get the feel of who's who and what they'd do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They tell half-truths, but if you've been listening, you know better than to just swallow it whole. They claim negative advertising works, but I don't like it,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This self-described independent voter said she has &quot;pretty much decided&quot; on who she will vote for, but would not say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was undecided until I heard who the vice presidential candidates were,&quot; she said. &quot;That made a significant difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't go for the negative stuff,&quot; said Francis Devlin, a retired New York City fire chief who moved to Bedford in 1996. &quot;&quot;It's really turning me off now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Devlin also said there were &quot;too many debates&quot; and that he learned nothing from them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that in the final weeks of the campaign, he wants to hear &quot;specific plans on what they plan to do and how they will get it through Congress. The economy is, of course, number one. Iraq is second and then health care, immigration and a whole slew of things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Devlin said that he liked McCain when he campaigned for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000, &quot;but this time, both of the candidates feel they have to be more negative, and that's not the greatest thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Cameron of Raymond, a retiree, said, &quot;It's a little rough and we're not used to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't expect it to be this negative,&quot; he said, &quot;because it's something that hasn't happened that badly in the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he will vote, anyway, but said that who he intends to vote for &quot;is my business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another middle-aged woman who asked not to be named, said, &quot;It's getting old. Honestly, I don't listen to it anymore. If you don't know who you will vote for by now, I don't know when you will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Windham independent said the candidates should think about the children and young people of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's unfortunate that the kids have to see this negativity, and hear it, and that's what they remember,&quot; she said. &quot;It's too bad they have to see adults acting this way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think the negative advertising and campaigning is of any benefit to any candidate who does it,&quot; she said. &quot;The only thing it does is reinforce the opinions of those who have made up their minds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clyde Hiltz of Raymond said he hasn't decided who he will vote for, or if he will vote at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The advertising and news coverage is all one-sided,&quot; said this retired construction worker. &quot;All the information is for Obama, every time you turn around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's frustrating,&quot; he said of the negative advertising. &quot;I just think there is too much of it. They may not be lying, but they are trying to distract people into thinking that they are right, and they are just telling people what they think they want to hear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want less negativity and more solutions, and neither one of them has any,&quot; Hiltz said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald St. Pierre of Londonderry is unfazed by the negativity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've seen many elections like this. It's pretty normal for me,&quot; said the 67-year-old registered Democrat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A retired warehouse laborer, St. Pierre said, &quot;Obama is painting a pretty picture. He's going to take care of everything. He's just trying to make everybody feel good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for McCain, St. Pierre said, &quot;He's telling the truth and he's being too kind _ and he's going to lose this election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shirley Stark of Auburn said her daughter told her &quot;that there is so much of it on the television that she feels like not voting at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just don't listen to it anymore,&quot; said this 81-year-old retiree. &quot;I just turn it off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Tousignant of Manchester said, &quot;Some of the stuff that McCain is saying about Obama is getting out of hand. I think it's going to hurt him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he supports Obama, Tousignant said that neither candidate &quot;is saying much on exactly what they're going to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A retired firefighter, Tousignant, 65, said he wants to hear more about the future of Social Security and Medicare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Devine of Sandown said that when &quot;some Obama people came riding up in their BMW a few weeks ago, that turned me off to begin with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said, 'What's Obama's plan on illegal immigration?' And they looked at their paper and said that he has a comprehensive plan. I said, 'What does that mean?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain has a comprehensive plan, too,&quot; she said. &quot;His plan is, 'Let them all in.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps a middle-aged woman voter from Bedford has the best approach. She said she is reading all she can on the campaign in newspapers and on the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does she think of the negative advertising?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't watch television,&quot; she said. &quot;We don't have one.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HILLARY'S RETURN. New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary winner Hillary Clinton's return to New Hampshire will come on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandra Abrevaya of the Obama campaign tells us that Clinton will be in the state working on behalf of both Obama and Senate candidate Jeanne Shaheen with stops in three communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She will appear on Obama's behalf in Manchester and Salem and with Shaheen in Portsmouth. Times and locations are &quot;to be determined,&quot; Abrevaya said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's pretty clear why Clinton would appear for Obama in Manchester. It's a city she carried over him by more than 3,000 votes in the primary. It's a city in which she and her husband have long been popular, and it's a city in which John McCain, with the endorsement of the New Hampshire Union Leader editorial page, is expected to be strong. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Salem, Clinton defeated Obama by more than 1,300 votes, and this is traditionally a GOP stronghold in which McCain would also be expected to do well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Portsmouth on behalf of Shaheen? Hard to say what the strategy is there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen won nearly 60 percent of the vote there against John Sununu in 2002, even though Sununu won the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2008 primary, it was fairly close: Obama defeated Clinton there by nearly 500 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE OLD JOKE. McCain admits he can't help himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he's in New Hampshire, he just has to tell the old Mo Udall joke, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know, the one about the late Democratic Arizona congressman who ran in the New Hampshire primary in 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one that has one Granite Stater asking another what he thinks of Udall, and the other replying, &quot;I don't know. I only met him twice.&quot; When Udall walked into a barber shop that afternoon and announced himself, the barber said, &quot;Yes, we were just laughing about that this morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain knows it's been told maybe a thousand times, mostly by him, but he told it again at St. Anselm College on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's in my DNA that I always have to tell the old Mo Udall joke,&quot; he told us in a telephone interview later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know why it is,&quot; he said. &quot;Probably every citizen of New Hampshire has heard me tell that joke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They keep telling me: 'Stop! Stop!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And McCain says that more than nine months later, he still has the &quot;lucky penny&quot; given to him by Union Leader Corp. Publisher Joe McQuaid on the morning of the presidential primary, &quot;right here in my pocket. I really do. I carry it around with me all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much more seriously, McCain mentioned in his remarks that he still wears the memorial bracelet of Army Cpl. Matthew Stanley of Wolfeboro, who was killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq two years ago. During the primary campaign, Matthew Stanley's mother, Lynn Savage, asked McCain to promise that her son's death would not be in vain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOE THE CANDIDATE: THE SEQUEL. Last week, we reported that GOP gubernatorial candidate Joe Kenney was snubbed by the McCain-Palin campaign. He wasn't officially scheduled to speak, much less make impromptu talks at vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin's events in Dover, Laconia and Salem, while other top member of the local ticket were rolled out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, during the &quot;warm-up&quot; for McCain on Wednesday, guess who was the first New Hampshire candidate to be welcomed to the microphone by state GOP chair Fergus Cullen?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, &quot;my friends,&quot; Joe the Candidate himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenney, obviously revved up and perhaps unaccustomed to speaking into a microphone before large crowds, came on so strong that his first few words were overtaken by a loud -- very loud -- whine of microphone feedback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then he settled down and urged everyone to &quot;keep New Hampshire New Hampshire&quot; by voting for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NASTY STUFF. A long-running feud between former Republican state Senate candidate Natalie Healy and Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter has boiled over in the past two days into a nasty fight involving Republican 1st District challenger Jeb Bradley and state Democratic chairman Ray Buckley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a 1st CD debate on Wednesday night, Healy, a Gold Star Mother whose son died in Iraq and a Bradley supporter, and fellow Gold Star Mother Debbie Lee of the Move America Forward PAC approached Shea-Porter. Healy asked Shea-Porter why she has not responded to her telephone calls and letters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shea-Porter's congressional office said later she had responded to two Healy letters. Bradley's camp, including Healy, says they were just form letters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suffice to say, a &quot;scene&quot; ensued after the debate, held at Memorial High School in Manchester and sponsored by the Mayor's Youth Advisory Council. Yesterday morning, Bradley began airing a radio ad featuring Healy saying, &quot;I called her three times -- she won't call me back. My son gave his life for our country, and Carol Shea-Porter can't be bothered to talk to me?&quot; The ad continues, &quot;Shame on you, Carol Shea-Porter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee said yesterday that Healy &quot;did receive a form letter, but never a return phone call.&quot; Lee said that after the debate, she turned to those who were left in the audience and announced that Shea-Porter had just committed a &quot;bald-faced lie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee said then Buckley approached her. She did not know who he was at first, but said that his mannerisms were &quot;condescending,&quot; and, she alleges, Buckley said, &quot;We've all lost things in this war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My son is not a thing,&quot; Lee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No,&quot; Buckley told us yesterday, &quot;I did not say that. I was extremely respectful of her and her son's extraordinary sacrifice. I would never say anything remotely like that. Perhaps because of the magnitude of the people all talking at once, especially (Bradley aides) Alicia Preston and Pat Griffin trying to create a scene, Mrs. Lee may have thought she heard that comment but it is just not possible that I actually said that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispute continued yesterday morning at the Legislative Office Building after a news conference in which the MAF PAC endorsed 2nd District GOP hopeful Jennifer Horn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our State House Bureau Chief, Tom Fahey, reports that Lee said she was &quot;disgusted&quot; by Buckley's remarks and attitude. Horn called on Buckley to resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fahey reports:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Buckley arrived in the lobby just after Horn's press conference had ended, reporters circled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is she still trying to milk that fake thing?&quot; he asked. He said the claim that Shea-Porter hasn't responded to Healy is false.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bradley's campaign then issued a press release blasting Shea-Porter and demanding that she ask for Buckley's resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT ABOUT JOHN? John Stephen, who lost to Bradley in the September primary, recently sent an email to supporters urging them to volunteer for the GOP New Hampshire Victory Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His email mentions McCain/Palin and Sununu. No mention of Bradley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The email made its way to Democrats, who wondered if John is still smarting from the primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen said he believes the reelection of Shea-Porter &quot;will eventually lead to higher taxes for everyone across the board, and so, &quot;I certainly support Jeb Bradley and support other Republican candidates who are not looking to raise taxes on any American families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUICK TAKES:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;[#x20ac]&cent; U.S. Rep. Thad McCotter, R-Mich., today will campaign with Bradley in Manchester, Goffstown and Portsmouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;[#x20ac]&cent; The New Hampshire Home Builders Association is having a fundraiser for Bradley and state Senate candidate Fenton Groen tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bradley on Monday in Bedford.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOFFSTOWN -- Calling himself an underdog facing an over-confident opponent, John McCain returned to familiar territory yesterday, urging a crowd of more than 1,000 at St. Anselm College to &quot;fight for what's right for America&quot; and &quot;don't give up hope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican presidential nominee portrayed Barack Obama as a &quot;detached&quot; academic who, McCain said, views the &quot;redistribution of wealth as an end in itself.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm asking you to come out one more time,&quot; said the two-time GOP New Hampshire primary winner. &quot;I know I can count on you again to come from behind and take a victory and bring it all the way to Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love you, New Hampshire,&quot; McCain, accompanied by his wife, Cindy, told supporters and students at the Thomas F. Sullivan Ice Arena. &quot;Some of my happiest, happiest memories are here in this wonderful state. I feel I know you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Granite State Republicans and GOP-voting independents delivered him come-from-behind primary victories over George W. Bush in 2000 and Mitt Romney in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've learned a lot of things over the years from the people of this state,&quot; said McCain, who held more than 100 town hall meetings in the state in each of his two primary campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I know one thing I've learned is it doesn't matter what the pundits think or how confident my opponent is. The people of New Hampshire make their own decisions, and more than once, they've ignored the polls and the pundits and brought me across the finish line first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't think of any place I'd rather be as Election Day draws close than running an underdog campaign in New Hampshire,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said Obama &quot;is looking pretty confident these days,&quot; with &quot;another of those big stadium spectacles in the works,&quot; but he said that &quot;acting like the election is over won't let him take away your chance to have the final say in this election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign preceded McCain's visit with a new Web ad featuring five New Hampshire residents who formerly supported McCain but are now voting for Obama. Former Republican New Hampshire House Deputy Speaker Mike Hill says in the ad that McCain will not &quot;bring change to Washington. I think John McCain is more of the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Democratic coordinated campaign director Colin Van Ostern chided McCain for calling western Pennsylvania &quot;the most patriotic part of America&quot; earlier this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we're all wondering how he'll rank New Hampshire,&quot; Van Ostern said. &quot;Are we less patriotic in the Granite State than they are in western Pennsylvania?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain and the Republican Party continue to try to create a divide among Americans. These divisive tactics simply won't work in the Granite State,&quot; Van Ostern said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain, who has been trailing by small margins in recent state polls, focused on what is always a key issue in New Hampshire: taxes and government spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that Obama told now-famous &quot;Joe the Plumber&quot; his goal is to &quot;spread the wealth around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In other words, Joe and guys like him will earn the wealth,&quot; McCain said. &quot;Barack and politicians like him will spread it ... And whatever the right word is for that way of thinking, the redistribution of wealth is the last thing America needs right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the country needs &quot;policies that create wealth and spread opportunity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said that Obama, a Harvard Law School graduate, &quot;talks about our economy in a detached and economic way, forgetting that the goal is not to redistribute the wealth but to create it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the one thing academics are good at is inventing and redefining terms, which is what he's up to with that phony income tax cut for 95 percent of the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that Obama's plan to give checks to those who do not now pay taxes will cause tax hikes for others, &quot;including many small businesses and a lot of people like Joe the Plumber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He charged that Obama is committed to nearly $2 trillion in new spending with &quot;no explanation at all of how he is going to pay for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain called his own tax cut plan &quot;the real thing,&quot; by doubling the child deduction for all families, cutting the capital gains tax, cutting business taxes and ending taxes on unemployment benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Obama's energy plan will cost $150 billion over 10 years but &quot;doesn't have much to do with actual production from existing energy sources, like offshore drilling or nuclear power,&quot; which McCain strongly backs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said the next President &quot;won't have time to get used to the office&quot; and &quot;cannot invite testing from the world,&quot; as Obama running mate Joe Biden has predicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What America needs at this hour is a fighter,&quot; McCain said, &quot;someone who puts all his cards on the table and trusts the judgment of the American people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fight for a new direction for our country,&quot; McCain urged the crowd. &quot;Fight for what's right for America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program began with Londonderry High School senior Zach Bencal singing the national anthem. Bencal was invited to sing the national anthem at an Obama campaign stop in Londonderry last Thursday, but the anthem was scratched so that time could be made for additional speakers, the Obama campaign said. The Pledge of Allegiance was recited at the Obama event and at yesterday's McCain event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking yesterday were Republican U.S. Sens. Judd Gregg and John Sununu, gubernatorial candidate Joseph Kenney and congressional hopefuls Jeb Bradley and Jennifer Horn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his stop in New Hampshire, McCain was headed to key swing states Ohio and Florida.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MONT VERNON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHE LIKES Obama, he wants McCain, but what Susan and Peter King both agree on is that Americans have a responsibility to get out and vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan King is an ardent supporter of Sen. Barack Obama, while her husband, Peter, supports Sen. John McCain. Living under the same roof but sharing different political philosophies can sometimes be tense, and recently, the couple's split over the candidates created a bit of a logistical problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kings' home is situated on a relatively busy stretch of Route 13 in Mont Vernon, and though her husband wanted to advertise his support for McCain, she wasn't budging on her backing of Obama. But instead of fighting it out, the couple came up with a compromise. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were throwing around ideas about how we could deal with our dilemma,&quot; Susan King said. &quot;Then we came up with a rhyme and decided that was it. We painted up the signs and put them out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In front of the King's home is a series of four Burma Shave-style signs that read: She likes Obama; He wants McCain; If you don't vote; You can't complain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The signs have garnered quite a bit of attention in town, said King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People say they like the signs,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her next-door neighbors, the Spinosas, who, like the Kings, are split on the candidates, have put up a sign that simply says, &quot;Ditto!&quot; Although the signs are a fun way to express a difference of opinion as well as support for each candidate, King hopes they serve a greater purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope we're planting the seed so that everyone will take the responsibility to vote seriously,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It really struck me, when the Iraqis went to vote and they came out with purple ink on their fingers, that they had risked their lives to vote,&quot; she said. &quot;It also struck me how cavalier we are in this country, that we don't vote because we don't have time, or we have other things to do. Those people (the Iraqis) have a passion for democracy that I hope we get back again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At home, there's occasional tension over the King's differing political stances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We disagree on things, but there's a respect there,&quot; King said. &quot;It's amazing to realize that someone you love and live with doesn't see the world as you do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan and Peter share similar views on social issues but part ways when it comes to fiscal policy. Still, she believes that though they appear to be on opposite sides, there's a commonality in their beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we have the same outlook on life,&quot; she said, &quot;but we just get there a different way.&quot; Asked whether she thought the two votes would cancel each other out, King said no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're representing both sides of the debate,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And though the result of the election is important, what she and her husband are most concerned about really is what comes next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the election, there is so much work to do, such an uphill battle, and whoever wins is going to have so much to sort out,&quot; she said. &quot;We've been thinking about signs to put up after the election so that people realize that the serious stuff is still ahead of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDONDERRY -- The Barack Obama train pulled into town yesterday at Mack's Apples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several thousand turned out for the rally, which featured an Obama fresh from Wednesday's debate with Republican opponent Sen. John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic presidential candidate continued to drive home themes from the previous evening in his lone political stop for the day. He returned to the talking points of his campaign, calling for tax cuts for people making less than $250,000, and making a federal health care plan available. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's what Sen. McCain doesn't seem to understand,&quot; Obama told his supporters as they stood in a steady drizzle. &quot;With the economy in turmoil and the American dream at risk, the American people don't want to hear politicians attack each other. You want to hear about how we're going to attack the challenges facing the middle class each and every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also talked about the current economic crisis and tried to tie his policies directly to New Hampshire. He noted the current revenue shortfall in the New Hampshire budget and said he had proposed creating a $25 billion fund in August specifically to help state and local governments address service needs without having to increase local taxes -- including property taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need this fund to help New Hampshire and states across the country pay for health care and education and policy and firefighters without resorting to tax or fee increases,&quot; Obama said. &quot;You've got a great governor in John Lynch. What he needs is a strong partner in Washington, and I am going to be that partner for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from location, the rally bore little similarity to a visit Obama paid last October; size, security and rhetoric were all dramatically bigger. The change in scope was not lost on 10 Londonderry Middle School students attending the rally as a special field trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keegan Smith said he had been to last year's Obama event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so much bigger this time,&quot; he said. &quot;Last year, there were maybe 700 to 800 people across the street. This is huge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celebrity sightings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Obama rally is complete without a few celebrity sightings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actor Justin Long, co-star of &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot; and the popular &quot;I'm a Mac/I'm a PC&quot; commercials was spotted by the middle schoolers and posed for photos. Actor John de Lance, better known as &quot;Q&quot; from &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation,&quot; was also present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not present, or at least not singing the National Anthem at the rally was Londonderry senior Zach Bencal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bencal, who sings the anthem for a number of school events and is actively involved in local community theatre, had been contacted by the Obama campaign to sing the anthem. He agreed to do so, then was told later in the evening the anthem had been scratched from the program. Bencal said he was told by the campaign the decision was a simple programming change to make room for another speaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess it just wasn't meant to be,&quot; Bencal said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandra Abrevaya, communications director for the Obama campaign's Manchester office, confirmed the choice had simply been a last-minute scratch from the rally's program, which included the Pledge of Allegiance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We regret the miscommunication with Zach about today's event but we are pleased that several other New Hampshire residents were able to speak at today's event, where thousands of voters in both parties gathered to hear Sen. Obama discuss his plan to bring the change we need to Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was introduced by Governor John Lynch. Also speaking prior to the senator was New Hampshire Congressman Paul Hodes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally came and went without any notable incidents, said Capt. Bill Hart of Londonderry Police, with no protesters or unexpected traffic snarls to speak of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A half-dozen vehicles improperly parked along Mammoth Road were towed for security reasons, but all things considered, the rally was managed successfully from a logistical standpoint, Hart said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Londonderry Police Department would attempt to reclaim some of the cost to the department for covering the rally from the Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matt Goodwin, a teacher at St. Anselm College, was one of the new faces at this year's rally. An Illinois native, Goodwin moved to New Hampshire in June and had voted in his own state's primary. The rally was the first opportunity he had to see his home-state senator speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought he was great,&quot; he said. &quot;He seemed pretty pumped up from the debate last night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting words</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the rally, former U.S. Congressman Charlie Bass held a teleconference on behalf of the McCain campaign to respond to the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bass spoke of McCain's experience and leadership skills while cautioning against Obama's trade policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bass also mentioned Obama's $25 billion fund to help offset local taxes, but added that it sounded a little too good to be true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm guessing the $25 billion wouldn't be left on a stump at midnight for New Hampshire to come and pick up,&quot; Bass said. &quot;I would expect there would be very significant controls on that money that would make the use of that fund fairly undesirable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Obama and Bass mentioned the latest round of polling in New Hampshire showing a sizable lead for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bass said October was historically a tough month for Republicans in the state and that a turnaround was likely as the election approached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also noted the possibility of a late charge, and called for supporters to finish the race strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are 19 days away from making history. We are 19 days away. But for those of you getting a little cocky, I got two words for you: New Hampshire.&quot; Obama said. &quot;I learned right here, with the help of my great friend and supporter Hillary Clinton, that you cannot let up, you cannot pay too much attention to polls. We've got to keep making our case for change, and we've got to keep fighting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE LINEUP. With both presidential candidates and both vice presidential candidates in New Hampshire over this week and next (John McCain will return Wednesday, according to his campaign), could it be that the race here is closer than expected?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why should McCain and Barack Obama worry about New Hampshire's four electoral votes when there are much bigger prizes still in &quot;toss-up&quot; status?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of New Hampshire Survey Center director Andrew Smith says he still believes &quot;it's going to be a very close state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fundamental dynamics are leaning Democratic at this time, but it's going to be close,&quot; he said, &quot;and if you're John McCain, you're looking for any place you have a chance of picking up votes. And if you're Barack Obama, you want to go places to where it's close and make sure John McCain has no chance anywhere.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;has to win here to have any chance of winning,&quot; Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure everyone remembers Al Gore,&quot; who would have won the election had he not lost New Hampshire by only 7,000 votes to George W. Bush in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REMEMBER NEW HAMPSHIRE. Obama sounded like a front-runner in his speech at Mack's Apples yesterday, focusing on the economy and continuing to liken McCain to President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But earlier yesterday in New York City and again in Londonderry, Obama warned supporters not to get too cozy with his leads in polls in various swing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to about 120 supporters at a breakfast fund-raiser in Manhattan, Obama warned, &quot;For those of you who are feeling giddy or cocky and think this is all set, I just say one word - I guess it's two - New Hampshire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been in these positions before where we were favored and the press starts getting carried away and we end up getting spanked,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama lost the New Hampshire primary to Hillary Clinton despite polls showing him with a substantial lead here following his victory in the Iowa caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And so that's another good lesson that Hillary Clinton taught me. So we want to make sure that we are closing strong, running through the tape,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PLOUFFE'S TAKE. Obama national campaign manager David Plouffe, speaking to the Status by telephone from Chicago after yesterday's Londonderry event, said, &quot;The point is we learned from the primary not to pay too much attention to polls, and it has infiltrated through our organization. But we do like where we are today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that &quot;McCain has performed well in two elections in New Hampshire,&quot; but said his campaign's analysis shows Obama strong among New Hampshire independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is also no doubt that what we saw in 2006 in the state turning Democratic has not abated,&quot; Plouffe said. He said the overall climate in the state is &quot;very positive, but we also know that John McCain has pulled a rabbit out of a hat before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plouffe also hit back at Sarah Palin for her comments in yesterday's New Hampshire Union Leader about Obama and former domestic terrorist Bill Ayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin said she would not hesitate to say again that Obama is &quot;palling around with terrorists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd use that term again in a heartbeat,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plouffe said, &quot;The McCain-Palin attack strategy is backfiring in a major way. That's one of the reasons Obama won the debate so convincingly (Wednesday) night based on voter surveys, because Obama was offering ideas and McCain was attacking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plouffe also said he did not believe Palin was &quot;the best messenger&quot; for the McCain campaign to send to New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his campaign's internal polling shows that Palin is viewed favorably by only 36 percent of New Hampshire independents, while 56 percent view her unfavorably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's puzzling that she'd go to New Hampshire and more puzzling that she'd be launching these attacks,&quot; Plouffe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT ABOUT JOE? We all know about &quot;Joe the Plumber&quot; from Ohio after Wednesday night's presidential debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what about &quot;Joe the Candidate?&quot; For governor, that is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, Joe Kenney is an underdog, to put it mildly, to Democratic incumbent John Lynch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he is, after all, the Republican gubernatorial nominee, part of the GOP team, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To borrow a phrase from Palin, the McCain campaign &quot;ruffled feathers&quot; in the Kenney camp during the Palin tour on Wednesday. Staffers refused to allow Kenney to speak at any of her three events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it weren't for Jeb Bradley, Joe Kenney wouldn't have received a mention at two of the three venues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Joe should have been allowed to speak,&quot; said his campaign manager, Rep. Casey Crane. She said Kenney, a Marine who served two tours in Iraq, &quot;would have motivated the crowd.&quot; Not to mention get some badly needed exposure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenney was officially introduced in Dover, but only Bradley and John Sununu warmed up the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casey said that when Palin was late arriving at Laconia, after Sununu and Bradley had spoken, there was plenty of down time and an empty microphone on stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenney asked the staff for permission to speak to the crowd, but according to Crane, was told &quot;he wasn't listed in the original program to speak, which was sent to Washington to be approved. They said that it couldn't be changed at that point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the McCain campaign never offered originally to have Kenney in the official script.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The senator is a big supporter of John McCain and he still is,&quot; said Crane. &quot;But it made sense to me that with the down time available, he wasn't allowed to rev up the crowd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowd estimates in Laconia ranged from 3,500 to 4,000. There were 1,300 in Dover and a few thousand more in Salem. Kenney could have used the face time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they felt as though they wanted to stick to the script they had,&quot; Crane said. &quot;We were just looking for an opportunity to get the senator up there and we felt as though he, as a Marine Corps vet who served in Iraq twice, would have been a good crowd 'warmer-upper.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of Kenney's friends in the crowd, seeing the microphone sitting there unattended for more than a half-an-hour, urged Kenney to get up and speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Crane said, the McCain campaign does allow Kenney's campaign to use a &quot;back room&quot; at McCain headquarters, which she and Kenney appreciate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Kenney said only, &quot;I'm just happy to know that there were a lot of New Hampshire people who wanted to hear me speak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain-Palin spokesman Jeff Grappone commented in a statement, &quot;Wednesday was all about Governor Palin delivering our party's hopeful message of reform, which will bolster the ticket from top to bottom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW FUND-RAISING FIGURES. The latest campaign finance totals are in for the six major candidates for the three federal offices up for grabs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the U.S. Senate race, Jeanne Shaheen out-raised John Sununu by nearly $1 million between July 1 and Sept. 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen's campaign announced she raised $2.2 million, a record for a candidate for federal office in New Hampshire, between July 1 and Sept. 30. Her campaign did not announce how much money she has on hand and her finance report was not posted on the Federal Election Commission Web site yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest available &quot;on hand&quot; figure for Shaheen is from June 30 - $2.15 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sununu report summary sheet, provided to the Granite Status, shows he raised $1.29 million during the quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the last report on Aug. 21, Sununu raised $918,000, including $589,000 from individuals and $619,000 from political action committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far in the election, Sununu has raised a total of $8 million and entered October with $3.6 million on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1st District U.S. House race, Carol Shea-Porter raised $320,000 in the third quarter, according to her campaign, and $242,000 since Aug. 21, including $93,745 from PACs and $148,000 from individuals. So far in the campaign, she's raised $1.25 million and had $507,000 on hand as of Sept. 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shea-Porter's challenger, Jeb Bradley, raised $203,000 since Aug. 21 and $1 million so far during the campaign, including $200,000 in loans he personally made to his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bradley entered October with $166,000 on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2nd District, Paul Hodes raised $188,000 during the Aug. 21-Sept. 30 period, including $104,000 from individuals and $84,750 from PACs. He $1.8 million so far in the campaign and had $563,000 on hand as of Sept. 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His challenger, Jennifer Horn, raised $107,0000 from Aug. 21 to Sept. 30, including $64,000 from individuals and $40,800 from PACs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horn's campaign has raised $226,000 so far in the campaign. Horn has loaned her campaign $194,600.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She had $109,600 on hand as of Sept. 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These figures do not account for the millions of dollars being spent in advertising by the political parties and special interest groups on behalf of all the candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TOUGH STUFF. The National Republican Congressional Committee has launched a new ad, maybe it's toughest yet, against Shea-Porter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It accuses her of voting &quot;to allow sex offenders and drug dealers to buy homes made available with taxpayer money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How so?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Shea-Porter campaign calls it an &quot;outrageous and unbelievable attack&quot; and says the NRCC is picking out a procedural vote taken in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call, the bill established a $15 billion loan and grant program to help states buy and rehabilitate owner-occupied foreclosed properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House adopted a Democratic amendment barring illegal immigrants from any financial assistance under the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vote being targeted was a motion by Republican Rep. John Shadegg of Arizona to recommit the bill to committee. It also would have added language barring sex offender, drug dealers and perpetrators of mortgage fraud from buying homes made available under the program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The motion to recommit failed, 216-210, after House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank said recommitting the bill would stall its passage. Shea-Porter voted with the majority to keep the bill alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But NRCC spokesman Ken Spain said the vote showed Shea-Porter &quot;seems to be more interested in representing the interests of criminals who have been convicted for infringing upon the laws and freedoms that New Hampshire voters value.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shea-Porter spokesman Pia Carusone said the &quot;GOP spin machine&quot; and &quot;Bradley and his henchmen are distorting a procedural vote and the public will see right through it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORGANIZERS ON THE WAY. A national self-described non-profit called Progressive Future is setting up shop in New Hampshire to work on Obama's behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activists in the state have been emailed asking if they can &quot;host an organizer&quot; in their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUICK TAKES:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;[#x20ac]&cent; A few tickets are still available for the state Democratic Party's annual Jefferson-Jackson Dinner at the Center of New Hampshire Radisson Hotel in Manchester on Saturday night. Barney Frank is the featured speaker. The party says the dinner will attract about 1,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;[#x20ac]&cent; Temple Adath Yesurun Brotherhood Candidates Form is slated for Oct. 26, featuring Sununu, Shaheen, Shea-Porter, Bradley and Kenney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;[#x20ac]&cent; Shaheen received the endorsement of the New Hampshire Troopers Association this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;[#x20ac]&cent; Shea-Porter's staff campaign blogger Susan Bruce resigned this week after posting on PolitickerNH.com that Palin was &quot;using (her) special needs baby as a prop on late night TV appearances.&quot; Bruce apologized for embarrassing Shea-Porter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;[#x20ac]&cent; Esquire magazine got into the endorsement act this week, backing state Democrats Lynch, Shaheen, Hodes and Shea-Porter. They went GOP in Maine, however, backing Sen. Susan Collins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;[#x20ac]&cent; Horn was this week endorsed by Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden said Monday that Republican John McCain is falsely attacking Barack Obama to distract voters from the economy while lurching from one bad idea to another. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every single false charge, every single baseless accusation is a simple attempt to get you to focus on something other than what's affecting your families and your country,&quot; Biden told about 500 people at an American Legion hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've known John McCain for a long, long time,&quot; Biden added. &quot;It's disappointing that his campaign, as a recent analysis has shown, literally 100 percent of the McCain campaign's advertisements are negative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess when you vote with the president 100 percent of the time, you can only attack 100 percent of the time,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study of all presidential ads in the largest 186 TV markets by the University of Wisconsin's advertising project found that nearly every McCain&nbsp;ad from Sept. 28-Oct. 4 was negative, compared to 34 percent of Obama's. Congressional Quarterly found that McCain supported President Bush in Senate votes 90 percent of the time during Bush's eight years in office, though the figure rose to 95 percent in the most recent year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In repeating the Democratic theme that McCain has shifted erratically on the economic crisis, Biden used language that might be seen as a reference to the Arizona senator's age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People assume because he had been a great soldier that he had certain hands, that John in a moment of crisis would know what to do,&quot; Biden said. &quot;Well, ladies and gentlemen, John's hands have been anything but certain the last year. They've been uncertain, and the McCain administration would be uncertain, clinging to the past, lurching from one bad idea to another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now 72, the Arizona senator would be the oldest president ever to begin a first term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urging the audience in Rochester to vote for Obama if they want change, Biden said the country cannot have four more years of what would essentially be more of Bush's policies on health care, the economy, the war and energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, in Manchester, Biden highlighted the differences between economic proposals announced Monday by the presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama has chosen to make a speech on economic policy. John McCain has chosen to do a speech of new attacks. The contrast couldn't be more clear,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign spokesman Ben Porritt responded: &quot;Americans can't afford Obama's proposal for nearly a trillion dollars in new spending which will definitely mean higher taxes and massive amounts of new debt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden also took aim at Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, whose first campaign trip to New Hampshire is scheduled for Wednesday. Palin said during last week's vice presidential debate that she isn't sure humans are responsible for global warming, he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do you resolve global warming if you have no idea how the heck it's caused?&quot; Biden asked.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RISKY BUSINESS. Trying to rescue the nation's economy by spending (or &quot;investing,&quot; as Sen. Judd Gregg says) $700 billion of taxpayer money and potentially running up the already astronomical federal deficit is risky business less than five weeks before an election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate last night passed a revamped version of the plan that was shot down by the House on Monday, with Gregg and John Sununu expected to support it. Another House vote is expected tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, the pressure is on Carol Shea-Porter and Paul Hodes. The pressure from Washington is to pass the plan. The pressure from rank-and-file voters is either heavily against it or split, depending on which member of Congress is asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What will they do? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shea-Porter said at mid-day yesterday she was &quot;desperately trying to get to 'yes'&quot; on the plan, &quot;but I'm not there, yet.&quot; She said negotiators were considering &quot;putting some sweeteners into the bill that would make it easier for some to vote for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she said the sticking point for her -- giving the Treasury Secretary sole authority over how the money is invested -- had not yet been addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shea-Porter said that if the Financial Stability Oversight Board's role is changed from advisory to one that has &quot;teeth,&quot; she would then &quot;sit down and make a decision&quot; and reconsider her &quot;no&quot; vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hodes hadn't seen the Senate or revised House bill, but agreed action was necessary. He said he wanted to see the impact of proposed changes before deciding how he will vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the pressure, while Hodes has said that e-mails he received by his office have been overwhelmingly against the plan, Shea-Porter said the e-mails she received were &quot;50-50.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue certainly makes for strange bedfellows. After the Monday vote, Shea-Porter and Hodes found themselves in agreement with their Republican rivals. The editorial page of this newspaper, hardly a fan of the two Democratic incumbents, gave them &quot;great credit&quot; for their votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Internet has been full of unconfirmed reports that House speaker Nancy Pelosi had given vulnerable incumbent Democrats, especially freshmen, a pass to allow them to vote against the plan on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hodes said that's not the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They (the leadership) asked me, and I said I was a 'no,' and that was that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shea-Porter insisted she &quot;voted my conscience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know,&quot; she added, &quot;I am middle class, and all of my husband's hard-earned retirement dollars are on the line just like everybody else's. All of our money has been put into my husband's retirement plan for the past 30 years.&quot; Despite that, she said, she wants to protect taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Republican side, it's also a tough balancing act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gregg has become the Republican face of the bailout as chief Senate GOP negotiator. Gregg, of course, is also the de facto head of the GOP in New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Republican activist says Gregg's role &quot;complicates&quot; the situation for local Republican candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, 2nd District GOP challenger Jennifer Horn has been adamantly against not only the bill, but the entire notion of a bailout. Jeb Bradley, Shea-Porter's 1st District challenger, was also opposed to the bill killed Monday and says the solution should be a &quot;workout&quot; and not a bailout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both, of course, volunteer compliments for the role Gregg is playing in this dance, but they aren't hiding their opposition to the bill he pushed earlier this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUSPICIONS. Key Republicans and Democrats are on both sides of the bailout. And leaders of both parties are calling the incumbents' and candidates' positions anything but pure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican attorney Ovide Lamontagne was &quot;highly suspicious&quot; of the votes by Shea-Porter and Hodes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've got the Democratic leadership articulating support for this, and they break ranks with their party after voting with the leadership almost 100 percent of the time,&quot; he said. &quot;It's pretty clear that their votes were purely politically motivated, and I haven't read a comment from them that to me is a compelling reason for them to vote as they did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley laughed at Bradley's position.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that just like him?&quot; he said. &quot;Is there a person in New Hampshire who actually thinks that if Jeb Bradley were in Congress, he wouldn't have voted for that bill? Here's a guy who went from moderate to liberal in the New Hampshire House and became a Bush lackey in Congress. And how he's against it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buckley said the choice &quot;has to be confusing for John Sununu when you're about a month before an election and the people of New Hampshire want you to go one way and your President wants you to go another.&quot; Sununu, however, had been clear since Tuesday that he's favored the bill killed Monday and the revised version considered last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUSH'S BIDDING? Not surprisingly, Buckley agreed with the votes cast by the two Democrats in the House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What they did was reasonable,&quot; he said. &quot;They did what an average person sitting at the kitchen table would do. Both of our members were saying we should look at all options before we automatically turn over the keys to our house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attributed Gregg's role in the crisis to &quot;doing Bush's bidding&quot; since he is a &quot;long-time friend of the Bush family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State GOP Chair Fergus Cullen called it a &quot;tough vote for any incumbent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well aware of Gregg's role in the effort, Cullen put himself in the &quot;slow-down-and-take-a-look camp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was &quot;not dissatisfied with the outcome on Monday because it means they go back to the table and negotiate a better plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that in principle, &quot;I always worry when the government thinks it has the answers and can reach them quickly, especially on an issue this complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Were it not for the election being five weeks away, I don't think anyone would be rushing this,&quot; Cullen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RATH AND SULLIVAN AGREE? Wow. It's true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not surprising that attorney Tom Rath, a lifelong Republican, is in favor of a quick action on a bailout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling for an end to partisan bickering, he said, &quot;The remedy may be imperfect, but we can't allow the economic system to swing wildly back and forth without correcting it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But former Democratic chair Kathy Sullivan, who happens to be a real estate investment attorney, agreed that &quot;something needs to be done&quot; although the bill killed on Monday &quot;was probably not the right bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Taxpayers are being asked to invest a lot of money in this thing, so it's important that they are able to see what's going on and that there will be accountability,&quot; Sullivan said. &quot;The problem is that over the last eight years, George Bush has lost so much credibility that it's hard for those who have been voting with him to say that as a leap of faith, they're going to do this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan said that in her professional role, she sees the crisis &quot;starting to affect people here in New Hampshire. The disconnect is that the people in Washington as a whole need to come out an explain to voters why this is necessary and how this happened because it didn't just happen overnight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other activists, Democrat Bill Shaheen, speaking for himself and not his wife, U.S. Senate candidate and former Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, said Congress should slow down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone wants to do the right thing, but we don't know what the right thing is,&quot; he said. &quot;The bailout is a one-legged stool. It needs more parts. What about the jobs and how are we going to pay this back?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should go cautiously,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative activist Sam Pimm said he generally opposes government intervention into &quot;private sector areas,&quot; but &quot;a lot of people's retirement savings, 401Ks and pension plans, are at stake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think they have to act,&quot; he said, &quot;and if what they're saying is true, that they're going to buy the assets and re-sell them and maybe make money, it might be acceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHN GOES POLITICAL. Gov. John Lynch, secure in his own reelection prospects, has made his first overt move of support for Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lynch, who at least outwardly tries to remain nonpartisan and occasionally phones John McCain when he's in the state, penned a highly partisan e-mail to supporters yesterday urging that they sign up for Obama's &quot;Neighborhood Team&quot; to phone-bank and canvass in for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this election,&quot; Lynch writes, &quot;every single vote will matter -- and New Hampshire could be the state that decides this race for the presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He notes that the race for the state's four electoral votes was close in 2000 and 2004 and that this year, &quot;New Hampshire is once again a crucial general election battleground and it's going to take all of us working together&quot; to elect Obama, Shaheen and the rest of the Democratic ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lynch is the heavy favorite in his bid for a third term. He is facing Republican state Sen. Joe Kenney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INSIDE THE GOP. The New Hampshire Reagan Network showed its muscle in internal party politics at the Republican state convention last weekend, resulting in a public display of divisiveness at least among some factions of the state GOP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Network says on its Web site that its &quot;mission is to advocate and advance the principles of the New Hampshire Republican Platform in the spirit of Ronald Reagan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so, according to the aforementioned Pimm, a volunteer for the group and chairman of its political action committee, &quot;We perceived there was going to be a problem with the platform early in the year, and so in April, we started working with New Hampshire Right-to-Life and some of the gun people to recruit people to sign up to run to be delegates to the convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The platform committee assembled by the party leadership recommended streamlining the 2006 platform and, according to Pimm and Network leader Fran Wendelboe, dropped opposition to expanded gambling. While the proposed new platform remained pro-life, some details were dropped that raised concern, Wendelboe said earlier this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pimm said the various conservative groups signed up 100 people to run for delegate to the convention in the party primary elections and the majority of those in the room at the Sunday convention were &quot;movement conservatives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conservatives showed their strength when the convention voted to keep the more detailed 2006 platform in tact and throw out the proposed streamlined version.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vote prompted a nasty (though entertaining) exchange and the airing of proverbial dirty laundry between Pimm and platform committee chairman Jeff Newman on the PolitickerNH Web log.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pimm called Cullen &quot;a liar or an idiot&quot; for saying after the vote that he had no preference on which version was adopted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wendelboe then apologized to rival Cullen on Pimm's behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cullen did not respond until yesterday, when he told the Status, &quot;I'm assuming that Sam Pimm is a spokesman for Fran and anything that he says, she agrees with. That's all I have to say about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OK, then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUICK TAKES:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;[#x20ac]&cent; The McCain campaign today will announce that state Rep. Brenda Ferland, a Charlestown Democrat-turned-independent and former Hillary Clinton supporter, is now backing McCain for President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;[#x20ac]&cent; Randi Weingarten, national president of the American Federation of Teachers, will be leading an AFL-CIO walk for Barack Obama in Concord on Saturday. AFT says it has more than 3,000 members in New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;[#x20ac]&cent; Team Sarah-New Hampshire, an independent group not affiliated with the McCain campaign, has a Web site to promote activism on Sarah Palin's behalf. Headed by Shannon McGinley of Bedford and state Rep. Nancy Elliott of Merrimack, the &quot;team&quot; will hold a rally this morning in front of Manchester's City Hall to gear up for tonight's debate between Palin and Democratic running mate Joe Biden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;[#x20ac]&cent; Former state Commissioner of Education Betty Twomey led a conference call praising Shaheen's commitment to education as governor in response to a new Sununu ad charging that during the Shaheen administration, the dropout rate climbed, she &quot;failed to solve the school funding crisis&quot; and she vetoed school accountability legislation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No governor I worked with was more committed to education than Jeanne Shaheen,&quot; said Twomey, who served from 1994 to 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;[#x20ac]&cent; Republican activist and former White House senior advance representative Jason Recher of Rye is now a senior adviser to Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;[#x20ac]&cent; Republican state Sen. Ted Gatsas says his bid for a fifth term has been endorsed by the Manchester Police Supervisors union.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO'S MORE MUDDY, BILL? New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson on Tuesday made his first visit to the Granite State since finishing fourth in the first-in-the-nation primary, this time as a surrogate for Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I miss you guys,&quot; he told about 100 people -- mostly Obama supporters and students at Southern New Hampshire University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richardson claimed the McCain campaign is &quot;slinging mud&quot; while the Obama campaign is &quot;staying positive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked after the meeting about a new ad that ridicules McCain for being unable to send an email -- an ad that even Joe Biden called &quot;terrible&quot; -- Richardson said, &quot;I think you've got to look at it proportionality. McCain, through his surrogates, through his ads, is many times more negative. You've got to respond. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Obama is saying in that ad that McCain is out of touch, and he is out of touch,&quot; Richardson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He insisted that Obama has responded to &quot;distortions, inaccuracies and even lies, but he's not negative. He is a positive candidate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent Spanish language Obama&nbsp;ad accuses McCain of &quot;lies&quot; on immigration although McCain was one of the top immigration advocates in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richardson, who is Mexican-American and whose state is on the front lines of the immigration issue, said, &quot;John McCain had a good immigration position at the outset, but then he switched to please his right wing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about Democratic unity? A University of New Hampshire/WMUR poll this week showed that 14 percent of former Hillary Clinton voters in the state said they intend to vote for McCain and 10 percent were undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Richardson said Clinton supporters are &quot;moving our way,&quot; and, &quot;In the end, as you see Senator Clinton campaigning more for Senator Obama, and there is a good schedule for her in October, that 14 percent will be significantly reduced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richardson also said that while McCain used to be a maverick, &quot;to get the Republican nomination, he's compromised. He's lost his 'maverickness.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Jeff Grappone cited Biden's criticism of the Obama&nbsp;ad and said, &quot;Let's cut the pretense that Barack Obama represents a new kind of politics and that he's running a positive campaign. Just like any old-style politician, Obama saw his poll numbers slide and approved a series of outrageous smears against John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE D.W. PAC: John Sununu's U.S. Senate leadership political action committee, the Daniel Webster PAC, is the focus of a new complaint to the Attorney General's Office by attorney and former Democratic Chair Kathy Sullivan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan is asking Attorney General Kelly Ayotte to probe whether the PAC violated state election law by failing to register with the state after it made &quot;significant contributions&quot; to candidates for state office in the 2006 and 2008 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State law requires any political committee to register with the Secretary of State &quot;not later than 24 hours after receiving any contribution in excess of $500 or before making any expenditure of $500.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu's campaign says it was not required to file the Daniel Webster PAC with the state because it is filed with the Federal Election Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it is determined the PAC needs to file any additional forms, it will of course do so,&quot; said Sununu spokesman Julie Teer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;THE WALL STREET ISSUE: Who's fault is it? According to the Democrats, Sununu's, of course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, on behalf of Jeanne Shaheen, Democrats continued to accuse Sununu of advocating the lack of regulation that has led to the current financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state Democratic Party released videos of Sununu speaking against credit agency regulation during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2006 and against hedge fund regulation at the University of New Hampshire in April 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan, a real estate attorney and former member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, said the videos show that Sununu is now attempting to &quot;rewrite history&quot; with his expressed &quot;enthusiasm for Wall Street regulation. But as these videos make clear, nothing could be further from the truth. He has been fundamentally opposed to Wall Street oversight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sununu campaign responded by sending us a list of five items it said shows that Sununu has a &quot;record of reform&quot; and a video of a 2005 Senate Banking Committee hearing in which he calls for more oversight and regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign said he also backed more oversight for the insurance industry and credit agency reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu spokesman Teer said Sununu &quot;has helped lead the charge promoting regulatory reforms that could have prevented today's crisis,&quot; while Shaheen's &quot;allies in Washington&quot; fought it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAUL UP, CAROL DOWN: In the latest UNH/WMUR poll, Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter trails Republican challenger and former Rep. Jeb Bradley, 45 to 42 percent, in a survey of 252 likely voters in the 1st District, while 271 likely voters in the 2nd District favored Rep. Paul Hodes over Republican newcomer Jennifer Horn, 38 to 26 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key points: Fully one-third of the 2nd District electorate remains undecided, and the margin of error in each race is large -- 6 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1st District poll, 59 of those surveyed described themselves as registered Democrats, 98 said they were registered independents and 67 said they were registered Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But asked for their personal &quot;party ID&quot; -- that is, what they consider themselves -- 99 respondents described themselves as Democrats, 97 as Republicans and 32 as independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poll director Andy Smith has continued to take heat among partisan Democrats this week for a polling sample they say is skewed toward Republicans. But Smith -- as he did in July -- defended his methodology as an accurate portrayal of those who say they are likely to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independents favored Bradley, 40 to 32 percent. Shea-Porter ran strongest among those 18 to 34 years old, the two were tied in the 35 to 49 age group, and Bradley led among those 50 and older.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2nd District sample included 104 self-described undeclared registered voters, 60 self-described registered Democrats and 91 self-described registered Republicans. Registration aside, 120 of those who responded described themselves as Democrats, 101 as Republicans and 45 as independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women favored Hodes by 40 to 23 percent and men favored him by 36 to 30 percent. He was also ahead in all age groups but was strongest among younger voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MORE ON THE SENATE: The UNH/WMUR Senate poll released on Tuesday had Shaheen leading, 48 to 44 percent overall and by 42 to 39 percent among all-important self-described independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu led 52 to 40 percent among married people, but Shaheen led, 61 to 27 percent, among those who are divorced or separated from their spouses, and, 75 to 19 percent, among those who say they were never married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geographically, Sununu is ahead 53 to 39 percent in the North Country, 54 to 40 percent in the Manchester area and 48 to 44 percent along the Massachusetts border. Shaheen leads in the central part of the state 48 to 44 percent, in the Connecticut Valley, 58 to 28 percent, and on the Seacoast, 57 to 34 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW POLLS: Yesterday produced three new New Hampshire polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the presidential race:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Rasmussen Reports had McCain leading Obama, 49 to 47 percent; last month, Obama led by one percentage point. Rasmussen changed the state's classification from &quot;Leans Democratic&quot; to &quot;Toss-Up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- A poll by Marist College of New York found Obama leading McCain, 48 to 45 percent with 6 percent undecided. When &quot;leaners&quot; were factored in, Obama's lead grew to 51 to 45 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in the Senate race:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Rasmussen Reports released a new poll showing Sununu now leading Shaheen 52 to 47 percent. A month ago, the same poll had Shaheen up by 10 percentage points. Rasmussen said undeclared votes now favor Sununu, 49 to 45 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLLING FOR THE ROCK: Here's a poll that has nothing to do with Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada-based Millennium Gaming, which has owned a option to buy Rockingham Park racetrack since 2005, hired a Virginia firm to conduct detailed polling on how Granite Staters feel about allowing video gambling at the track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someone who was polled recently tells us the approximately 10-minute call begins with questions about local and state spending and government services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The questioner then asks about video gambling at the state's racetrack and then hones in on Rockingham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll callers then state as fact positive remarks about video gaming, such as &quot;millions of people from Massachusetts&quot; will spend money in New Hampshire and Rockingham will be redeveloped if gambling is expanded, and obtain reactions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millennium lobbyist Rich Killion said the company &quot;periodically checks in with New Hampshire residents as to their perception of Rockingham Park and video gaming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HILLARY SENT ME: With polls here and nationally showing reluctance by some of her backers to support Obama, Clinton has set up a nationwide effort to mobilize her supporters on his behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national kickoff of &quot;Hillary Sent Me&quot; will be in Manchester on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton spokesman Kathleen Strand said &quot;thousands have signed up&quot; nationally since the program was unveiled last week and that on Saturday, Clinton supporters wearing &quot;Hillary Sent Me&quot; buttons will go door-to-door for Obama and Shaheen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton descibes the program, organized by her HillPAC, as &quot;a call to action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEARSE'S APPEAL: Independent 1st District congressional candidate Peter Bearse will go before the state Ballot Law Commission to appeal the Secretary of State's rejection of more than 400 petitions he submitted to try to get his name on the ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bearse says he turned in 1,500 signatures himself and more than 200 were sent in by town clerks, but only 1,260 were certified of the 1,500 required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He contends that Assistant Secretary of State Karen Ladd told him she concluded there were 500 unacceptable petitions after measuring the reject pile with a ruler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I and my campaign volunteers spent four months getting those signatures, and they become invalid because a pile of allegedly uncertifiable signatures was measured with a ruler?&quot; Bearse asked in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ladd said Bearse's allegation is not accurate and that since his appeal, she counted 405 rejects, leaving him about 240 short of the number of valid petitions required for him to be on the ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUICK TAKES: Six-term Republican Rep. Fran Wendelboe of New Hampton yesterday announced she is a candidate for Speaker of the New Hampshire House, joining fellow GOP Rep. Sherm Packard of Londonderry. No Democrat has emerged to challenge current speaker Terie Norelli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- The New Hampshire Advantage Coalition has begun asking all federal, state and local candidates to commit to hold the line on spending and support the principles of its cap, which would keep spending to no more than the rate of inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Former GOP congressional candidate Grant Bosse has returned to radio commentary as the new host of the &quot;Wake Up, New Hampshire&quot; morning show on WNTK/WUVR in New London and Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- If tomorrow night's presidential debate goes on as originally planned, the state GOP will host a debate watching party with Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty at the Center of New Hampshire. Obama's camp was planning to have former Republican John Hutson, a member of New Hampshire Veterans for Obama and current the president of the Franklin Pierce Law Center, speak during a party at Obama's Manchester headquarters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DURHAM -- Actor Michael J. Fox said yesterday he believes both presidential candidates back expanded funding for embryonic stem cell research, but with Democrat Barack Obama &quot;there's no mystery about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox, who has been a vocal supporter of stem cell research since being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease a decade ago, was in New Hampshire to back former Gov. Jeanne Shaheen's Senate campaign. Shaheen, a Democrat, is in a tight rematch with Republican Sen. John Sununu, who opposes increased federal funding for the research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though both Obama and Republican Sen. John McCain have voted to relax federal funding restrictions on embryonic stem cell research, some advocates are concerned that McCain might backtrack, given the platform his party recently adopted and his choice of a running mate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with The Associated Press, Fox said the platform plank is troublesome, but he isn't ready to conclude that McCain has changed his mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Historically, Sen. McCain has been a friend to the cause and a supporter of stem cell research. He hasn't specifically reversed himself on that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although, with Sen. Obama, there's no mystery about it,&quot; he added. &quot;There's no veil over any part of his support. His support is total and enthusiastic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party platform includes opposing even private funding for research on surplus embryos, which is currently allowed. McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, has opposed the use of embryos in research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox said he is not particularly concerned with Palin's opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not a political scientist, but my attention is at the top of the ticket,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both McCain and Obama voted in 2006 and 2007 for bills that would increase federal funding for the research, but President Bush vetoed those plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A campaign spokeswoman said Monday that McCain's position hasn't changed, but declined to say specifically what McCain would do if elected. Obama has promised to loosen the restrictions and double National Institutes of Health Funding over 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu, meanwhile, voted against both bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has said he supports funding for research on adult and amniotic stem cells and expanding available embryonic stem cell lines using techniques that do not require the destruction of embryos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the only engineer in the U.S. Senate, I've been proud to protect funding for the National Science Foundation from political manipulation and fully support funding for adult and amniotic stem cell research which has already resulted in a number of treatments that have proven to be successful in patient trials,&quot; Sununu said in a statement yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2007, Democrats portrayed him as the single vote standing in the way of overriding President Bush's veto of the expansion bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen's oldest daughter, Stefany, introduced Fox at the University of New Hampshire, by describing her 10-year-old daughter's diagnosis with juvenile diabetes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can tell you there is nothing more personal than having the man who stole the election from your mother in 2002 be the one vote you needed and the person standing in the way of a cure for your daughter's chronic disease,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists lately have created the equivalent of embryonic stem cells from ordinary skin cells, a breakthrough that could someday produce new treatments for disease without the moral question of embryo cloning. But Fox said it doesn't make sense to eliminate exploration in one area because of success in another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saying 'Let's avoid the controversy,' or 'Let's go with Curtain A because we're not quite sure what's behind Curtain B' I think does the country a disservice,&quot; he said. &quot;It's certainly a disservice to families and patients and people who could be affected by this research.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The star of TV's &quot;Family Ties&quot; and the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; films was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1991 and revealed his condition publicly in 1998. Symptoms of the disease -- a chronic, progressive disorder of the central nervous system -- can include muscle rigidity, tremors and slowness of movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox has acted sporadically since quitting acting full time in 2000, and will appear in four episodes of FX's &quot;Rescue Me&quot; this spring, playing the new boyfriend of star Denis Leary's ex-wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hate each other instantly and it becomes combative and ugly,&quot; he said of his and Leary's characters. &quot;What's interesting about it is my character is in a wheelchair so Dennis struggles with wanting to kick my ass and what does that say about him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox said such appearances aren't a direct attempt to further his cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't act that often,so when I do, my primary concern is that it be fun and something I can do,&quot; he said. &quot;But I think by virtue of who I am, I am attracted to subjects and situations and material that's semi-topical and compelling, that make you think as well as laugh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox campaigned with Democrat John Kerry in 2004 and with several U.S. Senate candidates in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ad for Missouri Democrat Claire McCaskill attracted wide attention when conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh accused him of either acting or going off his medication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox said he isn't looking to replicate that effort in this cycle but has put the word out that he is interested in helping candidates. Shaheen, whom he met in 2004 when she worked for Kerry, was the first to respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his three-minute speech to students, Fox said it's time to let scientists be innovative in tackling a variety of diseases, without political barriers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those families are counting on a new direction in Washington. They are counting on Jeanne Shaheen,&quot; he said. &quot;Let's take the politics out of science. Send Jeanne Shaheen to the U.S. Senate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MANCHESTER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You would think not having trouble around would be a good thing, but don't tell that to Fran Roy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roy admitted to being a little sad the other day when she went out to her back yard and didn't find the homing pigeon she named Trouble waiting for her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went looking for her and she was gone,&quot; Roy said. Call it empty-nest syndrome. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trouble landed in Don and Fran Roy's yard about three weeks ago, a racing bird that apparently lost its way. It seemed to take to the Roys' picturesque Manchester home that sits along the Merrimack River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While they cared for Trouble by setting up a small dog cage with water and birdseed in their back yard, the Roys didn't think the bird would survive the winter without a more permanent home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They put an ad in the lost and found section of the Union Leader, hoping someone would claim the bird. They contacted animal shelters and wildlife sanctuaries around the state and even appealed to Union Leader columnist John Clayton to write about their Trouble. Somehow or another, I was given the story to cover last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My career had really gone to the birds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I figured I'd take a picture, write a short story and that would be the end of it. Boy, was I wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story ran in our paper Monday morning. It was immediately picked up by the wire services and given play in national media outlets. The Roys were even interviewed by a couple of radio talk-show hosts in Davenport, Iowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My e-mail box was soon filled with offers from people from around the country looking for Trouble. A lady in North Carolina wanted to adopt him, so did a woman in Ohio. There were more than a dozen offers from people in New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People also called the Roys telling them of their own stories of lost pigeons landing in their yards. They asked the Roys to pass on their addresses if they found someone willing to take the birds. Apparently it's not that uncommon for these birds to get off track and it's amazing how many people are willing to give them a new home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man in Pennsylvania who originally owned the bird thinks he gave it away along with several dozen others last month during a pigeon club meeting in Connecticut, but is not sure who took it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another man who saw Trouble's picture in the paper said the distinct feathers on its feet indicate the bird is not capable of flying long distances, so he must have been living locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We may never know where Trouble came from, all we know is it had no shortage of offers for a new home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People, as I was reminded by one of my editors, love critters and they certainly made Trouble a media darling. We are in the middle of a historic presidential race, jobs are being lost in record numbers and our financial future is shaky, but somehow a lost pigeon makes headlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama and John McCain should hire this bird as their campaign manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, here I am, writing a second story about a homing pigeon that couldn't find its way home. And you'll be happy to know that Trouble has been adopted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Roys gave the bird to Stanley Shepherd of Manchester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shepherd, 76, has been raising pigeons since he was a kid and currently has about 30 birds he keeps at his daughter's home in Auburn. He tends to them to every day and even bathes them once a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had lost a few recently and answered the Roys' ad hoping they might have found one. Trouble wasn't his, but Shepherd took it anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was an odd-looking pigeon,&quot; Shepherd said. &quot;It was different than the ones I have and I fell in love with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trouble was in its new home by Tuesday and adapting well. Shepherd said it doesn't show an inclination to leave, finding a comfortable perch while the other pigeons take off for their daily flights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Roys said it was fun having Trouble around the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It brought a spark to our lives,&quot; Fran said. &quot;I didn't realize how many people would take an interest in this bird.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither did I.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; Pg. 02</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Barack Obama first began campaigning in New Hampshire in early 2007, many voters swooned. We watched him speak to retirees in Claremont one snowy February day that year. Not a single voter we talked with before he spoke planned to vote for him. Afterwards, many said they would. The word that spontaneously came from the lips of multiple attendees: sincere. They couldn't remember a politician who spoke with such sincerity, they said. And many of them had been voting since World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We wonder what those same voters think of Obama's sincerity now. In the past few weeks, Obama has thrown so many false accusations against John McCain that just keeping track of them has become difficult. And these aren't innocent errors. They are deliberate distortions of the sort Obama has always said he reviles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Obama said of McCain, &quot;He has consistently opposed the sorts of common-sense regulations that might have lessened the current crisis.&quot; That's entirely untrue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As The Washington Post pointed out in an editorial on Friday, McCain in fact has supported many new regulations of financial institutions, including some that Obama opposed. &quot;In 2006, he pushed for stronger regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- while Mr. Obama was notably silent,&quot; The Post wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama attacked McCain for having a top financial adviser who supported a deregulation bill a few years ago. Yet two top Obama financial advisers, with whom he met on Friday to help him form his response to the current troubles on Wall Street, supported the same bill, which was signed by President Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also last week, Obama released a Spanish-language ad that portrayed McCain as anti-immigrant and anti-Hispanic and tried to link him to immigration policies that were not his own as well as some choice Rush Limbaugh quotes that appeared to insult Mexicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who has followed the immigration debate knows that McCain is the most pro-immigration Republican on the national stage and that he is not in the least anti-Hispanic. To pull quotes from Rush Limbaugh, who has completely different immigration views than McCain and who opposed him on that issue for years (and still does) is completely disingenuous. The ad is so bad that even The New York Times called it &quot;misleading.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign also accused McCain of lying when McCain's campaign ran an ad saying that Obama supported sex education for kindergarteners. But the bill in question, which Obama supported in the Illinois state Senate, did indeed change state law to allow sex education for kindergarteners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has said that he won't attack John McCain's motives, only his policies. But he has repeatedly attacked McCain's motives, suggesting that he has been bought off by oil companies and lobbyists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's greatest strength as a candidate, aside from his oratorical skill, has long been his apparent sincerity and decency. Voters attracted to him think of him as that rarest of things: an honest politician. He has claimed himself that he would never engage in the sort of deceptive politicking that he says has tainted Washington for so long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet here he is violating his own professed standards. This is not the Barack Obama so many voters in New Hampshire and elsewhere thought they knew. But it is the real Barack Obama. For despite his rhetoric, he is in fact campaigning so dishonestly that even The Washington Post and The New York Times have called him on it. Which means that he is in practice no different from those regular politicians against whom his entire campaign has been built.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A coalition of 10 northeastern states this week will take steps to check global warming when it conducts the nation's first carbon auction, taking the same approach that curbed lake-killing acid rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental groups, energy producers, and government leaders will be watching closely as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative sells carbon credits Sept. 25 in the first of a series of quarterly online auctions. The cap-and-trade greenhouse gas reduction program, which aims to hold carbon dioxide emissions steady through 2014 and then gradually reduce them, is widely viewed as a model for future programs around the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the leadership vacuum in Washington, it has fallen to the states to take the lead on combating climate change,&quot; said Richard Revesz, dean of the New York University School of Law and an expert on environmental law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July 2003, then-New York Gov. George Pataki brought together nine other governors to develop a regional strategy to limit carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. The bipartisan action followed President Bush's rejection of greenhouse gas reduction goals set under a 1997 United Nations protocol reached in Kyoto, Japan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governors in Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont joined Pataki in the coalition known as RGGI, or &quot;Reggie.&quot; Other regional greenhouse gas coalitions, such as the Western Climate Initiative and the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Accord, are in earlier stages of development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both John McCain and Barack Obama support cap-and-trade programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, seen as key contributors to global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The approach is patterned after the acid rain-reducing program targeting sulfur dioxide that began with a New York law in 1984 and was expanded nationally with amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RGGI caps the total amount of carbon that power plants in the 10-state region can pump out of their smokestacks at the current level 188 million tons. Electric power generators must pay for allowances covering the amount of carbon they emit and RGGI will provide a market-based auction and trading system where the generators can buy, sell and trade the emissions allowances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiative will gradually reduce carbon going into the atmosphere by lowering the cap in several steps, until it is 10 percent below the current level in 2018. During that 10-year span, businesses will have to reduce their emissions. Those that can't, because of cost or technical hurdles, can buy allowances from companies that have achieved cleaner emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies have a financial incentive to curb emissions because they won't have to buy as many credits and because they can sell any they don't need. The price of credits is likely to rise as the cap is lowered. That gives companies more incentive to curb emissions sooner rather than later so they can buy and use credits at a lower price and sell them at a profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, generators can make up for a small percentage of their emissions by purchasing narrowly defined carbon offsets, such as investing in energy-efficient building technology or planting trees to absorb carbon from the atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overal goal is to give utilities an economic incentive, rather than a regulatory mandate, to burn less coal, fuel oil and natural gas, while at the same time making carbon-free energy alternatives such as wind and solar power more economically attractive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While power plants account for only a third of the carbon dioxide generated in the region, they're the easiest source to regulate because their emissions are already monitored in other pollution programs, said Peter Iwanowicz, director of the state Department of Environmental Conservation's Climate Change Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually, the program may be expanded to include sources such as industry and transportation, Iwanowicz said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some business and utility leaders have urged the states to hold off until a national plan is developed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Business Council of New York State warns that the regional plan could harm the power supply and system reliability while increasing energy prices that are already 52 percent higher than the national average for commercial customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research conducted by RGGI projects the typical New York residential customer will see an increase of 78 cents per month. But the Independent Power Producers of New York, an industry group, says the cost assumptions used by RGGI are outdated and inaccurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all energy generators oppose the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're very much in favor of a national cap-and-trade system for reducing carbon emissions because we believe climate change is real and that it requires a national, and really international, solution,&quot; said Don McCloskey, environmental policy manager for Public Service Enterprise Group, a power generator in Newark, N.J.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While other carbon-curtailing programs have been proposed, including a carbon tax, McCloskey said PSEG supports cap-and-trade because it allows companies to use their ingenuity and knowledge of markets to achieve environmental goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that while steep price increases were predicted when a similar program was launched to curb acid rain-causing sulfur dioxide emissions, the worst fears didn't come to pass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-hour auction will be conducted online among previously approved bidders. At the end, bids in the system will be used to determine a clearing price based on supply versus demand. The minimum clearing price is set at $1.86 per ton for the first auction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big question is what the clearing price will end up being. In Europe, carbon trading has hit electric ratepayers hard, with carbon allowances selling for as high as $48 a ton at auction. RGGI has put plans in place to prevent the price from rising above $10 a ton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceeds of the auctions are to be invested in programs to increase energy efficiency, support non-carbon-generating renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, and develop carbon abatement technologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Cramton, a professor at the University of Maryland with a research focus on emissions auctions, said the RGGI program is a good basis for a national cap-and-trade program. But he said a national program should include all sources of carbon emissions, from automobiles to industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The auction isn't limited to electricity generators. Investors or public interest groups also may participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first auction, only one public interest group has registered in hopes of buying carbon credits and taking them out of circulation, Iwanowicz said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to purchase and retire some allowances,&quot; said John Sheehan, spokesman for the Adirondack Council, a group dedicated to preserving the wilderness character of the 6-million-acre Adirondack Park. &quot;We set a goal of 1,000 tons initially.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carbon dioxide emissions are of concern in the Adirondacks, Sheehan said, because global warming could transform the region's fragile boreal ecosystem to a temperate zone similar to Richmond, Va.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Staff and Wire Reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain said yesterday the Federal Reserve needs to stop bailing out failed financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican presidential hopeful, in an appearance in Green Bay, Wis., said the Fed should get back to &quot;its core business of responsibly managing our money supply and inflation,&quot; and he laid out several recommendations for stabilizing markets in the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street and commanded the dialogue in the presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain made little mention of the massive proposal being crafted by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson that could amount to a $1 trillion taxpayer bailout of the mortgage industry. McCain said simply that leaders should put aside partisan differences and &quot;any action should be designed to keep people in their homes and safeguard the life savings of all Americans.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed engineered an $85 billion takeover of insurance giant AIG this week after seizing control of housing giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. To help return the United States to fiscal solvency, McCain said, the powerful central bank should instead focus on shoring up the dollar and keeping inflation low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A strong dollar will reduce energy and food prices,&quot; McCain said to applause from the Green Bay Chamber of Commerce. &quot;It will stimulate sustainable economic growth and get this economy moving again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator again criticized Democratic rival Barack Obama for ties to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and for advocating tax increases McCain said would &quot;turn a recession into a depression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has said he would raise taxes on people making more than $250,000 a year and would cut taxes on the middle class. McCain restated his assertion that Obama had voted to raise taxes on people who make just $42,000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain noted the Illinois senator had taken large campaign contributions from both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and that the one-time head of Obama's vice presidential search team, Jim Johnson, had received a multimillion-dollar severance deal after stepping down as Fannie Mae CEO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe just this once he could spare us the lectures and admit to his own poor judgment in contributing to these problems,&quot; McCain said of Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign released a new television ad yesterday hitting Obama for his connection to Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator is correct when he says Obama is the No. 2 recipient of campaign money from employees of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Obama has collected $126,349 from those sources, according to a compilation by the Center for Responsive Politics, second only to Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who has received $165,400.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain ticked off five points in his call for tighter regulation of financial markets:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First, to deal with the immediate crisis, I will lead in the creation of the Mortgage and Financial Institutions trust -- the MFI. The underlying principle of the MFI or any approach considered by Congress should be to keep people in their homes and safeguard the life savings of all Americans by protecting our financial system and capital markets. This trust will work with the private sector and regulators to identify institutions that are weak and fix them before they become insolvent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The MFI is an early intervention program to help financial institutions avoid bankruptcy, expensive bailouts and damage to their customers,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Second, I will propose and sign into law reforms to prevent financial firms from concealing their bad practices. An inexcusable lack of financial transparency allowed Wall Street firms to engage in reckless behavior that padded their profits and fattened executive bonuses when times were good but now imperil the financial security of millions of Americans when their bets turned sour,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said &quot;regulatory clarity&quot; is needed. &quot;The lack of transparency in our financial markets went unnoticed by the regulatory agencies scattered throughout Washington charged with protecting the common good. We've got the SEC, the FDIC, the CFTC, the SIPC, the OCC, the Fed. At best, this confusing assortment of regulators and institutions was egregiously lax in carrying out their responsibilities. At worst, they engaged in the old Washington game of guarding their bureaucratic turf instead of safeguarding the public interest and protecting investors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said many in the financial services industry &quot;also either forgot or neglected their duty to act ethically and honorably. This shortcoming was aided and abetted by the creation of financial instruments that allowed lenders to escape any responsibility for the risk of their loans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourth, he said, &quot;We must ensure that consumers and investors are protected. Our regulatory system must protect consumers and investors by punishing individuals who engage in fraud, break contracts, or lie to customers -- like the predatory lenders who know you can't afford an adjustable rate mortgage, but mislead you into signing one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, he said, in cases where failing companies seek taxpayer bailouts, the Treasury Department needs to follow consistent policies in deciding whether to guarantee loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, the Federal Reserve should get back to its core business of responsibly managing our money supply and inflation. It needs to get out of the business of bailouts. The Fed needs to return to protecting the purchasing power of the dollar. A strong dollar will reduce energy and food prices. It will stimulate sustainable economic growth and get this economy moving again,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pg. 07</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A consensus has developed among the Obama campaign and commentators in the press that John McCain has decided to lie his way to the White House. Exhibit A in this new consensus is McCain's&nbsp;ad, released last week, claiming that Barack Obama's &quot;one accomplishment&quot; in the field of education was &quot;legislation to teach 'comprehensive sex education' to kindergartners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within moments of the ad's appearance, the Obama campaign called it &quot;shameful and downright perverse.&quot; The legislation in question, a bill in the Illinois state Senate that was supported but not sponsored by Obama, was, according to Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton, &quot;written to protect young children from sexual predators&quot; and had nothing to do with comprehensive sex education for kindergartners. In a stinging final shot, Burton added, &quot;Last week, John McCain told Time magazine he couldn't define what honor was. Now we know why.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But before accepting the story at face value, it might first be a good idea to examine the bill in question. The bill was Senate Bill 99, introduced in the Senate in February 2003. Its broad purpose was to change and update portions of Illinois's existing laws concerning sex education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the bill was introduced, a coalition of groups, including the Illinois Public Health Association, the Illinois State Medical Society, the Cook County Department of Public Health, the Chicago Department of Public Health, the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council and others, issued a news release headlined &quot;Coalition of legislators, physicians and organizations bring Illinois into the 21st century with Omnibus Health Care Package.&quot; It was a three-part campaign; Senate Bill 99, covering &quot;medically accurate sex education,&quot; was the first part, with two other bills addressing &quot;funding for family planning services for women in need&quot; and &quot;contraceptive equity in health insurance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the news release, Senate Bill 99 required that &quot;if a public school teaches sex education, family life education and comprehensive health education courses, all materials and instruction must be medically and factually accurate.&quot; The bill's main sponsor, Sen. Carol Ronen, was quoted saying, &quot;It teaches students about the advantages of abstinence, while also giving them the realistic information they need about the prevention of an unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.&quot; The release contained no mention of sexual predators or inappropriate touching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The old law read: Each class or course in comprehensive sex education offered in any of grades 6 through 12 shall include instruction on the prevention, transmission and spread of AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Bill 99 struck out grade six, changing it to kindergarten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no doubt that the bill did address the question of inappropriate touching. On the other hand, there is also no doubt that, looking at the overall bill, the &quot;touching&quot; provision did not have the prominence that Team Obama has suggested it had, and it certainly wasn't the bill's main purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign suggested I call Ken Swanson, head of the Illinois Education Association and a 20-year veteran of teaching sixth-graders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The intent of the language and inclusion of kindergarten was simply to make it possible to offer age-appropriate, not comprehensive, information for kindergartners so that those young children could be given basic information so that they would be aware of inappropriate behavior by adults,&quot; Swanson told me. &quot;Certainly, it was never intended to be some sort of inappropriate information that might be appropriate for junior high or high school students.&quot; McCain's accusation, Swanson told me, was &quot;bogus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I suggested to Swanson that the bill seemed to provide for HIV education for youngsters before the sixth grade, and perhaps as early as kindergarten. &quot;As I recall the discussion, there was a conversation where in different places in the state -- that was something that should be left to local circumstances,&quot; Swanson told me. &quot;What might be appropriate in an urban inner city might not be appropriate in a rural community. I don't recall anybody, from our perspective, having a one-rule-fits-all vision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only bill sponsor who would talk to me was Sen. Iris Martinez. Martinez began by saying that the bill was indeed about inappropriate touching. &quot;We know that young children, very, very young, have things happen to them that they don't speak about,&quot; Martinez told me. &quot;It's important that we teach our young kids very, very young to speak up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I asked Martinez the rationale for changing grade six to kindergarten, she said that groups like Planned Parenthood and the Cook County Department of Health -- both major contributors to the bill -- &quot;were finding that there were children younger than the sixth grade who were being inappropriately touched or molested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I told Martinez that reading the bill, I just didn't see it as being exclusively, or even mostly, about inappropriate touching. &quot;I didn't see it that way either,&quot; Martinez said. &quot;It's just more information about a whole variety of things that have to go into a sex education class, the things that are outdated that you want to amend with things that are much more current.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, I asked, you didn't see it specifically as being about inappropriate touching?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Absolutely not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is the bill's intention was to mandate that issues like contraception and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases be included in sex-education classes for children before the sixth grade, and as early as kindergarten. Obama's defenders may howl, but the bill is what it is.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLLS AND MORE POLLS. As we head into the final six weeks of the national and state campaigns, what's expected to be a flurry of New Hampshire polling gets started today with numbers from the American Research Group. Expect new polls from the University of New Hampshire and WMUR early next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARG's new poll, to be officially released today, shows the presidential race in New Hampshire in a dead heat; Jeanne Shaheen with a substantial, but not insurmountable, lead over John Sununu; and John Lynch is, not surprisingly, far out in front of Joe Kenney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OBAMA-McCAIN. The battle for swing state New Hampshire's four electoral votes has been a statistical tie since mid-summer, and that continues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARG has John McCain leading Barack Obama, 48 to 45 percent with 6 percent undecided. The poll of 600 likely voters was taken Sept. 13 to 15 and has a margin of error of 4 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARG's mid-August poll had Obama up, 46 to 45 percent, and its mid-July poll had Obama ahead, 47 to 45 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two candidates are dead even among independents at 45 percent each, with 2 percent preferring another candidate and 8 percent undecided. McCain leads among Republicans, 85 to 11 percent, while Obama leads among Democrats, 82 to 12 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men prefer McCain 58 to 36 percent while women prefer Obama, 54 to 38 percent. Obama leads among younger votes while McCain leads among older votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHAHEEN'S LEAD. Democrat Shaheen has consistently led Republican Sununu in ARG's polls this year. She also has led in Rasmussen Reports polls, although a UNH poll in July had the race in a statistical dead heat. It will be interesting to see what UNH reports next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the first independent poll of this important race in nearly a month, ARG has Shaheen leading Sununu 52 to 40 percent with 8 percent undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August, ARG had Shaheen ahead, 52 to 41 percent and Rasmussen Reports had her ahead, 50 to 41 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARG's Dick Bennett's polling sample of 600 comprises 42 percent self-described independents, 30 percent Republicans and 28 percent Democrats. The state registration breakdown, according to the latest figures from the Secretary of State's Office, is 38.5 percent independent, 31 percent Republican and 30.5 percent Democratic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bennett said those surveyed are screened twice to be sure they are likely voters. He said that before being interviewed, they're asked, on a scale of one to 10, how likely they are to vote. Only those who respond in the seven to 10 range are interviewed, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the interview, Bennett said, participants are asked again if they are definitely going to vote, and only those who respond in the affirmative are used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARG's poll finds that Shaheen maintains a big lead over Sununu among independents, 59 to 35 percent, with 6 percent undecided. Democrats prefer Shaheen, 82 to 6 percent with 12 percent undecided, while Republicans prefer Sununu, 80 to 13 percent with 7 percent undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bennett said many of the independents supporting McCain then appear to move Shaheen, instead of Sununu. Bennett says the movement shows that they believe McCain is a maverick but don't yet buy Sununu's argument that he has been independent of the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also shows, he said, that the &quot;George Bush clone&quot; drumbeat used by the Democrats against all Republicans is sticking to Sununu but not McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Sununu captured the same number of independents that McCain has, the race would be almost tied,&quot; Bennett said. &quot;Sununu may have stood against the Republican Party a few times, but he still isn't known as someone who pokes George Bush and the Republican Party in the eye.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Bennett said the Senate race is far from over. He said that given the volatility of the political climate, &quot;21 percentage points could shift around very easily.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NO SURPRISE HERE. ARG's poll has Democratic Gov. Lynch leading his Republican challenger, Kenney, 62 to 31 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lynch received the support of 94 percent of Democrats and 66 percent of independents, while Kenney led among Republicans, 64 to 27 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE WALL STREET PLAY. Will New Hampshire have political winners and losers as the Wall Street crisis continues?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Sununu said his piece on Tuesday, Shaheen held a conference call yesterday with Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., and said &quot;John Sununu and his allies&quot; have brought on the crisis by backing lax -- if not a lack of -- regulation of the financial industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has sat back while the administration has gutted oversight of lending practices on Wall Street,&quot; Shaheen said. &quot;One of the root causes of the crisis has been what's happened with regulation of our financial institutions and also the deterioration of regulation in our mortgage market. John Sununu has sat on the Senate Banking Committee for five years while the crisis was developing and took no action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen called for disclosure requirements for all financial institutions, an end to &quot;our patchwork system of overlapping and competing oversight, and regulation of financial institutions based on the products and services they offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If investment banks are in the mortgage loan business, they should be subject to the same regulation as anyone else in that business,&quot; Shaheen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen said voters should ask themselves, &quot;Are the people who got us into this mess really going to be able to get us out?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu countered in an interview that Shaheen &quot;has no idea what she's talking about&quot; because he has supported stricter oversight of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the insurance industry since his first year in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he wrote legislation five years ago to strengthen regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but the bill never made it to the Senate floor because Democrats, led by New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, opposed it and would have filibustered it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he also backed reform of credit rating regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My record goes back at least five years of leading efforts to try to address the risks to the financial system,&quot; Sununu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO WILL TAKE THE HEAT? UNH pollster and political science professor Andrew Smith said the party in control of the White House historically is blamed for economic downturns, but with both sides pointing fingers, &quot;We'll see who's more skillful at it. The fact is there is enough blame to go around for anything that goes on in Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bennett said the crisis is actually &quot;a tremendous opportunity for any of the candidates to articulate what exactly is going on and say, 'This is what we should be doing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who will make the voters feel better about what's going on?&quot; he asked. &quot;That's the question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE RON PAUL LETTER. Libertarian-leaning Republican Congressman Ron Paul isn't endorsing Sununu but &quot;had some nice things to say about him,&quot; says Sununu spokesman Julie Teer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sununu campaign in the past few days sent a campaign recruitment letter to thousands of New Hampshire Ron Paul supporters as it tries to &quot;work for every vote we can get,&quot; Teer said. Presumably, the campaign worked from the former presidential candidate's first-in-the-nation primary voter list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Topping the letter is a quote from Paul that was requested by the Sununu campaign, said Teer. Paul says Sununu &quot;shares my commitment to freedom; to let Americans keep more of their own money, to protect our privacy and stop a national ID card and to secure our borders and end illegal immigration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John has led the fight to protect the Internet from taxes and regulation, and has been a steadfast supporter of Second Amendment rights,&quot; Paul writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu then writes that he knows, &quot;as you do, that freedom and liberty have a great friend in Congressman Paul.&quot; He discusses his record of supporting low taxes, civil liberties and privacy and opposing &quot;amnesty for illegal aliens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Won't you please get involved in our campaign?&quot; Sununu asks, noting the enclosure of a postage-paid volunteer reply card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. The local chambers of commerce of greater Manchester and greater Nashua have told their members the organizations have had nothing to do with a television advertisement critical of Shaheen paid for by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, which has been airing for several weeks, calls the former governor a &quot;taxing machine&quot; and says she signed the statewide property tax into law, proposed a sales tax and raised taxes on &quot;skiing, movies, fishing and phone bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want you to know that we have not been involved with the U.S. Chamber ad in any way; nor will we engage with similar campaigns in the future,&quot; GMCC President and CEO Robin Comstock wrote in a recent e-mail to members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She wrote that she was responding to &quot;numerous inquiries&quot; about the Manchester chamber's relationship to the U.S. chamber as a result of the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comstock wrote that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is a &quot;national business advocacy organization that regularly lobbies on issues they determine to affect the national business community&quot; and often endorses candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Manchester chamber, she wrote, is a &quot;non-partisan business advocacy organization&quot; that &quot;serves a very different role and has objectives and strategic goals centered on the needs and interest of the local business community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not, nor have we ever, endorsed a particular candidate in any political campaign,&quot; and, &quot;I do not see that practice changing in the future,&quot; Comstock wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comstock wrote that the Manchester chamber is &quot;not a division, department, or associate of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on any level. We are totally independent from them and their program of work; and we are totally removed from their lobbyist and other PAC related efforts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that neither she nor anyone from the chamber office was briefed on the ad &quot;or contributed to its development in any way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comstock said she had about &quot;80 or 100 contacts&quot; about the ad and felt a need to issue the clarification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An e-mail with similar language was sent by Greater Nashua Chamber of Commerce chief Chris Williams to that group's members on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A PRIVATE PHONE-JAM MEETING. When we last left the nearly 6-year-old New Hampshire phone-jamming scandal, a Democrat-led U.S. House Judiciary Subcommittee had subpoenaed the Bush administration's Justice Department for information &quot;relating to the approval, scope and timing&quot; of the federal probe of the GOP operation that jammed the get-out-the-vote phones at Democratic and firefighters union offices on election day, 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subcommittee is probing whether the Justice Department, for political reasons, stalled a criminal prosecution of former national GOP official James Tobin until after the 2004 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subpoena was issued in June, and last week, the department responded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to committee chair Rep. John Conyers, the agency offered to &quot;accommodate your interests in discrete questions relating to the New Hampshire Phone Jamming matter&quot; during a private briefing with committee staff &quot;in the next several weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The briefing will respond to your information needs about the timing of the Tobin indictment, the decision not to indict the New Hampshire Republican party, and the decision to intervene in the (related) state civil case; it will likely include access to certain germane documents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former state Democratic Chair Kathy Sullivan called department's offer &quot;not satisfactory&quot; from where she sits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She called on Sununu to &quot;step up to the plate and demand that the Justice Department provide this information publicly, not in secret, and that it be done before the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The phones were jammed during the first Sununu-Shaheen election in 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MARCHAND ON THE MOVE. Democratic activist former Portsmouth mayor Steve Marchand and Concord City Councilor Rob Werner have started a new PAC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Granite PAC&quot; is dedicated to &quot;building a sustainable, governable, Democratic majority,&quot; but some in the party wonder if it's really a forerunner to a Marchand campaign for statewide office (U.S. Senate again, maybe?) in 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Democrats also note the irony that PAC treasurer Werner is national field director for John Rauh's &quot;Just $6&quot; nationwide campaign finance reform group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marchand introduced Granite PAC in an e-mail yesterday to Democrats throughout the state. He also asks for contributions toward a fundraising goal of $25,000 in the next few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THEIR FIRST DEBATE. Second District U.S. House hopefuls Paul Hodes, the incumbent, and Jennifer Horn, the challenger, will debate for the first time on Monday at New England College's Simon Center in an event sponsored by AARP New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AARP says the debate will focus on health care and &quot;improving lifetime financial security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUICK TAKES:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;[#x20ac]&cent; The New Hampshire Advantage Coalition is planning a big fundraising event. As the attorney general continues to investigate a Democratic complaint that NHAC broke state election law by engaging in partisan political activity after filing with the IRS as a nonprofit issues advocacy group, NHAC will hold a &quot;Defending the New Hampshire Advantage&quot; event at the Derryfield Country Club in Manchester on Oct. 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Best&quot; and &quot;worst&quot; awards will be given to politicians who worked to preserve or erode the state's low-tax structure. Tickets are $25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;[#x20ac]&cent; Mike Huckabee continues to be involved in New Hampshire politics. Yesterday he endorsed District 3 GOP Executive Council candidate Russell Prescott. Today, he'll endorse congressional candidate Jeb Bradley and feature both on his &quot;HuckPAC&quot; Web site. During the primary, he endorsed unsuccessful congressional hopeful Bob Clegg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaigns of all three are (and were) being handled by Huckabee's state campaign manager during the presidential primary, consultant Deb Vander Beek.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOUDON -- Looking to appeal to &quot;Hillary Clinton Democrats,&quot; Republican presidential candidate John McCain opened a NASCAR race yesterday at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a whole lot of what we used to call Reagan Democrats there, maybe Hillary Clinton Democrats; I think a lot of those votes are up for grabs,&quot; said McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those voters, he said, will determine the outcome of the November presidential election, not only in New Hampshire but around the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said his campaign gained traction with independents and voters who once supported Clinton after Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was named as the vice presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But again, I still consider our team -- Governor Palin and me -- to be underdogs; we've got a long way to go,&quot; McCain said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin spent yesterday in Denver. McCain said she will be in the state before Election Day, but no specifics were available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there are going to be late deciders and they expect to see us,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both McCain and Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama have eyed New Hampshire's four electoral votes as a must-win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama campaigned in the state Friday and Saturday. McCain flew in yesterday to participate in the start of the Sylvania 300 Sprint Cup Series race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling and NASCAR legend Richard Petty in tow, fans swarmed McCain during a pre-race tour of the track's garage area. He briefly spoke to a meeting of drivers, thanking them for their support of the armed services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I'm in Iraq and Afghanistan, they're watching you,&quot; he said. &quot;You are their role models.&quot; After delivering brief remarks to the crowd, estimated to be about 100,000, McCain was quickly back on board one of his signature &quot;Straight Talk Express&quot; buses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While sipping coffee with wife Cindy McCain at the back of the bus, he blamed a post-convention spike in negative campaign ads on Obama, the Democratic National Committee and MoveOn.org.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure it wouldn't have gotten this negative if we had done town hall meetings,&quot; McCain said of his offer to hold joint question-and-answer sessions with Obama. &quot;When you are standing right next to somebody, you are kind of in control of the campaign and that's the news. The news isn't what your campaign spokesperson or a surrogate said, it's what happened at (the town hall).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has put out an ad accusing the McCain camp of being riddled with Washington lobbyists. McCain's campaign, in an ad, has accused Obama of calling Palin a pig.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain added that one of his &quot;whoops&quot; moments has turned into one of the more heavily played ads of this campaign season. The ad shows him responding to a question during a town hall forum, where he said troops might stay in Iraq for 100 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed,&quot; he said at the town hall meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he said, voters will reject negative campaigning, especially as economic woes continue to drive the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's obviously the economy, the economy, the economy,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;People are hurting, go up to Berlin (N.H.) and you've seen it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's New Hampshire communications director Sandra Abrevaya issued this statement yesterday:&quot;Yesterday, John McCain said that he is going 'to cut taxes for literally everybody' and take Barack Obama's New Hampshire pledge not to raise taxes for anyone making less than $250,000. Has he changed his tax plan, or has he forgotten what's in it? Even McCain's top campaign adviser has acknowledged that some people would pay more under McCain's plan, and his top economic adviser has confirmed that the McCain health plan is financed by a $3.6 trillion tax increase on average Americans' health benefits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She continued: &quot;If you're not going to tell the truth while you're running for President, why should we believe that you'd tell the truth once you're in office?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain got a warm reception from most of the race-goers at the Loudon track yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Lambert of Litchfield, a project manager for a construction firm, said he agrees with McCain on the importance of the surge in Iraq and his tax-cutting philosophy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm definitely on board with him and I think he made a good choice for vice president,&quot; Lambert said of Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norman Caron of Fitzwilliam said that he supports McCain and thinks his choice of Palin has energized the Republican campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's more one of us. I can see her standing here with us cooking sausages and having a beer,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Keisling, a Nashua accountant, said that he's voting for McCain because of his fears about an Obama presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He can't go overseas and talk with those foreign leaders and expect that just asking them to be nice to us is going to work. You've got to be in a position of strength and be ready to use force if you need to,&quot; Keisling said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1350 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CANDIDATES and political action groups have put up more than $11 million for political ads on WMUR this election season. And counting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest tally of political spending at the state's largest commercial television station shows the biggest bucks -- more than $5.4 million -- going to the U.S. Senate race between Republican U.S. Sen. John Sununu and Democratic former Gov. Jeanne Shaheen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Senate Campaign Committee and National Republican Senate Committee have spent $4.5 million for a combined 1,456 slots over the next seven weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Shaheen and Sununu campaigns are spending their own money, too. Shaheen has put down $644,669 for political ads and Sununu has bought $156,580, so far. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If no one buys another ad, WMUR will have shown more than 6,800 political ads for all races between Aug. 12 and Election Day on Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But don't stop counting. Neither John McCain nor Barack Obama have reserved a single spot beyond Sept. 22. And you know that's going to change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among Congressional candidates, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee bought $1,146,250 in air time. Add that to totals for U.S. Rep Carol Shea Porter, who's spent $211,000, and U.S. Rep. Paul Hodes, who so far has spent $119,880.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans to date are slow off the mark. There's no reported spending by the Republicans' national office, although the Shea Porter-Jeb Bradley match-up is considered a targeted race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his winning primary campaign, Bradley spent $111,795 on WMUR ads. John Stephen spent $105,082. Sounds even, but Bradley outspent Stephen more than 2-to-1 in the week leading up to the primary, dropping $65,000 in the seven-day stretch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the biggest state office contest, Gov. John Lynch has reserved $310,000 worth of time compared to Republican state Sen. Joe Kenney's $7,575.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRADLEY DIALS AG: Alicia Preston, campaign spokesman for Bradley, said his complaint about a version of phone jamming remains in effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bradley's camp asked Attorney General Kelly Ayotte to investigate a Monday evening incident in which hang-up calls went out to voters. Caller ID devices read out the Jeb Bradley for Congress campaign, even though Bradley's folks knew nothing of it. Then complaints started flooding Bradley's office, tying up phone lines workers were using a get-out-the vote effort. They had to shut down phones for two hours, and determined the problem was not on their end, Preston said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't know who did it, we made no accusation about who did it, and we don't know exactly what happened,&quot;&Atilde;[#x201a]&quot;she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Attorney General Bud Fitch said he is not aware of any similar complaints this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good news is that these stories are few and far between,&quot;&Atilde;[#x201a]&quot;he said. &quot;We're nonetheless looking into it, trying to determine the facts first, and then see if there is anything we can take action against.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAC-MAE MILLIONS: Hodes is questioning how billions in taxpayer money can be sunk into Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae mortgage bailouts, while executives of the two public-private mortgage lenders get healthy severance packages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CEOs of the two companies will get packages worth about $15 million each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If these companies were in such serious financial difficulty that they needed help to carry out their mission, they certainly don't have money to spare on golden parachutes. Nobody should be getting rich off taxpayer dollars,&quot;&Atilde;[#x201a]&quot;Hodes wrote Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">$90,000 PARACHUTE: In New Hampshire's own little severance pay dustup, Sen. Ted Gatsas was subdued at a Fiscal Committee meeting last week, choosing not to challenge the $90,000 severance package to which outgoing New Hampshire Retirement System executive director Constance Donovan is entitled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gatsas asked for a copy of her contract, which states clearly she gets six months pay if she gives 90 days notice before leaving her post, not to mention health insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donovan had only been on the job three months in July when the BTR Solutions consulting group from York Beach, Maine, delivered its workplace assessment to NHRS. In-house communications were the big issue. BTR said that workers consistently described communication after management meetings as &quot;like the old party comedy game&Atilde;[#x201a]&quot; where players whisper a message around a circle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gossip appears to have become a more trusted communication of information,&quot;&Atilde;[#x201a]&quot; BTR wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morale wasn't so hot, either. On a scale of 1 to 5, supervisors rated the level of respect in the organization at a 3; employees gave it a 2.6. Supervisors rated the level of trust at a 2.3, and other employees gave it a 2.1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BTR said the feelings and problems aren't a total surprise for an organization that has seen two executive directors and three board chairs in the course of only a few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NHRS employees &quot;have not had a consistent leadership role model for too long. Bad habits develop in such an environment,&quot;&Atilde;[#x201a]&quot;the consultants wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A separate audit report by KPMG found that NHRS lacks clearly documented computer systems policies, resulting in an environment where governance is difficult and proper control procedures are either not implemented or not being effectively followed.&Atilde;[#x201a]&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FIGHTING CONGRESS: New Hampshire came close to major delays on key projects in congressional wrangling over the federal highway bill. Sen. Judd Gregg was a leader in the fight against adding $8 billion to the bill that sends funding to each state, but he relented last week. Passage avoided the cut of $52 million and the loss of up to 1,800 construction-related jobs here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transportation Commissioner George Campbell prepared a list of endangered work for Gov. Lynch and the Executive Council. It included a one-year hold on a $22 million contract for the rusting Memorial Bridge in Portsmouth and delays on $17 million in work on I-93 at Exit 3, $4.5 million on the Manchester Airport access road and $9 million on Route 12A reconstruction in Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campbell noted that the state saved $5 million on the I-93 work in question, because contractors bid the job for less than what the state expected. A delay might have seen that saving lost in a new round of bidding, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executive Councilor Ray Burton criticized fellow-Republican Gregg in a statement. &quot;New Hampshire had to fight against its own U.S. senator to ensure that Congress kept its promise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He praised Lynch, Hodes, House Public Works and Highways chair Rep. Candace Bouchard, all Democrats, and Sen. Bob Letourneau for their work to advance the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUILDING WAR CHEST: The state GOP announced last week it has formed a new finance committee to raise funds for Republican contests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party chair Fergus Cullen said: &quot;State party finances are stronger today than they've been at any time since the 2004 election, and this talented and connected group will ensure we have the resources we need to help our candidates win elections.&quot;&Atilde;[#x201a]&quot; Through Sept. 3, the GOP raised $152,746 this year, and has $25,109 left. Two years ago, it raised $128,451 for primaries and spent all but $10,563, its public filings show. Democrats, by contrast, reported raising $844,598 and spent all but $85,243, filings show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee will be chaired byJim Merrill of Manchester, and will include 32 other business and party leaders. Better-known names include Manchester Mayor Frank Guinta, Susan Duprey, Karl Norwood, Doug Scamman, John Lyons, Mike Dennehy, Chuck Morse and Siobhan Tautkus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYC MAYOR RETURNS: Rudy Giuliani is coming back to New Hampshire on Sept. 29 for a fundraiser Executive Councilor Ray Wieczorek is holding. The former New York City mayor is helping the former Manchester mayor raise some serious bucks. Tickets are $100 each for dinner, and $250 each for a special VIP reception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FRANK SPEAKS: Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank will be the featured speaker at the Democratic Party's annual Jefferson Jackson Dinner Oct. 18 in Manchester. Former keynotes have included former Vice President Al Gore, Sen. Jim Webb, Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Evan Bayh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dinner has been a sellout for the last five years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest bucks are being spent on the U.S. Senate race. The National Republican Senate Committee has nearly $2.4 million in spots reserved on WMUR-TV to support Sen. John Sununu, while the national Democratic PAC has spent $2.2 million for ads backing former Gov. Jeanne Shaheen. That amounts to a combined 1,456 slots over the next seven weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen herself has reserved $645,00 worth of air time so far, while Sununu has set aside $156,000. Neither John McCain nor Barack Obama have reserved air time beyond Sept. 22, but that is likely to change.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama asked his supporters Saturday to help with recovery from Hurricane Ike and canceled his plans to crack jokes on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the aftermath of the storm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama didn't put aside his differences with Republican rival John McCain. In an outdoor rally attended by thousands, he discussed the &quot;quiet storms that are taking place throughout America&quot; as people lose their jobs, health care and pensions, and he argued that McCain is out of touch with those struggles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign criticized McCain in a new TV ad that notes the McCain campaign's ties to lobbyists in spite of McCain's pledge to end business as usual with the &quot;special interests.&quot; The ad asks, &quot;If seven of McCain's top advisers are lobbyists, who do you think will run his White House?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee called the ad an example of &quot;cynical hypocrisy and outlandish attacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's campaign is riddled with former lobbyists and his running mate is a longtime fixture of the Washington establishment,&quot; RNC spokesman Alex Conant said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama had been slated to appear in a skit on the NBC comedy show's season premiere, hosted by Olympic champion swimmer Michael Phelps. Campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Obama decided it was no longer appropriate because of the devastation in Texas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and running mate Joe Biden had planned to campaign together at the rally in Manchester's Veteran's Memorial Park. But the campaign decided to scale back the event as the storm battered the Gulf Coast and canceled Biden's appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama asked people to keep the victims in their thoughts and prayers and be ready to help volunteer or donate to relief efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During times of need, we are all in it together, and it doesn't matter if we are Democrats or Republicans, black, white, Hispanic or Asian, we are there for each other in times of need,&quot; he said. &quot;You will help them, I have confidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spoke by telephone Friday with David Paulison, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and Houston Mayor Bill White to get an update on the approaching hurricane. Obama spokeswoman Linda Douglass said the senator told White he would do whatever he can to help, including using his campaign Web site to raise funds for relief efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama planned to return to Chicago after the New Hampshire rally and spend the rest of the weekend at home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DOVER N.H.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belittling John McCain as a relic of the disco age, Democrat Barack Obama pushed his campaign Friday to a new level of counter-punching &quot;on the issues that matter&quot; and directed his running mate to be tougher on their Republican opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes come as national polls find McCain and his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, pulling ahead of Obama and Joe Biden, prompting some jittery Democrats to implore them to fight back harder, and Obama's camp to pledge &quot;speed and ferocity&quot; in that effort. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, I'm not going to be making up lies about John McCain,&quot; Obama told undecided voters in Dover. But he dipped into history, citing the oft-repeated phrase: &quot;If you don't stop lying about me, I'm going to have to start telling the truth about you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's what we're going to do,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dover resident Glenn Grasso asked Obama, &quot;when and how are you going to start fighting back against attack ads and the smear campaigns?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our ads have been pretty tough,&quot; Obama replied. &quot;I'm going to respond with the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has called Palin a &quot;phenomenon&quot; and acknowledged she's given her ticket a boost. But his aides say McCain is vulnerable to new criticisms because he has stretched the truth in recent comments and ads, and because Palin was shaky on foreign policy in an ABC News interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is the first day of the rest of the campaign,&quot; Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said in a statement Friday. &quot;We will respond with speed and ferocity to John McCain's attacks and we will take the fight to him, but we will do it on the big issues that matter to the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plouffe said Biden &quot;will be integral to that effort, both in pushing back on the lies that we'll continue to see from our opponents, and in keeping the debate focused on delivering for everyday Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice presidential candidates often play the role of attacker. But many Democrats feel their party's last two nominees for that job, John Edwards and Joe Lieberman, were too passive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newest Obama TV ad gets personal and makes a none-too-subtle dig at McCain's age. It shows McCain at a hearing in the early 1980s, wearing giant glasses and an out-of-style suit. Other images include a disco ball, clunky phone, outdated computer and Rubik's Cube. &quot;Things have changed in the last 26 years,&quot; the announcer says, &quot;but McCain hasn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He admits he still doesn't know how to use a computer, can't send an e-mail, still doesn't understand the economy, and favors $200 billion in new tax cuts for corporations, but almost nothing for the middle class,&quot; the commercial says. McCain has said he relies on his wife and staff to work the computer for him and that he doesn't use e-mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The non-partisan Tax Policy Center says McCain's proposed corporate tax cuts would total about $231 billion over four years. It says McCain's proposals for individual tax rates &quot;would primarily benefit those with very high incomes.&quot; It says many fewer households &quot;at the bottom of the income distribution would get tax cuts, and those tax cuts would be small as a share of after-tax income.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad closes with a photo of McCain standing with President Bush. &quot;After one president who was out of touch,&quot; the announcer says, &quot;we just can't afford more of the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another new Obama&nbsp;ad repeats criticisms of McCain for having current and former prominent lobbyists on his campaign staff. A third new ad is more positive, highlighting Obama's change message and saying he will provide better health care and tax breaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican National Committee spokesman Alex Conant said Obama is &quot;trying to destroy&quot; McCain and Palin with personal attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, meanwhile, released a new ad saying Obama has been &quot;disrespectful&quot; in his treatment of Palin, who seems to be making inroads among female voters in several states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats said Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who narrowly lost the nomination to Obama, will campaign for him at two stops Sunday in Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Dover on Friday, Obama rebutted McCain's claims that he would raise taxes on working-class families. &quot;I pledge that under my plan, no one making less than $250,000 a year will see any type of tax increase,&quot; he said. &quot;Not income tax, not capital gains taxes, not any kind of tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also criticized McCain for recently saying the economy is making progress under Bush. &quot;We can't afford four more years of what George Bush and John McCain consider progress,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When some in the audience shouted that Republicans have lied about him, Obama said, &quot;Lies, that's the word I was looking for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been hitting back hard, but we're hitting back on the issues that matter to families,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some independent analysts say McCain's flurry of claims and criticisms this week seemed to catch Obama off guard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a University of Pennsylvania authority on political communications, said Obama erred by focusing on one dubious McCain assertion that Obama had indirectly insulted Palin by using a phrase about putting lipstick on a pig while the Republicans hit him with a more damaging claim misrepresenting his position on sex education for kindergartners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When someone says you want to teach kids about sex, you should counterattack immediately, and they didn't,&quot; Jamieson said. &quot;They said they were outraged, but the outrage was lost among the outrage about lipstick. The Obama campaign didn't pivot fast enough when that ad went up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday's message from the Obama camp seemed to be: Don't worry, we're firing on all cylinders from now on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Babington reported from Washington.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1st District, Jeb Bradley and John Stephen have been conducting a pointed air war over their respective records as a former congressman and former state health and human services commissioner. But in August, it was difficult, at best, to generate excitement, and so the usual low turnout is expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary of State Bill Gardner yesterday predicted 80,000 Republicans and 50,000 Democrats will cast ballots. That's a 15 percent turnout, based on the most recent count of 863,542 registered voters in the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theoretically, a low turnout helps Stephen, generally viewed as the more conservative candidate, but Bradley, with four years in office, has built an organization that should at least equal that of his opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of New Hampshire polling director Andrew Smith says Stephen has run a much stronger race than he did when he lost to Bradley in 2002 and this time, &quot;he seems to have the more organized and more focused campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bradley yesterday picked up the endorsements of the four candidates who competed against Stephen and him in the 2002 primary. The most well-known and potentially helpful is fiscally conservative, pro-life Rep. Fran Wendelboe, who heads the grass-roots Reagan Network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six years ago, Stephen lost after concentrating his efforts on Manchester at the expense of other areas of the district. This time, he's gone district-wide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watch for him to spend the final few days of the campaign in the fertile grounds of central Rockingham County, in towns such as Kingston, Epping and Raymond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bradley will campaign in the Manchester area today, New Castle on Friday and at the Belknap County Republican picnic and the Seacoast on Saturday. On Sunday, Bradley will sprint from the North Country to Manchester and the Seacoast again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2nd District, there has been far less television advertising, and the four major candidates have less name recognition than Stephen and Bradley. Tonight's debate (9 p.m. for the 2nd District candidates, immediately after the 8 p.m. 1st District debate) is key, but again, says Smith, &quot;It's all about a ground game, and whatever team has put in place the better organization will probably win. We don't know who that is right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Clegg is probably the slight favorite over Jennifer Horn because of the contacts he has made from his many years in the state House and Senate and a relatively high-profile role for GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee last year. Horn gets a boost with the editorial endorsement of the Union Leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Smith says, &quot;The one who probably gets the most bang for his buck is Grant Bosse, who has so little money but has been running his own political organization effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But anyone who says they know who is going to win either primary is wrong. It's just a roll of the dice,&quot; says Smith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRE-PRIMARY MONEY: In his pre-primary campaign finance reports filed last week, Bosse reported raising $7,253 during the July 1-Aug. 20 reporting period and $41,815 since the beginning of the campaign. He reports having $10,917 on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horn raised $25,207 in contributions between July 1 and Aug. 20, including $10,859 from herself. She also loaned her campaign $135,000 for a total of $175,000 since the campaign began. She reported having $145,521 on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clegg raised $14,056 during the seven-week period, including a $3,000 contribution from himself. He also loaned his campaign an additional $50,000, for a total of $300,000 during the campaign so far. Clegg reported $93,439 on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Steiner raised $9,698 during the July 1-Aug. 20 period and reported $23,560 on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic incumbent Paul Hodes again overshadowed the Republicans, raising $70,099 during the period and reporting $947,497 on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in the 1st District, Bradley raised $76,590 between July 1 and Aug. 20 and reported $360,587 on hand, while Stephen raised $62,405 during the period and has $121,199 on hand. Democratic incumbent Carol Shea-Porter raised $79,723 during the period and reported $675,141 on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE LATEST ADS: Jeanne Shaheen's fourth television ad will be on broadcast and cable television today, and it's sure to cause a stir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continuing the light-hearted (some may say sarcastic) tone of her previous ad depicting John Sununu digging a hole, the new ad musically focuses on Shaheen's strategy of linking Sununu to the unpopular President George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coupled with a rendition of Carole King's &quot;Where You Lead&quot; are scenes of Bush and Sununu walking, talking, standing shoulder-to-shoulder, and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush, from a 2002 reception in Manchester for Sununu, says, &quot;John Sununu was with me from the beginning. There was no question in my mind where he stood.&quot; Graphics say Sununu voted with Bush 90 percent of the time and on some issues, more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad comes as the state Democratic Party announced this week that it intends to focus intently on linking the two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonight, Republican candidate for governor Joe Kenney will be on the air with his first television ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Airing during Republican National Convention coverage on Fox News, the ad features Kenney introducing himself and charging that Gov. John Lynch &quot;is turning our state into Massachusetts because he just can't say 'no' and he's spending us out of homes. It's OK to be liked but really caring about people means saying no to special interests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Kenney speaks, taxes and fees allegedly raised by Lynch scroll across the screen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WITH MITT AND ANDY CARD: Sununu, already flush with cash, will be the guest of honor at a fundraiser hosted by Mitt Romney in Boston on Sept. 22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've learned the host committee includes former Bush White House Chief of Staff Andy Card and former Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci. Former Romney national finance chairman Chris Collins is an event co-chair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOOKING GOOD: Despite the pushing and shoving and grumbling from politicians in large states across the nation, the New Hampshire primary is looking good for being first-in-the-nation again in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Republicans are taking their &quot;medicine&quot; in St. Paul, Minn., this week, seating only 12 official delegates, instead of the full 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no effort to seat the full delegation. Instead, the Republicans went along with the punishment meted out by the Republican National Committee for the state holding its primary earlier than allowed by the former RNC rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain is credited by state Republican chair Fergus Cullen and McCain adviser Steve Duprey, a former state GOP chair, with intervening to win special dispensation for the primary to go ahead of the rest of the pack, along with South Carolina, in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RNC rules committee rejected the full &quot;Ohio plan,&quot; promoted by U.S. Sen. Bob Bennett, which kept the primary first and then set up rotating groups of primaries and caucuses based on state sizes. That meant the key vote at the RNC rules committee last Friday and the full convention on Monday were simply on providing special ahead-of-the-pack places for New Hampshire and South Carolina. The rule addressed only binding primaries that selected delegates and was silent on Iowa and Nevada, whose caucuses do not pick delegates. It leaves Iowa (and presumably Nevada) free to move ahead of New Hampshire, which under the rule can hold its primary no earlier than the third Tuesday in January (Jan. 17, 2012).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duprey tells the Status that McCain personally dispatched him to St. Paul last Thursday night to &quot;make it clear that he wanted specific 'carve-outs' for New Hampshire and South Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator McCain said to me, 'Please go to Minnesota to represent me at the rules committee meeting and make it clear my wish is that New Hampshire and South Carolina are preserved,' &quot; Duprey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the rest of the calendar, the rule sets up a commission to study the primary system and report back to the Republican National Committee in 2010 with recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, as for &quot;taking our medicine&quot; and accepting the RNC punishment in 2008 rather than antagonizing the larger states with a protest, &quot;I felt all along that our strategy was the right one,&quot; Cullen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAWSON'S PENALTY PARTY: South Carolina Republicans were also punished for holding their primary too early this year, but it didn't create the same kind of angst that it did here for a while.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Katon Dawson, the South Carolina GOP chairman, turned the &quot;punishment&quot; into fun, hosting a &quot;penalty party&quot; in St. Paul last Friday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waiters wore football referee &quot;zebra&quot; shirts and occasionally threw penalty flags. Half-drinks and half-crab cakes were served to guests of offending states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That,&quot; said Cullen, &quot;was the right attitude to have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NICE SEATS: By the way, Cullen reports that the cut-in-half New Hampshire delegation has prime seats, at the front of the XCel Center, next to the delegation from McCain's home state of Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Duprey insists that no Granite Stater has wanted for access to the floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Network crowd shots so far this week have occasionally included Granite Staters. So far, we've seen Phyllis Woods, Gordon MacDonald, Jayne Millerick and former Gov. Walter Peterson on television in the attentive audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the prominent Republicans who did not get to the convention was RNC member Nancy Merrill. She said she stayed home for &quot;personal reasons&quot; but says she was, of course, pleased with treatment of the primary in the new party rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NO WORRIES. Democrats claim not to be concerned by the new Democratic Change Commission, Barack Obama's creation to study the primary and caucus system for 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-New Hampshire crusader Debbie Dingell of Michigan hailed the new commission as the beginning of the end of what she considers a rigged system that perennially allows New Hampshire and Iowa to go first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But New Hampshire Democrat chairman Ray Buckley was not concerned. He said he and Lynch have been assured by Obama that if he becomes President, New Hampshire will retain its first-primary status under any new DNC rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BARACK ON THE PHONE: Obama briefly joined 200 New Hampshire campaign volunteers and staff on a one-way conference call yesterday to thank them for their efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporters were allowed to listen in as Obama noted that McCain &quot;has spent a lot of time in New Hampshire,&quot; and said, &quot;New Hampshire could not be a bigger battleground state this time around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that in 2004, Democrat John Kerry won the state by &quot;one point,&quot; while in 2000, Al Gore lost it by the same margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GRADES ON GUNS: The New Hampshire Firearms Coalition has a primary election guide that gives &quot;A&quot; grades to congressional candidates Stephen, Clegg and Bosse, while Bradley and Horn each received a &quot;D.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grading was based on a 20-question survey on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMELLA WITH PALIN: Maria Comella, who handled media for the Bush-Cheney reelection campaign in New Hampshire in 2004 and was Rudy Giuliani's national spokesman during the primary, has been picked by the McCain campaign to handle media for vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MINNEAPOLIS -- Members of the New Hampshire delegation attending the Republican National Convention heard from leading party figures yesterday who thanked them for their longtime support of Sen. John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Hampshire delegation met jointly with members of the South Carolina delegation for breakfast and heard from a host of prominent speakers including Cindy McCain, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close McCain friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are here today because of these two states. John and I are humbled by your support and your belief in the two of us,&quot; Cindy McCain told the delegates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. McCain won both the New Hampshire and the South Carolina primaries, putting him on the path to the GOP nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You never gave up on my husband. I can't thank you enough for that,&quot; Mrs. McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. McCain singled out Peter Spaulding, who served as chairman for the McCain campaign in New Hampshire not only this time but also in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You were always upbeat &acirc;[#x201a]&not;&Acirc;&brvbar; you kept me going,&quot; she said to Spaulding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giuliani, who unsuccessfully sought the GOP presidential nomination, gave the New Hampshire delegates a preview of what he is likely to say tonight as the keynote speaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giuliani said cutting short the first night of the convention in deference to the hurricane was the right thing to do and was an example of McCain's leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John has always demonstrated the ability to put his country ahead of everything else,&quot; Giuliani said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giuliani talked primarily about the war in Iraq and national security issues. Referring to the television ad aired by Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton during the primaries, which featured a ringing telephone in the middle of the night, Guiliani said: &quot;We couldn't have a person better prepared to be on the other end of that phone than John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the two major party tickets &acirc;[#x201a]&not;&quot; McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin vs. Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. Joseph Biden &acirc;[#x201a]&not;&quot; Giuliani said the GOP has their candidate with the most experience at the top of the ticket, unlike the Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have it in the right order,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is going to be able to handle anything that's thrown at him,&quot; Giuliani said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to Palin, Giuliani said, &quot;I believe he made an inspired choice for his running mate &acirc;[#x201a]&not;&Acirc;&brvbar; She's taken on everybody &acirc;[#x201a]&not;&Acirc;&brvbar; She's enormously popular in her state. She has shaken things up in Alaska.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With typical Giuliani humor, he said, &quot;If she wasn't running for vice president, I'd be supporting her for mayor of New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Hampshire delegates also heard from Leon F. &quot;Lee&quot; Ellis, a retired colonel in the U.S. Air Force, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam with McCain. He talked about the torture and months of solitary confinement that McCain was subjected to there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other speakers at the breakfast included: McCain campaign manager Rick Davis; Carlos Gutierrez, secretary of commerce; former Indiana Sen. Dan Coates and former Louisiana governor and member of Congress Charles E. &quot;Buddy&quot; Roemer, a former Democrat who switched to the Republican Party in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Linda Killian is a professor of journalism and the director of Boston University's Washington Center. She is working on a book on the Democratic Party and is currently a public policy scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. She is in St. Paul covering the convention for the New Hampshire Union Leader.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain plans to air television commercials in Minnesota, at least during the Republican National Convention here, establishing a strong presence in a state that has not been a focus of his ad campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new ad, criticizing Democratic nominee Barack Obama as little more than a popular speaker, will begin airing Monday in the state and will also appear on national cable and in New Hampshire and 10 other states where he has maintained an advertising presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ad and the expansion into Minnesota were confirmed by two operatives, one Republican and the other a Democrat, who are familiar with the ad purchase. The commercial is financed by McCain and the Republican National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It features Obama during last month's address before a massive crowd in Berlin. The ad states that without the crowds and without his words, &quot;there's nothing left.&quot; The ad also shows images of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and states: &quot;Ready to tax, ready to spend, not ready to lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Minnesota, the ad is scheduled to air on national cable and in Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, called &quot;Costly Words,&quot; represents a continuing Republican attack against Obama that voters should not be swayed by his soaring rhetoric and the adulation he receives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, neither Obama nor McCain has aired general election ads in Minnesota, though voters here have seen them on national cable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state represents an opportunity for McCain. The party convention is being held here, and its governor, Tim Pawlenty, is a Republican who had been mentioned as a potential running mate for McCain. Of course, McCain did not choose him, selecting instead Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. In the last two presidential elections, Democrats Al Gore and John Kerry won in the state but by less than 4 percentage points.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to John McCain's ads mocking Barack Obama's celebrity status, Obama said, &quot;Their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks and planting doubts about people. We have to make sure that we keep focused on people's day-to-day concerns.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month he said of McCain's campaign, &quot;they want to distract people from talking about the real issues.&quot; At the same campaign stop, he said, &quot;we've got to change how our politics is done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, keep focused on the issues and don't engage in politics as usual. That's the Obama campaign. Except for all those ads and speeches that, well, you know, attack McCain's patriotism and wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Obama produced an ad that attacked McCain for being rich and, with his wife, owning at least seven homes. When he ran for President in 2004, John Kerry and his wife owned at least five homes worth about $30 million. We don't remember the Democrats suggesting that Kerry's economic views were therefore to be discounted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's hypocrisy is so blatant that were he a Republican the Big Media would call him on it daily. But he's a Democrat. Thanks to the media's double standard, Obama's double standards go largely unreported and uncriticized.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HIRING HYERS. Bill Hyers, the young Democratic strategist who was ousted from the Jeanne Shaheen campaign more than a month ago, has landed in a pretty good place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hyers is now the Midwest Regional Director for the Barack Obama campaign, Obama spokesman Sandra Abrevaya confirmed. He is coordinating the campaign in Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska and Kansas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not bad considering that Hyers was moved out of the Shaheen campaign to make way for former Clinton campaign whiz Robbie Mook. One might even argue that for Hyers, being a regional director for a presidential candidate is a step up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official line given for Hyers' departure was &quot;personal reasons,&quot; and yesterday, Shaheen spokesman Kate Bedingfield would not budge from it. She said his departure was unrelated to recent polling showing the Shaheen-John Sununu race was tightening up. Nor did it have anything to do with how much money the campaign has been spending, Bedingfield said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After he left, several reports surfaced that Hyers was replaced because Mook, who had engineered key Clinton victories, including Ohio, became available after Clinton ended her campaign, and Shaheen simply could not pass on such a valuable commodity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bedingfield refused to shed any further light on the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, Hyers, 32, was cited by Campaigns and Elections' Politics magazine last month as one of about two dozen &quot;rising stars&quot; in U.S. politics. Coincidentally, also in that group is former Portsmouth Mayor Steve Marchand, 34.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT IS THE NHAC? Attorney General Kelly Ayotte says her office is reviewing a Democratic complaint that the conservative New Hampshire Advantage Coalition has broken state election law and may have broken federal tax law governing nonprofits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former state Democratic Party Chair Kathy Sullivan charged in a complaint to Ayotte that the NHAC initially filed in November 2006 with the Secretary of State's office as political action committee to engage in political activity, but in March 2007, officially changed its stripes and filed with the IRS as a nonprofit issues advocacy group with the purpose of &quot;preserving the New Hampshire way of life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Sullivan says, even as a nonprofit, NHAC, &quot;continued to engage in partisan political activity.&quot; She notes that its Web site continued to carry material referring to NHAC as a Republican group and continued to make references to its chairman, Mike Biundo, who is a former Republican legislator and current candidate for the House, and its executive director Tammy Simmons, who is also a House candidate. Both hold or have held posts on the Manchester or state Republican committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan also says the NHAC has failed to file a required disclosure report for its political activities prior to its switch to nonprofit status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan says the NHAC, Biuindo and Simmons are violating state election law by &quot;using NHAC as an alter ego for their own political speech and political activities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biundo responded, &quot;NHAC is a duly registered 501 c(4) and is operating as such. It is obvious that Kathy Sullivan on behalf of her tax and spend friends are concerned about NHAC's effort to curb spending and cut taxes. NHAC is a predominately volunteer organization whose sole purpose is to defend the New Hampshire Advantage and protect the New Hampshire taxpayers. We are winning the battle of ideas and that obviously has them concerned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ayotte yesterday wrote Sullivan that she has assigned the complaint to the Elections Unit of her office and, promises, &quot;It will be given appropriate priority given the upcoming state primary and general elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GO FISH. Jeanne Shaheen's campaign and the state Democratic Party have also ramped up their efforts this week to try to show a questionable connection between indicted Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens and John Sununu, who has been a Stevens ally in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sununu camp called the move an effort to distract attention from Shaheen's poor record on taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan this week called on Sununu to give to charity $39,000 in donations he received from Stevens and executives of the VECO oil pipeline company, which is also under federal investigation. Sununu has already given $12,000 to charity --$10,000 from Stevens' Northern Lights PAC and $2,000 from VECO execs who pleaded guilty to bribing public officials last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the state Democratic Party put up a web video alleging &quot;Ted Stevens and his big oil buddies&quot; made &quot;tainted&quot; donations to Sununu, Sullivan questioned Sununu's trip to Alaska in 2004 to attend the Kenai River Classic, a fishing trip/fundraiser for the Kenai River Sportfishing Association, which is hosted annually by Stevens and his friend, association head Bill Penney. Penney testified in June before a grand jury on the Stevens-VECO probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event attracts corporate executives and politicians who mix and mingle and try their hand at fishing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu actually attended the event in 2004 and 2006. VECO chief Bill Allen, whose $1,000 donation to Sununu in 2002 was one of the two he gave to charity, was a guest at the 2004 event along with five other U.S. Senators, several Bush administration officials and a long list of corporate executives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why is Sununu rubbing elbows with these oil company executives and lobbyists in Alaska at the same time he is taking tens of thousands of dollars from an ethically challenged senator who is under indictment for taking bribes?&quot; Sullivan asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu spokesman Julie Teer said Sununu's 2004 trip was funded by a joint fundraising committee comprising Stevens for Senate, Stevens' Northern Lights PAC and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski's campaign committee. She said his 2006 trip was funded by Stevens for Senate and said payment for both trips &quot;fully met Senate rules.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teer said Sununu was among &quot;dozens of senators, Democratic and Republican&quot; who attended the &quot;charity event, helping raise money for river preservation, habitat restoration and scholarships for kids pursuing studies in biology and fish-related sciences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teer added, &quot;With Jeanne Shaheen's record, her support for Barack Obama's plan to raise energy taxes, her attempt to give New Hampshire a sales tax and her failure to solve the education funding crisis, it's no wonder she wants to change the subject.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOEHNER FOR JEB. While the Washington-based National Republican Congressional Committee is staying out of the heated GOP 1st District U.S. House race between Jeb Bradley and John Stephen, the U.S. House Minority Leader is taking sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've learned that Rep. John Boehner of Ohio will travel to New Hampshire next Thursday to host a fundraiser for Bradley at C.R. Sparks in Bedford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning at 8 a.m., Bradley and Stephen will square off in a debate on the &quot;Charlie Sherman Show&quot; on WGIR radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OBAMA'S PARTY. At least two key Granite State Democrats attended Barack Obama's big 47th birthday party in Boston on Monday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Paul Hodes confirmed yesterday he was a guest at the reception, attended by about 800 people. The dinner, a DNC fundraiser that cost up to the maximum allowable contribution of $28,500 per couple, was attended by about 250 of Obama's closest (and we'd guess most wealthy) friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that crowd was Democratic activist/fundraiser and Stonyfield Yogurt CEO Gary Hirshberg, who e-mailed the Status that he was heartened to see about half the crowd at the dinner was former Hillary Clinton supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this is any indication of what is ahead, then any hopes that the McCain folks had that the Dems are going to be divided are probably for naught,&quot; said Hirshberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEANWHILE, ON ELM STREET. Local Democrats opened Obama's state campaign headquarters on Elm Street on Monday night while the big party took place in Boston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign has ramped up to now having more New Hampshire volunteers than any other Democratic presidential nominee, according to Obama spokesman Abrevaya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've also heard that the staff is somewhere around the 40 mark, but the campaign would not confirm the number. The McCain campaign also won't say how many staffers it now employs in the state --for &quot;strategic reasons,&quot; we're told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HODES ON &quot;GOING HOME.&quot; Hodes calls the flap over the House Democrats' move last week to shut down shop and go home for five weeks &quot;a tempest in a teapot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you take a look at the numerous attempts we (House Democrats) made to responsibly meet our energy needs, with drilling, controlling speculation and other proposals we advanced that the Republicans blocked, what they're saying defies logic,&quot; he said. &quot;It's just political gamesmanship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While home, Hodes has been getting around the district quite a bit, but he also has put aside a little time for politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to attending the Obama event, Hodes will host his own fundraiser next Thursday at Alyson's Orchard in Walpole, with suggested donations between $50 and $1,000. Hosts include famed documentary-maker Ken Burns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TO PULL OR NOT TO PULL. Station managers throughout the state aren't saying whether they've pulled the radio ad by the Associated Building Contractors' Free Enterprise Alliance charging Shaheen is anti-drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we reported Saturday, her campaign's attorneys issued letters to 13 station managers demanding the ad be pulled because it contains &quot;false and misleading&quot; information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABC says it received no information from any of the stations that they intended to pull the ads, which are scheduled to air through Saturday. &quot;Had they decided to pull the ad they would have let us know,&quot; said ABC political director Chris Singerling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Shaheen lawyers' letter hinted strongly that failing to remove a false and misleading ad by an issues advocacy group may be grounds for loss of a station's license, but the campaign isn't saying whether it will pursue a complaint to the Federal Communications Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad sparked a fund-raising letter from Judy Reardon of the Shaheen campaign decrying the out-of-state &quot;attack ad&quot; and asking for money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHEA-PORTER, TOO. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter is targeted in a new energy-related radio ad by the nonprofit Freedom's Watch that began airing yesterday and will continue for two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad slaps Shea-Porter for opposing drilling in Alaska and contends she &quot;says 'no' to off-shore oil exploration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad also says Shea-Porter was &quot;the deciding vote&quot; in the 213-212 roll call last week that sent Congress home for five weeks &quot;rather than vote for more domestic oil production.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AND, THE UNION ISSUE. Shaheen was reportedly among five Democratic Senate candidates who attended a reception on Monday hosted by labor leaders on the eve of the AFL-CIO's semi-annual Executive Council meeting in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state GOP criticized Shaheen for &quot;hobnobing with union bosses&quot; after taking $159,000 from &quot;big labor PACs&quot; and announcing her support for the Free Choice Act, which would eliminate private ballot voting for worker decisions on whether to unionize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The self-described &quot;pro-worker&quot; Employee Freedom Action Committee continues its ad campaign targeting Shaheen for backing the Free Choice Act with a new ad television on WMUR and cable networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUICK TAKES:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Long-time McCain sidekick Steve Duprey has been rewarded with an impressive title at the upcoming Republican National Convention: he's one of six convention Deputy Permanent Co-Chairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Republican Doug Kruse's campaign and supporters last night held an official kickoff of his run for the state Senate District 18 seat against Democratic incumbent Betsi DeVries at the Belmont Hall restaurant in Manchester.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We thought it was still summer, but the liberal national media are here to set us straight. It is, they announced last week, the start of &quot;mud-slinging&quot; season. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is because John McCain's campaign has &quot;already&quot; begun &quot;negative attacks&quot; on Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Already&quot; means, of course, that this was bound to happen. Listen to the liberal media and you are led to believe that conservatives always &quot;go negative&quot; at some point and &quot;negative&quot; is bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's funny how comparing one candidate's position to another's can be characterized as &quot;negative&quot; and how that translates into &quot;mud-slinging.&quot; Whether it is a Republican or Democrat, we think stacking up a candidate's record, statements, position papers, or lack of experience etc., is factual and useful. Jeanne Shaheen's Senate campaign has so far consisted almost entirely of attacking Sen. John Sununu on his record. We think that is just fine. But notice that no one is accusing her of &quot;mud-slinging?&quot; She is a Democrat, after all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, the liberal media are not going to let facts get in the way of their passion for their man Obama. Any criticism of Obama will be, by their definition, either mud-slinging or racist or, at the least, the always reliable &quot;negative attack ad.&quot; Of that, we are positive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican National Chairman Mike Duncan arrives in New Hampshire tomorrow as state GOP officials and the McCain campaign are in heavy negotiations with the Republican National Committee over the status of the state's delegation to the national convention in Minneapolis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line: It appears that all 24 New Hampshire delegates will be seated on the convention floor, but it also appears that only 12 of the 24 delegates will be officially allowed by the RNC to vote for Sen. John McCain as the nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That compromise doesn't sit well with delegation Chairman Peter Spaulding, who promises to announce &quot;24 votes for John McCain&quot; when the Big Nominating Vote comes and cast 24 New Hampshire votes on any other issue that may come up, regardless of what the RNC thinks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A refresher: The RNC earlier this year stripped the state GOP of half its 24 delegates to the convention for breaking the national party rule forbidding any delegate selection event (meaning presidential primary) to be held prior to the first Tuesday in February. New Hampshire, of course, held its primary on Jan. 8. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain promised that the state's full delegation will be seated, despite the RNC rule. He never actually addressed &quot;voting,&quot; but wouldn't one logically think that if a delegate is seated, that delegate would be allowed to vote?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guess not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the calendar has crept closer to the first-week-of-September convention and an RNC deadline of this Saturday for submission of delegate lists for certification, there was some confusion over who gets seated and who doesn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An e-mail exchange obtained by the Granite Status shows that state chair Fergus Cullen was reluctant to submit the names of all 24 delegates to the RNC for certification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spaulding had e-mailed Cullen on Tuesday, &quot;It is my understanding that all 24 delegates and alternates will be submitted to the RNC and we will deal with any that are not certified at the convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cullen responds to Spaulding, copying other several other Republicans, &quot;We are NOT able to submit a full slate of 24 delegates and 21 alternates. We can submit 12 and 12.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cullen continues, &quot;All the early states (four others were punished by the RNC for going early) are being handled this way. However, we do continue to hear, informally and formally, through multiple channels, that the rest will be accommodated in a way that should satisfy us (floor access, etc.) -- but there are no guarantees at this time. I think most of our delegation understands this and is OK with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spaulding responds that he thinks all 24 names should be submitted for certification, writing, &quot;What are we contesting if we don't submit all 24 and have them cut us by 50 percent?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point, McCain sidekick Steve Duprey, steps in, announcing in an e-mail yesterday:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Folks, This now taken care of.&quot; He says he has spoken with top McCain advisers Charlie Black and Rick Davis, who, Duprey says, spoke with Duncan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of the delegates (including the early ones) will be on the floor, and NH will be in the front of the hall,&quot; Duprey writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tells Cullen to &quot;call the person doing the registration. If they don't know of this yet, advise them that we were informed from me through Black and Davis of this decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, Duprey handled the seating situation, but what about voting? Will half the delegates be powerless? Who will get to vote and who won't? What's the pecking order? Does any of it matter?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duprey told us, &quot;My understanding is the plan as I hear it is to have them on the floor and they'd be able to be on the floor and not be voting.&quot; He said there would be an &quot;asterisk on credentials&quot; of those who can't vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duprey said this also applied to the other &quot;punished&quot; states _ South Carolina, Michigan, Florida and Wyoming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another McCain source says all the work has been centered on seating and not on voting because voting is just a formality at this point and the compromise is viewed as a way to &quot;make everyone happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Spaulding isn't satisfied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My position is that New Hampshire is entitled to all its votes,&quot; he said. &quot;That's been our contention and it's my understanding that it's always been John McCain's contention. I will announce that New Hampshire is casting all 24 votes for John McCain, and if they want to shut off my microphone, so be it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Cullen, while some wish he'd be a little less compliant with the RNC, others realize that as a party person he's got to walk a fine line and play ball with the national types.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said yesterday only that the issue &quot;is moving toward a resolution,&quot; and, &quot;I'm not worried about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But will he submit 24 delegates for certification, or just 12?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't have to file until Saturday,&quot; he said, &quot;and we're still working on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OFFICIALLY SPEAKING. By the way, Duncan's early morning private (no media) meeting tomorrow will include a small group of top campaign and party officials. It will be followed by a broader &quot;Grassroots Leadership Social and Meeting,&quot; according to the invitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accompanying Duncan on the visit will be McCain campaign national political director Mike DuHaime, RNC National Political Director Rich Beeson, McCain Regional Campaign Manager Jim Barnett and RNC Regional Political Director Randy Bumps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MAVERICK&quot; GREGG. He's not running for reelection this year, but is he campaigning?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever Sen. Judd Gregg is doing, he's doing it his way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gregg supporters of course deny that the senator is looking ahead to 2010, but it's become increasingly noticeable lately that he's been raising his profile with a barrage of news releases, especially on the energy and low-income home heating issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One long-time Capitol Hill observer tells us that Senate Republicans, facing the prospect of having the Democrats increase their majority this November, are &quot;dispirited,&quot; but Gregg &quot;is one of the few guys who keeps picking up the flag and running up the hill.&quot; The &quot;flag&quot; is staunch low-tax, low-spending core fiscal principles that seemed to get lost when the GOP was in the majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gregg has recently taken a political risk in the name of fiscal sanity by blocking a bipartisan, $8 billion bill to bail out the federal highway trust fund with money from the federal treasury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Hampshire has a $52 million stake in the bill and Democratic leaders, along with Republican state Sen. Bob Letourneau, have demanded Gregg release the &quot;hold&quot; he has placed on the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But interestingly, even as a career politician and a Washington pro, Gregg continues to play well at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lost in the maze of numbers in last week's UNH polling was the fact that even in a tough atmosphere for Republicans, Gregg remains the most popular member of the state's congressional delegation. He received favorable reactions from 53 percent of those polled and unfavorable reactions from 23 percent, as compared to a 52/27 favorable/unfavorable rating in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gregg hasn't been fund-raising yet. His campaign committee reported raising only $9,300 in the second quarter of this year and only $293,000 since his reelection in 2004. But he has more than $900,000 on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MORE ON STEVENS. Beyond the contributions to Sen. John Sununu's campaign given by indicted Sen. Ted Stevens' Northern Lights campaign that Sununu will be giving to charity, it turns out that Sununu's and Gregg's leadership PACs contributed to Stevens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Sununu's Daniel Webster PAC gave the Stevens for Senate Committee $2,500 last November. Curiously, that was after Sununu had given to charity $2,000 in contributions from executives of a firm at the center of the Stevens probe who had pleaded guilty to bribing public officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gregg's White Mountain PAC gave $2,500 to Stevens for Senate last Halloween -- Oct. 31, 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Jeanne Shaheen's campaign yesterday called on Sununu to return or give to charity an additional $35,000 he received from Stevens PACs in the 2002 cycle, noting that the probe included material dating back to 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu's campaign declined to comment, but supporters noted that the $35,000 was money received and spent in the previous election cycle six years ago and that one of the Sununu PACs that received $25,000 -- the Sununu Victory Committee -- has not been in existence since late 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOST IN THE SHUFFLE. Following the well-publicized UNH polls last week on the Shaheen-Sununu race and the Obama-McCain race in New Hampshire, there were several more polls of interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UNH poll of the &quot;race&quot; for governor had John Lynch leading Joe Kenney, 67 to 16 percent and Lynch with an approval rating of 72 percent, including 63 percent of the self-described Republicans polled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Rasmussen Reports polls issued on consecutive days had Obama leading McCain in the Granite State, 47 to 41 percent, and Shaheen leading Sununu, 50 to 45 percent. Rasmussen had McCain with 63 percent favorability and Obama, 57 percent favorability, in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another UNH poll this week reported that consumer confidence in the state is way down. Only 13 percent of those polled believe the U.S. will have good economic times in the next 12 months, 74 percent expect bad times, and 13 percent think things will be mixed. The percentage that believe the U.S. will experience bad economic times is at its highest since UNH began measuring consumer confidence and has stayed above 70 percent since February 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESSURING CAROL. The Sierra Club is making its presence known in the 2008 campaign in New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week, as oil companies reported their most recent profits, the group launched a radio ad in the 1st Congressional District urging Rep. Carol Shea-Porter to &quot;end the billions in government giveaways to big oil, to crack down on the price gouging that's keeping gas prices so high and to invest in renewable energy and give consumers more, cleaner energy choices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the state Sierra Club chapter and Granite State Progress will conduct a &quot;street action&quot; in downtown Manchester to criticize the profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, the national Sierra Club will launch a television ad today in New Hampshire, Ohio, Colorado and Washington, D.C. critical of McCain and praising Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUICK TAKES:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? The political place to be last night was the Athens Restaurant in Manchester for state Sen. Lou D'Allesandro's 70th birthday party. A big bipartisan turnout was expected and a letter from Obama was to be read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? D'Allesandro had invited Hillary Clinton. She couldn't make it but called him personally this week to wish him well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) is targeting Sununu and six other elections nationwide &quot;to elect a health care majority in Congress.&quot; The union promises an &quot;aggressive voter contact plan, including mail, phone calls and earned and paid media.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Democrats say all 20 coordinated campaign offices are up and operational in the state and local Democratic committees have separately funded offices in Claremont and Exeter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? State Democrats will have staff and volunteers going door to door statewide this weekend for their ticket, all the way down to state House races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Not to be outdone, the McCain forces will have a statewide &quot;Super Saturday&quot; this weekend with phone banks and door-to-door activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? State Senate Republican Leader Ted Gatsas, facing a rematch with Democrat Bob Backus, has set up a pretty sharp Web site, put together by the local Wedu firm. Ted also has huge (4-foot by 8-foot) signs throughout his district already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? 2nd District GOP House candidate Bob Clegg has picked up the endorsements of activists Tony and Betty Maiola of Newport, Grafton County Sheriff Doug Dutile and Coos County Commissioner Burnham &quot;Bing&quot; Judd of Pittsburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? 1st District GOP House candidate Jeb Bradley has been endorsed by the New Hampshire Fire Chiefs Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Obama has rented the Elm Street, Manchester, building next to the one housing the Lynch, Carol Shea-Porter and Shaheen campaigns and several other Democratic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Manchester City Democrats are organizing a fundraiser/watch party of Obama's convention acceptance speech on Aug. 28.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three months before Election Day, John McCain's stepped up aggression begs the question: Will voters vote for the scold?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new ad launched Wednesday suggests Democratic rival Barack Obama is nothing more than a lightweight celebrity akin to a Britney Spears or a Paris Hilton. A previous ad took issue with Obama's canceled visit to injured troops. McCain has suggested Obama would rather lose a war than an election and ridicules him for the &quot;audacity of hopelessness&quot; in his Iraq policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's the biggest celebrity in the world,&quot; his latest ad asks. &quot;But, is he ready to lead?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Republicans welcomed McCain's confrontational strategy. New Hampshire GOP Chairman Fergus Cullen said Republicans in his state &quot;like to see the McCain campaign on offense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in striking an aggressive pose, McCain is in danger of letting the caricature of an angry, petulant candidate take seed not so much because he is one, but because it stands in stark contrast to Obama's carefully cultivated, well, celebrity, and McCain's own promises to run a respectful campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The campaign is making him seem angrier than he is and therefore it's a disservice to him,&quot; said John Weaver, McCain's former senior strategist, who left the campaign in a shake-up last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angry candidates don't win elections. Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton won by running as sunny optimists one promised John Winthrop's &quot;shining city upon a hill&quot; and the other was the &quot;man from Hope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain wants the presidential campaign to be about Barack Obama that's why he talks about him so much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To that end, McCain is helping frame a not-so-flattering portrait of Obama for voters. His ads have become increasingly tough; a third of his commercials portray Obama negatively, a new study concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show that the race remains tight nationally and in key battlegrounds. New state polls by Quinnipiac University show Obama leading McCain in Pennsylvania, and McCain and Obama tied in Ohio and Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No doubt Obama has fame. He fills political venues with people. He breaks fundraising records with a massive donor base. He does not have a name recognition problem. But Obama himself concedes that his challenge is getting voters to see him as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a leap, electing a 46-year-old black guy named Barack Obama,&quot; he said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said McCain and his Republican allies will try to scare them by saying Obama, who is black, &quot;doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign manager Rick Davis on Thursday said Obama, with that comment, had &quot;played the race card.&quot; He said the remark was &quot;divisive, negative, shameful and wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In working to sow doubts about Obama, McCain and his campaign have worked on a specific story line that the Democrat is not tested, not ready to lead and too out of touch with the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of last week, more than 90 percent of the ads aired by Obama did not mention McCain, whereas one-third of McCain's ads referred to Obama negatively, according to a study of political commercials by the Advertising Project at the University of Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Obama has managed to keep his hands cleaner on negative ads, though he has counter-punched. Instead, outside groups that support him have run commercials against McCain. On Thursday, a coalition including MoveOn.org and the Sierra Club was launching ads critical of McCain's stance on energy and gasoline prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the campaign's talk of Obama's celebrity, McCain is popular in his own right. He ran for president in 2000 and has built his image as a maverick, challenging President Bush and fellow Republicans on some high-profile legislation. Some Republicans worry that a negative campaign will undermine his appeal, particularly with independent voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others maintain that as long as Obama is the candidate who needs to prove himself, voters will pay little attention to McCain angry or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain is simply not a relevant variable in this election,&quot; said Ken Goldstein, a University of Wisconsin political scientist and director of the advertising project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In building their case against Obama, the McCain campaign has employed several lines of attack. It's heaviest ad placements have focused on energy, blaming Obama for high gas prices and depicting him as a tax raiser who opposes expanded oil exploration. But it also has launched ads criticizing Obama's stand on the Iraq war and his decision not to visit wounded soldiers in Germany. Obama said he did not want the visit to be seen as political.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Iraq ads have received widespread media attention, although they appeared only a handful of times in a few markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This careening from message to message makes them look like they don't have one specific thing they want to say about this guy and that there is no centralized theme, there is no centralized message,&quot; Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio said. &quot;And that is most concerning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is projecting confidence, but he is not ready to ignore McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In back-to-back days, he has retaliated with ads attacking McCain. In both, he accuses McCain of engaging in &quot;old politics&quot; a loaded phrase given that McCain turns 72 in late August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also offered a personal rejoinder Wednesday. &quot;He doesn't seem to have anything positive to say about me, does he?&quot; he said, campaigning in Missouri. &quot;You need to ask John McCain what he's for, not just what he's against.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's too early to say with certainty, but political analysts are seeing signs that the &quot;Bush effect&quot; may be fading, and Republican candidates -- particularly John Sununu -- might be shedding the albatross of the unpopular President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago, Democrats swept to victory in New Hampshire and much of the nation by exploiting voter frustration with President George W. Bush. With the war in Iraq going poorly, Granite State voters, in a historic election, ousted two incumbent U.S. House members, replaced them with Democrats, and awarded Democrats with control of the state House and Senate, as well as the Executive Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Democrats are banking on a replay. And in the one of the most-watched races in the country, they hope to keep the anti-Bush momentum going strong to replace Republican Sen. John Sununu with former Gov. Jeanne Shaheen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This election,&quot; said state Democratic Party senior adviser Kathy Sullivan, &quot;is a referendum on the eight years of George Bush and the failures of his administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course I see (the tie between Bush and Sununu) as an issue. John Sununu has been a big part of the problem. He has demanded no accountability whatsoever from this administration,&quot; Sullivan said, citing as examples the war in Iraq, no-bid contracts for private work in Iraq and the justice department's firings of nine U.S. attorneys last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen and the state and national Democratic parties have relentlessly tied Sununu and other vulnerable senators across the country to Bush, whose New Hampshire approval rating was at 28 percent in a University of New Hampshire poll in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Web site's home page depicts Sununu and Bush standing shoulder to shoulder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen recently called Sununu &quot;complicit&quot; with Bush in failing to provide funding for studies of new embryonic stem cells. She criticized him for backing Bush's veto of a big Medicare funding bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was quoted as saying that Sununu, by voting with Bush in nine out of every 10 votes, &quot;got us to where we are today: with $9 trillion in debt, a war in Iraq with no end, a housing crisis, gas prices that are the highest in history, and no energy plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Narrowing the gap</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps as a result of that line of attack, Sununu trailed badly in early UNH polling -- by 16 percentage points last fall, by 17 percentage points in February and by 12 percentage points in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, unexpectedly, a new UNH poll last week showed Sununu had nearly erased the deficit and was trailing Shaheen 46 to 42 percent, within the 4 percent margin of error, for a statistical dead heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington-based Rasmussen Reports on Friday released a poll showing Shaheen leading Sununu, 45 to 40 percent. Last month, the same pollster showed Shaheen leading 53 to 39 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why the closure?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu has long tried to distance himself from Bush on certain issues in the Senate, with little success. His political answer to the Democrats is that he has voted with New Hampshire &quot;100 percent of the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the 2008 presidential election has taken over the national political spotlight. National news reports are consumed by Barack Obama and John McCain. Bush, a lame duck with five months left in his tenure, has been relegated to a less conspicuous place on the national political scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Escaping Bush's shadow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are Sununu and the Republicans beginning to emerge from Bush's shadow?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan says no, that Bush will continue to be a key issue in this election -- for both Sununu and McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican strategist David Carney says yes, that tying Sununu to Bush is &quot;trying to beat the same dead horse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Objective analysts see evidence that voters may be moving beyond Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a very good question,&quot; said veteran state political analyst Dean Spiliotes, former research director for the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do think that at some level, given the shape that Bush is in as a lame-duck President and the intense focus on the (Obama-McCain) election, there is a tendency for the incumbent to get pushed to the side. Bush still has low approval, but it may be that the visceral reaction that voters had to him in 2006 has been somewhat muted by their pre-occupation with McCain and Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Bush close to the end of his term and the presidential race front and center, Republican voters are reawakening, said UNH poll director Andrew Smith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 2006 and 2007, the political dynamics were centered on Bush, and Republicans were in a blue funk,&quot; Smith said. &quot;They were not happy with Bush, and they did not get behind him in the 2006 election. They stayed home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that two years ago, Democrats composed a higher percentage of those who participated in his surveys than they did in his poll last week. That's because in 2006, he said, many Republicans did not consider themselves likely voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now, as we move toward the general election, Republicans are seeing McCain moving himself into having a chance, so they are getting behind him,&quot; Smith said. &quot;And as they get behind him, support for other Republican candidates is going up. They are saying again that they are going to vote, and so they are showing up in polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith said, &quot;Democrats are still doing their best to tie all Republican candidates to Bush, but for those independent voters, Bush is gone. So I think that tying candidates to Bush is going to be a less successful tactic this year than it was in 2006.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drawing distinctions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spiliotes, who now operates his own political blog, NHPoliticalCapital.com, said Sununu himself deserves some credit for &quot;doing a good job in the last few months of being clear on how he differs from Bush, in the two energy bills he voted against, on the Patriot Act and on calling for (former Attorney General) Alberto Gonzales to be fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 2006, Iraq was first on people's minds,&quot; said Spiliotes. &quot;Now, it's second or third. Sununu was getting pummeled on Iraq, and to the extent that it is less of a concern, that helps him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spiliotes said Sununu and the Republicans also &quot;have an opportunity&quot; on the energy issue, particularly on expanded drilling for domestic oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The voters are so frustrated that they want to at least contemplate the idea of drilling somewhere,&quot; which Republicans from McCain on down are advocating, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the economy, Spiliotes said, voters tend to be equally frustrated with Republicans and Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu has also distanced himself from Bush on some civil liberties issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claire Ebel, executive director of the New Hampshire Civil Liberties Union, said that Sununu was &quot;one of the leaders&quot; in efforts to limit the reach of the Patriot Act and in the fight against approving Real ID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that Sununu is among the top three Republican senators on the ACLU's congressional scorecard, trailing Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, both of Maine, and tied with Arlen Specter, of Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All those things have combined to help Sununu pick it up a little bit,&quot; Spiliotes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">External factors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside groups on both sides are also beginning to get heavily involved in the race, raising negative information about both candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans United for Change, a union-funded issues advocacy group, earlier this year aired a radio ad saying that Sununu and Bush are &quot;two peas in a pod&quot; for supporting the Iraq war and &quot;tax giveaways for the wealthy and big oil companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans for Job Security, a business-funded conservative &quot;issues group,&quot; sent two anti-Shaheen mailings to 50,000 homes in late June and early July. One mailing depicts her with a growing, Pinocchio-like nose, and both mailings ask, &quot;Where does Jeanne Shaheen really stand on taxes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Carney acknowledged that Bush hurt Republicans in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now,&quot; he said, &quot;the Bush card is not as effective this time as it was last time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carney, who said he is working with Americans for Job Security, said, &quot;McCain is now the guy, and New Hampshire likes McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever damage Bush has done to Sununu has now been factored in&quot; in voters' minds, Carney added, saying that the tactic of the two clearly isn't working like it used to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is still too early to tell where the Shaheen-Sununu race is going, Smith and Spiliotes said. They said the &quot;underlying demographics&quot; of the state -- its virtual three-way split among Democratic, Republican and independent votes -- remains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathy Sullivan said she &quot;always expected it to be a close race with such close registration numbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was not surprised by the new UNH poll, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the race plays out, the nation -- not just the state -- will be watching.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator's low-key arrival in Manchester stood in stark contrast to his Democratic rival's ongoing visit to the Middle East. Sen. Barack Obama, of Illinois, was swarmed by media as he arrived in Baghdad yesterday for a meeting with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and other Iraqi leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the second leg of Obama's excursion, following a visit to Afghanistan over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spent most of the day in Maine, where he joined former President George H.W. Bush in Kennebunkport and later campaigned in Portland with the state's two Republican senators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Manchester last night, there was just one reporter and one photographer waiting for McCain as his plane -- a white, blue and gold Boeing 737-400 emblazoned with his campaign slogan, &quot;Reform, Prosperity, Peace&quot; -- touched down on the Wiggins Airways tarmac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Vietnam War veteran limped as he made his way down the metal stairway, a leather briefcase in one hand and a cell phone in the other, and walked straight into an awaiting Chevy Suburban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, the McCain campaign announced it was releasing a new ad in New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, entitled &quot;Pump,&quot; says voters can &quot;thank&quot; Obama for rising gas prices at the pump and says McCain &quot;knows we must now drill more in America and rescue our family budgets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's appearance in Rochester today marks his third campaign stop in New Hampshire since he clinched the Republican Presidential nomination in March. The candidate's last visit to New Hampshire was on June 12, when he spoke at Daniel Webster College in Nashua.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grappone said the campaign was prepared for an &quot;overflow&quot; crowd at the Rochester Opera House at 31 Wakefield St. Doors open at 10:30 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rochester Opera House hosted several presidential campaign stops in the lead-up to this year's New Hampshire Primary. Obama spoke there on the night of Jan. 7, hours before the polls opened.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LENGTH: 30 seconds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AIRING: National cable and Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCRIPT: VOICEOVER: &quot;Barack Obama never held a single Senate hearing on Afghanistan. He hasn't been to Iraq in years. He voted against funding our troops. Positions that helped him win his nomination. Now Obama is changing to help himself become president. John McCain has always supported our troops and the surge that's working. McCain. Country first.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHN MCCAIN: &quot;I'm John McCain and I approve this message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KEY IMAGES: Still photos of Obama set against maps of Afghanistan and Iraq and newspaper and journal excerpts supporting what is said in the voiceover. Still photographs of McCain with American flags behind him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANALYSIS: The McCain campaign released this tough new ad in 11 battleground states to coincide with Obama's high-profile trip to Iraq and Afghanistan. It reinforces arguments that McCain and his surrogates have made repeatedly about the Illinois senator: that he is a newcomer to foreign affairs who has pandered to the left wing of his party but done little to educate himself about the complicated military situation in the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without saying so directly, the ad suggests Obama's visit to the region is a political stunt even though McCain has said he supports Obama's decision to make the trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FACT CHECK: The ad's most inflammatory charge that Obama voted against troop funding in Iraq and Afghanistan is misleading. The Illinois senator consistently voted to fund the troops once elected to the Senate, a point Democratic rival Hillary Rodham Clinton made during the primaries when questioning whether his anti-war rhetoric was reflected in his actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under pressure from anti-war activists, Obama did vote 'no' on a major troop funding bill in May 2007, after he became a presidential candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's subcommittee on European affairs, which has jurisdiction over NATO. Since NATO maintains troops in Afghanistan, Obama did have jurisdiction to call a hearing on the situation there if he chose to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until this week's Middle East trip, Obama had been to Iraq only once, in January 2006 and had never visited Afghanistan. McCain has been to Iraq eight times, Afghanistan four times.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEHIND THE NUMBERS. Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter is the political story of the week with her huge second quarter fund-raising numbers. She's an example of what the incumbency can do for someone who was a political unknown two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2006, Shea-Porter was barely scraping together enough money to operate her skin and bones campaign and was the underdog in a primary race against former New Hampshire House Democratic Leader Jim Craig, who had the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, she has $750,000 in her campaign bank after raising $260,275 in the second quarter and $921,736 in the election cycle thus far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About one-third of her total &quot;take&quot; - $91,000 - came from political committees, mostly from labor union PACs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the quarter, she received $2,500 from the AFL-CIO, $3,000 from the United Auto Workers, $5,000 from the NEA, $5,000 from the American Federation of Teachers, and $5,000 from the Service Employees International Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large portion of her contributions from individuals are channeled through well-known liberal conduits, such as ActBlue, Council for a Livable World and MoveOn.org. She also received thousands from fellow Democratic congressional campaign committees and leadership PACs, including $5,000 from California Rep. Henry Waxman's LA PAC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, $74,856 of her $168,939 in total contributions from individuals were unitemized contributions of less than $250.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRADLEY SELF-INVESTING. Republican Jeb Bradley dipped into his own wallet and reserves to pay his campaign bills in the past three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He loaned his campaign another $50,000, bringing the total in loans from himself to $200,000 since 2004. Bradley still spent more than he raised in the quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His loan aside, Bradley raised $63,368 from individuals and $35,150 from PACS, for a total of $98,518. Add the loan and &quot;other receipts&quot; and his total receipts are $148,526 - still about $40,000 less than he spent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luckily for Jeb, he had plenty of money in the bank entering the quarter, and ended the quarter with $475,348 on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of Jeb's $189,283 in quarterly expenditures, $74,040 went to media guru Pat Griffin's Merrimack &amp; Potomac Group, while $42,300 went to Primary Communications, a consulting firm headed by his former congressional chief of staff, Deb Vander Beek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the November 2006 election, Bradley's campaign has somehow spent $533,312.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shea-Porter has spent $283,5639 and Bradley's main primary rival, John Stephen, has spent $218,448 including $139,205 in the quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen also spent more than he raised, but only by $1,000. His received $136,905 from individuals, $1,311 in &quot;other receipts&quot; and $1,000 from one PAC, the Washington-based Arab American Leadership Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign's total receipts for the quarter were $138,216. It spent $139,205.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen's biggest expenditures were $46,700 to Maryland-based MH Media LLC and $20,700 in consulting fees for Riverbank Communications. He also paid McLaughlin and Associates of New York $5,250 for polls in late June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HODES' BIG MONEY. We reported last week on the nuts and bolts of Rep. Paul Hodes' second quarter filing but we can now provide some detail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of Hodes $254,905 in total receipts, $139,190 came from individual contributions and $112,750 came from PACs, including those representing the insurance, banking, investment, utility and architectural industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also received thousands from labor PACS and fellow House Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His individual donors included a large percentage from out-of-state, including New York friend, former Gov. Mario Cuomo, who gave $500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hodes spent $114,167 in the quarter and $710,760 so far in the election cycle. He paid Anzalone Liszt Research, Inc. of Alabama $18,500 in May for polling and Renee Schaeffer of Washington $7,500 for &quot;financial consulting services.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four major 2nd District Republicans candidates combined raised a total of $130,000 in the quarter, loans from the candidates to their campaigns aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant Bosse says he's not worried about having only $12,850 on hand because his is a shoe leather operation, going door to door. And in his latest effort to show he's the only true conservative in the race, Bosse, beginning Monday, will outline 50 cuts to federal spending in the remaining 50 days of the primary campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jennifer Horn's camp reports &quot;strong&quot; fund-raising numbers for the quarter, but much of it comes from her own pocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horn raised $60,605, but $25,000 comes from a loan she made to her campaign. She received $33,824 from individuals and no PAC money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far in the campaign, Horn has total receipts of $131,723, with $40,000 of it - or 30 percent - in personal loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She spent $70,236 in the quarter and $110,978 so far in the campaign and reported having $20,745 on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the quarter, she paid Riverbank Communications $6,300 for political consulting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horn ended the quarter with only $1,867 more on hand than candidate Jim Steiner of Concord, who raised $9,876 and spent $1,578 in the quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With $156,556, Bob Clegg has far more money on hand than his GOP competitors. His campaign is mostly self-financed - $250,000 of his $334,526 in total receipts so far in the campaign, or three-quarters of it, has come from loans from himself. He has also made contributions totaling $7,500, leaving $64,610 from individuals and $12,400 from PACs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second quarter, he received $47,760 from individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clegg spent $143,650 in the quarter and $177,969 in the campaign so far. In the quarter, he paid Griffin's Merrimack &amp; Potomac Group $45,500 for media consulting and $42,280 to Primary Communications for political consulting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE SUNUNU MONEY. The Status first reported a week ago that Sen. John Sununu's quarterly fund-raising of $1.1 million and his $5.1 million cash on hand were records for his campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, we can tell you that in the quarter, Sununu raised $761,605 from individuals, $317,480 from PACs and $17,500 from political party committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign spent $337,757 in the second three months of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also reported last week that Jeanne Shaheen raised $1.8 million and would report $1.9 million on hand. No details of her report are yet public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHONE-JAM TALKS. Earlier this month we reported that a U.S. House subcommittee had subpoenaed the federal Justice Department for information &quot;relating to the approval, scope and timing&quot; of a federal probe of the GOP's 2002 phone-jam operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was on a list of 21 items related to six investigations being undertaken by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law. The most prominent probe is the Valerie Plame leak investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding phone-jamming, committee aides have told the Status that while the documents have not yet been produced, negotiations are under way between committee and department staffs, and there have been &quot;renewed efforts&quot; by the Justice Department to locate documents on the phone jamming case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Committee aides also say President George W. Bush's assertion of executive privilege yesterday covers only certain material in the Plame case and not the entire subpoena. That means the phone-jamming case is still alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE OBAMA PRESS TEAM. We first reported late last week on UnionLeader.com that Barack Obama's presidential media team for New Hampshire is in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandra Abrevaya is the new state communications director, coming to the campaign from Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin's Capitol Hill office. She is a former communications director for Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, and previously worked for the political communications firm, Strategy Group, based in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign will work a new voter contact organization funded by the Democratic National Committee, called the New Hampshire Campaign for Change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its press secretary is Larkin Barker, former spokesman for Rhode Island Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts and for Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse's 2006 campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVAN SIGNS ON. Gov. John Lynch continued building his reelection staff by hiring Evan Carlson of Bedford as campaign press secretary. He is the former press secretary for Sen. Joe Biden's presidential campaign. Following the primary, he consulted for New Hampshire Voices for Health and the Young Democrats of New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously, he was press secretary for the New Hampshire Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carlson said Lynch's campaign now has 10 full-time staffers. It formally opened its campaign office 379 Elm St., Manchester, on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNDER ONE ROOF. The former Chris Dodd for President office space at 379 Elm St., Manchester, has become a Democratic enclave. Officially opening on Monday, it will house Shea-Porter's campaign, the Senate Democratic Caucus campaign operation, the Committee to Elect House Democrats, the Manchester City Democratic Committee, the party's coordinated campaign field office as well as the Lynch office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various big name Democrats will attend a grand opening on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BIG DONORS. While relatively unknown in political circles, members of the Ayasli family of Nashua have quietly been huge donors to candidates on both sides of the political aisle for several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to BusinessWeek.com, Yalcin Ayasli founded the Hittite Microwave Corp. of Chelmsford, Mass., in 1985 and was its chairman until 2005. A native of Turkey, Ayasli has also contributed to the Turkish Coalition USA PAC, which advances Turkish causes on Capitol Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OpenSecrets.org lists political contributions of $91,250 from Ayasli during the current two-year election cycle, fairly evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. When other family members are included, the Ayaslis donations total more than $314,000 in 2007 and 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to OpenSecrets, the only local politician to received Ayasli donations in the past two years was Democratic former U.S. Senate candidate Katrina Swett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, family members made almost equal contributions to the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUICK TAKES:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Shaheen's campaign announced late last week it has a new campaign manager. Robby Mook, who worked on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in Nevada, Ohio and Indiana, replaced Bill Hyers, who left for &quot;personal reasons,&quot; according to the campaign. Mook was New Hampshire deputy field director for Howard Dean's 2004 presidential run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? District 18 GOP state Senate challenger Doug Kruse will roll out a finance committee tomorrow comprising prominent Manchester Republicans Ben Gamache, Cliff Hurst, Ovide Lamontagne, Gordon MacDonald, Jim Merrill, Ray Pinard, Siobhan Tautkus and Jerry Thibodeau. Former Mitt Romney campaign staffer Kristy Roney, viewed as a &quot;rising star,&quot; is his campaign manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Horn this week picked up the endorsement of Rep. Jane Johnson, R-Swanzey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Before coming to New Hampshire on Tuesday, John McCain will be hosted by former President George H.W. Bush at Walker's Point in Kennebunkport, according to campaign adviser Steve Duprey.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BIG MONEY. Preliminary second-quarter numbers from the John Sununu and Jeanne Shaheen campaigns are in, and both campaigns in the nation's highest-profile U.S. Senate contest are claiming record-setting fundraising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our preliminary counts show Gov. Shaheen raised more than $1.6 million this quarter - the most ever raised by a candidate for federal office from New Hampshire,&quot; said Shaheen spokesman Caitlin Legacki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu campaign manager Paul Collins reports &quot;another million dollar-plus quarter&quot; from April 1 through June 30 and says Sununu will report more than $5 million on hand next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen's camp did not release her &quot;on hand&quot; figure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins says Sununu's supporters &quot;have never been more energized and enthusiastic, resulting in a record setting fundraising quarter. Both the amount raised in a single quarter and the amount on hand is record-setting for Team Sununu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legacki said Shaheen's numbers &quot;reflect the tremendous support we've seen on a daily basis for Gov. Shaheen's campaign&quot; to &quot;put New Hampshire families, not the special interests, first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first quarter of 2008, Sununu reported raising $1.01 million and having $4.3 million on hand, while Shaheen raised $1.9 million and reported $1.8 million on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT'S ONLY JULY, but the special interest groups on both sides of the Shaheen-Sununu Senate battle continue to ramp up their purchases of time on the airwaves and space in newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groups on each side this week are focusing on workers' issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TARGETING SHAHEEN. As Shaheen picked up the endorsement of the state firefighters union - the Professional Fire Fighters of New Hampshire - yesterday, a nationwide &quot;pro-worker&quot; group formed earlier this year targeted her for &quot;issues&quot; advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beginning with a full-page ad in the New Hampshire Union Leader two days ago, the Employee Freedom Action Committee, a non-profit 501(c)(4), plans a full throttle effort to paint her as &quot;anti-worker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group insists it's not anti-union, but its prime focus is defeat of the Employee Free Choice Act, which would eliminate private ballot voting for worker decisions on whether to unionize. Shaheen backs the legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group has a local chapter, Granite Staters for Employee Freedom, headed by Matt Murphy of Hampstead and a steering committee that includes activists Brinck Slattery of Manchester, Dennis Acton of Fremont, Joe Korowski of Atkinson, John Lombombard of Enfield and Kevin Attar of Hampstead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its New Hampshire Web site contends she is doing the &quot;labor union bosses' dirty work&quot; while Sununu &quot;has consistently opposed efforts to strip workers of their fundamental right to a private ballot vote on the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Group spokesman Tim Miller says it plans to spend enough money in New Hampshire to be a player in the race, while focusing on worker issues. It's hired Meridian Communication to &quot;work with them to put together a committee of local folks interested in the issue,&quot; says Meridian co-founder Mike Biundo. &quot;The main goal is an education process focused on asking the candidates where they stand on the issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miller, who predictably would not name any of its donors, said the group &quot;was created to draw attention to the card check issue and hold the union bosses and their friends in Congress accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The card check legislation would take away workers' right to vote in private on whether they want to be unionized,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not anti-union,&quot; Miller said. &quot;If a group of employees wants to vote their conscience in private and start a union, that's fine and that's up to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miller said the group is now active in five states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In New Hampshire, we expect to do both television and radio and more print advertising highlighting Shaheen and Sununu's positions on these issues,&quot; Miller said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TARGETING SUNUNU. While interest groups come and go, People for the American Way survives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more than 25-year-old liberal non-profit is placing radio ads to air next week focusing on Sununu's support for Justice Samuel Alito and &quot;the anti-worker ruling&quot; in the case of Ledbetter v. Goodyear last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court ruled, 5-4, that Lily Ledbetter's equal pay suit against her employer was not valid because the statute of limitations had expired. Alito wrote the majority opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad says that &quot;a new justice nominated by George W. Bush and supported by New Hampshire Sen. John Sununu wrote the opinion that denied her equal pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tell John Sununu we need judges who will protect workers - not take away our rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It directs listeners to the group's SaveTheCourt.org web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PFAW president Kathryn Kolbert will be in the state tomorrow doing interviews leading up to the ad campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEAM SHAHEEN. Shaheen is trying to broaden her grassroots organization through the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu's campaign committee has long been called &quot;Team Sununu,&quot; but he didn't have the &quot;Team&quot; phrase patented, so bring on Team Shaheen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate challenger issued an e-mail request this week for supporters to join up through her Web site and build a grassroots organization by creating their own Team Shaheen pages. They receive &quot;downloadable campaign materials&quot; and special event information and can &quot;track your progress in finding new Team Shaheen members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOT A PRETTY SITE. Forgive the pun, but citydems.com is not a pretty site - or sight - for Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someone - the Dems (and we) are not sure who - recently secured the former domain name of the Manchester City Democratic Committee and set up a site called &quot;the Real Manchester City Democrats -- More Taxes. Bigger, More Intrusive Government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It shows video of Gov. John Lynch refusing to comment on the conservative New Hampshire Advantage Coalition's campaign to put spending cap initiatives on local ballots and contains other unflattering material about Democratic officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's clearly meant to be confused with the Manchester Democrats' real site, www.citydems.org. When one &quot;Googles&quot; &quot;Manchester Democrats,&quot; the imposter site comes up, not the real one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party spokesman Alexis Chininis said the sad part is that &quot;it's a replica of our old Web site.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the party tried to re-register the domain a few months ago, it found that it had been taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Democratic Chair Chris Pappas said, &quot;These kinds of dirty tricks and attacks on Gov. Lynch and our Democratic legislators are both outlandish and unscrupulous, and are not welcome in Manchester.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WORKING HARD. Joe Kenney may not be the perfect candidate, but he is the GOP nominee for governor. So maybe the party should treat him with a little R-E-S-P-E-C-T.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign manager Rep. Casey Crane today will announce the hiring of a field director -- 48-year-old Bob Dinsmore of Merrimack, a retired business development director for a Massachusetts firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father ran against Ted Kennedy for the U.S. Senate in 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Dinsmore in charge of setting up a field operation, Casey will focus on press releases and media, which will finally allow Kenney to get some much-needed attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While getting little or no help from the state party, Kenney's campaign has a small but enthusiastic following, evidenced by a good showing at the Amherst Fourth of July parade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOWARD RETURNS. Democratic National Chairman Howard Dean will attend a house party hosted by New Hampshire Speaker of the House Terie Norelli in Portsmouth tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norelli said the two have been friends since she backed his Presidential candidacy in 2004. She said the event is an effort to build grassroots support and excitement for the Democratic ticket and not a fundraiser, although donations won't be turned away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dean will be in Maine today and early tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RIDGE ROLLS IN. The GOP's coordinated campaign Victory Committee will hold its first fundraiser on July 17 at the home of Dan and Joy Monfried in Bedford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Featured guest will be Tom Ridge, the former Pennsylvania governor and former Secretary of Homeland Security, who is now a John McCain surrogate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ridge may make other stops in the state in conjunction with the $100-a-person ($1,000 per host) event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the hosts is one Joel Maiola, former Judd Gregg chief of staff, (remember him?), who has set up his own consulting firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STAYING PUT. Mike Dennehy says he was &quot;flattered&quot; by the rumors that he might return to his former post as McCain's national political director under the new national campaign regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he's staying where he is -- in Concord with a continued senior advisory role in the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just give them advice when I'm called upon, and when I see things going wrong, I tell them,&quot; he says. &quot;And when I see things going right, I tell them. But other than that, I'm staying intimately involved with New Hampshire and a couple of other battleground states,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The post went to Mike DuHaime, Rudy Giuliani's former campaign manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still no word on specifics of McCain's July 22 visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHY NOT TRY? Pollster and political analyst Andy Smith of the University of New Hampshire says he doesn't blame McCain supporters for trying to goad Barack Obama in to a series of town hall-style meetings in New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a good strategy for him,&quot; Smith tells the Status. &quot;This is an important state that he can't afford to lose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIGNING UP. The New Hampshire Advantage Coalition says more than 100 candidates and elected officials have signed its pledge not to vote for or support &quot;any budget that raises government spending more than the rate of inflation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not bad for about six weeks of work, says Biundo, the group's chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list includes Kenney, Executive Council candidate Steve Stepanek and mayors Frank Guinta of Manchester and Ken Merrifield of Franklin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group also reports that its spending cap proposal has been approved to appear on Rochester's ballot in November. About 75 percent of the total signatures needed to secure ballot places for referenda in the other target communities, except Portsmouth, have been received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUICK TAKES:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Long time Sununu family friend Judy Galluzzo of Salem endorsed 2nd District GOP House candidate Jennifer Horn this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? The state chapter of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation will hold the first of six &quot;taxpayer training schools&quot; in Manchester on July 19 at the Center of New Hampshire Radisson Hotel. The group will teach attendees how to write letters to the editor, how to &quot;effectively contact elected officials&quot; and how to &quot;organize neighbors, communities and like-minded citizens.&quot; Featured speaker will be Glen Caroline, executive director of the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Former top state Democratic Party staffer Russell Verney is now Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr's campaign manager. Verney in the 1990s managed Ross Perot's campaigns for President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? AARP and DividedWeFail.org are organizing debates for Shaheen and Sununu and the candidates in each U.S. House race for late September, with focus on health care and the economy. Former Portsmouth Mayor Steve Marchand is helping to organize the events in his role as an AARP consultant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Republican 1st District U.S. House candidate John Stephen yesterday was endorsed by the National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Coalition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHN DiSTASO</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS; Pg. A2</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1893 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHY NEW HAMPSHIRE? The Granite State isn't the only state with a town called Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We found perhaps an even more appropriately named town, Pleasant Unity, in the large swing state of Pennsylvania. That state also has a town called Unity House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a Unity in Illinois, Barack Obama's home state and the state in which Hillary Clinton grew up. There are also Unitys in Maine, Oregon and Wisconsin. And there's a Unity in Ohio, which is one of the most important battleground states of all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, why New Hampshire? Because we're apparently special. With apologies to the state's detractors, we do have the most energized electorate in the country, thanks to the first-in-the-nation primary and the already geared-up general election battles. There's also the little coincidence that Obama and Clinton received an identical number of votes (107 each) in our Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As much as the well-oiled machine that is the New Hampshire Democratic Party will deny it, the Obama-Clinton primary race left scars, and on one level, this is an attempt to soothe them and push for a win in a tough state in which John McCain is as well known, if not more well known, than any local politician. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign believes &quot;they can win in New Hampshire and that if they pay attention to it now, they don't have to have as concentrated an effort down the road,&quot; says Manchester pollster Dick Bennett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Sullivan County, with the blue-collar population centers of Claremont and Newport, may be viewed as &quot;Clinton territory,&quot; in fact, Obama won the county in the primary, 3,823 to 3,512, although Clinton won Claremont, 1,114 to 898, and Newport, 470 to 422.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bennett noted that his statewide poll last week had Obama leading McCain, 51 to 39 percent in New Hampshire, &quot;and this appearance helps solidify the lead. Anything Hillary can do is a plus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be interesting to see what women at the event will say,&quot; Bennett said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign told us in an e-mail this week, &quot;New Hampshire is obviously going to be a critical state in the general election, and New Hampshire voters are incredibly energized and take great pride in helping to select our next President, as they have done for so many years. Senator Clinton and Senator Obama are looking forward to returning to a place where they competed vigorously ... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO WILL BE ON STAGE? Since the Democrats have no meaningful state primaries for major offices, you can expect the entire top of the ticket on stage with Obama and Clinton, or nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeanne Shaheen, Carol Shea-Porter, Paul Hodes, executive councilors and perhaps the entire state Senate lineup are expected to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And super-delegate Gov. John Lynch will finally make it official tomorrow that he supports Obama, despite his recent friendly phone chat with McCain. First lady Dr. Susan Lynch, a top Clinton supporter, is also expected to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT ABOUT BILLY? Snarky question? Maybe, but: How far away will Bill Shaheen be from the Radisson Hotel Center of New Hampshire today when Michelle Obama and Jeane Shaheen campaign together? And will he be anywhere near Unity tomorrow?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former state &quot;First Hunk,&quot; you may remember, resigned last December as a Clinton campaign national and state co-chair after invoking Obama's past admitted use of illegal drugs into the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Clinton-Obama race reached the boiling point about three weeks before the primary, Bill told The Washington Post that if Obama became the nominee, the Republicans would &quot;jump on his drug use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It'll be, 'When was the last time? Did you ever give drugs to anyone? Did you sell them to anyone?' There are so many openings for Republican dirty tricks. It's hard to overcome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Shaheen apologized profusely before resigning and hasn't been heard from in public since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FREEDOM OR DUMMER? State GOP Chairman Fergus Cullen suggested, as McCain has, that Obama participate in joint town hall meetings with the Republican candidate, rather than holding rallies and giving speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cullen told Politico.com this week that &quot;there is another small town in New Hampshire -- one called Freedom -- that I suppose the Obama campaign ruled out as a possible venue for Friday's event. That is because in an Obama presidency, we'd have less of it: less freedom to decide how to spend our money because more of it would be taken by the government in higher taxes; less freedom from foreign sources of energy because Obama opposes expanding domestic energy production; less freedom to make health care choices because Obama prefers big government health care to approaches that utilize the power of the free market to expand health care access and lower costs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Democratic Chairman Raymond Buckley commented, &quot;Perhaps Fergus should move his office to the town of Dummer. His increasingly hysterical press releases just get dumber and dumber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STAFFING UP. The McCain campaign is lying low during these days leading up to the big Democratic event tomorrow, but it has quietly rounded out the staff of its campaign and of the NH Victory 2008 coordinated campaign organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to already-announced New England campaign manager Jim Barnett, state director Ashley Maagero and regional communications director Jeff Grappone, the recently-hired staffers, are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Alden Guptill, deputy New England campaign manager, is former executive director and political director of the Vermont Republican Party and field coordinator for Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas' 2004 campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Aaron Goulette, New England &quot;E-Campaign&quot; director, is former New Hampshire 72-hour get-out-the-vote director for the Republican National Committee and coalitions/operations director for McCain's New Hampshire Primary campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Rob Heuchling, New England regional coalitions director, is a former McCain volunteer in New Hampshire and Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Matt Flanders, New England Regional special projects director, is the former McCain field coordinator for Sullivan, Grafton and Coos counties during the primary campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Amber Hillman, New England regional director of scheduling and surrogate operations, is a former finance volunteer for McCain's campaign in Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Mark Lenzi will be the NH Victory 2008 communications director assisting director Brandon Vidrine, who's name was first reported here last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NUMBER GAME. In the money election, the numbers continue to pile up in favor of the Democrats in New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monthly reports filed last Friday with the Federal Election Commission show that the state Democratic Party collected $208,000 in May, compared to $13,000 for the state GOP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state Democrats spent $135,199 in May and entered June with $165,412 on hand. The Republicans spent $14,898 in May and began this month with $104,055 on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats continue to get a huge cash infusion from Washington for Shaheen's U.S. Senate race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party received $151,760 in May alone from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, bringing the DSCC total for the election cycle to $353,973. Total contributions from individuals in May were $31,199 for the Democrats and $10,000 for the Republicans. The GOP received $5,000 in May from the Republican National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CIGARETTES AND NUKES. State political action committee reports filed in Concord last week show the very flush Senate Democratic Caucus PAC had a few interesting donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the same report that disclosed party chairman Buckley received $147,000 in consulting fees for the PAC since March 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to more than 10 pages of individual donors, the report also listed tens of thousands of dollars from lobbyists, PACs and some businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were two noticeably uncharacteristic donors -- $1,000 from tobacco giant Philip Morris and two $500 contributions from Baltimore-based Constellation Energy Group, which calls itself &quot;one of the nation's premier nuclear power plant owners and operators,&quot; with five operational nuclear units at three plants and two more units in the proposal stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buckley said such money &quot;does not influence the votes of Senate Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among individual contributions, the largest, $10,000, came from multi-millionaire Lynn Forester de Rothschild, a top Clinton supporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate Republicans also received PAC and corporate donations, including $5,000 from Hampton-based Waste Management and $3,000 from Amoskeag Beverages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IMPRESSIVE TOTALS. June 18 was the deadline for filing of political action committee reports, but not candidate campaign committees, so money totals for relatively few candidates were in. But among the state Senate candidates, the Democrats filed more reports than the Republicans and had generally impressive numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among incumbents, Lou D'Allesandro (of course) led the way with $185,744 on hand, while Jacalyn Cilley reported $17,925, Martha Fuller Clark reported $39,173, Betsi DeVries, $28,054; Harold Janeway, $26,815: Sylvia Larsen, $30,794; Maggie Hassan, $58,886; Kathy Sgambati, $48,114 and Deborah Reynolds, $31,353.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other Democratic candidates, District 16 challenger Bob Backus has $27,157 on hand, while candidates for open seats Peggy Gilmour has $11,270; Matthew Houde, $14,830; Amanda Merrill, $15,483 and Jay Phinizy, $1,665.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only GOP Senate candidate numbers available were $8,168 in incumbent Mike Downing's account, and District 10 challenger former Sen. Tom Eaton, with $48,946 on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican District 5 Executive Council candidate Steve Stepanek reported $8,460 on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOVE-ON MOVES IN. MoveOn.org is going local.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manchester members plan a get-together tonight in the city to form a new local MoveOn Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Between now and November, this council will join with others around the country to hold house parties and rallies, reach out to undecided voters and get our message into the media,&quot; according to an e-mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great way to meet other local progressives -- and we'll make sure it's fun and effective.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLEGG GOES DRUDGING. Atop the Drudge Report yesterday was a not-so-flattering photo of musician/Congressman Paul Hodes getting down, as it were, on an electric guitar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Money for Nothing?&quot; is written on the photo. &quot;End the Hodes-Pelosi spending spree by clicking here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A click sent you to Republican 2nd District U.S. House candidate Bob Clegg's Web site and a lengthy &quot;questionnaire&quot; critical of the many taxpayer-funded &quot;franked&quot; mailings sent out by Hodes since he has been in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One question is, &quot;Paul Hodes says that people find it 'refreshing' to hear from their member of Congress through these mailers. Do you find it refreshing or an abuse of taxpayer dollars?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clegg campaign purchased the regional Web ad and says it will appear for at least a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Hodes' office, they didn't find the photo very funny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It just shows the tone that we can expect from Mr. Clegg,&quot; said Hodes congressional spokesman Mark Bergman. He said Hodes has worked to keep spending in check by keeping George Bush accountable for money spent in Iraq and supporting an end to no-bid contracts while backing a moratorium on earmarks and a 50 percent reduction in legislative appropriations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He opposed taxpayer subsidies for big oil companies, Wall Street hedge fund managers and opposed handouts to Silicon Valley venture capital firms that want to take over small businesses in New Hampshire,&quot; Bergman said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following its disgusting &quot;General Betray us&quot; ad from last year, the leftist group has a new one depicting a mother and a newborn. The mother says: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hi, John McCain. This is Alex. And he's my first. So far his talents include trying any new food and chasing after our dog. That, and making my heart pound every time I look at him. And so, John McCain, when you say you would stay in Iraq for 100 years, were you counting on Alex? Because if you were, you can't have him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So our volunteer service members are just pawns stolen from their parents by the government? Does Sen. Barack Obama, on whose behalf this ad was made, agree with this insulting portrayal?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moveon.org might find this hard to believe, but America's military men and women are adults who choose to defend the country. They are neither children, nor victims. Depicting them as such is despicable. But that is what we've come to expect from this anti-military outfit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT'S ABOUT TAXES. What drove Kathryn Forry, 67, a retired school teacher and education program coordinator from Jaffrey, to run for governor in a primary against ultra-popular two-term incumbent John Lynch?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview this week, Forry, a soft-spoken Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for the state House four years ago, did not specifically advocate an income tax, but said, &quot;We need a New Hampshire governor who will give leadership to the Legislature as our state chooses to reform the many unfair ways we tax ourselves in New Hampshire. We need to reduce the unjust property tax on our homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forry, who said that 60 percent of her property taxes go to education, said New Hampshire needs &quot;to establish a fair source of state revenue to reduce or replace some of the other unfair taxes we have. We need a governor who is willing and able to lead on this issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forry said that through the business profits tax, the business enterprise tax, the interest and dividends tax and the property tax, &quot;We have state income taxes that are paid only by some New Hampshire residents.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Lynch for two terms &quot;has had a chance for leadership to address school funding, which has been festering since 1997, and he just hasn't done it. Others should now have a chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forry said that while she likes Lynch, &quot;he's not doing the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She and her husband have resided in New Hampshire for 40 years. Now retired, she was most recently the Title I director for the ConVal and Jaffrey-Rindge school districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just want them to stop the charade and talk about fair and just taxes for all of New Hampshire,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her approach? &quot;I don't have a lot of money, but I'll be out there campaigning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CALM DOWN. Here we go again, &quot;sowing division among New Hampshire Democrats,&quot; as alleged on the Blue Hampshire Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our innocent, unassuming, straightforward report in this column last Sunday that Democrat Lynch telephoned Republican Sen. John McCain on June 11 to welcome him to the state caused a ruckus on the progressive Web log.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's Lynch doing calling a Republican? How dare he call McCain? Whose side is he on, anyway?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, for the record, Lynch spokesman Colin Manning said Democrat Lynch will support Democrat Barack Obama with his super-delegate vote at the Denver convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator Obama is the nominee and the governor is obviously going to support the nominee on the ticket. Of course he's going to support him for President,&quot; Manning said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, by the way, we understand the McCain campaign received several calls from conservatives already wary of McCain's credentials complaining about McCain being so nice to Lynch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can't we all just get along?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A LOUISIANA IMPORT. The state and national Republican parties have tapped Brandon P. Vidrine to be executive director of their coordinated &quot;Victory&quot; campaign in the Granite State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vidrine has been the political director of Louisiana U.S. Senate candidate John Neeley Kennedy's campaign since December. He has worked on other Louisiana elections and for the GOP in Arkansas. He was a member of the Bush-Cheney inaugural committee in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Hampshire was a critical state in determining the outcome of the Republican primary, and this November, it will undoubtedly play a key role in the presidential election,&quot; Vidrine emailed us. &quot;The Republican Party will continue to make New Hampshire a priority because, contrary to the beliefs of Barack Obama, voters in the Granite State are looking for policies that encourage lower taxes, strong national defense and small government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCAIN'S NEW AD. New Hampshire is among 11 battleground states targeted for McCain's second television ad of the general election campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new 30-second ad, which began airing on WMUR and cable networks on Tuesday, attempts to separate McCain from President George W. Bush on the global warming issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With rapid-fire visuals of the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, a voiceover says, &quot;John McCain stood up to the President and sounded the alarm on global warming -- five years ago. Today, he has a realistic plan that will curb greenhouse gas emissions, a plan that will help grow our economy and protect our environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad is also airing in Nevada, Colorado, Missouri, New Mexico, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad debuted on the day McCain delivered a speech on energy policy in Houston. The campaign called the speech the first in a series of discussions over the next two weeks on energy security. He is expected to roll out a comprehensive plan to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New Hampshire last week, McCain called for a diversified approach, including nuclear power. He has also called for an end to the federal moratorium on offshore oil and gas drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUSH AND SUNUNU. The Democrats are highlighting reports that Bush last night headlined a Washington fund-raiser for the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President's Dinner event was expected to rake in $12 million for the Senate committee and $7 million for its House committee counterpart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee called Sen. John Sununu a Bush &quot;rubber stamp&quot; and said they would &quot;once again join hands&quot; to raise money. Democratic challenger Jeanne Shaheen's campaign noted that Sununu told Foster's Daily Democrat last week that he does not expect to be campaigning with Bush in New Hampshire, &quot;given his popularity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, he'll raise money with Bush in Washington, but won't campaign with him in New Hampshire?&quot; asked Shaheen spokesman Kate Bedingfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sununu spokesman Julie Teer said Sununu would attend the event &quot;as he and his colleagues traditionally have in recent years.&quot; She said Sununu has voted with New Hampshire &quot;100 percent of the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JEANNE AND &quot;HOLLYWOOD.&quot; Politico.com reports that Shaheen is among a half-dozen Democratic Senate candidates who have &quot;signed agreements&quot; to receive at least $100,000 from a new political action committee comprising &quot;Los Angeles' top liberal female activists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, not yet fully organized, calls itself Voices for a Senate Majority, according to Politico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen is also raising money with Michigan Sen. Carl Levin, the nation's top critic of the state's first-in-the-nation primary, and the DSCC in a joint PAC called Democratic Senate 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A NEW RADIO AD. The Republican-leaning Americans for Job Security on Tuesday night launched a new radio ad in New Hampshire criticizing Shaheen's record on taxes when she was governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It cites her support for a statewide property tax, sales tax, capital gains tax and her opposition to a repeal of the so-called death tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman said the &quot;statewide saturation buy&quot; will continue for &quot;the next several weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE THING TO DO. It has apparently become the popular thing for Republican congressional candidates to do -- get their pictures taken with Democrats. This column last Sunday was accompanied by a photo of Clegg and Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee with a Democratic &quot;tracker&quot; who showed up at a Clegg-Huckabee event. Not to be outdone, the Jennifer Horn campaign this week sent us this photo of Horn with Paul Hodes congressional staffer Lucas Watson (left) and campaign manager David Kieve, who were at the Barley House in Concord having a drink as the Horn campaign was having a fund-raiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just because we disagree doesn't mean we have to be disagreeable,&quot; said Hodes spokesman Mark Bergman. Horn spokesman Zack Condry said their appearance, and that of a video camera-carrying &quot;tracker,&quot; shows that &quot;Paul Hodes thinks that Jennifer Horn is the candidate to beat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN &quot;RGA&quot; PROBLEM? The non-profit conservative group Freedom Watch yesterday launched &quot;robo&quot; calls in New Hampshire critical of Democratic U.S. Reps. Paul Hodes and Carol Shea-Porter for opposing additional domestic oil drilling as gasoline prices top $4 a gallon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hodes and Shea-Porter are among more than three dozen members of Congress targeted by the calls, said group spokesman Tim Pearson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pearson called New Hampshire &quot;a place where the environment is ripe to influence the issues debate, so we will do what we can to talk about the issues we care about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is a potential problem. Pearson said Freedom Watch has not registered as a political action committee in the state. That may put it in the same category as the Republican Governors Association, which earlier this year launched a &quot;poll&quot; with questions critical of Lynch. It registered only after it was issued a cease-and-desist order by the Attorney General's Office, which found that registration was required by law because the RGA was trying to &quot;influence the votes of one or more voters&quot; in the upcoming elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN THE 1ST CD. Republicans John Stephen and Jeb Bradley have secured influential endorsements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bradley today will be backed, as he was in 2006, by the 275-member New Hampshire Troopers Association, which represents the non-commissioned members of the State Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Association president Lou Copponi says it was an &quot;easy pick&quot; because Bradley &quot;has always shown he cares for and supports the men and women of the State Police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen has been seen on the Seacoast often lately, last week opening a campaign office in North Hampton. At a gathering at Widow Fletcher's Tavern in Hampton, Stephen was endorsed by former state Sen. Bob Preston of Hampton. The former Senate Democratic leader and gubernatorial candidate said he switched his registration to independent to vote for Stephen in the September primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FACING OFF. The first Republican 2nd District congressional debate will be next Wednesday at the Keene Public Library at 7 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sponsor is the Cheshire County GOP. Debate chairman Chandler &quot;Chip&quot; Fairbanks says Grant Bosse, Bob Clegg, Jennifer Horn and Jim Steiner have accepted, and that he had not received a reply from Alfred L'Eplattenier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questioners will be county committee members Ann Cartwright of Alstead, Robert Kasper of Walpole and Edwin &quot;Smokey&quot; Smith of Hinsdale, with Cheshire County Attorney Peter Heed as moderator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN INTERESTING CAST. State Rep. Fran Wendelboe, R-New Hampton, said last Friday's fundraising dinner for the conservative Reagan Network, which she chairs, was a &quot;smashing success&quot; with about 150 attendees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event, held at the Center of New Hampshire Radisson Hotel, featured former Navy secretary and Ambassador J. William Middendorf, who served in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan administrations and was a key player in Barry Goldwater's campaign in the early 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those who attended was former state Democratic chair George Bruno. In his role as managing director of USA Group International, which provides international consulting and communications services to individuals, governments, foreign embassies and private business, Bruno accompanied Doug Henderson, a member of the British House of Commons. With them was retired Maj. Gen. Craig Whelden, who is now a member of the staff of the Army's Office of Installation Management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wendelboe said the event raised enough money &quot;to keep us for the rest of the year&quot; and that additional fundraising will be directed to candidate campaigns through the network's PAC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wendelboe, former House Speaker Donna Sytek and Edda Cantor of Leadership New Hampshire are at Saint Anselm College this week as faculty in residence for a course on women in politics hosted by the New Hampshire Institute of Politics and the Center for Women in Politics at Rutgers University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of the NHIOP, Dale Kuehne has been named interim executive director, succeeding Paul Manuel, who become chief operating officer for the Center for Global Engagement in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kuehne is currently a special assistant for government relations at St. Anselm and is a founding director of the institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John DiStaso is senior political reporter of the New Hampshire Union Leader.</SPAN></P>
