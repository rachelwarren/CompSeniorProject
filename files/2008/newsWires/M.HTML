</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the glass aquariums at Tropical World Pets, the radio stops playing music and breaks into ads. Political ads. Attack ads. Ads with scary music. Ads approved by John McCain. Ads approved by Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Duerfahrd, manager of the store in south St. Louis County, has had enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The amount of money they spend on commercials,&quot; Duerfahrd, 29, says with a slight shake of his head. &quot;I'm ready for it to be over. It goes on too long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign - finally, at long last - ends today. And now the election. A historic one, no matter the result. Sens. McCain and Obama have stated and restated their cases. Spent millions. Aired ads. Held debates. Printed signs. Opened offices. Recruited volunteers. Their push for the presidency has been going on so intently, so passionately, so inanely at times and for so very, very long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By now, some people are exhausted by the political chatter. Some people, keyed into their candidate, are being killed by the drawn-out suspense. Others have been eating it up. But even those political junkies must wonder what they will do without a campaign to devour. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The down-and-dirty, exhaustive nature of political campaigns can cloud the importance of what will be determined at the ballot box. Either McCain or Obama will be elected the 44th U.S. president. Either way, a history of firsts will be made. The first black president. Or the first woman vice president. The challenges ahead are immense - at the least, two wars and an economy on the brink of melting down. National polls indicate Obama leads, but McCain's campaign says it is poised for a shocking upset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duerfahrd wants to move on. His girlfriend is into politics. She is hooked on the political TV shows. She supports McCain. So does him mom. But Duerfahrd is that rarest of species, the one that gives pollsters nightmares: He is undecided. Still.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pet store sits in a strip mall on Watson Road called General Grant Center. A picture of Ulysses S. Grant - 18th president, Republican - graces a mall sign. A large statue showcases not Grant, but father and son farmers in straw hats waving at traffic, advertisements for the Sappington Farmers' Market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three doors down from the fish and reptile store, campaign fatigue has set in for Ren Binder, owner of Renditions Salon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I look forward to getting the voting over and getting normal programming back on the box,&quot; says Binder, 45.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Binder is ready to pick a winner. &quot;I'm waiting for an ending,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Missouri, particularly, presidential campaigns can seem to drag on because the state always appears in play. It is a bellwether, picking the winning candidate in every election since 1900 (except in 1956). On the electoral map, Missouri is neither clearly blue nor red. And so the ads and visits get only more intense as Election Day nears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But soon the campaign offices will wrap up and break down. Disappear. The McCain headquarters in Maryland Heights, located in a complex near the golden windows of West Port Plaza, will shutter. Perhaps it will revert back to its former use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It used to be a print shop,&quot; says a McCain volunteer. &quot;That's the rumor, anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama field office in Des Peres - one of 10 in St. Louis County and St. Louis - sits for now in an office next to a Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore, which itself is closing. With the campaign over, workers at the hair salon next door look forward to easier parking in their shared, cramped lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawns once again will become refuges of &quot;For Sale&quot; signs. Signs for &quot;Change&quot; and &quot;Hope&quot; and &quot;Country First&quot; will be taken down, stashed in the garage or sent to the trash. In a few months, it be hard to remember whether the neighbors surprised you by being for McCain or Obama. Which one was it, now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cars and trucks will return to being apolitical vehicles - except in the extreme, whether it is a Hummer or a Prius - just as soon as people get around to scraping off that Obama or McCain sticker. (Winning has something to do with it. Those pro-Bush &quot;W&quot; stickers from 2004 seemed to stick around for a while.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don Ford, 62, of Eureka, has his work cut out. On the back of his Oldsmobile Cutlass rests a blue Obama sticker and a sticker reading &quot;To Continue the Pain / Vote McCain.&quot; His back window holds signs, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, he had stopped with his wife, Bette, at a Lowe's in Fenton to pick up a last-minute item. He will be too busy today: He's a poll worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford, a retiree from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, watches the political lineup on MSNBC at night. The car radio is tuned to NPR - that way he skips the political ads. He drove to Columbia, Mo., to hear Obama give a stump speech. He saw Joe Biden when the vice presidential candidate stopped in Arnold. He and his wife tried to get in to see Bill Clinton when the former president visited Kirkwood. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing in the box store's parking lot, Ford says he is ready for the campaign to end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wished it would've ended weeks ago,&quot; he says, back when Obama's lead in the polls was even greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Ford, the end of the campaign means finding out what lies ahead, admitting his work is done, seeing which way the election will break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll either have a bad case of depression or euphoria,&quot; Ford says. &quot;I guess it's time to find out.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ELECTION DAY 2008 POLLS ARE OPEN FROM 6 A.M. TO 7 P.M.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONG LINES o If you have to wait a long time to vote, predictions of a modern turnout record likely will hold true. And if there are gigantic voting problems in key states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida, go to bed. This could take awhile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOOSIER CANDIDATE o If McCain loses &quot;red state&quot; Indiana, look for a final electoral map with a whole lot of blue. Polls close at 5 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VIRGINIA o If East Coast returns show Obama winning where no Democrat has won since LBJ, he can measure the drapes. Polls close at 6 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HISPANICS o If exit polls have McCain getting a third of Latino votes in places like New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada, he's in the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MISSOURI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUTHWEST MISSOURI o If turnout is lower than that in urban areas, McCain is in trouble. If McCain's winning margin there is over 150,000 votes, he's in the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. LOUIS AND KANSAS CITY o Obama needs at least 70 percent turnout in Missouri's big cities. His edge needs to be at least 150,000 votes there, to counter McCain's outstate support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RURAL AREAS o McCain gets a boost if he snags more than 60 percent of the vote from the Bootheel and central and northern Missouri. If he gets less, Obama has the advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUBURBAN COUNTIES o If either candidate wins Jackson and St. Louis counties, he'll win statewide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT THE POLLS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN ARE THE POLLS OPEN? 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO I NEED ID? In Illinois, some first-time voters may need to show ID. In Missouri, all voters must show ID, but not necessarily a photo ID. A utility bill or bank statement is acceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT IF I'M NOT LISTED AS REGISTERED? You can request a provisional ballot, but it won't count if cast at the wrong polling place. Ask your local election office for the right location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WILL IT BE CROWDED? Very - avoiding the peak hour rush by voting in mid-morning or mid-afternoon could help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT HAPPENS IF I AM STILL IN LINE WHEN THE POLLS CLOSE? If you join the line by 7 p.m., you will be allowed to vote.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBUS, OHIO - Barack Obama and John McCain uncorked massive get-out-the-vote operations in more than a dozen battleground states Sunday, millions of telephone calls, mailings and door-knockings in a frenzied, fitting climax to a record-shattering $1 billion campaign. Together, they'll spend about $8 per presidential vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Go vote right now,&quot; Obama urged supporters from the Ohio Capitol steps, reminding people of a nearby polling location where they could cast ballots by sunset. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With just two days to go, most national polls show Obama ahead of McCain. State surveys suggest the Democrat's path to the requisite 270 electoral votes is much easier to navigate than McCain's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show the six closest states are Florida, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Nevada and Ohio. All were won by George W. Bush in 2004 and have been made competitive by Obama's record-shattering fundraising. The campaigns also are running aggressive ground games elsewhere, including Iowa, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Colorado and Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All that's left now for the candidates is to make sure people vote Tuesday - if they haven't already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Election Day is becoming a misnomer. About 27 million absentee and early votes were cast in 30 states as of Saturday night, more than ever. Democrats outnumbered Republicans in pre-Election Day voting in key states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAST-MINUTE PLEAS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the campaign closes, voters are being inundated with television ads and automated phone calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee rolled out battleground phone calls that include New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's criticism of Obama in the Democratic primary. She is heard saying: &quot;In the White House, there is no time for speeches and on-the-job training. Sen. McCain will bring a lifetime of experience to the campaign, and Sen. Obama will bring a speech that he gave in 2002.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new TV ad, Obama highlighted Vice President Dick Cheney's support for McCain. The ad features Cheney, an extremely unpopular figure among the general public, at an event Saturday in Wyoming, saying: &quot;I'm delighted to support John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and McCain campaigned on each other's turf Sunday. Obama was in Ohio, a bellwether state Bush won four years ago and where polls show Obama tied or winning. McCain visited Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, states won by Democrat John Kerry in 2004. He trails in both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and the RNC dramatically ramped up their spending in the campaign's final days and now are matching Obama&nbsp;ad for ad, if not exceeding him, in key battleground markets in states such as Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia and Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After months of planning, the Republican Party launched the last stage of its vaunted &quot;72-hour program,&quot; when volunteers descend on competitive states for the final stretch. Democrats unleashed their &quot;persuasion army&quot; of backers scouring their own backyards to encourage people to back Obama in the campaign's waning hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 10,000 Obama volunteers in Ohio were knocking on doors and planning to hit their 1 millionth home Sunday after a five-day push.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no doubt that we've got an uphill battle,&quot; said Rich Beeson, the RNC's political director. But, he said: &quot;I'm not going into Election Day with any trepidation that they've put any state away&quot; by banking early votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RNC reported making 5.4 million voter contacts last week, compared with 1.9 million in the same week in 2004, and it says its volume has steadily increased since October began. Overall, it says 26 million voters have been contacted by volunteers over four months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday alone, the RNC says an estimated 3 million voters were contacted by phone or in person, and it saw so many volunteers show up to help that in at least one state, Colorado, the party ran out of canvassing packets. Some 180,000 were gone by midday Saturday; more were printed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LITTLE IMPACT?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the hype, Republicans and Democrats alike acknowledge that turnout operations usually are good for gaining a few percentage points at the most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain planned visits today to media markets that hit battlegrounds Florida, Virginia, Indiana, New Mexico, and Nevada. A repeat trip to Pennsylvania also was slated before McCain returns home to Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was getting help Sunday from rocker Bruce Springsteen in Cleveland and also was hitting Ohio's two other largest cities, Columbus and Cincinnati. He plans visits to Florida, North Carolina and Virginia today.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri's status as a presidential battleground state has had its upside for TV stations, and a potential downside for viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The upside: A record amount - at least $45 million - has been spent on TV campaign advertising this year on Missouri broadcast stations by all the major candidates on Tuesday's ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The downside: All that money has gone for more than 101,000 TV ad spots, almost a quarter of them aired on St. Louis stations. And that can lead to viewer fatigue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I expect on a per-voter basis, Missouri is close to the top states&quot; on campaign ad spending, said Evan Tracey, president of TNSMI-Campaign Media Analysis Group, a nonpartisan firm that has tracked campaign ad spending on broadcast stations for the Post-Dispatch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm's totals don't include cable TV buys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest spenders on Missouri's broadcast TV ads have been the two major-party presidential nominees. Democrat Barack Obama had spent close to $10 million in the state, as of the firm's latest report, which tallied spending through last Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coming in second was Republican John McCain, who was closing in on $8 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bulk of the presidential duo's spending in Missouri has been within the last 60 days, Tracey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their $18 million in Missouri is far less than what the two men spent in Florida, Pennsylvania or Ohio, Tracey said. But all three states also have two or three times as many registered voters as Missouri's 4 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which ads have they aired the most? For Obama, it's the ad that shows an unraveling ball of yarn, while an announcer attacks McCain's proposal to tax employer-provided health care benefits, and replace it with a broader tax credit. That ad has been aired more than 2,000 times on Missouri stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has spent the most on a single ad in Missouri -$1.13 million - to air a 60-second biographical spot. But because McCain has changed his ads frequently, none of the individual spots has been aired nearly as much as those run by the Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both presidential candidates are running most of their ads during the local news, morning talk shows and syndicated game shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri's two major candidates for governor came in No. 3 and No. 4 in overall ad spending. Democrat Jay Nixon has spent at least $5.5 million, followed by Republican Kenny Hulshof, with $4 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Closing out the top five: Chris Koster, the Democratic candidate for Missouri attorney general, who spent more than $2.1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis stations snagged the largest share of the TV ad spending, roughly $18.4 million, although more ad spots were aired in Kansas City, which has lower ad rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the most part, local TV ad executives declined to discuss their stations' take, or how it compared with earlier presidential election years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exception was Robert Totsch, director of sales for KMOV-TV Media. Although he declined to discuss his station's campaign ad revenue, Totsch emphasized that this year's regional campaign ad spending was &quot;off from market expectations,&quot; which had been 10 percent to 15 percent higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Totsch noted, for example, that for the Feb. 5 primary, the presidential contenders didn't spend money until a few weeks before Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, Obama and McCain didn't resume TV ad spending heavily in Missouri until late summer, Totsch said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the statewide candidates, most didn't begin spending on TV ads until about six weeks ago. The exceptions were Hulshof and Koster, who had bitter intraparty primary battles this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last couple of weeks, Totsch acknowledged, it has been &quot;Katy, bar the door&quot; for political ads, with candidates actually seeking more TV ad time than was available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illinois ad spending was far less</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Illinois has almost twice as many registered voters as Missouri - 7.7 million, compared with 4 million - its TV viewers have seen far fewer campaign ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All candidates and groups had spent just under $26 million to air 25,210 campaign ad spots, as of last week, the ad-monitoring firm reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key reason for the low spending: Obama and McCain haven't been buying much TV time in Illinois, because it's Obama's home state. The Illinois senator has spent roughly $2.5 million on TV ad time in his home state this year. McCain has spent far less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, the biggest campaign ad spenders in Illinois this year have been two members of Congress: U.S. Rep. Bill Foster, D-Geneva, ($2.9 million), and Democratic U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin ($2.6 million).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new ethics complaint against Sarah Palin accuses the Alaska governor of abusing her power by charging the state when her children traveled with her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint alleges that the Republican vice presidential nominee used her official position as governor for personal gain, violating a statute of the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act. The complaint was filed by Frank Gwartney, an Anchorage Democrat who supports Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama. It follows an Associated Press report this month that Palin charged the state more than $21,000 for her three daughters' commercial flights since she became governor in December 2006. She later ordered changes to travel forms to specify official business on the trips.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama plunked down $4 million for 30 minutes of prime-time television Wednesday night, summoning voters to &quot;choose hope over fear and unity over division&quot; in Tuesday's election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain called the broadcast ad a &quot;gauzy, feel-good commercial,&quot; paid for with broken promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-minute ad, aired on CBS, NBC, Fox and several cable networks, came six days before voters will go to the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also came as key independent voters were still weighing their decision. Though national polls and those in battleground states show Obama in the lead, Republicans and even some Democrats said the race was tightening as it neared the end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama made no mention of McCain in his paid television ad, but both men sharpened their rhetoric during the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, in Florida, argued that Obama lacks &quot;what it takes to protect America from terrorists&quot; as he sought to shift attention away from the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question is whether this is a man who has what it takes to protect America from Osama bin Laden, al-Qaida and the other great threats in the world,&quot; McCain said. &quot;He has given no reason to answer in the affirmative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, in North Carolina, said if, &quot;Senator McCain is elected, 100 million Americans will not get a tax cut ... your health care benefits will get taxed for the first time in history ... we'll have another president who wants to privatize part of your Social Security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-minute campaign commercial, purchased at a cost that campaign aides put at roughly $4 million, marked not only Obama's attempt to seal his case with the electorate, but also underscored his enormous financial advantage in the race. Obama's fundraising efforts have outpaced those of McCain, but critics say Obama has done so by reneging on a pledge to limit spending to the $84 million available under federal matching funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama used his commercial to pledge a rescue plan for the middle class in tough times. &quot;I will not be a perfect president,&quot; he said. &quot;But I can promise you this - I will always tell you what I think and where I stand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across 30 minutes, the ad blended the views of Obama as well as statements of Americans discussing their economic and health care troubles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain sought to blunt Obama's pitch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's got a few things he wants to sell you: He's offering government-run health care ... an energy plan guaranteed to work without drilling ... and an automatic wealth spreader that folds neatly and fits under any bed,&quot; McCain told an audience in Florida.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HERSHEY, PA. - Barack Obama and John McCain fought for votes Tuesday on critical ground in Pennsylvania, the only Democratic state McCain is still contesting on a national political map growing increasingly daunting. With just one week to go, GOP doubts about his chances for the presidency grew louder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even two Republicans once on McCain's short list for vice president sounded skeptical. In a fundraising e-mail on behalf of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Mitt Romney referred to &quot;the very real possibility of an Obama presidency.&quot; In the Midwest, Gov. Tim Pawlenty gave a dour assessment of McCain's chances in his state, saying Obama &quot;has a pretty good advantage in Minnesota right now.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, a poll by the Pew Research Center gave Obama a 16-point lead among registered voters. The survey said Obama had 52 percent and McCain 36 percent, with independent voters supporting the Democrat by a 48-31 margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates kicked off their final week of campaigning in the southeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which hasn't supported a Republican presidential candidate in 20 years and where Obama is ahead in the polls. McCain is working for an upset and has Pennsylvania as the linchpin to his victory strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not afraid of the fight, I'm ready for it,&quot; McCain told noisy supporters at a rally in this Republican region that is home to the world's largest chocolate factory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's advisers say they are confident of victory in the state. Still, they sent the candidate to rally supporters in Pittsburgh Monday night and to the battleground Philadelphia suburbs on Tuesday. About 9,000 people stood in the mud and a steady, cold rain at Widener University to hear him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just want all of you to know that if we see this kind of dedication on Election Day, there is no way that we're not going to bring change to America,&quot; said Obama, uncharacteristically attired in jeans, sneakers and a raincoat. McCain canceled a second event 50 miles away in Quakertown because of the dismal weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Hershey, McCain appeared with running mate Sarah Palin, who planned to stay in the state for another rally in Shippensburg. &quot;Pennsylvania, it's going to be a hard-fought contest here,&quot; she said. &quot;It's going to come down to the wire here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If McCain doesn't win the state's 21 electoral votes, it's hard to see how he can win the presidency since Obama is expected to pick up several of the states that helped re-elect President George W. Bush four years ago. McCain needs one of the blue states to make up for expected losses in the red ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both presidential candidates were leaving Pennsylvania for later rallies in Republican strongholds that have turned into battleground states - McCain to North Carolina and Obama to Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early voting in some swing states also appeared to be in Obama's favor. In North Carolina, for example, the turnout for early voting has been nearly a third higher than in 2004 and the number of Democrats has been close to double that of Republicans. Democratic voters in Florida have numbered about 100,000 more than Republicans, and Democrats also hold an edge so far in Colorado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nielsen Company reported Tuesday that McCain and Obama are focusing about three-fourths of their advertising in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Obama, who had been outspending McCain by up to 4-1 on advertising, is now airing only twice as many ads as McCain, the ratings company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain told Pennsylvania voters he's the candidate ready to take office, after a military career and years as a prisoner of war. He hammered Obama as a traditional liberal Democrat seeking to redistribute wealth and even willing to displace America's favorite pastime with a 30-minute commercial Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one will delay a World Series game with an infomercial when I'm president,&quot; McCain said to loud applause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those three states are battlegrounds, offering a combined 68 electoral votes on Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concentration of firepower comes even as Obama mounts a national advertising campaign that will culminate this evening with a 30-minute, prime-time commercial on network television.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Republican John McCain declared &quot;I'm going to win it,&quot; dismissing polls showing him behind with little more than a week to go in the presidential race. A confident Democrat Barack Obama drew 100,000 people to a Denver rally and rolled out a new TV ad asserting that his rival is &quot;running out of time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heading into the final nine days of the 2008 contest, the White House competitors campaigned in key battleground states that President George W. Bush won four years ago as the state-by-state Electoral College map tilts strongly in Obama's favor. Democrats and Republicans alike say it will be extraordinarily difficult for McCain to change the trajectory of the campaign before the Nov. 4 election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, I think John McCain might be added to that long list of Arizonans who ran for president but were never elected,&quot; McCain's fellow senator from Arizona, Republican Jon Kyl, told the Arizona Daily Star editorial board in an interview published Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates sparred from a distance, each criticizing the other anew in hopes of swaying the roughly one-fourth of voters who are undecided or could still change their minds. The campaign trail images and rhetoric said perhaps more about the state of the race than any poll could.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Colorado, Obama reveled in one of his largest U.S. crowds to date, with local police estimating that &quot;well over&quot; 100,000 people packed Denver's Civic Center Park and stretched even to the distant steps of the state Capitol. The enthusiastic sea of people prompted a &quot;goodness gracious&quot; from Obama as he took the stage. Another enormous swarm greeted him in Fort Collins later on the Colorado State University lawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At each stop Obama portrayed McCain as more of the same, saying, &quot;For eight years, we've seen the Bush-McCain philosophy put our country on the wrong track, and we cannot have another four years that look just like the last eight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Cedar Falls, Iowa, McCain campaigned before a much smaller audience and chided his Democratic rival: &quot;He's measuring the drapes. ... I prefer to let voters have their say. What America needs now is someone who will finish the race before starting the victory lap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; McCain cast Obama as too liberal for a right-of-center country, saying, &quot;He started out in the left-hand lane of American politics and has remained there.&quot; In appearances, McCain hit that same theme, accusing Obama of wanting to raise taxes and boost spending in tough economic times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In coming days, both candidates will focus primarily on Bush-won, vote-rich battlegrounds like Ohio and Florida, which decided the last two presidential elections and could do so again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania is the only state that Democrat John Kerry won four years ago that both candidates are expected to visit before Election Day. With 21 electoral votes, it hasn't voted for a Republican president since 1988, but McCain is aggressively courting white, working-class voters who overwhelmingly chose Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in the primary over Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides say Obama will lay out his closing argument in a speech today in Canton, Ohio. Even so, McCain appeared undeterred in Iowa, where public surveys show Obama comfortably leading. He also campaigned in the toss-up state of Ohio, followed by Pennsylvania today, where Obama has the advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the TV interview, McCain said of the race, &quot;We're going to win it, and it's going to be tight, and we're going to be up late&quot; on election night.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON o Joe the Entrepreneur, Joe the Shadow and other Joes from all walks of life are responding to a John McCain video contest, part of his late offensive skewering Barack Obama's tax proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I work very hard for what I earn and I don't need Barack Obama to tell me how to spread my money around,&quot; says Joe the Magician of Atlanta, who turns dollar bills into hundred-dollar notes in front of the camera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the campaign's final days, McCain is attempting a magic act of his own: trying to reverse his political fortunes by relying heavily on Obama's promise to &quot;spread the wealth&quot; when he met Joe Wurzelbacher, the now-famous Ohio plumber. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the Joe campaign and the GOP effort to paint Obama as a &quot;socialist&quot; appears to be having little impact, judging by polls showing Obama's leads in Ohio and several other battleground states steady or widening. An exception is Missouri, which remains a toss-up according to a new Post-Dispatch poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest batch of state surveys analyzed Friday by pollster.com showed states accounting for 268 electoral votes in the &quot;strong Obama&quot; column - just two shy of the 270 needed in the Electoral College. National Journal's Hotline counted states providing 266 solid Obama electoral votes, more than double the number firmly in McCain's corner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National polls are every bit as daunting for McCain. They showed him behind by double digits late last week, 13 points in a New York Times poll, 11 points an ABC News survey and 10 points in a Fox News poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results painted a uniform picture of voters' worries about the economy and a growing sense that Obama would be best suited to repair the financial damage to the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Post-Dispatch's poll in Missouri, for instance, by a 9-point margin, voters said they trusted Obama more than McCain on the economy. In the ABC News National poll, Obama held a 17-point advantage on the economic question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain hopes his use of Joe-the-Plumber themes - in ads, videos and stump speeches - can narrow that gap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He (Obama) believes in redistributing wealth, not in policies that grow our economy and create jobs,&quot; McCain said Friday in Colorado. &quot;Sen. Obama is more interested in controlling wealth than in creating it, in redistributing money instead of spreading opportunity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Far-left liberal'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's &quot;Joe&quot; strategy is about more than the economy, noted pollster Charles Franklin, a University of Wisconsin professor and co-developer of pollster.com and the Big Ten Battleground Poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Franklin recalled that last summer, Obama's momentum had stalled amid a growing perception that he was &quot;a far-left liberal.&quot; With the nation being what Franklin describes as center-right on the political spectrum, McCain was able to draw even despite mounting dissatisfaction with the administration of President George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Painting Obama as a spread-the-wealth lefty gives McCain the opportunity to rekindle those sentiments, Franklin said, adding: &quot;with one obvious problem - that it was a Republican president that just bought out the banks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg said a survey he took last week showed the strategy wasn't working. Pollsters read voters a recent McCain statement about &quot;Obama's socialist policies&quot; and plan to raise taxes, then read them an Obama assertion that &quot;no one earning under a quarter-million dollars&quot; would see higher taxes. Voters overwhelmingly sided with Obama, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings suggested to Greenberg that the McCain offensive could backfire, given voters' concerns about government tilting policies toward the rich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now we're having a debate on that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terry Nelson, political director for the Bush-Cheney campaign four years ago, is among the Republicans who believes that Joe the Plumber can work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's something voters can identify with. Rather than an abstract policy debate, it is a real effort about a real person trying to build a business and be successful. And we live in a country where people want to have freedom to be successful,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Socialism revisited?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Obama's plan, individuals making over $200,000 annually and families who report income of $250,000 or more would see their tax rates rise from 35 percent to the 39.6 percent rate that was in place during much of the 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andy Roth, director of government affairs for the financially conservative Club for Growth, argued that increasing that rate while reducing taxes at lower income levels amounts to &quot;Marxist theory, taking from the rich and giving to the poor. ... Why should we give more money to a government that has clearly demonstrated that it is reckless and irresponsible as far as spending?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tax experts note that the upper-income rate has seldom been lower than 35 percent since the government started imposing taxes on income early last century. The rate reached as high as 90 percent in the 1950s to pay for the Korean War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roberton Williams, an analyst at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington, said politicians of all stripes have long bought into a system that taxes wealthier people at higher rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If a progressive tax system is socialism, then we've been a socialist country since 1913 when we first put the tax system in place,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts on socialism dismiss the notion that Obama harbors socialist tendencies. They point to his financial support from wealthy investors and his connections with advisers such as Robert Rubin, of Citigroup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Wolff is an economist at the University of Massachusetts and co-author of the book &quot;New Departures in Marxian Theory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no way that Mr. Obama would be getting the contributions from corporate America that he is getting if they had the faintest suspicion that their positions in the economy would be jeopardized,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet it's neither professors nor tax analysts whom McCain is trying to reach with his tax appeal. It's voters such as Jane Word, 73, a nurse in St. Louis, who say she's voting Republican in November and understands Joe the Plumber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know Obama has a socialist agenda,&quot; she said, in words that might come straight from a McCain&nbsp;ad. &quot;He wants to spread the wealth around.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RENO, NEV. - Scrambling to win the West, Democrat Barack Obama mocked John McCain on Saturday for aggressively trying to distance himself from President George W. Bush. McCain touted his Western ties and warned that Obama is a tax-and-spend threat to the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financially flush Obama campaign also unveiled a two-minute TV ad that asks, &quot;Will our country be better off four years from now?&quot; The length of the ad, which will air in key states, highlights Obama's fundraising superiority - most campaign commercials run 30 seconds or a minute. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama continued to ridicule McCain for distancing himself from the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain attacking George Bush for his out-of-hand economic policy is like Dick Cheney attacking George Bush for his go-it-alone foreign policy,&quot; Obama said. The Democrat said Bush must not mind the criticism, because he cast his vote early this week - for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten days before the election, both candidates were targeting the same trio of states - Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico. Any of them could help shape who wins the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flurry of appearances by Obama and McCain likely represent the last time in a long, testy campaign that the toss-up territory of the West will get this much attention. Electoral prizes, such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida, will soon take command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said it was too late for McCain to portray himself as independent from Bush after standing with him for years. McCain has a mixed record of supporting and bucking Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Real change, Obama said, is &quot;not somebody who's trying to break with his president over the last 10 days after having supported him for the last eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the front-running Obama campaigned at a baseball stadium, McCain was at an outdoor rally at the New Mexico state fairgrounds in Albuquerque. The Arizona Republican claimed he had the edge in battleground states in the region, calling himself &quot;a fellow Westerner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. Obama has never been south of the border,&quot; said McCain, arguing that he has a feel for issues such as water that resonate throughout the region. Obama's campaign said Obama has, in fact, been to Mexico before he got into public office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, in Mesilla, N.M., McCain said he had a home-court advantage in the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know the issues, I know land, I know water, I know Native American issues,&quot; said McCain, speaking at a sun-splashed rally. &quot;I know how Western states are growing with dynamic strength. Senator Obama does not understand these issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain continued to portray Obama, an Illinois senator, as a tax-and-spend liberal certain to push for more government and higher spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He believes in redistributing wealth,&quot; McCain said. &quot;That's not America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His running mate, Sarah Palin, evoked the same theme Saturday in Sioux City, Iowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While she spoke, the crowd at her rally cried out about Obama: &quot;He's a socialist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RIVAL ADS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, meanwhile, continued to use his massive fundraising appeal to his advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Obama&nbsp;ad is scheduled to begin running Sunday. While not mentioning McCain, it promotes Obama's economic policies while saying the Democrat will work to end &quot;mindless partisanship&quot; and &quot;divisiveness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee released its own TV ad Saturday questioning whether Obama has the experience to be president. The ad, featuring the image of a stormy ocean, says the nation is in &quot;uncertain times&quot; that could get worse and asks whether voters want a president &quot;who's untested at the helm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West, once reliable Republican territory, has seen its politics and demographics shift over the last decade. Bush narrowly won Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico four years ago and Democrats see them and their 19 electoral votes as a real opportunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to the nation's troubled economy, Missouri's likely voters put greater trust in Democrat Barack Obama than Republican John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, in a nutshell, appears to be why Obama's standing in this battleground state has improved since last summer - and why, less than two weeks before the Nov. 4 election, Obama is locked in a too-close-to-call presidential contest with McCain, a new poll shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy is driving the presidential race, no question about it,'' said Del Ali, head of Research 2000, which conducted the polls in Missouri and Illinois for the Post-Dispatch and KMOV-TV (Channel 4).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the 800 likely Missouri voters polled last week, 48 percent backed Obama, while 47 percent favored McCain. Three percent preferred one of three minor-party candidates, and 2 percent were undecided. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although statistically insignificant, Obama's lead is his first in Missouri against McCain in any Research 2000 polls this year. The previous poll, in late September, showed McCain with a one-point edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Illinois, Obama's home turf, it's a blowout. He holds a commanding 25-point lead over McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In each state, the poll's margin of error is 3.5 percentage points for each number. In Missouri, that means either man could be ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri is among a handful of remaining toss-up states in the presidential contest. It's especially important for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama doesn't need Missouri. McCain has to have it,'' Ali said. &quot;There's no analysis that shows McCain can get to 270 (electoral votes) without Missouri.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ali says Obama's strength with voters on economic issues is undoubtedly helping his cause. More than half of those polled in Missouri (52 percent) said they trusted his judgment more on the economy, compared with 43 percent for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also got significantly higher marks on health care and the environment. He edged out McCain on gas prices, energy and taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain was deemed far more trustworthy in tackling terrorism, international affairs, the war in Iraq and Supreme Court appointments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain wasn't benefiting as much as expected on his foreign-policy strengths because domestic matters are at the top of many voters' minds, Ali said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the case with poll participant Evelyn Tucker of Festus, a nurse primarily concerned with the economy and health care. She backs Obama. &quot;I know he's inexperienced, but his heart is in the right place. He inspires my confidence,'' said Tucker, 51. &quot;He's not going to be led around by the nose. That's my problem with Mr. McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Gabrick, a business owner in O'Fallon, Mo., supports McCain. &quot;I like his conservative values and the direction he'll take the country,'' Gabrick, 47, said. &quot;I like that he's strong on defense, and will continue our success in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Obama: &quot;I do not agree with the direction he wants to take the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabrick and Tucker exemplify the two candidates' gender appeal. A majority of women voters polled favored Obama, while a majority of the men preferred McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tucker and Gabrick also reflect opposing positions on the government's recent actions to spend up to $700 billion to aid financial institutions in trouble - a plan both presidential candidates voted for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabrick was among the solid majority of those polled who oppose the aid. &quot;I don't think it's wise to mortgage our children's future with the bailout,'' he said, adding that the nation's economy would improve &quot;if the free market is allowed to perform as it has in the past.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tucker blamed lack of government oversight for some of the financial mess. She reluctantly supported the bailout, but added, &quot;It's a shame that it came to that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked specifically about the current financial mess, Missouri voters seemed to be wary of either presidential candidate's abilities. Only 33 percent said they had greater trust in Obama, compared with 22 percent for McCain. The biggest bloc - 45 percent - wasn't sure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ILLINOIS VIEWS DIFFER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Illinois, Obama outpolled McCain on every &quot;trust&quot; issue except fighting terrorism, where the Republican had a slight edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think (Obama) is a visionary who can move us forward,'' said poll respondent Mary Plocher, 55, a social worker from O'Fallon, Ill. &quot;I'm a cancer survivor, and I think his health care plan will work better for me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's popularity at home coincides with negative feelings in the state about the nation's current leadership - a typical response reflected in other polls around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A whopping 84 percent of poll respondents said the nation was going in the &quot;wrong direction,'' the highest level of dissatisfaction in Illinois in four years of polling. Likely Missouri voters polled weren't much more optimistic: 79 percent said the country was headed in the wrong direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's favorite-son status in Illinois is the chief reason why neither candidate has been spending much on TV ads there. Over the past month in Illinois, McCain has spent no money in any of the state's major markets, according to TSNMI-Campaign Media Analysis Group, an ad-monitoring firm tracking campaign spending for the Post-Dispatch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has spent just under $1.2 million in TV ads aired on Illinois stations since mid-September, the firm says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a far cry from the hefty spending in Missouri, which has fewer than half as many TV viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spent at least $1.1 million on TV ads just in the past week to reach Missouri voters, according to the ad-monitoring firm's latest report. That's more than twice as much as McCain, who reported spending $476,000 on Missouri TV stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates spent the bulk of their ad money in recent weeks in Kansas City and St. Louis. Although both cities are Democratic strongholds, their TV stations' viewers are primarily in the suburbs, which are swing territory or lean Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RACE AN UNDERCURRENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looming behind the poll numbers in both polls is the issue of race. That was especially true in Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both states, roughly a quarter of those polled - 24 percent in Illinois and 28 percent in Missouri - said they believed Obama's biracial background would be an &quot;important'' or &quot;very important'' factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, about three-quarters of those polled in Illinois said the nation was ready to elect an African-American as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Missouri, only two-thirds of the respondents agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tim Jennings, a union carpenter from Cedar Hill who supports Obama, said he's heard the racial talk. &quot;I know a couple of people who normally vote Democratic, who aren't going to vote Democratic for that reason,'' Jennings said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Ali: &quot;In a close contest, at the last minute, race could be enough to deny Obama a victory&quot; in Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ali said other factors might play a role, including the rising unfavorable ratings of Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin remains popular among the GOP base. She attracted about 20,000 for Friday's rally in Springfield, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Schmidt, a McCain supporter from Affton, saw Palin at her Oct. 2 rally in St. Louis. &quot;She was electrifying,'' Schmidt said, citing in particular Palin's opposition to abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Palin's unfavorable rating among those polled in Missouri has climbed to 47 percent, edging out her favorable rating of 44 percent. A month ago, her favorable rating was 50 percent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">JEFFERSON CITY Mo.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They once were co-workers and even basketball teammates. But Jay Nixon and Kenny Hulshof's friendship has all but disappeared as the two men throw elbows at each other in their battle to become Missouri's next governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon, a Democrat, is Missouri's longest-serving attorney general. In the mid-1990s, he relied on his assistant, Hulshof, to prosecute some of the state's highest-profile crimes. During lunch breaks at the office, they played pickup basketball games. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A dozen years later, Hulshof is a Republican congressman who derisively refers to Nixon as &quot;old way Jay&quot; and implies that his former boss is corrupt. Nixon portrays Hulshof as an out-of-touch &quot;Washington politician&quot; responsible for the nation's economic woes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vitriol in the governor's race has at times been overshadowed by an even more hotly contested presidential race that has brought Barack Obama, John McCain and their running mates to Missouri for more than two dozen events since they won the state's presidential primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The barrage of presidential TV ads has gone on for months, making it difficult for the gubernatorial candidates to break through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the presidential candidates, Nixon and Hulshof have each stressed the economy. They've offered rival health care and higher education proposals, and discussed the need to make government more efficient and accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon and Hulshof have also pledged to bring change if they are elected to replace Republican Gov. Matt Blunt, who is not seeking another term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the shared theme with the presidential campaign has created a challenge for Hulshof, who entered the governor's race without Nixon's broad name recognition and who has trailed both in fundraising and public opinion polls throughout the campaign. The most recent poll, from late September, showed Nixon with a 9-point lead, 51 percent to 42 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama's talking about change in Washington, and Kenny Hulshof is Washington,&quot; said George Connor, acting chairman of the political science department at Missouri State University. &quot;Much to his dismay, McCain and (running mate Sarah) Palin are talking about changing the way things are done in Washington. So every time McCain runs an ad against the Washington establishment as usual, that's a hit against Hulshof.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hulshof, 50, has tried to distance himself from Washington. He emphasizes that he comes from a family of Missouri farmers, not politicians. On occasion, Hulshof still helps out on the family farm that he inherited from his parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also highlights how he bucked the Republican leadership by voting as a member of the House Ethics Committee to admonish then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. Hulshof subsequently was removed from the committee a fact he touts as a badge of honor when talking about his integrity and independence on the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon, 52, also has a small-town background, though he grew up surrounded by politicians. His father was the mayor of the small Missouri town of De Soto and served as a municipal judge. His mother was the school board president and also served on the city park board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least initially, political party affiliation wasn't an issue between Nixon and Hulshof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon retained Hulshof as an assistant attorney general in 1993 when Nixon succeeded Republican Attorney General Bill Webster, who had hired Hulshof several years earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Republicans in 1994 chose Hulshof as a last-minute replacement candidate for a congressional race, Nixon gave Hulshof a safety net by allowing him to take a leave of absence and then return to his state job after he lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a good working relationship,&quot; said Nixon, who described Hulshof as a &quot;competent and capable&quot; attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Nixon took heat from some Democrats for standing by Hulshof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Hulshof began preparing for a second congressional bid, Nixon said he didn't think a state employee should be mounting a long-term political campaign. After a boss-to-employee conversation, Hulshof resigned at the end of 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think each of us, while we didn't say this directly, had decided to part company,&quot; Hulshof said. The tone was &quot;don't let the door hit you&quot; on the way out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the pair appeared to be cordial until the August primary, when both men beat their party rivals and turned their attention on each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Hulshof and Nixon each suggest the other is a changed man for the worst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hulshof has made a campaign issue of halting certain no-bid contracts in the attorney general's office even though Hulshof received a similar contract from Nixon to continue handling three court cases following his resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hulshof also has criticized Nixon for accepting campaign donations from businesses and attorneys who have been a part of legal matters involving the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a recent debate, Hulshof closed by suggesting Nixon had acted unethically in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure Mr. Nixon probably began his career in government with good intentions, but somewhere along the way, power and politics changed him, and he lost his way,&quot; Hulshof said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon has countered such accusations by casting them as &quot;desperate&quot; Washington-style political attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's been in Washington a long time. He's a lot different,&quot; Nixon said. When &quot;I think of him, I'm running against a congressman, not against an assistant attorney general.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - When asked in their debates about fixing the ailing economy, John McCain and Barack Obama quickly brought up ambitious energy plans in their short lists of prescriptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spoke excitedly about the prospect of building 45 nuclear reactors in a little more than two decades, a nuclear renaissance that he says will dramatically reduce imports of oil and exports of cash to countries that don't hold the United States in high regard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama moved quickly to proposals for more federal support for alternative energy sources like wind and solar and more government subsidies for biofuels and clean coal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates promise to tackle climate change with programs that force industries to reduce pollution, albeit with the flexibility that enables them to buy and sell pollution credits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what neither candidate is saying much about is how the jarring changes in the economy could make it difficult or impossible to achieve their energy blueprints anytime soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's $700 billion commitment to prop up banks almost certainly will lead to new spending priorities, energy experts say. Programs that sounded appealing - even essential - just weeks ago might no longer muster support in Congress as it tries to pay for the bailout while supporting Medicaid, Medicare and the many other social programs Americans demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to the environment, struggles by businesses to survive the recession could diminish the political will to fight global warming with new regulations. And plummeting oil prices could dampen the fervor surrounding renewable energy sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic atmosphere could make it more difficult for either McCain or Obama to secure the subsidies for clean-coal research, which is important for the coalfields of Southern Illinois and the coal industry leaders that make their headquarters in St. Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, securing financing for new nuclear reactors proposed for the Callaway Power Plant near Fulton, Mo. - and perhaps later for downstate Illinois - could be more difficult in the months ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Alvarez, an Energy Department official in the Clinton administration, predicted that &quot;very large and very expensive programs are going to be even harder to pull off&quot; without large-scale support from taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's going to be a much more intense competition for federal subsidies than ever before,&quot; said Alvarez, now a senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies, a think tank in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NUCLEAR QUESTIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cornerstone of McCain's energy planning is 45 nuclear reactors, which likely would cost in excess of $300 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has agreed that nuclear power must be part of the nation's future but also cited the nation's failure to settle on a solution for storing nuclear waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the nation's current economic travails, the cost of nuclear plants put the feasibility of McCain's plan in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a year ago, six of the nation's top investment banks told Congress that financial risks and higher construction costs &quot;will make lenders unwilling at present to extend long-term credit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, investment banking has been radically restructured and credit worries have mounted, meaning that utilities and holding companies building nuclear plants must rely even more heavily on government loan guarantees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But so far, Congress has agreed to allocate just $18.5 billion to nuclear plants, nowhere near what it would take to build even a handful of new reactors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date, 17 entities, including AmerenUE in Missouri, have submitted applications to build a total of 25 new reactors. The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission is expecting five more applications over the next 14 months, a spokesman said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Kerekes, a spokesman for the industry's Nuclear Energy Institute, said companies anticipate a vastly changed credit market when they get to the point of putting together their financing in two or three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Knock on wood for all of us, this situation will have sorted itself out for all of us by then or we're going to have bigger problems than whether nuclear plants get built,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BATTLING DEPENDENCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When debate moderator Bob Schieffer of CBS asked candidates last week how long it would take the United States to reduce dependency on foreign oil, Americans heard some distinctly rosy assessments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten years, Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain went further: &quot;I think we can easily, within seven, eight, 10 years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security&quot;?&quot;?...&quot;?,&quot; he responded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Realistic or not, their responses were in keeping with voter sentiments. A poll released last week by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs produced these findings: 80 percent of Americans think securing adequate energy supplies should be a very important goal of U.S. foreign policy - more than 10 points higher than the goal of combating international terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates disagree on drilling for oil and gas. Last spring, McCain dropped his opposition to drilling in the ocean for oil and gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama called McCain's reversal a &quot;gimmick&quot; and said he would continue to support a congressional freeze on drilling on most of the outer continental shelf, from 3 miles to 200 miles away from land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama, aware of public support for expanded drilling, later reversed course himself and said would accept offshore drilling if accompanied by more federal support for renewable energy sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The means to achieve energy independence remains in doubt. McCain has proposed a $300 million prize for a highly efficient electric car battery. Obama wants to offer $7,000 in tax credits for people who buy plug-in hybrids - vehicles that alternate between traditional engines and electric power with rechargeable batteries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But plug-in hybrids are not yet sold and may not be widely available in the United States for several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy experts say candidates have focused too heavily on quick fixes rather than stressing what Americans can do now - energy conservation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In candidate debates, McCain has not talked about energy conservation, and Obama has brought up the issue sparingly, advising people to weatherize their homes and businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Lubell is a physics professor at City College of New York and director of public affairs for the American Physical Society, the world's largest association of physicists. His organization published a report recently calling efficiency in fuel use and building design &quot;a great hidden energy resource.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, he said, &quot;has gotten caught in this trap of drilling our way out of something, which doesn't make sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama? He has no clear record with regard to energy efficiency and has fallen prey to &quot;hype about plug-in hybrids, which is not realistic,&quot; Lubell added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lubell praised both candidates for aggressive stands to combat climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scientifcally, it is a compelling problem, and the public accepts the notion that it's a problem,&quot; Lubell said. &quot;But at the moment most people are feeling affected by other things in a much more urgent fashion.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You have only 14 days, America, to decide who you want to lead this country. And IMHO - that's hip, cyber-techno Internet talk for &quot;in my humble opinion&quot; - that person should be me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some say I don't have a chance, that a vote for the Life Sherpa is a vote wasted. Well, did you feel that way when you cast your ballot for Ralph Nader? Well, OK, those were wasted votes, but I think you get my point. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not like my candidacy hasn't struck a chord. If you go to my column online (stltoday.com/lifestyle) you will see my official campaign poster, as well as the electronic media's belated coverage of my quest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, my campaign recently held a major rally at the Bar That Can't Be Named and made some real progress on some vital issues. For example, do you know how much better a White Russian tastes when it's made with vanilla-flavored vodka?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After many hours at the rally, we also concluded that my campaign needs to enlist the help of an untapped demographic, those folks who have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in a, shall we say, less than technically correct manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since you are in this country using our school systems, our hospitals and our social programs without paying any taxes, it would be great if you could also find a way to get to the polls and cast a vote for your ol' amigo, the Life Sherpa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The future is now. Destiny has arrived. Do the right thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Life Sherpa: With the presidential election right around the corner, there is one thing you need to do to ensure success: Stop answering questions that are asked of you! If someone asks you about strip joints, steer them towards your economic policy. If they inquire as to your favorite sports team, look them in the eye and tout your foreign policy beliefs. Answering questions directly never got anyone elected. Time is running out and the election is slipping away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Concerned Countian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Concerned: I truly appreciate your heartfelt concern about my candidacy in these crucial days leading up to the election. I've thought about dodging the tough questions, and simply providing the same type of safe, stock answers that my two main opponents offer up ad nauseam. But the Life Sherpa doesn't play that game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One candidate promises change. What the hell, I AM change. No more business as usual! No more catering to the whining left-wing tree-hugging cadre, or the blustering right-wing money-grubbing cabal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the election right around the corner, it's time to answer the questions, take off the gloves, cut to the chase and address a few issues:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- White-collar crime: Crooks are crooks, so lose the adjectives. White-collar criminals are simply criminals, just like crack dealers and car-jackers. Sell a rock of crack, you go to jail. Bilk investors and pillage their retirement accounts and you go to St. Tropez. That is no way to run a railroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Affirmative action: Whether you favor it or oppose it, affirmative action is based on the notion that two wrongs make a right. As Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Charles Krauthammer once wrote: &quot;It frontally violates the principle of equal treatment and thus inevitably creates, in a society founded on the ideal of equality under law, new and bitter racial divisions.&quot; Also bad railroad management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Abortion: It involves babies, not fetuses. Federal law provides a person with the opportunity to make a choice on this divisive, emotional issue. I am not opposed to that. But please don't change the words to conveniently lessen the impact. Or in the interest of fairness, let's start calling death-row prisoners &quot;rabid dogs.&quot; It makes it so much easier to put them down when the time comes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Energy: Hey, it takes wattage to manufacture Birkenstocks. So don't tell me you're serious about finding alternative energy sources to wean this nation from foreign petroleum, but then turn around and say you are opposed off-shore drilling for oil, nuclear power and burning coal. Maybe if you just click your heels three times, Dorothy, everything will run on solar panels and windmills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can you feel it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's Life Sherpa on-line chat time, coming up at noon today. As always, there's no cover charge and no drink minimum. Submit questions at STLtoday.com/lifestyle. Find the Sherpa's face and click.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Missouri voters report to their polling places on Nov. 4, members of the state's legal community may recognize one of the names near the very top of the ballot: Darrell L. Castle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Castle is the founding partner of the Castle Law Offices, a trio of bankruptcy and personal injury firms that includes offices in St. Louis and Kansas City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Castle, a soft-spoken Memphis attorney, is the Constitution Party's candidate for vice president of the United States. In 37 states, including Missouri, his name will appear on the ballot just below Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitution Party, a staunchly Christian conservative party that's seen growing membership in recent years, will be stumping in Kansas City later this week. Castle and the party's presidential pick, Florida Baptist preacher Chuck Baldwin, will speak at two campaign events on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The platform of the Constitution Party is seeped in Christian language and asserts that the nation was founded by Christians. The party bills itself as the only 100 percent anti-abortion ticket and advocates for a stronger border between the United States and Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Castle's run for the nation's second-highest office is a strenuous effort that's gone largely unnoticed even among attorneys here and in Castle's native Tennessee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the executive director of the Tennessee Bar Association and the chair of the group's bankruptcy section knew Castle by name and by his solid reputation. Neither men knew he was running for a national office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Castle, a Marine Corps veteran and an attorney for 30 years, admitted his candidacy has been flying under the radar, although not by choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The national media don't seem to be lining up to interview me,&quot; he said last week from his law office in Memphis. &quot;So that part's been difficult. We're making progress. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Castle put most of his law practice on hold this year after being added to the ticket at the party's nominating convention, held in April in Kansas City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His monthly visits to the firm's offices in Missouri have subsided, replaced by campaign stops in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Arizona. Late last week Castle was slated to speak in New York at an anti-bailout rally on Wall Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jason Amerine, the managing partner of the Castle Law Office's operations in Kansas City, said news of Castle's candidacy has reached some clients in Missouri. A few have called the office asking if the &quot;Castle&quot; running for vice president is the same &quot;Castle&quot; that gave the law firm its name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We tell them, 'yes,' &quot; Amerine said. &quot;They're all pretty surprised. I think a lot of them are happy to hear that. It kind of builds up credibility for this office here, knowing that the owner is running for vice president. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Castle said most of his clients have no knowledge of his political aspirations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've taken pains to prevent that from happening,&quot; he said. &quot;I did not want to use this as a business-building tool. But at the same time, quite honestly, I've had very little news exposure. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitution Party in Missouri</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitution Party candidates have not appeared on Missouri ballots since 2004, when the party failed to earn 2 percent of the vote in any of the statewide races that featured its candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party supporters made a deliberate push this year, collecting more than 16,000 signatures to regain the party's position on the ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Castle is the only lawyer on the Constitution Party ticket in Missouri, said party chairwoman Donna Ivanovich, although not for want of effort. She said the party approached several attorneys in Rolla as potential Constitution Party candidates for an open judgeship in the area, only to come up empty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivanovich, who made two unsuccessful runs as a party candidate for Missouri Secretary of State, is no stranger to the legal community. She's the assistant to Nicholas Terry, the senior associate dean of faculty at Saint Louis University Law School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After leaving the Republican Party, Ivanovich participated in the formation of the Constitution Party in 1992, as did Castle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she hasn't done much to advertise Castle's ties to Missouri, except to send invitations to federal attorneys for a campaign event in St. Louis that was eventually canceled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I haven't made a big effort to contact the law firms,&quot; Ivanovich said. &quot;I just figure it's their obligation to know who they're voting for. If they feel they only have two candidates [for president], well, we have five candidates in Missouri. Unfortunately, people don't do their homework. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pressure is on for Missouri's Constitution Party. If the group can secure 2 percent of the vote in any of the five statewide races featuring Constitution Party candidates, then the party will stay on the ballot until 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, Missourians cast 5,355 for the Constitution Party candidates for president and vice president. That segment was 0.2 percent of the presidential vote in Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading by example</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Castle, the last few months of campaigning have been an education in politics. This attempt at the vice presidency is his first-ever run for political office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his family spurred him to throw his hat into the ring. His wife, Joan Castle, is active in Constitution Party activities in Tennessee and is the office manager of the 13-lawyer firm's Memphis office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I learned a lot about leadership in the Marine Corps,&quot; Castle said. &quot;Not the way you might think, in an authoritative or dictatorial fashion. The Marine Corps teaches you to lead by example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you require your Marines or your employees to be to work at 8, then you need to be there at 7:30. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amerine, the managing partner in the firm's Kansas City office, described Castle as a quiet person with sound legal judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's very calm,&quot; Amerine said. &quot;Nothing rattles him, no matter what the situation is. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Amerine joined the firm seven years ago, right out of law school at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, he had never heard of the Constitution Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, as an undecided voter, Amerine said he's researching the group and generally likes what he sees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think his party and Chuck Baldwin, they have a good chance of providing a lot of positive change to our economy,&quot; Amerine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm supportive of him. I know him well enough to know he could do some good. &quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - The next president's choice of a Treasury secretary may well be the most important appointment he'll make - someone to grab the reins of a trillion-dollar-plus program to shore up the world's largest economy, probably in the middle of a severe recession, and at the right hand of a chief executive who'll be a rookie himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In normal times, the job can be demanding enough. In an economic crisis, as now, it can be one of the most powerful and stressful jobs in the government. Just ask Henry Paulson, the former investment banker who's made it clear he's not interested in keeping the title. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If not Paulson, then who?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama showered praise on legendary investor Warren Buffett when asked during a presidential debate whom they might put at Treasury. Buffett said maybe Paulson should stay for a while.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has a couple of Bill Clinton's Treasury secretaries as economic advisers: Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers. McCain has current and former CEOs of major companies, including Meg Whitman of eBay and Carly Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Buffett, McCain said when asked in the debate, &quot;He has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations, institutions today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama agreed that &quot;Warren would be a pretty good choice - Warren Buffett, and I'm pleased to have his support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a little hard to imagine the oracle of Omaha putting his money in a blind trust - or leaving Omaha for that matter. He previously has responded to such suggestions by saying he loves running his company, and a government position would be outside his &quot;circle of confidence.&quot; Would he respond to an appeal to help his country in a time of need? Who knows?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On PBS' &quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot; recently, Buffett said Paulson would do the next president a favor by staying in the job at least a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paulson has appeared to rule this out, saying he's told both candidates he would &quot;start working with whoever the new Treasury secretary is as soon as he is appointed and work to make the transition a first-rate transition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and McCain both are surrounded by experienced economic advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's team includes Buffett, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and and the two former Treasury secretaries: Rubin, now an executive with Citigroup, and Summers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Summers has been put before the public a lot by the Obama campaign. But he's not without controversy. After serving as Clinton's final Treasury secretary, he became president of Harvard. He drew worldwide attention for his comments that biological differences may partly explain the dearth of women among the very highest achieving scientists, a controversy that led to his resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two seasoned economic professionals who might be tapped for the post regardless of who wins: Timothy F. Geithner, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and Sheila Bair, head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both, along with Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, have played major roles in putting together the government's series of bold steps to restore financial order in a world coming unglued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geithner is a Democrat, and Bair is a Republican. Also mentioned as a possible contender: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is close to eBay Chief Executive Meg Whitman - the only other person he mentioned at the presidential debate as a possible Treasury secretary. &quot;She knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace,&quot; McCain said. &quot;She knows how to create jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also counts as a principal economic adviser former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. The company's board fired her in 2005 after a string of earnings disappointments. She also drew criticism for launching an effort at Hewlett-Packard to identify company employees who were speaking to reporters anonymously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texan Phil Gramm, a close friend of McCain and a former Senate Banking Committee chairman, also was considered a possible candidate for Treasury secretary - until he was forced to leave McCain's campaign team during the summer after he decried some Americans as a &quot;nation of whiners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two long-shot possibilities if McCain is elected: New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a former Democrat; and New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo. McCain suggested both of them, as well as Buffett, to head a bailout oversight board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Obama, other possibilities include Daniel Tarullo, his top adviser on financial issues, and New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine, who is a Goldman Sachs alum, like Paulson.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Democratic officials say they are a bit puzzled that television commercials in support of their party's presidential nominee, Barack Obama, have been popping up on Oklahoma television stations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite his lead in national polls and in battleground states, Obama has little chance of defeating Republican nominee John McCain in Oklahoma, which makes expenditures on television advertising in the state surprising eveb to some Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls have generally given McCain a 2-1 advantage over the Illinois senator in Oklahoma, a conservative state that hasn't voted for a Democratic nominee for president since 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Democratic Party Chairman Ivan Holmes said he was surprised to see two television spots Wednesday on Oklahoma City television stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holmes said the Obama campaign has &quot;not spent a penny&quot; for yard signs to help the party drum up support for the nominee and his fellow Democrats. &quot;We appealed to them two or three times just to help us out with yard signs to help our down ticket candidates,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jed Green, Obama's state campaign director, said he assumed it was part of a 50-state strategy to increase Obama's popular vote and &quot;hopefully provide a mandate from the populace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had no inside information, however, on the strategy behind the television ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama campaign in Chicago did not immediately reply to an e-mail request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Republican chairman Gary Jones suggested that since Obama was not coming to the state before the Nov. 4 general election, buying TV ads could be a way of appeasing Democrats who feel neglected by the Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, Jones said, Obama is flush with cash. &quot;He has so much money he doesn't know how to spend it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he does not think there has been much movement toward Obama in Oklahoma, such as has developed in other states won by George Bush in 2004 and now seen as possibilities for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Holmes and Green predicted Obama will do better in Oklahoma than polls suggest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holmes said the telephone polls are not capturing many enthusiastic young supporters of Obama who rely on cellular phones instead of traditional land lines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. - John McCain told Barack Obama to his face Wednesday night, &quot;You didn't tell the American people the truth&quot; about a key campaign pledge as the two presidential rivals slung accusations at close quarters in the final debate of their campaign for the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One hundred percent, John, of your ads - 100 percent of them - have been negative,&quot; Obama shot back a few moments later to his rival, seated only a few feet away at a round table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's not true,&quot; McCain retorted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is true,&quot; said Obama, seeking the last word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is currently running all negative ads, according to a study by the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But he has run a number of positive ads during the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind in the polls, McCain played the aggressor early and often.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He demanded to know the full extent of Obama's relationship with William Ayers, a 1960s-era terrorist, the Democrat's ties with ACORN, a liberal group accused of violating federal law as it seeks to register voters, and insisted Obama disavow last week's remarks by Rep. John Lewis, a Democrat, who accused the Republican ticket of playing racial politics along the same lines as segregationists of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Struggling to escape the political drag of an unpopular Republican incumbent, McCain also said, &quot;Sen. Obama, I am not President Bush. ... You wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama returned each volley, and brushed aside McCain's claim to full political independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I've occasionally mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people - on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities - you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's allegation that Obama had not leveled with the public involved the Democrat's decision to forgo public financing for his campaign in favor of raising his own funds. As a result, he has far outraised McCain, although the difference has been somewhat neutralized by an advantage the Republican National Committee holds over the Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He signed a piece of paper&quot; earlier in the campaign pledging to accept federal financing, McCain said. He added that Obama's campaign has spent more money than any since Watergate, a reference to President Richard Nixon's re-election, a campaign that later became synonymous with scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama made no immediate response to McCain's assertion about having signed a pledge to accept federal campaign funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about running mates, both presidential candidates said Democrat Joseph Biden was qualified to become president, although McCain qualified his judgment by adding the words &quot;in many respects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain passed up a chance to say his own running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, was qualified to sit in the Oval Office, though he praised her performance as governor. Obama sidestepped when asked, saying it was up to the voters to decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain used the opening moments of the debate to accuse Obama of waging class warfare by advocating tax increases designed to &quot;spread the wealth around.&quot; The Democrat denied it, and countered that he favors tax reductions for 95 percent of all Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody likes taxes,&quot; Obama said in an exchange early in the third and final debate of a campaign nearing its end. &quot;But ultimately we've got to pay for the core investments&quot; necessary for the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If nobody likes taxes, let's not raise anybody's, OK?&quot; McCain retorted with a laugh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOE THE PLUMBER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's allegation stemmed from one of Obama's campaign appearances last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ohio on Sunday, Obama was approached by one man who said, &quot;Your new tax plan's going to tax me more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A video clip caught by Fox News shows Obama replying, &quot;It's not that I want to punish your success. I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you, that they've got a chance at success, too. And I think that when we spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain referred repeatedly to that voter, Joe Wurzelbacher, a plumber from Toledo, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wurzelbacher watched Wednesday night's debate and said he still thinks Obama's plan would keep him from buying the small business that employs him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About McCain: &quot;He's got it right as far as I go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, Wurzelbacher declined to say who was getting his vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was surprised that he was called &quot;Joe the Plumber&quot; repeatedly during the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's pretty surreal, man, my name being mentioned in a presidential campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's reference to Ayers reprised campaign commercials he has run to try and raise doubts about Obama's fitness to serve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayers, who was a member of the violent Weather Underground in the 1960s, hosted a meet-the-candidate event for Obama in an Illinois race many years later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Sen. McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me,&quot; Obama replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men debated at a round table they shared with Bob Schieffer of CBS, the moderator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN THEIR OWN WORDS</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, we have allocated $750 billion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Facts went astray on tax cuts, negative campaign advertising and oil exports when Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain engaged Wednesday in their third and final presidential debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some examples:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE DEFICIT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: &quot;Every dollar that I've proposed, I've proposed an additional cut, so that it matches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts: The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that his programs would add $281 billion to the deficit at the end of his first term. The analysis includes Obama's proposals for saving money. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ENERGY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: &quot;We have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts: This is a reference to U.S. spending on oil imports. McCain has repeatedly made this claim. But the figure is highly inflated and misleading. According to government agencies that track energy imports, the United States spent $246 billion in 2007 for all imported crude oil, a majority of it coming from friendly nations including neighboring Canada and Mexico. An additional $82 billion was spent on imported refined petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel and fuel oil. A majority of the refined products come from refineries in such friendly countries as the Netherlands, Canada, the United Kingdom, Trinidad-Tobago and the Virgin Islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: &quot;One hundred percent, John, of your ads - 100 percent of them - have been negative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts: The statement is true when it comes to McCain's current commercial spots. But by saying McCain's ads &quot;have been&quot; 100 percent negative, Obama ventures into misleading territory. McCain is currently running all negative ads, according to a study by the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But he has run a number of positive ads during the campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: &quot;Sen. Obama is spending unprecedented amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts: Obama is spending unprecedented amounts of money on ads, period - negative or otherwise. Obama is outspending McCain and the Republican Party by more than 2-to-1 in presidential ads. At one point in August, 90 percent of the ads Obama was airing were against McCain. A study conducted at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that about 34 percent of Obama's ads are now negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAX CUT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama: &quot;I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts: Obama constantly says this. But the independent Tax Policy Center says his plan cuts taxes for 81.3 percent of all households in 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BIDEN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: Said of Obama's running mate Sen. Joe Biden: &quot;He had this cockamamie idea of dividing Iraq into three countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts: Biden actually proposed dividing Iraq into three semiautonomous regions, not separate countries. He was a prime sponsor of a nonbinding Senate resolution that called for Iraq to have federal regions under the control of Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis in a power-sharing agreement similar to the one that ended the 1990s war in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE BAILOUT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain: &quot;Now, we have allocated $750 billion. Let's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts: Ordering the government to buy up bad mortgages to cut homeowners' monthly payments might sound good, but experts are skeptical. They say the plan McCain is promoting is unlikely to solve the housing crisis that's pushing the economy toward recession. One big problem: The vast majority of the toxic home loans that are clogging financial markets and freezing up credit have been repackaged into complex investments that the government would be hard-pressed to unravel and buy. And the government could end up paying far more than they would ever be worth. That could primarily help banks and lenders with taxpayer money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN THEIR OWN WORDS</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week after endorsing Democrat Barack Obama for president, Christopher Buckley is leaving National Review, the conservative magazine founded more than 50 years ago by his father, William F. Buckley Jr. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Within hours of my endorsement appearing in The Daily Beast, it became clear that National Review had a serious problem on its hands,&quot; Buckley wrote in a blog at thedailybeast.com. &quot;So the next morning, I thought the only decent thing to do would be to offer to resign my column there. This offer was accepted - rather briskly!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minor-party presidential candidates finally will have their own debate: Sunday at 7 p.m. St. Louis time at Columbia University in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate will include independent Ralph Nader, the Green Party's Cynthia McKinney and the Constitution Party's Chuck Baldwin. Libertarian Party nominee Bob Barr said he had a scheduling conflict, but debate organizers say he wanted to appear only with Nader.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Iranian leader takes no offense at John McCain's jokingly turning the refrain of the song &quot;Barbara Ann&quot; into the phrase &quot;Bomb Iran.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporters have questioned McCain about it. Barack Obama has criticized him for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ali Larijani, Iran's parliamentary speaker and former chief nuclear negotiator, said Tuesday in response to a reporter's question in Geneva, &quot;We don't have any objection to them singing a song.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a real bomb, he said, would be no laughing matter. &quot;We are confident that if they make that mistake they will be awakened from their sleep and they will face a nightmare,&quot; Larijani said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama has become the first presidential candidate to buy ad space inside a video game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nine video games from Electronic Arts Inc., ranging from the extremely popular &quot;Madden '09&quot; football game to the street racing &quot;Burnout: Paradise,&quot; feature in-game ads from the Obama campaign.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community organization ACORN defended its voter registration practices amid new allegations of voter fraud and a call from Republican lawmakers to investigate irregularities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ohio, Barack Obama told reporters that the group's registration problems should not be used by the GOP as an excuse to keep voters from turning out on Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACORN has registered 1.3 million young people, minorities and poor and working-class voters, the group says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, 72, would be the oldest president to take office if elected in November. His campaign dismissed the petition (which has nearly 2,900 signatures) as a stunt and noted it's driven by a group with ties to the liberal Moveon.org.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview scheduled to air Monday night on ABC-TV's &quot;Nightline,&quot; Joe Biden said it was &quot;fair enough&quot; for Republicans to question Obama's relationship with 1960s antiwar radical Bill Ayers but attacked the way they did that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden suggested it would be OK if Republicans noted that Obama was only 8 years old when Ayers co-founded a violent radical group but said they objected to Obama's serving on a nonprofit organization board with him a quarter-century later. &quot;But to run an ad saying Barack Obama ... consorts with terrorists, and put this guy's picture up? Come on! That's over the top.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Briefly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Negative study: A study of all presidential ads in the largest 186 TV markets by the University of Wisconsin says that nearly every John McCain&nbsp;ad from Sept. 28-Oct. 4 was negative, compared with 34 percent of Barack Obama's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Support study: Congressional Quarterly says John McCain supported President George W. Bush in Senate votes 90 percent of the time during Bush's eight years in office, though the figure rose to 95 percent in the most recent year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Endorsement: Barack Obama received the endorsement Monday of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. The group is named after Jim Brady, the press secretary to former President Reagan, who was wounded by a gunman who tried to assassinate Reagan in 1981.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- McCain on Lewis: John McCain said that it was unfair for Rep. John Lewis to compare the negative tone of the Republican presidential campaign to the atmosphere a segregationist fostered in the 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Clinton report: Hillary Clinton is sending out press releases emphasizing that she is campaigning for Barack Obama. She was in Pennsylvania on the weekend and Monday. She also wants it known that by her count she has raised $10 million for the Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WILMINGTON, N.C. - John McCain, conceding he is behind in the presidential race, cast himself Monday as the fighter America needs to face its enemies abroad and to restore the economy at home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The national media has written us off,&quot; McCain told 2,500 people at Cape Fear Community College in Wilmington. &quot;Senator Obama is measuring the drapes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they forgot to let you decide. Friends, we got them just where we want them. What America needs in this hour is a fighter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's visit to Wilmington was his first public appearance in North Carolina in the general election - a state where his Democratic opponent, Barack Obama, has campaigned five times and sharply outspent him on advertising and staffing. Obama has aired a television ad specific to North Carolina, linking the closure of Carolina Mills factories in Maiden, N.C., to McCain's support for free-trade measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is being forced to play defense in North Carolina and in Virginia - two upper-tier Southern states that have been reliably Republican in recent presidential elections. McCain sent running mate Sarah Palin into North Carolina last week, and she is scheduled to return for a fundraiser in Greensboro, N.C., and possibly other events Thursday. Plans are being laid for McCain to attend a rally in Charlotte on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And after Monday's rally, McCain went to a residential area in Wilmington to film a campaign commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wilmington event drew an enthusiastic crowd that chanted &quot;U-S-A&quot; and &quot;McCain&quot; but did not include the personal insults about Obama that recently prompted McCain to defend his Democratic opponent. About a dozen Barack Obama supporters outside the event got into a brief shouting match after the rally with McCain supporters on the grass. Shouts of &quot;Nobama&quot; were matched by &quot;Yes We Can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain compared Obama with President Herbert Hoover, who was in office when the country went into the Great Depression in 1929. He said Obama's proposal to raises taxes would be the wrong remedy for an economy in decline. (Obama has said he would raise taxes only on those who make more than $250,000 per year and would reduce taxes on the middle class.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last president to raise taxes and restrict as Senator Obama proposes was Herbert Hoover,&quot; McCain said. &quot;They say that those who won't learn the lessons from history are doomed to repeat them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While casting Obama in the role of Hoover, McCain seemed to portraying himself as a sort of conservative Franklin Roosevelt. McCain said he had known fear and doubt - an allusion to his days as a POW in Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know what fear feels like,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Paul Cox, Obama's North Carolina spokesman, said McCain is the one who hasn't learned history's lesson - at least recent history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why does he continue to endorse the failed economic policies of George W. Bush?&quot; Cox asked. &quot;Folks are looking for answers and John McCain is not providing them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clean energy, green jobs are a big part of the answer to Missouri's job problem</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story &quot;Jobless rate here is higher than in U.S.; hard-hit manufacturing sector is a key&quot; (Oct. 1) noted that our local unemployment rate is higher than the national average. An economic crisis, driven in part by skyrocketing energy costs, is pummeling our labor force and raising serious questions about how we can get the economy moving again and put people back to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for all the recent attention to bailing out Wall Street, the real issue is how can we create jobs here in Missouri. How we can break our dependence on foreign oil, a dependence that has increased the cost of everything from a loaf of bread to a tank of gas, forced companies to lay off employees and sent billions of dollars overseas to oil-producing countries, pushing America deeper in debt? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the solution should be investing in clean-energy technology and creating green jobs. A major investment in clean-energy technologies such as wind and solar energy would create more than 43,000 jobs in Missouri, according to a recent study from the Center for American Progress. These are jobs for which people already are trained. For example, the Sheet Metal Workers' International Association, in cooperation with the Sheet Metal and Air-Conditioning Contractors National Association, has been training energy management technicians for more than 20 years. These members are proficient in auditing energy-using systems and indoor air quality in homes, schools, hospitals and businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investment in green jobs will benefit many other skilled tradesmen in Missouri and around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By investing in producing more energy here in America and increasing energy efficiency, we can break our dependence on foreign oil and create jobs here at home. That's a story that ought to be on the front page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Andrews | St. Louis Coordinator, St. Louis Sheet Metal Workers' JATC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing less than free and open debate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sylvester Brown is a good writer and I enjoy his columns, but I disagree with him about the seriousness of Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama's alleged abuse of Missouri law enforcement (&quot;Election cycle and spin cycle go hand in hand - on our dime,&quot; Sept. 5).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are the facts: On Sept. 23, KMOV-TV reported that two high-profile prosecutors were joining the Obama campaign's so-called &quot;Truth Squad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KMOV-TV's Russell Kinsaul reported that, &quot;The Obama campaign is asking Missouri law enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading TV ad,&quot; and reporter John Mills said, &quot;They also say they plan to respond immediately to any ads and statements that might violate Missouri ethics laws.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As soon as I saw this report, I issued a statement condemning the Obama campaign for using Missouri law enforcement to intimidate voters. I did so from my office because the issues are civic and public and not political in nature. It is fine to form a truth squad, but the group the Obama campaign has formed amounts to a police squad. If any campaign attempted to intimidate voters, I would condemn that campaign, including the McCain-Palin campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KMOV-TV's executive news director Sean McLaughlin defended the station's report in &quot;KMOV's report on Obama 'truth squad' stirs up controversy&quot; (Sept. 30). St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch claimed in a letter to the editor that the report was false.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will leave it to Mr. McCulloch and the station to settle the dispute. In the meantime, I will continue to speak out against any attempt to intimidate voters or chill free and open debate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am happy to hear that Wachovia Foundation is granting $2.5 million to the St. Louis Zoo for a new south entrance (&quot;Makeover at zoo's south gate to feature pedestrian bridge,&quot; Oct. 7), but is this not the same Wachovia that initially agreed to a Citigroup buyout for $2.1 billion, backed by the federal government, as a result of its bad debt ratio?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Something just does not seem right. But at least it is a bridge to somewhere.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illusion of reliability</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Premier Election Solutions, formerly Diebold, announced in August that its electronic voting machines had been losing votes, malfunctioning and providing erroneous counts in larger precincts for more than a decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These machines still are in place in St. Louis and Kansas City. The secretary of state has done nothing about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is appalling. I call on Secretary of State Robin Carnahan to decertify these machines immediately and do whatever she can to help these cities switch to optical-scan machines before the November presidential election.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than just transit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes to Proposition M&quot; (Oct. 5), an editorial supporting the Metro transit system, addressed urban and economic development issues but neglected to mention how support for the MetroLink affects environment and health issues in the St. Louis metro area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The looming service reductions not only would result in diminished riding opportunities for the general public, but also would exacerbate the gridlock in which commuters languish daily during rush hour. This is on top of the fact that the entire state was designated recently as being in &quot;non-attainment&quot; of the 24-hour fine particle National Ambient Air Quality Standard and that the never-ending construction on U.S. Highway 40/Interstate 64 basically ensures area-wide traffic congestion and road construction pollution. These factors make respiratory health and summer ozone conditions in St. Louis a greater cause for concern for even the healthiest among us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Support for MetroLink is crucial for the future prospects of an environmentally and economically sustainable St. Louis. Even if you could not care less about these incontrovertible warnings, the question remains: Who will St. Louis area residents blame when driving to work is too expensive and public transportation is a distant memory?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Anderson | St. Louis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's in that bill?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial &quot;Crazy distinctions&quot; (Oct. 5) said that the bailout included a provision that mental health must be covered by health care insurance to the same extent that physical health is covered. While this certainly is a worthwhile idea, what does it have to do with the financial bailout? What else is in this bill that the public doesn't know about and probably never will?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new law requires health insurance companies to include these costs in their programs. Who will pay for the consultations for all the drug addicts and alcoholics? You and I soon will see our health insurance costs increase because of this. We all will all feel the pinch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our investments have tanked, and our savings are worth less every time the Federal Reserve lowers the interest rate, and it's all because the younger generation wants everything whether it can afford it or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's OK to say, &quot;Don't worry, everything will be back to normal in five or six years,&quot; but how about us who are living on 401(k)s, savings and (God forbid) the stock market?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stop quibbling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our country would be far better off if the politicians would spend more time examining what is happening in our country instead of picking out excerpts from what was said by someone running for office from the opposite party and smearing that person's character or proposed policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By paying attention to what is going on, they just might be able to prevent a catastrophe like the credit crunch. This event developed over a long time, and should have been noticed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians must stop quibbling like a bunch of old hens and tell the voters specifically what they would do if elected.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;D&quot; and an &quot;F&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Am I the only one who remembers Congress holding hearings about steroid use in baseball, questioning Amtrak officials about dining car menus and querying airline executives about whether to offer a free ticket or a free meal if a plane sat on a runway for more than four hours?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, Congress asked oil company executives about why gasoline prices were rising. After that, Congress gave billions to Africa to fight AIDS and went home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If President George W. Bush gets a &quot;D&quot; on his report card, this Congress deserves an &quot;F.&quot; This is a failed Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawrence N. Thomas | St. Louis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't hold out, Mr. McCain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was an interesting exchange at the Oct. 7 presidential debate. Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, stated that he has a plan and will capture Osama bin Laden. This was a serious and unequivocal statement about possibly the biggest terrorist threat to the United States, and one that the Bush administration has relegated to an afterthought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have some serious questions. How long has McCain had this plan? Why has he not told anyone? He claims to be a close friend of Gen. David Patreaus, who becomes head of U.S. Central Command at the end of the this month. Is Mr. McCain going to keep us in suspense and tell us only if we elect him president?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, is this really the Straight Talk Express or a politician lying through his teeth to make political points?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBUS, Ohio - Barack Obama is playing it safe. Leading in polls with 25 days to Election Day, the Democratic nominee is offering careful proposals to address the economic crisis while letting allies respond to John McCain's sharpest charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama now reads his speeches from teleprompters, reducing the chance of gaffes. He has not held a news conference in two weeks, although he has done several one-on-one interviews with national and local reporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He now refers to Republican John McCain as &quot;my opponent&quot; more often than by name. And he offers carefully limited, comparatively noncontroversial remedies for the nation's financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publicly, Obama's aides say he keeps a calm demeanor and measured tone because he doesn't want to fuel the anguish and panic caused by the economic meltdown. Privately, they acknowledge there is no desire to shake up a campaign dynamic that is inching him closer to the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't like to yell,&quot; Obama told more than 10,000 people in Columbus on Friday, his fifth large rally in hotly contested Ohio in two days. He was referring to a sound-system glitch, but it could have been a metaphor for his home-stretch strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's responding just right, and the polls are reflecting it,&quot; said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who campaigned with Obama this week and helped lead the counterattacks against McCain. When GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin spoke in Ohio on Thursday, Brown said, she spent too much time on issues such as Obama's ties to Vietnam War-era radical William Ayers, now a college professor in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are saying, 'What about our jobs, what about the banking situation?'&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday as McCain rolled out a new TV ad with his sharpest language yet about Ayers, the sharpest Democratic response came from Obama's running mate, Joe Biden, who told an audience in Springfield, Mo., that McCain was trying to &quot;take the lowest road to the highest office in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAREFUL BALANCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is seeking a careful balance these days. He criticizes details of McCain's chief economic proposals, and he briefly and broadly disputes Republican attacks on his character, not getting into details. That seems to satisfy Democratic stalwarts who feel recent nominees were too slow to respond to character attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama devotes more time to explaining his own long-standing proposals for tax cuts and energy investments. On Friday, he added a temporary program of tax breaks, low-interest government and government-backed private loans for small businesses having trouble borrowing to meet payrolls, maintain inventories or expand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When this careful rhetoric threatened to bore crowds seeking rhetorical fireworks and when the economic problems turned into a crisis, he added more upbeat lines to his stump speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now is not the time for fear,&quot; Obama said at every Ohio stop this week. &quot;Now is the time for resolve and steady leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless asked, he does not mention McCain's and Palin's fiercest line of attack: that he has associated with Ayers, a former 1960s radical who helped found the violent Weather Underground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasingly, high-profile supporters take the sharper jabs at McCain before Obama comes on stage. On a sunny street with a few thousand people in Chillicothe, Ohio, on Friday, Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland played the part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The McCain-Palin campaign and some of their followers unfortunately want you to be afraid of Barack Obama,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;others&quot; had spread untruths about the nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama does not leave all the heavy lifting to surrogates. Referring to McCain and Palin, he told the Chillicothe audience, &quot;it's not hard to rile up a crowd by stoking anger and division.&quot; He said Americans wanted &quot;someone who can lead this country&quot; in a time of economic crisis, not divide it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that McCain advisers have said their candidate will lose if the campaign's focus stays on the economy, Obama said: &quot;So in the last couple of days, we've seen a barrage of nasty insinuations and attacks, and I'm sure we'll see much more over the next 25 days. We know what's coming. ... But it won't work.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is playing it safe on policy, too, avoiding the far-reaching proposals that have caused McCain headaches. McCain's call this week for the government to buy bad home-loan mortgages at full face value and renegotiate them at a reduced price set off loud protests from conservatives and liberals alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's proposals have been more limited. His proposal Friday to temporarily extend an expiring tax break that lets small businesses immediately write off investments would cover only investments up to $250,000. It would cost the Treasury $900 million, Obama aides said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden accuses McCain of taking 'lowest road'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden said Friday that Republican John McCain is trying to &quot;take the lowest road to the highest office in America,&quot; with ads and rhetoric questioning Barack Obama's character and judgment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every single false charge, every single baseless accusation is an attempt to stop you from paying attention to what is affecting your daily lives, to what is happening at your kitchen table,&quot; Biden said at a rally in Springfield, a Republican stronghold in Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political watchdog calls for inquiry over ads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A campaign watchdog group filed a complaint Friday with federal regulators against two groups, alleging they violated the law by airing political ads during the presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democracy 21 wants the Federal Election Commission to investigate the American Issues Project, which ran a $2.8 million ad campaign against Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama, and the American Leadership Project, a group that backed Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primaries and ran about $4.3 million in ads supporting her or against Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint argues that both groups violated the law by not operating as a political action committee, which would have restricted their fundraising to capped donations. The American Leadership Project was largely financed by unions that supported Clinton. The American Issues Project ad against Obama was paid for by Texas billionaire Harold Simmons, a McCain fundraiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both groups say they comply with federal requirements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for troubled mortgages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden said Thursday that Republican John McCain keeps switching responses to the economic crisis and now advocates a plan for troubled mortgages that would &quot;reward banks and lenders for their greedy behavior.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats have increasingly tried to paint McCain as lurching from one position to another in a bid to persuade voters that he would be capable as president of addressing the nation's economic woes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now he's gone to the point of actually wanting to reward banks and lenders for their greedy behavior,&quot; Biden said. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a steady hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has proposed to devote $300 billion - nearly half the recent financial rescue package passed by Congress - to buying troubled mortgages at face value from financial institutions. McCain promotes it as a way to help homeowners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waukesha, Wis. - Republican presidential candidate John McCain said Thursday that questions about Democratic rival Barack Obama's association with a former war protester linked to Vietnam-era bombings are part of a broader issue of honesty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his strongest personal criticism since his faltering campaign began casting Obama as an unknown and unacceptable candidate, McCain told supporters that Obama had not been truthful in describing his relationship with former radical William Ayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Loud cheers from 4,000 people gathered at a sports complex near Milwaukee greeted McCain's attacks over Ayers, who helped found the Weather Underground, a Vietnam protest group that bombed government buildings 40 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to know the full extent of the relationship,&quot; McCain said. Later, McCain told ABC News: &quot;It's a factor about Sen. Obama's candor and truthfulness with the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has denounced Ayers and his violent actions and views. He dismisses McCain's criticism as an effort to &quot;score cheap political points.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AP and other news organizations have reported that Obama and Ayers, now a college professor who lives in Obama's neighborhood, are not close but that they worked together on two nonprofit organizations from the mid-1990s to 2002. In addition, Ayers hosted a small meet-the-candidate event for Obama in 1995 as he first ran for the state Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser, says that Obama, who was a child living in Indonesia and Hawaii in the late 1960s and early 1970s, was not aware of Ayers' radical past at the time of that campaign event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To press its argument, the McCain campaign also released a 90-second Internet ad about Obama and Ayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama and domestic terrorist Bill Ayers. Friends. They've worked together for years,&quot; the ad says. The ad also claimed that one of the nonprofits on which Obama and Ayers worked was a radical education foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That educational foundation was The Annenberg Challenge; it was funded by the Annenberg Foundation, a charity set up by longtime Republican backer and newspaper publisher Walter Annenberg. Annenberg has since died, but his wife has endorsed McCain this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden said Thursday that Republican John McCain keeps switching responses to the economic crisis and now advocates a plan for troubled mortgages that would &quot;reward banks and lenders for their greedy behavior.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats have increasingly tried to paint McCain as lurching from one position to another in a bid to persuade voters that he would be capable as president of addressing the nation's economic woes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now he's gone to the point of actually wanting to reward banks and lenders for their greedy behavior,&quot; Biden said. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a steady hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPRINGFIELD Mo.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice presidential candidate Joe Biden asserted Friday that Republican John McCain's campaign is trying to distract voters from the nation's financial woes by attacking Democrat Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every single false charge, every single baseless accusation is an attempt to stop you from paying attention to what is affecting your daily lives, to what is happening at your kitchen table,&quot; Biden said at a campaign rally in Springfield, a traditional Republican stronghold in the swing state of Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign launched a TV ad Friday that raises questions about Obama's ties to an anti-Vietnam war radical. The ad states: &quot;When convenient, he worked with terrorist Bill Ayers. When discovered, he lied.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad follows up on McCain's criticisms of Obama while speaking at a town hall forum in Wisconsin. McCain said Thursday that Obama hasn't been transparent in explaining links to Ayers and told ABC News that &quot;it's a factor about Sen. Obama's candor and truthfulness with the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin has been even more blunt. She has accused Obama of &quot;palling around with terrorists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayers is a Chicago college professor who helped found the violent Weather Underground in 1969. The group is blamed for bombing government buildings in the early 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and Ayers live in the same Chicago neighborhood and worked together on two nonprofit organization boards from the mid-1990s to 2002. Ayers also hosted a meet-the-candidate event for Obama in 1995 as he first ran for the Illinois state Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden on Friday never specifically mentioned Ayers or the new ad. But he said McCain is trying to avoid dealing with the nation's financial woes and is instead trying to &quot;take the lowest road to the highest office in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for McCain's campaign said questions should be asked about Obama's connections to Ayers and the group Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. Election officials in several states have accused ACORN of submitting false or duplicative voter registrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama continues to demonstrate through his relationships with Ayers, ACORN and others that he lacks the judgment and credibility we need in a president,&quot; spokeswoman Wendy Riemann said. &quot;It's time Barack Obama was honest with the American people about these relationships.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden urged voters to force the presidential campaign to focus on the economy, health care and other issues that directly affect their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent polls show McCain and Obama are running about even in Missouri, which has voted for the presidential winner in every election but one over the last century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attendees at the rally said that they have become increasingly worried about the nation's economy. Springfield resident Kenny Knauer, who said he's been a Democrat since Missouri picked Adlai Stevenson instead of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower in 1956, said that it really doesn't matter what Obama and McCain plan on doing unless they first fix the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't solve any other kinds of problems until you solve that,&quot; said Knauer, who has been working with local Democrats to put up campaign sings and canvass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's financial problems have been felt in Missouri, where the unemployment rate is at its highest mark in 17 years. Many of those lost jobs have been in the manufacturing sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Biden spoke in Missouri, the stock market continued a weeklong slide. The Dow Jones industrials lost 128 points, while the Nasdaq composite index posted a modest gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden spoke on a sunny but windy day from a temporary stage erected in a city park near a minor league baseball stadium. The speech ended Biden's two-day swing through four Missouri cities, located in counties that supported President Bush in 2004. Springfield is the home of GOP Gov. Matt Blunt, and the southwest corner of the state has historically been Republican territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden committed a gaffe while introducing Springfield Democrats at the start of his Friday remarks. He referred to state Rep. Charlie Norr as &quot;Claire.&quot; During a previous visit to Missouri, he asked state Sen. Chuck Graham to &quot;stand up&quot; before noticing the lawmaker's wheelchair.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no clear winner in Tuesday night's presidential debate, but there were clear losers: America's undecided voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was their one chance to see Sen. John McCain and Sen. Barack Obama onstage together interacting directly with voters and spontaneously answering the questions of ordinary citizens. Instead, they heard mostly a rehash of stump speeches and claims and counter-claims already repeated ad nauseum on the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Billed as a town-hall-style debate, the event's stilted format yielded few memorable or illuminative moments. Scared-stiff audience members read their questions from note cards after those questions were screened and selected by moderator and former NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw. Brokaw inserted many of his own piercingly personal, straight-from-the-heartland queries, such as &quot;Who do you have in mind for Treasury secretary?&quot; and &quot;Would you give Congress a date certain to reform Social Security and Medicare within two years after you take office?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of a free-wheeling, wide-ranging debate in which the candidates engaged directly with voters on a broad spectrum of issues, the gathering featured canned discussion of only a few topics, mostly confined to wonkish exchanges on economic and foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate was the latest in a series of disappointments this electoral season. There were the early &quot;Jeopardy&quot;-style primary debates, in which a slew of candidates competed to see who could squeeze the most headline-grabbing phrases into 60-second sound-bites. Then there was the overhyped CNN/YouTube Republican debate, which fell short of its populist billing when it became clear that CNN staffers had picked the questions and turned the &quot;people's debate&quot; into a forum for Democratic partisans. The late-season primary debates between Sen. Hillary Clinton and Obama were punchier and more revealing, and Gov. Sarah Palin's outside-the-Beltway persona enlivened the recent vice-presidential debate, making it the second most-watched debate in history. But Tuesday's presidential debate marked a return to the disappointing status quo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moderators have been a big part of the problem, but the presidential campaigns also share the blame. They negotiated the straitjacket rules that have made direct engagement and rebuttal so scarce in these stage-managed, contrived affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a consequence, American voters miss out. We miss the chance to see the candidates offer unrehearsed responses to deeper questions about their governing philosophy, life experiences and personal values, including the cultural and character issues so often dismissed as a distraction by Beltway moderators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missing from our superficial debates are such questions as: What does this candidate think is the role of government in a citizen's life? Does he see government as the answer to our problems or as the problem itself? Does he worry, as I do, about our coarsened popular culture, the disintegration of our families, the violence on our streets and protecting the innocence of our children? Does he have a plan for bringing our country together amid such deep partisan divisions? What is that plan, and does his record show that he could carry it out? What does he believe is the root cause of the terrorist threat America faces today? Does he see the world the way I do? Can I trust him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we elect a president, we're not just choosing a set of policies; we're choosing the person we want to see on TV screens for the next four years, the person we want waking up to that 3 a.m. emergency call to respond to a national crisis, the person we want imposing his political will and values on government and, by extension, on our nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Choosing a president is a little like choosing a spouse, albeit for a shorter-term commitment: We'll be stuck with this person after Jan. 20, so we want someone we can live with long after the debates have ended, the ballots have been cast and counted and the hard work of governing has begun.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, Palin question Obama's record</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans John McCain and Sarah Palin questioned on Wednesday whether Barack Obama's record matched his rhetoric as they sought to sow doubt about the Democratic presidential candidate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's not willing to drill for energy, but he's sure willing to drill for votes,&quot; Palin said, eliciting cheers of &quot;Drill, baby, drill&quot; from the crowd, which often interrupted the candidates during their joint appearance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's remarks about Obama were interrupted with shouts of &quot;socialist,&quot; &quot;terrorist&quot; and &quot;liar.&quot; At another time, a man in the bleaches shouted &quot;No more ACORN,&quot; referring to a group that registers poor voters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN's national poll of debate watchers found that 54 percent said Obama did the best job, compared with 30 percent who said McCain performed better. While 51 percent of those polled said they had a favorable opinion of McCain, unchanged from before the debate started, 64 percent said they had a favorable opinion of Obama, up 4 percentage points from before the debate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has raised about $3.3 million from contributors who did not list a home state or who designated their state with an abbreviation that did not match one of the 50 states or U.S. territories, according to records provided by the Federal Election Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of those contributors idenitifed themselves as living in foreign cities. Under federal law, foreign citizens cannot make political contributions, but U.S. citizens living abroad can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission on Monday asking for an investigation of Obama's foreign contributions, among other things.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutor clears the air about 'truth squad' reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent report on KMOV-TV completely distorted what I and others said about potential campaign ads. We said that if ads were false, we would say so. Period. The statement immediately morphed into something sinister, starting with KMOV's lead-in to the story and continuing through recent letters to the editor with stops along the way at various blogs and radio talk shows. To clear the record, let me state unequivocally:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russell Kinsaul of KMOV-TV said in his lead-in, &quot;The Obama campaign is asking Missouri law enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading TV ad.&quot; That is absolutely false.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matt Drudge and Rush Limbaugh said (by way of Gateway Pundit), &quot;[Bob McCulloch and St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce] are threatening to bring criminal libel charges against anyone who levels what turns out to be false criticisms of their chosen candidate for president.&quot; That is absolutely false, and never mind that there is no such animal as criminal libel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Matt Blunt said, &quot;What Obama and his helpers are doing is ... abusing the justice system and offices of public trust to silence political criticism with threats of prosecution and criminal punishment.&quot; Absolutely false.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local radio hosts continue to spread these falsehoods without checking the facts or asking for clarification from me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither I nor any other person made any of the above statements, nor did I or any other person say anything from which a responsible journalist could infer that we said or even intended the above. The mere fact that my statement of &quot;... if they're not going to tell the truth then somebody's got to step up and say, 'wait a minute that's not true' ...&quot; becomes &quot;... threatened to file criminal libel charges&quot; clearly demonstrates the need for someone to step up and call out those who intentionally distort or ignore the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For 25 years as an assistant prosecuting attorney and the prosecuting attorney, I have worked diligently to protect the freedoms of all people in our community. I always have done my very best to earn and retain the trust of the people of St. Louis County and the metropolitan area I serve. I never have been, nor will I ever be, afraid or hesitant to stand up and speak out on issues important to the people of my community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the letter writers and their cohorts - Mr. Blunt, Mr. Drudge and Mr. Limbaugh, et al - must realize is that they are not the only people in this country who enjoy the freedoms and rights of the First Amendment. The rights apply to all people, including me.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unions, high wages go hand in hand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article &quot;Group seeks more minorities on construction jobs&quot; (Oct. 1) noted the Missouri Department of Transportation's success in placing minorities on construction jobs on the U.S. Highway 40/Interstate I-64 project. What the article failed to note is that a report published the same day by the Transportation Equity Network found that construction wages in St. Louis, controlled for the cost of living, are the highest in the nation. St. Louis also has highest rate of unionization in construction in the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, by the University of Missouri-St. Louis' Public Policy Research Center, found that unionization is highly correlated with construction wages. Construction jobs offer great opportunities for disadvantaged individuals who have not gone to college - especially if they can get into a union apprenticeship training program in St. Louis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Z. Dwight Billingsly's column &quot;This is no time for na&iuml;vete and immaturity&quot; (Oct. 2) reads as it it were a joke - a tragic joke. From the headline, I thought it was about Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the Republican vice presidential candidate. But no. The thrust was that Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, showed incredible courage to pick Ms. Palin as his running mate. Mr. Billingsly does not mention issues, causes or facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some issues he missed: The occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan, the deregulation that caused the economy to tank, the &quot;war on terror&quot; that is nothing but a money pit for Vice President Dick Cheney's cronies and the CIA that was operating better before all the Sept. 11, 2001-related changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was despicable that Mr. Billingsly was branding Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee for president, as na&iuml;ve when Mr. Billingsly defines courage as approving of death and watching the Bill of Rights, the economy and our respect in world go down the toilet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Jung Echols | St. Louis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No more deregulation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain's health care plan would give a $5,000 tax credit to American families to spend on health insurance and tax employer-provided health care as income to employees. This tax would cause employers to cut employer-provided health care and leave Americans searching for private policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My husband and I are students who work part-time. We had to find independent health insurance. We couldn't afford the policy offered by my university. We found health insurance through a national company for $220 a month. We have dental coverage, but we couldn't afford maternity insurance now. We pay $15 a month for generic medicine, but if we require a prescription for which a generic is not available, our insurance pays about $3 on a $60 prescription. The company that provides our health care does not provide vision insurance. We spent $600 on our eye exams and contacts this spring. We pay $25 co-pays on office visits. We do our best not to get sick. Our yearly expenses for just our health insurance coverage, for two healthy 20-somethings, is $2,640.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, a woman in our family died unexpectedly. She had worked part-time and provided health insurance for her husband, a farmer. When she died, her employer offered to continue the husband's coverage at $440 a month. That's $5,280 per year for one person. Mr. McCain's $2,500 tax credit wouldn't even cover that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deregulation has proven to be a failure on Wall Street; I can't imagine the effects it will have on health care.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three legs of culpability</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indoor sport du jour seems to be assigning blame for the current economic crisis. In my view, blame for the financial morass rests squarely on the support of a three-legged stool of culpability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first leg, of course, is the financial institutions that created investment instruments out of thin air, assigned them a value and marketed them to a legion of greedy suckers. Their motivation was short-term gain with no regard for predictable future damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second leg is the U.S. government that failed to write rules and assign referees to govern and control this economic free-for-all. Was something sinister going on here, or were our public servants simply blinded by the illusion of prosperity?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third leg of culpability in the financial disaster is the person in the mirror. We have become a society addicted to easy credit. We have buried our noses in the free-lunch trough for so long that we have come to believe in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, here we are. What do we do now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't bail out the people who created the toxic financial game; we should throw them out. The financial system must be saved, but the people who gamed the system must be gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We insist on rules and enforcement mechanisms necessary to mete out swift and appropriate punishment to any future transgressors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we take stock of ourselves and the naievete that led us to believe in and demand a free lunch. In the final analysis, our financial institutions and government are a reflection of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David A. Baetz | Innsbrook</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serving their own</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Brooks is correct in saying that American leadership is scarcer than credit (&quot;A leadership crisis makes things even worse,&quot; Oct. 1). Unfortunately, however, he misses the primary cause of the crisis: the failure of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to lead. Ms. Pelosi and her associates have been so thoroughly engulfed in hatred for President George W. Bush that crucial issues of the American people have been ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Pelosi and U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., have been incompetent. They insisted that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were doing fine - right up to the point of near-failure of both institutions. They accepted political donations from these institutions and pressured banks to approve loans to people who had neither jobs nor money to pay the mortgage. Mr. Frank should resign in disgrace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our representatives in Washington need to start representing the people, not serving their own needs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ASHEVILLE, N.C. - Barack Obama's allies warn that John McCain's attacks on the Democrat's character will lead to the political equivalent of mutual assured destruction: Fire your big weapon at your own peril. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Obama surrogates said his supporters may start reminding voters of McCain's ties to Charles Keating, a convicted savings and loan owner whose actions two decades ago triggered a Senate ethics investigation that involved McCain as one of the &quot;Keating Five.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warnings of massive retaliation came as McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, took on the role of attacker and said that Obama sees America as so imperfect &quot;that he's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country.&quot; She was referring to an early Obama supporter, 1960s radical Bill Ayers, a founder of the Weather Underground whose members were blamed for several bombings when Obama was a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has denounced Ayer's radical views and activities. But he's not above questioning McCain's character with loaded words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, Obama unveiled a TV ad on the economy that paints McCain was &quot;erratic in a crisis.&quot; Some see that as a reminder of McCain's age, 72.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also alluded to harsher tactics in a speech Sunday to thousands of people in Asheville, N.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and his aides, Obama said, &quot;are gambling that he can distract you with smears rather than talk to you about substance. They'd rather try to tear our campaign down than lift this country up. It's what you do when you're out of touch, out of ideas and running out of time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has denounced Ayers' radical views and activities. Ayers hosted a small gathering for Obama in 1995. Obama and Ayers live in the same Chicago neighborhood and served on a charity board together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just months into his Senate career, in the late 1980s, McCain made what he has called &quot;the worst mistake of my life.&quot; He participated in two meetings with banking regulators on behalf of Keating, a friend, campaign contributor and S&amp;L financier who was later convicted of securities fraud. The Senate ethics committee investigated five senators' relationships with Keating. It faulted McCain for &quot;poor judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the new Obama&nbsp;ad, an announcer says: &quot;Our financial system in turmoil. And John McCain? Erratic in a crisis. Out of touch on the economy.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad, slated to start running today on national cable, alludes to McCain's response to the nation's financial crisis. He briefly suspended his campaign, called for a White House summit meeting that ended chaotically and showed varying degrees of support for the massive rescue bill Congress passed Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin repeats claim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in Burlingame, Calif., Palin defended her claim that Barack Obama &quot;pals around with terrorists,&quot; saying the Democratic presidential nominee's association with a 1960s radical is an issue that is &quot;fair to talk about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin launched the attack Saturday and repeated it Sunday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like a reliable Maytag, politicians are known for spinning the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Matt Blunt recently wrote an opinion piece schooling the Springfield News-Leader on &quot;free speech,&quot; &quot;constitutional rights and the integrity of law enforcement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Great principles but, it turns out, a tad off-topic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blunt's letter appeared the same day (and in the same newspaper) as an editorial accusing him of using taxpayer dollars to release press statements that support the Republican presidential ticket. Describing Blunt as a &quot;political assassin,&quot; the editorial charged the governor with &quot;stinking up his Web site with partisanship and propaganda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ouch!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To comprehend all this, let's analyze the cycle of spin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sept. 23, KMOV (Channel 4) reported that Barack Obama was getting help from local prosecutors to clarify misleading TV ads. Obama's Missouri &quot;Truth Squad,&quot; the report said, included U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch and Jefferson County Sheriff Glenn Boyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans, both locally and nationally, hit the roof. Obama enlisted prosecutors to intimidate voters and squelch free speech, they claimed. Conservative pundit Rush Limbaugh's website reported that the Truth Squad threatened &quot;to prosecute anti-Obama speech.&quot; The state GOP campaign accused Obama's campaign of creating a &quot;police state in the Show-Me state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outrage seemed feigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the primaries, both Obama and McCain have employed such tactics to counter negative attacks. McCain has enlisted the aid of powerful Republican officials to serve on his Truth Squads, including New Hampshire's attorney general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the KMOV report, no Democrat interviewed said anything about using prosecutorial power on Obama's behalf. McCulloch and Joyce explained that their goal is only to get truthful information to voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jefferson County's Sheriff Boyer was infuriated by insinuations that he'd arrest voters for their political views. The Vietnam veteran said the accusations were nothing but &quot;spin for political purposes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even KMOV's John Mills, who reported the story, said the GOP twisted his report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heaven forbid a little thing like &quot;truth&quot; get in the way of a juicy allegation that might fire up the base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after the firestorm, Blunt issued a statement on the state's website accusing Obama, McCaskill, Joyce, Boyer and McCulloch of &quot;abusing the justice system ... to silence political criticism with threats of prosecution and criminal punishment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nine days after the KMOV report aired and the accusations had been largely refuted, Blunt still maintained that the Democrats used &quot;the language of enforcement&quot; and attached the &quot;stench of a police state to Missouri's civic life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his News-Leader op-ed piece, the governor said the newspaper ignored &quot;the assault on free speech.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's give the governor the benefit of the doubt. The Obama campaign did in fact stress the involvement of prosecutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justin Hamilton, spokesman for Obama's Missouri campaign, explained: &quot;We reached out to respected members of the community who would donate their personal time to help keep the campaign focused on the issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, when introducing the KMOV report, an anchor said, &quot;The Barack Obama campaign is asking Missouri law enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading TV ad during the presidential campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems naive for a governor, but Blunt did write that he based his statement on &quot;news reports&quot; that &quot;exposed&quot; Obama's plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But didn't he in fact commit the very same infraction he's putting on his political opponents - blending politics and a public office? Blunt used the state website to name Democratic names and support a word war launched by his party. Taxpayer dollars support government offices, including websites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blunt's statements were &quot;fact-driven,&quot; Rich Chrismer, Blunt's spokesman, countered in response to my questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In his op-ed, the governor goes into detail about why he condemned the actions of the Obama campaign because the issues are civic and public and not political in nature,&quot; Chrismer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sounds like a little dual-action spin to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surely, there's a rule prohibiting an elected official from using his power and office for partisan favors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't give you an accurate answer to that question,&quot; said Stacey Heislen, interim executive director of the Missouri Ethics Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heislen said she couldn't recall any similar violations investigated by the commission. And even if she could, she'd be hesitant to discuss them - it might influence someone interested in filing a claim on the matter, she explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I followed Heislen's advice and called the Missouri attorney general's office. One would think that the attorney general, Jay Nixon, a Democrat running for governor, would have something to say on this issue. But a representative declined to address the subject. It should fall under the purview of the Missouri Ethics Commission, he told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David C. Kimball, associate professor of political science at UMSL, chuckled when I told him about my runaround for a definitive answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimball said he was no ethics lawyer, but he couldn't recall any hard-and-fast rules. He did, however, seem to find a measure of delight in Blunt's position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's certainly a high amount of irony in the governor using his letterhead to accuse others of interjecting partisanship into their official duties, isn't it? Unfortunately, irony is lost on politicians, particularly during election times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elected officials, be they Democrat or Republican, play partisan games. The only real recourse is voting offending politicos out of office, Kimball said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I still think there ought to be a rule banning partisan politicking on the taxpayers' dime and time but, hey, what do I know? I'm just a voter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I guess on Election Day, we'll see how Blunt's Maytag worked. We'll also see if the stains of politics have permanently set.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Biden won Thursday night's vice presidential debate at Washington University, according to two national polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A CBS News/Knowledge Networks survey of 500 uncommitted voters taken after the debate reported that 46 percent thought Biden won, while 21 percent gave Republican Sarah Palin the victory. A separate CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey reported similar views, with 51 percent saying Biden did better, to 36 percent favoring Palin. The CNN survey reported that 87 percent thought the Delaware senator was qualified to be president, while 42 percent saw Palin that way. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President George W. Bush made a short stop in St. Louis County on Friday to help raise $1.5 million for fellow Republican Kenny Hulshof, one of several signs that the national GOP is paying closer attention to the state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican National Committee Chairman Robert M. &quot;Mike&quot; Duncan also was in the area Friday to attend the fundraiser and to encourage volunteers at the party's joint campaign headquarters in Maryland Heights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Missouri is a target state,&quot; Duncan said in a brief telephone interview. &quot;You're going to see an RNC presence here until Election Day. We're doing very well here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He discounted recent polls, including several for the Post-Dispatch, that show Hulshof trailing Democratic opponent Jay Nixon and Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama about even against Republican John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts and many activists in both major parties say McCain must carry Missouri to win the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign indicated as much earlier this week, when leaders announced that his campaign was withdrawing workers, money and ads from Michigan and shifting them to a handful of other key states, including Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of last week, Obama was outspending McCain by a huge margin for TV ads in Missouri. The latest figures by TNSMI-Campaign Media Analysis Group, a nonpartisan firm monitoring TV ad spending for the Post-Dispatch, showed Obama spending at least $369,035 on ads airing in Missouri last week, compared with $115,752 for McCain. The Republican was running ads only in St. Louis and Kansas City, while Obama's ads were airing statewide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan said he was heartened by the thousands who turned out Thursday night for a rally featuring Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin at St. Louis University's Chaifetz Arena. The rally followed Palin's 90-minute debate with the Democratic running mate, Joe Biden, at Washington University. Duncan said the rally turnout underscored his confidence that Missouri will go for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people of Missouri match up with the values of the McCain-Palin ticket,&quot; Duncan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri Democratics disagree. On Friday, the party and labor launched the first of several events in the coming days aimed at highlighting the plight of area workers who have lost jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're shipping our jobs to Canada, and we've heard nothing from the Bush administration,&quot; said Joe Shields, president of United Auto Workers Local 110. Shields expects to lose his job soon as a result of Chrysler's decision to curb production at one Fenton plant and close another by Oct. 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hulshof was accompanying Bush on Air Force One. Hulshof spokesman Scott Baker said the congressman was thrilled to get the president's help, but noted that the two had their differences. Earlier Friday, Hulshof had voted against the $700 billion bailout package for financial institutions that Bush had supported.</SPAN></P>

The sooner this election is over, the sooner we can all get back to watching videos of kittens. But in the meantime, let's enjoy this clip from &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; parodying the Sept. 26 debate between John McCain (Darrell Hammond) and Barack Obama (Fred Armisen). o Why are these people crying? We're not sure what this commercial is selling, but these people are worked up about something - quite possibly about being charged $2 per minute. o &quot;You're No One If You're Not On Twitter&quot;: This guy's just gonna call it out - Twitter is where it's at. If you're not Twittering, you should start. (Shameless plug: twitter.com/GoSTL) o &quot;Web Therapy&quot;: We love Lisa Kudrow. But what's she been doing since &quot;Friends&quot;?

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Truth squad blurs lines between personal belief, professional duties</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats, Republicans and independents alike should be concerned that the Obama campaign launched a truth squad, composed in part of Sen. Claire McCaskill, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce and St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch, which plans to challenge those people who allegedly say anything erroneous about Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee for president (&quot;KMOV's report on Obama 'truth squad' stirs up controversy,&quot; Sept. 30).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A truth squad like this dangerously blurs the lines between the personal beliefs and professional obligations of elected officials, further complicated because some &quot;truths&quot; are subjective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a television interview, Mr. McCulloch shrugged off concerns, saying it was unlikely that anyone would be prosecuted. That makes the issue of a crusading partisan squad no less serious. Its ultimate effect is to dampen free speech, engender distrust of neighbors and frighten the general population, which isn't in a position to sort through the technicalities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Matt Blunt, talk show host Rush Limbaugh and the Drudge Report have raised concerns about affect of these tactics on freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there should be a necessity for a truth squad, it should be bipartisan and composed of people from a range of disciplines and experiences, such as political scientists, ethicists, religious leaders and educators without ties to one party or campaign. If anything, we need to encourage more people to talk openly and freely, not less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joan Lipkin | St. Louis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Censure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope that the Post-Dispatch upholds our constitutional right of freedom of speech by censuring the threats of the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney and the St. Louis circuit attorney to challenge advertisements that mischaracterize Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee for president. This is outrageous!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Will | St. Charles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters decide</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish the St. Louis Democratic &quot;truth squad&quot; would spend some time rooting out voter fraud, rather than trying to determine if a candidate's ad is truthful or not. Aren't the voters suppose to decide who is telling the truth - at the polls?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don Pixley | Ballwin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intent of letter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No super sound bites - and no knockout blow either&quot; (Sept. 27), an analysis of the first presidential debate, included Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain's story about General Dwight D. Eisenhower's supposed draft letter of resignation to be used in case the Normandy invasion did not succeed. Mr. McCain used it as &quot;an effective way to bring up the issue of responsibility in Washington.&quot; Effective, perhaps, but also historically inaccurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a former archivist at the Eisenhower Presidential Library, I have seen the actual &quot;in case of failure message.&quot; You can see it, too, on the library's website. After lauding the bravery and devotion to duty of the troops, Eisenhower did take responsibility: &quot;If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone.&quot; But there was no mention of any intention to resign. He would have, I surmise, seen resignation as a shirking of his responsibility to continue what he called the Great Crusade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the first time Mr. McCain has used this story. Why, if it was going to be used in major speeches and the debate, was this story not fact-checked? Is he more interested in &quot;effect&quot; than &quot;truth&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karen Holzhausen | New Melle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better representation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the economic bailout: Why are banks not to be held responsible for managing their own liquidity? How can it be that the taxpayer has the responsibility to attempt restoration of banks' capacity to borrow or lend to each other? The notion that banks' refusal or inability to lend or borrow has created the calamity we face is ludicrous. What self-respecting company needs to borrow to make current payroll or stock the shelves? Where do profits go if not to fund continuing operations?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is apparent to ordinary Americans that massive fraud must be involved to create such a rapidly deteriorating financial crisis, and before any bailout is approved, the crooks, legislators included, should be identified, prosecuted and jailed. We deserve better representation from our elected officials and more honest operations from the management of our banks and other companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clyde Bollinger | Festus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better ideas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people are against the bailout because the public has better ideas. The philosophy of smaller government, less regulation and diminished oversight cannot be sustained. The people in charge cannot be trusted. Left to their own devices, they will find a way to line their own pockets and those of the politicians who enable their greed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the mortgage debacle, we can form a new temporary department. The government could purchase bad loans and renegotiate them at reasonable rates and terms. All loans 60 or more days in arrears would be transferred. All foreclosure proceedings would be frozen. This would keep owners in their homes at payments they could afford. It would free up money for spending and stabilize neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The banks who made the bad choices would suffer losses, as they should. They would become smaller, but with good assets and cash flow and capable of making new, ethical loans. The &quot;spread&quot; should be regulated, and lending institutions should pass along decreases in the prime rate instead of using them for higher profits. That way the &quot;Fed&quot; truly can have an impact on the availability and cost of credit and stimulate the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To restore trust in the system, everyone involved should be investigated and any wrongdoing should be prosecuted. Corporate reform is needed, too. Wages and benefits for the highest positions should be limited to 50 times that of the lowest-paid employee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wealth needs to be spread down - all the way down. No one believes in anything &quot;trickling down&quot; anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Byington | Spanish Lake</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someone else's money</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears that the $700 billion fleecing of the good ol' taxpayer soon will be passed. It is a sad time in our country when the many people who caused this problem - from borrowers to lenders to government hacks - are not taken to the woodshed for punishment. Instead, we're getting this bailout shoved down our throats to reward more failures of business and government, which is supposed to look out for our interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only thing that the government did well in the last 100 years was to win World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What bailout is next? You know there will be another one because it is easy to spend someone else's money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fred Daly | St. Charles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrong man for the job</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is the wrong man for the job. How can he possibly be qualified to get us out of this mess? Either he was not smart enough to see the problems coming or he was smart enough but chose to allow the problems to continue. There have been warnings from others for at least two years about the crisis. If he didn't see it coming, why would we think he suddenly has become smart enough to figure out how to get us out of the mess?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he did see it coming and allowed it continue, was it because he and his friends would benefit personally while he kept telling us the economy and our finances were stable and strong? If this is the case, how could we possibly trust him to suddenly do the right thing now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Ann Ford | Florissant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intestinal fortitude</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our government's $700 billion boondoggle is financially unsound, but the alterative is a depression. Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., said, &quot;This is the bottom line: If we do not do this, the trauma, the chaos and the disruption to everyday Americans' lives will be overwhelming, and that is a price we cannot afford to risk paying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At age 85, I read his statement to mean that baby boomers and their children who have enjoyed the eras of materialism and self-indulgence the past 50 years of prosperity simply don't have the psychological stamina and intestinal fortitude to endure the suffering and hardship I saw handled by my parents' generation during the Great Depression. Only we over 75 can recall those horrors; no book or movie can come close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action indicates that our nation is on the edge of financial and social collapse, and no one wants to admit it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article &quot;VP presidential face-offs have produced memorable moments&quot; (Sept. 29) was a great read. I hope the debate produces what's been long overdue this election season: a detailed and serious discussion of public education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A meaningful discussion about our nation's public schools is even more important now that we're grappling with the financial crisis. As the economy continues its downward spiral, states will be tempted to decrease their investment in public schools, and local schools will feel the woes of Wall Street when parents, teachers and students need real solutions for fixing our public schools, not just stale debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've seen how White House and congressional emphasis on one-size-fits-all, high-stakes standardized tests has stigmatized students and sapped the enthusiasm of many educators who never envisioned teaching would become more about test-taking strategies than the actual subjects our students need to know. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A discussion about the federal role for education and how the bailout plans will affect our nation's public schools may not produce the memorable moments the media craves, but they're something parents and teachers deserve to hear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Guinther | Jefferson City President, Missouri National Education Association</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stay on track</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have read or heard this week that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the Republican vice presidential candidate, is being urged to use the vice presidential debate time as a 90-minute negative ad against Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fine enough, but we already know how she and the Republican Party feel about the Democrats. What we need is to hear her views, her opinions, her take on the vice presidency, her experience.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Know before you go</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial &quot;Bracing for Election Day&quot; (Sept. 29) reminded voters that they can help speed the polling place process by being sure that their name and address, if either has changed, are correct on the voter list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voting process also will go faster if voters have read and decided how to vote on the many propositions before they get to the polling place. I hope the Post-Dispatch will print all the ballot information and also have articles discussing the propositions well before Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, people should watch for the postcard from the Election Board that should arrive a few days before the election. As a poll worker, I hate to tell a person five minutes before the polls close that he is at the wrong polling site. You have to be at the right place to vote. So check those cards. If one didn't come, call the Election Board before Election Day. You can even use that postcard as your required identification when checking in at your polling place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it will be a very busy day, with informed voters and poll workers, the election process should go smoothly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need ballot issue info</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national election coverage by the Post-Dispatch does a good job of providing information about both parties running for president and vice president. However, those of us who have chosen to vote absentee in the upcoming election need to decide soon on more than the next president and vice president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The November ballot has a number of issues that will have people spending a great deal of time reading. The issues as written on the ballot are topics about which we are not reading in the newspaper. People will walk away from the polls wondering why judges and bonds didn't get the same coverage as national issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When are we going to hear about the upcoming bond issues that will affect taxes in the region? Many of these bonds would have a long-term affects on the city. When are we going to hear about the judges up for retention? Those judges will affect Missouri voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must start getting information on the ballot issues in Missouri.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prevention education</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For many kids, violence trumps learning&quot; (Sept. 12), an online follow-up to &quot;The ABC's of violence&quot; (March 9), was another example of the growing need to incorporate prevention education into our schools. Every day our children are faced with an extremely violent world, and not all are lucky to have caring parents to help them navigate it safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that a study from Washington University shows a correlation between children witnessing violence and having difficulties in school, we must work together to give our kids the tools to handle this. With access to a solid prevention education, any child can learn how to not only keep themselves safe, but also how to make his or her world a safer place, which benefits us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Educating our children about how to handle life situations such as bullying, anger and discrimination is key to healthy development. When children have the knowledge and confidence to deal peacefully with these situations, they can enjoy a safer and happier childhood, which will lay the foundation to help them grow into healthy, productive adults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are agencies and groups in St. Louis dedicated to bringing this education to our kids. Nonprofits such as Progressive Youth Connection have been delivering violence prevention education to local schools for more than 36 years. Unfortunately, these programs are not widespread or available to many of our youth. We owe it to our children and our community to give our kids the chance for a bright, happy future. Prevention starts now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uninsurables</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain's health insurance plan may force people with pre-existing illnesses to purchase Missouri Health Insurance Pool health insurance. If one is accepted, the monthly payments for MHIP insurance are close to $1,000 per person per month at age 63 and close to $585 per person per month at age 43. Many people with pre-existing illnesses are underemployed. Those with mental illnesses often are not employed. Other states have similar &quot;bargains&quot; for those who are refused by private insurers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Missouri, if a person with a mental illness in his medical records called a leading health insurance company, he would be told immediately that, &quot;We won't insure anyone with a mental illness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain is not aware that between MHIP and employer-provided insurance lies a no man's land for &quot;uninsurables,&quot; those with any pre-existing illness, mental or physical. Mr. McCain, with his pre-existing diagnosis of cancer, probably could not get insurance in Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a long-time registered nurse, I know that no health insurance leads to no preventive medical care, followed by poor health and more emergency room visits and finally to the taxpayer, who picks up the tab for those with no health insurance. Mr. McCain's plan is lacking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reckless abandon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recently had to sell my house to relocate for family reasons, and it cost me the equity from two previous homes, my 401(k), my personal savings and my pension to cover my negative equity position. I pleaded with my mortgage company to consider an equitable adjustment, not a bailout. It seemed that our interests were aligned. But I was treated poorly and rudely. Ultimately, I honored my obligation with nothing but lip service from a mortgage company that suggested I find a charity to help with food so that I could devote more income to covering my mortgage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, our interests are closely aligned again. But, this time, I am being asked to loan money to cover the very same assets that the banks are causing to be non-performing because of their own belligerence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These financial institutions have acted with reckless abandon and have done this country a tremendous disservice. While I recognize that our interests are aligned, I suggest that the management at the financial institutions that would become the custodians of this mammoth expenditure either are unwilling to behave in a constructive manner or are incapable of pursuing a less modest but honest return on their investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps I lack objectivity because I have been so affected, but maybe, just maybe, I havea perspective that recognizes that entrusting assets that amount to national treasure to this existing group of petulant adolescents that managed the collection of financial companies into crisis is worse than wasteful and would serve only to enable further misguided behavior by these management teams.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expecting an 80 percent voter turnout for the November election, Missouri officials say they've been working long hours to ensure that the election runs smoothly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hotly contested presidential race between Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama is likely to spawn charges of voter fraud and voter intimidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both political parties will have observers at the polling places. &quot;We are going to do everything we can to ensure it is a fair election,&quot; said Tina Hervey, spokeswoman for the Missouri Republican Party. Hervey said the party plans to have poll watchers at the sites &quot;that have had a history of fraud occurring. &quot; She declined to say where those sites are and how many poll watchers the party will send out. Messages left for Obama campaign workers were not returned by press time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be prepared for voter challenges, Missouri Secretary of State Robin Carnahan announced Tuesday morning that $2 million in grant funding is available for local election officials to hire additional poll workers. That includes $500,000 for student poll workers, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carnahan was speaking at a news conference held at the St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners in downtown St. Louis. With her were Carol A. Wilson, chairwoman of the St. Louis election board, and John Fox Arnold, chairman of the St. Louis County election board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri is used to close elections, Carnahan said, adding that she welcomes the additional scrutiny by the campaigns. &quot;We want to make sure that they understand the laws in Missouri, and the best way to do that is to make sure poll workers are well-trained,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Election officials are still recruiting poll workers. Carnahan said she wants to have about 7,000 more poll workers at the polling places on Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you don't have enough poll workers there, and they're not well-trained, you're going to have chaos, and you're going to have long lines whenever there is an issue,&quot; Carnahan's spokeswoman,&quot; Laura Egerdal, said in a telephone interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long lines may be inevitable due to the record turnout expected, but the idea is to enable some poll workers to help voters resolve their issues while allowing the lines to move forward, according to Carnahan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arnold said he expects long lines to be a problem in the county, and he pointed out that Missouri law says everyone in line when the polls close at 7 p.m. has the right to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson said the city election board is on track to getting 2,100 poll workers, and Arnold said the county board expects to have 5,400 poll workers, including 100 workers to handle the technical issues that arise. Currently, about 208,000 voters are registered in the city and 670,000 in the county. Voter registrations are still coming in for both jurisdictions. Wilson said the city board will remain open until 7 p.m. next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anticipated voter turnout is roughly 500,000 more than voted in the 2004 election, when 65 percent of registered voters participated, Carnahan said. About 230,000 new voter reg-istration forms have been processed, she said, although it's unclear how many of those are first-time voters and how many are name or address changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To guard against potential voter-registration challenges at the polls, Carnahan urged voters to verify that they are registered to vote before the Oct. 8 voter registration deadline. Missouri residents can look up that information on the secretary of state's Web site, www.sos.mo.gov. Voters who get tagged as not registered by the &quot;Voter Information Lookup&quot; should follow up with phone call to their local election officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(When I input my name and address to test the Lookup, the system said that I am not a registered voter in the city of St. Louis. My local election workers, however, checked the database and reassured me that, yes, I am properly registered. The secretary of state's office later figured out that city election workers typed my street's directional prefix in the street name field.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it can't pull you up, it's just because the software doesn't like your address or the way you typed in your name. That's why it says to call,&quot; Egerdal said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rumors have been circulating that voters who lose their homes through foreclosure will face challenges to their right to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;that's not the law in Missouri,&quot; Carnahan said. In Missouri, people vote where they live, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carnahan's office plans to get the word out about who's eligible to vote. Egerdal said in a follow-up e-mail that the law allows voters who move within the voting jurisdiction to make ad-dress changes on Election Day and to vote either at a central location or at the polling place for the new address. Voters who move to another voting jurisdiction before the Oct. 8 deadline are to complete a new voter registration application. Those who move to another jurisdiction after Oct. 8 may vote absentee for federal and statewide races by contacting their local election authorities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A local television station's coverage of a Missouri campaign &quot;truth squad&quot; working on behalf of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama has touched off a national Internet frenzy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two prominent political websites - the conservative &quot;Drudge Report&quot; and the liberal &quot;Daily Kos&quot; - are battling over the purpose of the squad, which is among dozens that Obama and Republican rival John McCain have set up in various states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some conservative groups also are distributing video of the report that KMOV-TV (Channel 4) aired last week. And commentator Rush Limbaugh is talking about it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has prompted all the furor is that several members of Obama's &quot;truth squad&quot; in Missouri are prosecutors or members of law enforcement. They include St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce, Jefferson County Sheriff Glenn Boyer and St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch. All are Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joyce and McCulloch are featured in a KMOV report by John Mills, in which both say their aim was to refute any false information spread about Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when KMOV anchor Russell Kinsaul introduced the report, he said: &quot;The Barack Obama campaign is asking Missouri law enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading TV ad during the presidential campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That comment seems to have sparked the controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Matt Blunt, a Republican, accused the Obama camp of planning &quot;to use Missouri law enforcement to threaten and intimidate his critics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blunt sent out a statement from his office in which he decried what he called &quot;the stench of police-state tactics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor repeated those accusations on national TV news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican National Committee Deputy Chairman Frank Donatelli held a conference call over the weekend to call for the law enforcement officials to step down. And conservative blogs have accused the Democratic Party of trying to intimidate voters and squelch free speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats contend that the squad is being mischaracterized. They note that several of McCain's &quot;truth squads&quot; in other states, including New Hampshire, include Republican officials with prosecutorial powers, including the state's attorney general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(McCain's watchdog groups in Missouri don't have any law enforcement officials, a GOP spokeswoman said.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joyce said in a statement over the weekend that &quot;my sole purpose in participating in this initiative is about getting truthful information to the voters. This has never been or never will be about prosecuting people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri Obama communications director Debbie Mesloh says the accusations are &quot;the height of absurdity&quot; and reflect a Republican effort &quot;to deceive voters about the role of respected Missourians across the state who want to see this election be about the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCulloch, who could not be reached for comment Monday, told a local television station that critics have &quot;very sinister motives.&quot; McCulloch has been a prominent political player this year. In the Democratic contest for attorney general this summer, he narrated a TV ad on behalf of state Sen. Chris Koster that is widely credited with aiding Koster's narrow primary victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KMOV executive news director Sean McLaughlin defended his station's report and emphasized that &quot;nothing in the story said anything about prosecution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McLaughlin said the report was &quot;misinterpreted,&quot; perhaps because the public isn't used to seeing law enforcement officials talk politics in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The furor prompted Mills, the KMOV reporter, to post a follow-up on the station's website in which he discounted the Republican critics' claims and noted that McCain has truth squads, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McLaughlin attributes the uproar to politics, and recent polls showing a neck-and-neck contest in Missouri between Obama and McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're a significant state in an important election,&quot; said McLaughlin. &quot;That's probably what's driving it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The upside for the station: a huge surge in traffic to its website.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the meltdown of the American financial system dominating news reports, another long-running crisis continues unchecked, squeezing American businesses and workers as never before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation reported that family health insurance coverage provided by an employer now costs an average of $12,680 a year. The foundation's authoritative report, based on a nationally representative survey of employers, found coverage for a single worker costs an average of $4,704 a year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As recently as 2000, the average cost of family coverage was $6,348, while the cost of covering a single employee was $2,424.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growth in the cost of health insurance premiums slowed this year to just 5 percent. Such good news may, in turn, slow the trend of businesses discontinuing employee health benefits. But the reduced rate of growth is the result of companies shifting an increasing proportion of insurance costs to their workers, who in many cases are even less able to afford them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Workers will pay an average of $3,354 in premiums for family coverage this year. That's more than double the $1,543 they paid as recently as 1999. And that doesn't even count higher deductibles, co-insurance fees and co-pays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With workers' incomes stagnating as food and energy costs soar, more American families are being torpedoed by medical costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nonpartisan Center for Studying Health System Change reported last week that one in five American families - 57 million people, most of them in families that have insurance coverage - had problems paying medical bills last year. That's up from 15 percent in a 2003 survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than half of these families said they had to borrow money to meet their medical expenses. About 20 percent said they considered declaring bankruptcy because of their difficulties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the Kaiser report, the center's findings were based on a national survey, and both were completed before the recent turmoil in American financial markets. Today, the impact of medical bills on families could be even more severe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's becoming increasingly clear that the American health care system as currently organized - wasteful, inefficient and poorly designed - is unsustainable. The solution isn't more money; it's a completely redesigned system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health care reform has been a hot topic in political campaigns at all levels over the past year. Both Republican Sen. John McCain and Democratic Sen. Barack Obama have offered different reform plans, although neither of them calls for the fundamental transformation that many experts believe is needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the debate continues, so does the squeeze on families and businesses. And the casualties, both commercial and personal, continue to mount.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flexing its political muscle, Congress insisted on a package that gives lawmakers a stronger hand in controlling the money than President George W. Bush's administration had wanted. The rescue plan casts Washington's long shadow over Wall Street, with the federal government taking over huge amounts of devalued assets from beleaguered financial firms in exchange for more oversight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the plan, lawmakers could block half the money and force the president to jump through some hoops before using it all. The government could get at $250 billion immediately, $100 billion more if the president certified it was necessary and the last $350 billion with a separate certification - and subject to a congressional resolution of disapproval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the resolution could be vetoed by the president, meaning it would take extra-large congressional majorities to stop it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal is designed to end a vicious downward spiral that has battered all levels of the economy, in which hundreds of billions of dollars in investments based on mortgages gone bad have cramped banks' willingness to lend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawmakers had to navigate between angry voters - many of whom view the plan as a rescue package for the wealthy on Wall Street - and Bush administration officials who warned that inaction would cause the economy to seize up and spiral into recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negotiators sought Sunday to iron out the final shape of the legislation, which House Republicans still had to review. It was their fierce opposition to a federal rescue that nearly torpedoed an emerging bipartisan pact late in the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But officials in both parties hoped for a House vote today, and the two presidential candidates said they probably would support it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the bottom line: If we do not do this, the trauma, the chaos and the disruption to everyday Americans' lives will be overwhelming, and that's a price we can't afford to risk paying,&quot; Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the chief Senate Republican in the talks, said Sunday. &quot;I do think we'll be able to pass it, and it will be a bipartisan vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A breakthrough came when Democrats agreed to incorporate a GOP demand - letting the government insure some bad home loans rather than buy them - designed to limit the amount of federal money used in the rescue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another important bargain, vital to attracting support from centrist Democrats and Republicans who are fiscal hawks, would require that the government, after five years, submit a plan to Congress on how to recoup any losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential nominees came behind the outlines of the bailout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is something that all of us will swallow hard and go forward with,&quot; said Sen. John McCain, D-Ariz. &quot;The option of doing nothing is simply not an acceptable option.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Democratic rival, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, sought credit for taxpayer safeguards added to the initial proposal from the Bush administration. &quot;I was pushing very hard and involved in shaping those provisions,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Republicans said they were still reviewing the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not ready to say that a deal is done,&quot; said Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressional leaders announced a tentative deal in the early hours of Sunday morning after lengthy negotiations at the Capitol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've still got more to do to finalize it, but I think we're there,&quot; said Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who also participated in the negotiations at the Capitol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executives whose companies benefit from the rescue could not get &quot;golden parachutes&quot; and would see their pay packages limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government would receive stock warrants in return for the bailout relief, giving taxpayers a chance to share in financial companies' future profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To help struggling homeowners, the plan requires the government to try renegotiating the bad mortgages it acquires with the aim of lowering borrowers' monthly payments so they can keep their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody got everything they wanted,&quot; said Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. He predicted it would pass, though not by a large majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gregg said he thought taxpayers would come out as financial winners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think we're going to lose money, myself. We may, it's possible, but I doubt it in the long run,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifics of the plan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- A $700 billion taxpayer rescue of Wall Street, with $250 billion available immediately, another $100 billion upon report to Congress and the final $350 billion available only upon action by Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money would be used to buy mortgage-backed securities and other troubled assets from investment banks, commercial banks, smaller community banks, pension plans and even local governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Government could use its power as the owner of the troubled mortgage bonds to facilitate modifications for the mortgages themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bipartisan oversight commission would monitor the program. If after five years there was a net loss to taxpayers, the president would have to submit legislative proposals to recoup funds from beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Democrats won new, unspecified restrictions on CEO pay and executive compensations for participating companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans won language creating a parallel insurance program that companies could choose instead of giving up their bad assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Creation of warrants, which would allow any windfall coming to participating companies to be shared with the government, thus the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Actions by the Treasury would be posted online in real time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Judicial review of the Treasury's actions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President George W. Bush will be returning to Missouri next week to help raise money for the Republican nominee for governor, U.S. Rep. Kenny Hulshof, R-Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's visit will be Friday, the day after the vice presidential debate at Washington University between Republican Sarah Palin and Democrat Joe Biden. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hulshof's private fundraiser is to be at Hunter Farms, an estate in St. Louis County owned by Stephen and Kimmy Brauer and a favorite site for GOP events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush's stop is among several signs that the GOP is paying attention to the state's tightening contests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign of Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain is &quot;upping the number&quot; of paid workers in Missouri, said Republican National Committee deputy chairman Frank Donatelli during a campaign stop Friday in St. Peters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donatelli said the additional staff reflected stronger fundraising for the GOP and its presidential ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've gone from a Cadillac to a Rolls Royce. We had a good plan. We're top of the line now,'' Donatelli said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest poll for the Post-Dispatch/KMOV-TV shows a dead heat in Missouri between McCain and the Democratic nominee, Sen. Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll of 800 likely voters, conducted Monday through Wednesday, showed 47 percent supported McCain, compared to 46 percent for Obama. The rest were undecided or supporting one of three minority-party candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll also showed that Hulshof trailed his Democratic rival, Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon, by nine percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donatelli played down the poll results, as did Obama state spokesman Justin Hamilton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Hamilton said that the Obama operation has had a much larger field operation in Missouri than McCain for some time. &quot;We think you definitely have to be in the state to win it,'' Hamilton said. &quot;We've always been under the impression that this is a very competitive race in Missouri.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign ad spending in Missouri has been almost twice that of McCain for the past two weeks, according to a nonpartisan ad-tracking firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TNSMI-Campaign Media Analysis Group, which is monitoring ad buys for the Post-Dispatch, reported Friday that Obama has spent at least $703,000 over the past two weeks for 2,646 ad spots aired on urban and rural TV stations around the state. In contrast, McCain spent $348,000 for 828 ads - which were airing only on St. Louis and Kansas City stations, the firm said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall this year, Obama has spent at least $5.3 million to air TV ads in Missouri, compared to $4.6 million for McCain, the ad firm's figures show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has 40 field offices in the state, and at least 100 paid workers in the state. The campaign says it intends to knock on 100,000 doors today in a statewide effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign and the state GOP are sharing 10 offices around the states, and jointly have close to 40 paid workers, a spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Tim Townsend ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">METRO; Pg. C1</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A radio ad for Sen. John McCain trumpeting the Republican presidential candidate's support for stem cell research is upsetting some conservative Christians he recently won over by choosing one of their own - Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin - as a running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain &quot;is running the risk of alienating the people (he's) just pulled into the fold,&quot; said Glynn Young, an anti-abortion conservative from Kirkwood. &quot;I'm mystified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Memories of a narrow-but-devastating 2006 defeat in the battle over state constitutional protection of embryonic stem cell research still are fresh in the minds of Young and other conservative evangelicals and Catholics in Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the new stem cell ads, McCain is tapping into ethical nuances Missouri voters are more familiar with than other voters, said Larry Weber, executive director of the Missouri Catholic Conference. &quot;I think he does this at some risk,&quot; Weber said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one-minute ad - which also is airing in Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - never uses the word &quot;embryonic,&quot; but the term &quot;stem cell research&quot; comes up four times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain has been a champion of stem cell research and does not hide from his record,&quot; Wendy Riemann, a spokeswoman for the McCain campaign, wrote in an e-mail message to the Post-Dispatch. &quot;Stem cell research offers tremendous hope for those that are suffering, however, John McCain feels the compassion to relieve suffering and to cure deadly disease should not erode moral and ethical principles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proponents of the research say that because embryonic stem cells can grow into any tissue, they hold the promise of cures for a variety of diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who oppose the research on moral grounds say that because human embryos are destroyed when extracting the stem cells, the process is akin to abortion. They promote so-called adult stem cell research, which does not involve the destruction of embryos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most scientists say adult stem cell research does not hold the same promise as embryonic stem cell research. However, some scientists recently have attempted to circumvent the moral issue posed by embryonic stem cell research, including Harvard researchers who on Thursday announced a possible alternative that would not involve destroying human embryos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stem cell research, to unlock the mystery of cancer, diabetes, heart disease,&quot; says a narrator in the McCain&nbsp;ad. &quot;Stem cell research to help free families from the fear and devastation of illness. Stem cell research to help doctors repair spinal cord damage, knee injuries, serious burns. Stem cell research to help stroke victims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin, said the ad was &quot;designed to confuse voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that because the ad does not designate what kind of research is being discussed, it would remind champions of embryonic stem cell research of McCain's support for the science, and suggest to its critics that McCain is leaning toward continuing President George W. Bush's current policy of opposing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helen Hitchcock, director of the St. Louis Catholic organization Women for Faith &amp; Family, said the ad is confusing. &quot;Particularly in the context of controversy in Missouri over funding embryonic stem cell research, it is most unfortunate that in this ad no distinction is made,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2001, Bush announced that federal funds would pay only for studies on stem cell lines already in existence. Scientists have said those lines have become tainted and unusable for research. Last June, Bush vetoed legislation, for the second year in a row, that would have expanded the use of federal funding for the research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both McCain and Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential candidate, have said they favor relaxing Bush's restrictions on federal funds for the research. But while Obama also favors abortion rights, McCain has a long record of opposing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain also opposed embryonic stem cell research until 2001, when he changed his mind, saying he had &quot;looked at the issue more carefully&quot; and that he had been &quot;educated&quot; on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riemann said the genesis of the ad was a speech by Sen. Joe Biden, the Democratic vice presidential candidate, in a Mehlville gymnasium on Sept. 9. Biden referenced Palin's pledge to advocate for disabled children if elected to the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, guess what folks?&quot; Biden said. &quot;If you care about it, why don't you support stem cell research?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days later, nine St. Louis radio stations began airing the McCain&nbsp;ad. Voters in 16 markets across the country, including Kansas City, began hearing the ad at the same time. The McCain campaign would not say if the ad was airing elsewhere in Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, radio stations in Florida, Missouri, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin received a stem cell ad from the Obama campaign, including multiple stations in St. Louis and Kansas City, but none in between.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like McCain's, Obama's&nbsp;ad does not mention the word &quot;embryonic,&quot; and it claims the research could &quot;unlock&quot; cures for diabetes, cancer and other diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama's&nbsp;ad says McCain &quot;has stood in the way&quot; and &quot;opposed&quot; stem cell research. That claim has been called misleading in the mainstream press and by the McCain campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The appeal of the McCain-Palin ticket crosses party lines and has Barack Obama so scared that he is lying about John McCain's record on stem cells,&quot; Riemann said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A press release put out by McCain's campaign this week refuting the Obama&nbsp;ad heralded McCain's voting record and quoted letters the senator has written and signed in favor of embryonic stem cell research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain, as early as this year, has indicated he's open to changing his position on stem cell research,&quot; Justin Hamilton, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, said referring to meetings McCain has had in the past year with opponents of embryonic stem cell research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That embryonic stem cell research is even being debated in this presidential campaign at all is surprising given that McCain's position is more similar to his opponent's than it is to his own party's 2008 platform, which bans all embryonic stem cell research, public and private.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the four politicians atop the major party tickets, only Palin has consistently opposed embryonic stem cell research. In the 2006 Alaska gubernatorial debate, Palin said, &quot;Stem cell research would ultimately end in the destruction of life. I couldn't support it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several denominations in Missouri joined hands against the 2006 ballot proposal to amend the state constitution to protect all forms of embryonic stem cell research allowable under federal law. The coalition almost pulled off an upset against the well-financed supporters of the research, and the battle scars from that fight have not healed. Some of those who took part in the Amendment 2 fight believe the McCain campaign has misunderstood the depth of anger over the issue among conservative Christians in Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why is he talking about this here when it's been such a hot-button issue?&quot; asked Cynthia Haehnel, an attorney who assisted the Archdiocese of St. Louis during the Amendment 2 battle and who called the ad &quot;upsetting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luke Bobo, executive board president of the Center for Bioethics and Culture Missouri, said McCain's strategy to air the ads here is &quot;risky, quite insensitive and shows a general lack of knowledge of issues here in Missouri.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all opponents of embryonic stem cell research in the state thought the McCain ads were a mistake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would caution everyone from over-reacting just because the words 'stem cell' were used,&quot; said Kerry Messer, a lobbyist for the Missouri Baptist Convention. &quot;There's no issue here other than you can be sure Obama's followers will use this as a wedge issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As kids start a new school year, we know that many of them are learning to be productive citizens. But far too many will drop out before getting diplomas. As police chief, I know that this makes the job of law enforcement harder; there is a clear link between high school graduation and the likelihood that a person will commit violent crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High school dropouts are three and a half times more likely than graduates to be arrested and eight times more likely to be incarcerated. The anti-crime group Fight Crime: Invest in Kids Illinois recently released a report showing that increasing graduation rates by just 10 percentage points would prevent 150 murders and 8,100 aggravated assaults every year in Illinois.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, we know what will help boost graduation rates. Getting kids started on the right track early in quality preschool programs makes them more likely to graduate and less likely to end up in our jails. A study of the High/Scope Perry Preschool program in Michigan showed that at-risk kids who participated were 44 percent more likely to graduate, compared to those who did not attend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to reach kids early. Giving them the skills to succeed in school will make our streets safer in the long run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Col. Richard E. Miller | Granite City Chief of Police, Granite City Police Department</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Playing with our future</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Missouri board seeks big boost in funding for higher education&quot; (Sept. 16): Missourians need to speak up and tell the Legislature to stop playing politics with our future. Being ranked 47th in the United States in state appropriations per capita is an embarrassment. The one thing that can be said about the track record of funding of education in our state is that we are consistent: consistently bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too many times have Missourians or the Legislature used the magic wand of &quot;formulas&quot; to calculate school appropriations. We have many excuses for not funding our schools and universities. Some of the excuses could be racial, religious or vouchers, taxes (I no longer have children in the schools or universities), it doesn't benefit me, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we have to understand is that if we do not invest in our intellectual future, we will have nothing. Having a strong educational system from First Steps through the university level is paramount to Missouri's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allowing individuals to become certified to become an educator in Missouri by taking a few online courses indicates the priority of education in our state. Would we allow this for a someone who wanted to become a lawyer or engineer?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question we should ask is not &quot;what high school did you attend?&quot; but &quot;from what university did you graduate?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voting progressive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After eight years of President George W. Bush and widespread disillusionment with Republican governance, Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama's inability to significantly outpace Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain in the election is probably because of his skin color. Sad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone likes to say he's progressive, but when it comes down to it, many white people won't vote for a black man, not even a man with a far greater intellect and vision than his run-of-the-mill Republican opponent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heartless, uncaring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Palin's town charged rape victims for medical exams&quot; (Sept. 12): Wasilla Police Chief Charlie Fannon and his department should attend a victim awareness program so that they may be enlightened as to how a raped or sexually assaulted person feels. It is bad enough that the crime happened, but to be worried about how to pay for the test to confirm you were assaulted is beyond the pale. This is ridiculous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being raped probably is the worst crime that can happen to a person. It is degrading and disgusting. The victim feels violated, dirty, scared and embarrassed. How heartless and uncaring Alaska was to treat victims like this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was a rape victim, and I would love to talk with Republican vice presidential candidate Alaska Gov. and former Wasilla Mayor Sarah Palin, who allowed the practice to continue, about this anytime, anywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol Burton | DeSoto</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just a good-ole-boy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding Ellen Goodman's column &quot;Flash: All women do not think alike&quot; (Sept. 19): Many women will recognize the scenario. The Republican Party is desperate to camouflage the dysfunction of its last eight years of administration. The good-ole-boys of the Republican Party have set their sights on their prey. And women are the target. They bagged a good-ole-boy girl. You don't have to be a hunter to understand the lingo; it is all too familiar: Atta-boy-girl!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Living their dream</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems the lady liberals have their pantsuits in a knot over the rise of Republican vice presidential candidate Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to national prominence. They just can't seem to stand it that someone other than a liberal feminist has a chance to crack the &quot;glass ceiling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They show in their put-downs of Ms. Palin their hypocrisy and their angst that a conservative Republican is living their dream. The nerve of that woman!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too bad, so sad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Anselm | Florissant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shutting it down</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not a big surprise that the Post-Dispatch came out in support of the very, very misleading bill that just passed the House of Representatives regarding offshore drilling (&quot;A hiccup in time,&quot; Sept. 18). The bill supposedly allows expansion of offshore drilling when, in truth, it shuts it down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nuts and bolts are this: Drilling within 50 miles of the coast is banned. In the Gulf of Mexico, this is where the majority of the drilling is done. Between 50 and 100 miles, where there is a good amount done in the Gulf, an adjacent state can block drilling. More than 100 miles offshore, where there is only a smattering of drilling done in the Gulf, drilling would be allowed. The idea and effect here is to kill any real move to increase offshore drilling.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting terrorism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent poll found that the issues of most concern to voters were the economy, terrorism and health care. It's amazing that the cause of all these problems was not mentioned. The Iraq war, which is an ill-advised attempt to steal another country's oil, not only is responsible for our economic problems, including lack of funding for health care and for repair of our infrastructure, but it also has nurtured the growth of terrorism from local fringe movements to a world-wide &quot;holy war&quot; against Western civilization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is time we bring our troops home and concentrate on our internal national issues. We can fight the war on terrorism in ways much better than direct military action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William A. Joern | Sunset Hills</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No reward</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of these financial institutions that are being taken over or are struggling remind me of what I learned about the Great Depression. I am surprised at the apparent lack of action by the Bush administration. Last week, President George W. Bush passed up a fund-raising event to deal with the situation. A little too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's not reward the executives of these corporations by allowing them to have their bonuses and a pat on the back. If I made bad judgments at my job, I would be fired and, I guarantee you, I would not be rewarded with a bonus check. Let's get real. Someone needs to be made accountable, and it should not be the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan McGauley | Fenton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want it back</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to R.J. Matson, who actually made me laugh out loud on Sept. 17 with his look at the Wall Street ticker tape. That's a tall order after the big collapse of this economic house of cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the image that popped into my head: A man, with an IRA statement in his hand, yelling toward Wall Street from the window of his second-story flat in Brooklyn (and paraphrasing the TV commercial): &quot;IT'S MY MONEY, AND I WANT IT BACK!&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Missourians begin absentee voting this week, leading up to the Nov. 4 general election, they'll notice something different with the ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time in a presidential election, Missouri voters no longer can simply check or punch one box to vote for all candidates in their preferred party all the way down the ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Known as &quot;straight-ticket voting,&quot; the vote-once-vote-for-all option had been standard in Missouri for decades until the Legislature outlawed it in 2006. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Warren, a political science professor at St. Louis University who has studied the effects of the straight-ticket option, says there's no doubt that its abolition will be noticed in Missouri's election-night tallies this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's going to take a lot more time for people to vote,&quot; Warren said. &quot;Some will simply quit and go home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some political activists in both major parties also privately agree that the lack of the straight-ticket option this fall could shorten the coattails of the two major-party candidates for president, Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The upshot: The party with the victorious presidential candidate might not see its down-ballot candidates benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, a little history:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 2,765,067 ballots cast in Missouri in the last presidential contest in November 2004, almost half - at least 1,101,488, according to an incomplete tally - used the straight-ticket box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The partisan breakdown of those ballots: roughly 54 percent Democrat, 46 percent Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the straight-ticket option has been credited with presidential coattails (Republican Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992), 2004 was the first year state officials kept records on its use. That also was the year when prominent Republicans began publicly calling for its elimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. John Loudon, R-Ballwin, was among the leaders of that drive. Among other things, he asserted that the straight-ticket voting option had become a particularly powerful political tool for Democrats in St. Louis County, the state's largest bloc of swing votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roughly 60 percent (172,520) of the county voters who favored Democrats in the 2004 presidential election cast straight-ticket ballots. That compared to about 45 percent (111,343) of the county voters who cast pro-Republican ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Legislature outlawed the straight-ticket voting option in 2006, a move widely seen as an attempt to hurt down-ballot Democratic candidates in a pro-Democratic year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban didn't appear to harm the victorious Democrats at the top of the 2006 statewide ballot: now-U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill and now-state Auditor Susan Montee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, there was noticeable voter drop-off: 66,000 Missouri voters cast a vote for U.S. Senate, but not for state auditor. The decline continued farther down the ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, with polls now showing a slight edge in Missouri for McCain, there's talk that the lack of a straight-ticket option will hurt the GOP candidate for governor, U.S. Rep. Kenny Hulshof, who continues to trail his Democratic opponent, Attorney General Jay Nixon, in recent polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hulshof spokesman Scott Baker disagrees, saying that the lack of a straight-ticket option on the ballot could help Hulshof peel off Democratic voters. &quot;Kenny got a number of crossover votes in 2006,&quot; Baker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Democratic Party spokesman Zac Wright sees no impact. &quot;Regardless of the layout of the ballot, people are hungry for positive change,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SLU professor Warren, for one, predicts that the voter drop-off could be dramatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question is: Which down-ballot races do they ignore?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of political futures will hinge on the answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China on their minds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For weeks, Obama has been hammering McCain in Missouri with a TV ad that ties McCain to the outsourcing of U.S. jobs to China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Nixon has followed suit with an ad that hits Hulshof over congressional votes deemed pro-China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state Democratic Party points to the loss of at least 45,400 Missouri jobs to China since 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hulshof spokesman Baker countered that China is Missouri's fourth-largest export market, and asserted that Nixon is putting at risk $9.6 billion in related economic activity in the St. Louis area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon spokesman Oren Shur said the issue is the loss of Missouri jobs to what he calls unfair trade deals Hulshof backed in Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such attacks on trade with China could collide with the local bipartisan effort to persuade that nation to consider Lambert-St. Louis International Airport for a cargo hub to transport goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But until Nov. 4, expect China to continue to be a popular political target.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; Pg. B2</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">718 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ides of September 2008 someday may be recalled as the time when the American economy faced its greatest challenge since the stock market crash of 1929 ushered in the Great Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's response will test us in ways that 9/11 hasn't, at least not so far. We can't outsource this one to the military. As America reorganizes its financial markets, every American will feel the pain, some far more than others. Jobs may be harder to come by, loans will be harder to obtain, prices may be higher and paychecks may be smaller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For every &quot;master of the universe&quot; bond trader who won't get a seven-figure bonus this December, there will be a dozen or more people considerably farther down the food chain who won't be able to pay the rent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why it's crucial that Congress, the Bush administration, the banking industry, federal regulators and even presidential campaigns get this one right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response must be prompt but also fair. It must be immediate but also thorough and thoughtful. The usual politics of self-interest must go by the board: No special deals for special friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress and the administration, Democrats and Republicans, must come together in a bipartisan - indeed, non-partisan - effort to remake the financial markets in a way that rewards capital but doesn't punish those who work for a salary. The system must be transparent, risks must be known and regulation must be tough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remedy should come in at least two stages. The first would create, by month's end, a federal entity to take bad mortgage loans off the books of banks at a fair price. This entity would negotiate with debtors with the goal of allowing them to keep their homes, and then sell the strengthened loans back into the commercial market. Such a move should help restore confidence in the credit markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This step should be followed early next year by new enforcement laws and strengthened regulatory agencies. This effort would be led by the new president, either Republican John McCain or Democrat Barack Obama, which means voters must weight carefully each man's ideas about the economic challenges and remedies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain is an awkward position. A longtime foe of government regulation, he tried to repackage himself as an economic populist last week, even as the storm surge of events swept over him. On Tuesday, he said he was opposed to a government takeover of American International Group. The next day, after the government took over the huge insurance firm, Mr. McCain allowed as how it might have been a good idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, after a halting start, was back on his game Friday in Miami. Surrounded by his economic advisers and appearing determinedly presidential, Mr. Obama exuded a kind of calm confidence. To his left, as if to remind people of the boom economic times of the 1990s, stood former Clinton administration Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'd feel better about that if we didn't know that Mr. Rubin had made his pile as an arbitrageur at Goldman Sachs and if he'd done more to rein in Wall Street excesses when he headed the Treasury Department. To be sure, very few people either on Wall Street or in Washington have acknowledged their responsibility for this mess. Nor, for that matter, did many of us in the news media pay much attention as problems grew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why we'd suggest that Warren Buffett be asked to help reorganize the financial markets - even though he's 78 years old and hardly needs the job. The Oracle of Omaha, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., not only is the richest man in the world, but he also predicted the current debacle in 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his letter to shareholders that year, Mr. Buffett warned of Wall Street's dangerous infatuation with financial derivatives, those contracts that add risk upon risk. Derivatives based on mortgage-based securities are what crashed the financial system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I view derivatives as time bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system,&quot; Mr. Buffett wrote, predicting, &quot;these instruments will almost certainly multiply in variety and number until some event makes their toxicity clear. Central banks and governments have so far found no effective way to control, or even monitor, the risks posed by these contracts. In my view, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction. . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama outraised and outspent Republican rival John McCain in August, according to reports filed Saturday with the Federal Election Commission. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain reports raising $47 million to Obama's $65 million. McCain spent $41 million in August, and Obama $53 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's report showed only $1.8 million in donations in August. She still owed about $9 million to her campaign vendors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Barack Obama is airing a new ad that defends his abortion-rights record and says Republican rival John McCain backs a party platform that would deny abortions to victims of rape and incest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's&nbsp;ad answers an independent ad campaign that singles out Obama's efforts in the Illinois Senate to defeat the Born Alive Infants Protection Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now votes taken out of context, accusing Obama of letting infants die? It's a despicable lie,&quot; Obama's&nbsp;ad states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an Illinois state senator, Obama opposed three legislative efforts in 2001, 2002 and 2003 to give legal protections to any aborted fetus that showed signs of life. Obama and other opponents of the Illinois bill have noted the state already had a law to protect aborted fetuses born alive and considered able to survive. Moreover, they said, the proposed legislation would have undermined the landmark Supreme Court case on abortion, Roe v. Wade.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden says Republican John McCain is helping President George W. Bush wage war against organized labor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden told a union picnic Saturday that McCain has been an accomplice in dismantling protections that safeguarded the economy and workers' rights. Hundreds of coal mining families in southwestern Virginia cheered as Biden accused Bush of putting anti-labor, corporate interests in charge of the U.S. Labor Department and the National Labor Relations Board.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Records indicate Palin's pay dropped, but rose too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the campaign trail, GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin has declared at least four times that she cut her own pay as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just-released records from the Wasilla clerk's office show Palin's pay did drop from $64,200 in October 1996 to $61,200 in January 1997. But six months later, in June 1998, it jumped to $68,000. Palin's pay dipped once more in July 1999 to $66,000, according to the records, but it went back to $68,000 three months later and stayed at that level until Palin left office in October 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin spokeswoman Maria Comella did not have an immediate comment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hidden Valley already makes wide range of public contributions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Wildwood officials can't budge ski resort owner on plan to close&quot; (Sept. 11): As a skier and long-time winter public information specialist for Hidden Valley Ski Area, I personally stand to lose if the ski area closes. But it's not just skiers and seasonal employees who will lose. This is a business that makes a wide range of public contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few that maybe Wildwood's administration has overlooked:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Hidden Valley already donates public parking. The ski area allows AmerenUE to park a large fleet of vehicles used in tree-trimming on a side lot at the ski facility. That helps keep the power on for all of us. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Hidden Valley provides the largest winter field school trip in the area. More than 5,000 kids in grades five to eight visit during winter from more than 100 schools from eastern Missouri and Southern Illinois. Many kids from rural school districts - Sullivan, Mo., to Waterloo - otherwise never would experience skiing. Most will not become skiers. The program is about building confidence and getting out of doors in winter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Hidden Valley is a friend to wildlife. Hidden Valley has been helping me with a personal project: keeping alive the tradition of providing homes for purple martins, a declining bird species. Hidden Valley has spent more than $1,000 in two years erecting purple martin housing, joining Forest Park and the Missouri Botanical Garden in this effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Wildwood feels a need to make demands of a public payment before approving a modest expansion is absurd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Miller | Brentwood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leave the deer alone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would you take someone's life just because there might be too many of us? I am a seventh-grader at Westminster Christian Academy. I was shocked to hear that people want to kill innocent deer in Town and Country. The deer lived here way before we did. They should not be murdered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Genesis, God told us to take care of the creatures he gave us. For many years, I have enjoyed the presence of deer in my own yard. Every time I see one of these amazing creatures, all I can do is thank God for its beauty. Instead of killing the deer, why not relocate them to a place where they would be safe? I realize we have tried this before, and some people are hesitant to try it again. We might be able to find a safer way to move these gorgeous creatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should leave the deer at peace. They are just trying to live their lives as they always have. There are safety hazards associated with shooting the deer. If someone misses the deer, someone could be injured or killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counting the number of deer is entirely up to God. What right do we have to take the lives of innocent animals?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maren Osterholt | Town and County</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Account for all POWs, MIAs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sept. 19 is POW-MIA Recognition Day. In World War II, 20,000 American prisoners of war liberated from German camps by our Soviet allies were taken to the Soviet Union. Live sightings were reported until the late 1950s. In Korea, 8,000 prisoners of war were taken to China and the Soviet Union. Live sightings were reported into the 1960s. In Vietnam, 3,331 people held by the communist government as bargaining chips were betrayed by President Richard M. Nixon, who, after accepting a token 300 or so, declared that all prisoners of war were home. We had live sightings as late as 1989. The administrations of Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have aided in the cover-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, federal buildings and post offices will fly the POW flag. A commemorative postage stamp was designed. The American Legion has an empty chair at all meetings for the prisoners of war and those missing in action. None of these has brought a single accounting of a single prisoner of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this election cycle, we should ask all candidates what they will do to bring a full accounting of prisoners of war and those missing in action from World War II, Korea and Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John P. Fitts | Noel, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unexamined mind</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked to run for vice president of my church council, I felt honored. I said, &quot;Let me think and pray about it.&quot; Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, when asked to run for vice president of the United States, said she didn't blink before accepting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other qualifications aside, do we want a vice president with so little thoughtfulness and self-examination? The unexamined mind can be a dangerous thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barbara O. Barnes | Sappington</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Word of advice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have a word of advice for Republican vice presidential candidate Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin: Blink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martha Mahon | University City</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not so fast, whippersnapper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama mocks Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain (and, by extension, disses a lot of us seniors) as &quot;out of touch&quot; because Mr. McCain supposedly isn't technologically savvy (&quot;Obama&nbsp;ad blasts McCain as out of step with times,&quot; Sept. 13). Tell that whippersnapper Mr. Obama that a lot of us senior citizens may not carry an iPod, but we sure know how to use voting machines!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shirley F. Giebel | St. Louis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and family plan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article &quot;In Alaska, Palin kept politics personal&quot; (Sept. 14) had much to say about how Republican vice presidential candidate Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin appointed friends to help her in her job as governor. This must make the Democrats feel a real kinship to her, as their own John F. Kennedy surrounded himself with friends and family to help him in his cabinet (and other areas) as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And don't forget that former President William Jefferson Clinton appointed his wife, Hillary, to bring national health insurance to Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It just shows we all need friends and family around us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carole Edwards | South St. Louis County</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vote accordingly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 40th annual Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup &quot;Public's Attitudes Toward the Public Schools&quot; poll (published in the September issue of Phi Delta Kappan: The Journal for Education) includes this finding: &quot;Americans view Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama as much more supportive of public schools than Republican presidential candidate John McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those of us who support the public schools ought to take note and vote accordingly in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A.K. Trautwein | Overland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fairy tales</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain/Palin plan to drill, particularly in Alaska, is the height of irresponsibility. There is strong evidence for global warming. There are more natural disasters all around the world, and they are increasing. Scientists have explained the reasons for the phenomenon, but Republicans prefer to ignore them. &quot;Drill, baby, drill&quot; won't solve our problem, but it could create additional ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The technology exists for us to start giving up oil - foreign and domestic - but vested interests won't allow it. Drilling for new Alaskan oil will provide only minimal, if any, relief from dependence on foreign oil, and nuclear power plants - which still have concerns about waste - will take many years to build and get up and running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solar, wind and thermal energy and other sources are here and are being used successfully in many places in this country and around the world. So why are Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain and vice presidential candidate Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin feeding us irresponsible fairy tales? Perhaps to protect our dependence on the Arabian American Oil Company in Saudi Arabia - the homeland of Osama bin Laden and most of his Sept. 11, 2001, cohorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rita Warren | Olivette</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marvels of science</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists warmed up the largest machine ever built by man, a gigantic atom smasher, hoping to shed light on the so-called dark matter that makes up about a quarter of the universe (&quot;Huge atom smasher, which some fear, is set to start up this week,&quot; Sept. 8). Some scientists fear that there is a slight chance that this would create a black hole that would set in motion the end of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember when they were experimenting with the atom bomb? Many thought the bomb itself would set off a chain reaction that would blow up the world. What nonsense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, it obliterated two large cities in Japan, killing 200,000 or so people, but the entire world? Balderdash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, while the scientists fiddle with the secrets of the atom, I am fiddling with a way to travel to the safety of Mars.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By this time in 2004, the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and other political advocacy groups had made a major splash in the presidential race, spending millions of dollars to sway voters' views of John Kerry and George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the rules of the game have changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal election officials cracked down on the Swift Boat group and similar outfits after they swamped the airwaves in 2004. As a result, some &quot;soft money&quot; groups have stumbled out of the 2008 election gate, shutting down before the presidential election even switched into high gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a new breed of political advocacy could be gaining steam. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enter Ed Martin, the energetic and ambitious former aide to Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt and now a St. Louis lawyer who is president of the American Issues Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AIP was set up earlier this year as a nonprofit, &quot;social welfare&quot; organization that is subject to even less disclosure than the Swift Boat-style groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin says he expects that in the coming weeks, outside groups - including the AIP and an array of other conservative and liberal organizations - will unleash a torrent of advocacy spending. &quot;We're in the calm before the storm,&quot; Martin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calm, of course, is a relative term. There's no shortage of independent political organizations already engaged in influencing the 2008 elections - including multimillion-dollar campaigns by business and labor groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Established interest groups, such as the Club for Growth on the right and the Service Employees International Union on the left, have launched big efforts to rev up key constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But so far at least, the soft money groups, called 527s - named for the section of the tax code they fall under - don't appear poised to match 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FEC CRACKDOWN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Bush-Kerry contest, groups stepped into a void created by campaign finance reform, using 527s to launch withering attacks funded by unlimited contributions and subject to little public disclosure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all, 527s, from the Swift Boat Veterans to the left-leaning Media Fund and America Coming Together, poured more than $420 million into the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after the election, the Federal Election Commission determined that four groups - the GOP-aligned Swift Boat Veterans and Progress for America Voter Fund and the Democratic-leaning Media Fund and America Coming Together - had flouted election laws. The agency levied more than $2 million in fines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FEC's move seems to have dampened the enthusiasm for 527s this year, campaign experts say. Plus, the two major party candidates, Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Barack Obama, D-Ill., have been critical of the independent attack groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It appears to have substantially reduced the role (of 527s) so far,&quot; said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a campaign watchdog group. Several soft money outfits that were expected to play a major role in the election have either fizzled or shifted their focus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The legal environment is much tougher in 2008 than it was in 2004,&quot; said Tom Matzzie, who runs Accountable America, a left-leaning website set up to monitor conservative advocacy groups. &quot;The big story is truthfully that there's not a lot of activity going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'CONSERVATIVE VALUES'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soft money hasn't disappeared from the political scene. In all, federal 527s have raised about $132 million in the first 18 months of this election cycle, about $30 million less than such groups raised in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with the new rules on 527s, some political strategists turned to a different section of the tax code - 501(c)(4) - for social welfare organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All these groups are doing basically the same thing,&quot; said Steve Weissman, of the Campaign Finance Institute, a nonpartisan organization affiliated with George Washington University. &quot;They're electioneering in various ways, and we don't know what the cumulative total is going to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Issues Project is among those set up as a social welfare group. Created earlier this year to champion what the group's website calls &quot;conservative values,&quot; the AIP focuses on smaller government, strong national defense and lower taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 38, is a solo-practice lawyer who resigned in November amid a controversy over the destruction of e-mails in Blunt's office. He said he &quot;jumped at the chance&quot; to get involved with the group because it offered a new avenue to press a conservative agenda as the presidential race played out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin said he got involved with the group, based in Tampa, Fla., at the urging of Cleta Mitchell, a well-known Republican lawyer based in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he and others have been worried that McCain would be vastly outspent, because Obama opted out of public financing and its accompanying spending restrictions. And he noted that Democratic soft money groups have traditionally had an edge on their GOP counterparts, so this was a chance to even out a &quot;lopsided debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The liberal-leaning groups have made very clear ... that they're going to spend tens of millions of dollars on advocacy for their issues and to influence the discussion in the fall,&quot; Martin said, citing campaigns by the Service Employees International Union and Planned Parenthood, among others. &quot;So our goal is to be pushing into the public discourse some conservative ideas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'WE MAY NEVER KNOW'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the AIP created a firestorm when it debuted on the political scene a few weeks ago with a controversial ad linking Obama with William Ayers, a one-time member of the Weather Underground, a radical group that bombed government buildings in the early 1970s. Obama was 8 years old when the bombings occurred; it was many years later when he met Ayers, a longtime resident of the Chicago neighborhood where Obama lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad was paid for by a $2.9 million donation from Texas billionaire Harold Simmons, a major fundraiser for McCain who also helped bankroll the Swift Boat group in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign denounced the ad and asked the Justice Department to investigate the AIP, saying the group appeared to be more like a political committee than a nonprofit group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin shrugged off the charges, saying the ad buy was a &quot;drop in the bucket&quot; compared with what some liberal groups were spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AIP is now gearing up for its next move, he said. The group will likely air new TV ads and launch other &quot;issue advocacy&quot; efforts in the coming weeks, but no firm decisions have been made, Martin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're looking at everything to figure out what's possible,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign finance watchdogs and election lawyers for both presidential candidates are watching warily as they enter the crucial home stretch of the contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of these groups don't get started until now, and they don't report until October, so it's hard to know exactly what they're doing,&quot; said Weissman, of the Campaign Finance Institute. And because the 501(c)(4)s are subject to fewer disclosures, &quot;we may never know&quot; the full extent of their role.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama launched two new campaign ads in Missouri on Wednesday, a move that state Democrats say is the latest proof that he's not abandoning the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another piece of evidence: the 1,500 or so new voter registrations that the state Obama operation has submitted in the past week to election officials in the city of St. Louis and St. Louis County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new registrations are among 75,000 that Obama's Missouri campaign say they hope to add to the state's voter rolls before voter registration ends Oct. 8. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Obama spokesman Justin Hamilton declined to say how many the campaign has turned in so far this election season. &quot;We're on track,&quot; he said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, Democrats say they don't have to offer any proof to discount what they see as unfounded speculation pushed by Missouri Republicans to deflate enthusiasm among Obama loyalists in Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state Republican Party touched off the talk of a Democratic defection late last week, when state GOP executive director Jared Craighead held a conference call to assert that the Obama campaign would soon pull up stakes after the latest round of public polls showed a slight edge for the Republican presidential nominee, John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think they're out of here,&quot; Craighead said. &quot;They're just not getting traction here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craighead provided no proof of an eminent Obama defection, beyond third-hand talk from an unnamed rural mail carrier who allegedly told Republicans of outgoing shipments of equipment from an outstate Obama office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the state GOP continued its mantra this week, issuing a release entitled &quot;So Long, Farewell, auf Wiedersehen, Good Night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, both presidential campaigns seem to be testing Missouri's political waters lately. McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, headlined two high-profile rallies in the state in recent weeks. Obama's vice presidential nominee, Joe Biden, conducted two campaign stops - in Columbia and south St. Louis - about 10 days ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two presidential contenders also have spent more than $4 million apiece on TV ads in Missouri so far this year, according to the latest figures compiled by TNSMI-Campaign Media Analysis Group, a nonpartisan ad-tracking firm that is monitoring campaign ad spending for the Post-Dispatch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in recent weeks, both presidential camps have dramatically curbed their Missouri ad buys. The latest weekly report showed combined ad spending of less than $120,000 in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what's particularly interesting about the Republican claim that Obama is about to pull up stakes is the state GOP's acknowledgement that Obama has a much larger ground operation in the state: 40 campaign offices to 10 offices for the combined McCain-state GOP operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Obama has at least 100 paid staffers in the state and a Missouri press operation, McCain's state staff is believed to be far less. McCain's press spokesmen appear to be stationed in other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craighead and state GOP spokeswoman Tina Hervey say their point is that Obama is wasting time and money on Missouri, and that polls prove it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama spokesman Hamilton said the GOP was sidestepping what really appears to be happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a question of whether we're leaving, but whether the McCain campaign ever plans to show up,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;We're committed to winning the state by being here on the ground. The McCain campaign wants to phone it in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. peters mayor backs Nixon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, St. Peters Mayor Len Pagano, a Republican, touched off a stir with his announcement Wednesday that he's endorsing a Democrat for governor: Attorney General Jay Nixon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagano joined Nixon on Wednesday for a tour of the St. Charles County Economic Development Center. &quot;Jay Nixon is definitely the person I feel will ... target our economic problems that we're having in Missouri,&quot; Pagano said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon said in a statement that he welcomed Pagano's support and will focus on creating &quot;a better-educated, healthier work force to compete in the 21st-century economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagano's support is significant in that St. Peters is in St. Charles County, generally considered a Republican stronghold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagano emphasized in an interview that his decision shouldn't be seen as a slap at the Republican candidate for governor, U.S. Rep. Kenny Hulshof of Columbia. &quot;This isn't anti-Hulshof, it's pro-Nixon,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But fellow Republicans aren't expected to see it that way. Hulshof campaign manager John Hancock said there's no evidence Pagano contacted anybody in state government to air concerns about jobs. Hancock also noted that the St. Peters post is nonpartisan and added, &quot;It's not credible to call him a Republican.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of John McCain's and Barack Obama's biggest fundraisers are executives from the stricken financial services industry, which will need all the help it can get from whichever candidate wins the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s chief executive, for example, has raised more than $500,000 for McCain's campaign. Obama has received at least $1.5 million collected by three senior executives at Lehman Brothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Obama each are considering how to avoid future collapses and the need for further costly government bailouts, steps that may include tougher banking and investment regulations. But executives from the same companies in the crosshairs of such decisions are helping these candidates get elected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tough talk is coming from candidates who have fueled their campaigns with Wall Street money. Securities and investment firms gave $9.9 million to Obama and $6.9 million to McCain through July, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a private group that tracks money spent in politics. The industry is McCain's No. 3 contributor and Obama's No. 4 contributor, according to the center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three executives from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have raised at least $500,000 for Obama. That firm is Obama's top source of campaign money overall; its employees have contributed more than $690,000 to his campaign, according to the center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merrill Lynch's chief executive, John Thain, has raised more than $500,000 for McCain. Merrill's work force likewise is McCain's top donor, giving nearly $300,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, employees from the commercial bank and insurance sectors gave McCain's campaign $3.6 million and Obama's campaign $3.4 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressional candidates collect considerable money from Wall Street, too. Democratic candidates have accepted nearly $37 million from securities and investment firms in the current election, and Republicans have accepted nearly $29 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry's contributions to all federal candidates and political parties: $101 million so far in this two-year election cycle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merrill Lynch and its new owner both will be looking for help from the White House. Merrill Lynch jumped into the arms of Bank of America Corp. over the weekend to avoid becoming the next Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy protection Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a weekend that reshaped Wall Street, Goldman Sachs is the larger of the nation's two remaining major independent investment banks. The other is Morgan Stanley, where employees have contributed $300,000 to Obama and $217,000 to McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's still early, but Wall Street's institutions may have good reason to worry about a new president, once they get past the issue of financial survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, before the latest round of financial carnage, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said he expected the next president and the next Congress to address Paulson's blueprint for the biggest overhaul of government financial regulation since the Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigns Respond</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the candidates scrambled Wednesday to adjust their messages to connect more directly with financially struggling voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama talks directly into the camera in a new, two-minute television ad on how he'll fix an economy in which &quot;paychecks are flat and home values are falling.&quot; McCain and running mate Sarah Palin softened opposition to government bailouts, accepting the U.S. takeover of the nation's largest insurer as unfortunate but necessary to protect ordinary Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shot that has been called by the Feds - it's understandable but very, very disappointing that taxpayers are called upon for another one,&quot; Palin told reporters during a visit to a delicatessen in Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both McCain and Obama advocated cracking down on freewheeling Wall Street practices and for tough new regulations on financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama ridiculed McCain's calls for more regulation as an eleventh-hour conversion for one who has long championed deregulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too many in Washington and on Wall Street &quot;weren't minding the store. They sat on their hands until it was too late,&quot; Obama told a rally in Elko, Nev. He challenged McCain's vow to take on the &quot;old boys' network. ... He hasn't taken them on for the last 26 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day earlier, McCain opposed additional government relief and praised the government's decision not to rescue Lehman Brothers after it had intervened to help investment bank Bear Stearns and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ERIC MINK</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; Pg. D11</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">887 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After two weeks' vacation and more than 1,700 Midwestern highway miles, I came home looking for some wisdom. I found it on the editorial page of Sunday's Post-Dispatch - in a letter to the editor by Dorothy Anderson of Spanish Lake:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a question,&quot; she wrote, setting us up for her rhetorical punch line. &quot;This year, are we having a presidential election or a vice-presidential election?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enough about Sarah Palin already. Enough, even, about Joe Biden, as paltry as coverage of the long-time Delaware senator has been in comparison to the frenzied attention paid to the formerly unknown governor of Alaska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll grant that their respective life stories, family situations and opinions on issues are interesting. I'll also note that, except for an immense disparity in length, the political careers of both are essentially routine when you bore down into them. Both of those careers now are the subjects of inevitable campaign exaggerations and, in Palin's case especially, campaign deceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But none of this really matters. The truly relevant questions when it comes to them are: If Obama were elected and, God forbid a million times, were to be struck down by violence or illness, would you feel comfortable with Biden becoming president? Likewise, if McCain were elected and, God forbid a million times, were to be struck down by illness or violence, would you feel comfortable with Palin becoming president?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People's opinions obviously differ. I'd be comfortable with Biden becoming president. And I'd be as uncomfortable with Palin becoming president as I'd be with University City's Joe Adams, a decent man and mayor of my hometown, becoming president. By any reasonable comparative assessment, Biden is qualified for the job, and Palin isn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But neither Biden nor Palin is running for president, as reader Dorothy Anderson gently chided us on Sunday, and I'm not about to base my vote for president on either one. The candidates for president are Barack Obama and John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time I vote on Nov. 4, I expect to have a good sense of which man comes closer to sharing my values and my priorities about issues; which one is more genuine, given the realities of politics; and which one I can trust better to keep faith with me and the rest of the American people - including those who don't vote for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does this amount to?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Well, I know that millions of Americans are struggling to pay bills that aren't optional: mortgages and rent, food, transportation, medical expenses. People close to me have lost their jobs and suddenly find themselves working to stay afloat financially. And although I make a good living and have managed to keep debts to a minimum, my wages haven't kept pace with inflation, my retirement funds have taken a huge hit and my profession is undergoing a wrenching transformation that could put me on the street tomorrow with barely a blink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- I read about crises in the financial and securities industries and reflect on the last 30 years or so, during which The Market was elevated to the status of god - as if asset and liability balance sheets and profit and loss statements said more about the goodness of American society than the way people live and treat each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hear politicians express confidence in the marketplace and wonder if they are ignorant or if they secretly realize how many crises have resulted from the failure of government to do its job and protect ordinary Americans from the abuses of the very marketplace they pretend to revere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- I've seen the American health care system left to the mercy of those same market forces and watched costs rise, health decline and millions forced into bankruptcy. I'm mystified that anyone can keep a straight face when he claims that the marketplace can solve these problems when what we need is the political will to create a new, uniquely American system that will spare people from needless suffering and anguish when they are most vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- I'm offended by scam artists who prey on the real fears of real people and pretend that getting more oil to market, even in 10 years, will do anything but prolong our sick and destructive dependence on petroleum products, further erode the American economy and hurt working people more than anybody else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- I keep hearing that education is the key to conquering poverty, and then I read about higher and higher tuition costs, limitations on grants to bright qualified students who lack only money and abusive commercial loan practices that pump young people into the job market carrying crushing debts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- I see my country's fundamental values of justice, fairness and individual rights debased in a fight against punks and thugs who exploited simple security flaws we knew about but hadn't bothered to fix. I see a war waged because weak, frightened people needed to feel and appear strong - a war that, no matter how it concludes, will leave our country more vulnerable than it was before and our American values pointlessly and shamefully compromised. I wonder if there is such a thing any more as accountability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's six weeks and six days until the presidential election, and I'm going to spend that time figuring out whether to place my trust in Barack Obama or John McCain. I've already answered the only question that matters about Joe Biden and Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With chaos rocking financial markets, John McCain assailed &quot;greed and corruption&quot; on Wall Street and promised to clean it up, while Barack Obama blamed White House policies and said his opponent would only deliver more of the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates struggled on Monday to seize control of the issue voters say is most important - the economy - with Republicans and Democrats alike saying the man who succeeds may well win the election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in a dizzying day of speeches and statements, neither White House hopeful offered any fresh ideas for turning things around. Instead, each relied on the same vague, though vastly different pitches he has sounded over the last few months for fixing what ails the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they didn't emphasize that they are part of the Congress that has done little to head off the crisis. McCain is a four-term Arizona senator, Obama a first-termer from Illinois.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bemoaning &quot;the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression,&quot; Democrat Obama faulted Republican McCain's domestic policy agenda as the same as President George W. Bush's - &quot;one that says we should just stick our heads in the sand and ignore economic problems until they spiral into crises.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain declared in a new TV ad, &quot;Our economy is in crisis. Only proven reformers John McCain and Sarah Palin can fix it&quot; - though he also told voters in Jacksonville, Fla., &quot;The fundamentals of our economy are strong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With some seven weeks left in the campaign, both Obama and McCain are trying to find a message that resonates with anxious voters who are fretting about their retirement nest eggs, home mortgages and job security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As different as their policies are, they were united in their message to voters: It's not your fault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courting working-class voters who gave him grief in the Democratic primary, Obama sounded an I-feel-your-pain note.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama lamented Republican policies over eight years that he said &quot;encouraged outsized bonuses to CEOs while ignoring middle-class Americans&quot; and said: &quot;Instead of prosperity trickling down, the pain has trickled up - from the struggles of hardworking Americans on Main Street to the largest firms of Wall Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's words were sympathetic as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America is in a crisis today,&quot; he said - then added: &quot;The economic crisis is not the fault of the American people. Our workers are the most innovative, the hardest working, the best skilled, the most productive, the most competitive in the world. ... But they are being threatened today ... because of greed and corruption that some engaged in on Wall Street.&quot; Some in the markets, he said, &quot;have treated Wall Street like a casino.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In line with historical positions of Democrats and Republicans, Obama generally supports stronger consumer protections, better regulatory oversight and more government intervention, while McCain broadly prefers a market system of less federal involvement and red tape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both advocate tax cuts, though to different degrees and different ends. Obama seeks to cut into inequality between rich and poor by raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans and giving breaks to the middle class and lower-income people. McCain wants to spur the economy and create jobs by keeping tax rates low for higher-income taxpayers and slashing rates for corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While they focused on the topic that voters say matters most, the two campaigns also continued to assail each other Monday on character issues. The Democratic vice presidential nominee, Joe Biden, said McCain was &quot;launching a low blow a day.&quot; McCain's campaign, in turn, accused Obama of spouting &quot;false talk about change&quot; and hurling insults to cover up his record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has led for months on the question of who would best handle the economy, but some polls show that his advantage has dwindled. He had a slight advantage over McCain on the economy - 47 percent to 42 percent - in an ABC News/Washington Post poll last week, with the Democrat's edge cut in half since spring.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A failed plan to rescue Lehman Brothers was followed Sunday by more seismic shocks from Wall Street, including an apparent government-brokered takeover of Merrill Lynch by the Bank of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A forced restructuring of the world's largest insurance company, American International Group Inc., also weighed heavily on global markets as the effects of the 14-month-old credit crisis intensified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A global consortium of banks, working with government officials in New York, announced late Sunday a $70 billion pool of funds to lend to troubled financial companies. The aim, according to participants who spoke to The Associated Press, was to prevent a worldwide panic on stock and other financial exchanges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten banks - Bank of America, Barclays, Citibank, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS - each agreed to provide $7 billion &quot;to help enhance liquidity and mitigate the unprecedented volatility and other challenges affecting global equity and debt markets.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Reserve also chipped in with more largesse in its emergency lending program for investment banks. The central bank announced late Sunday that it was broadening the types of collateral that financial institutions can use to obtain loans from the Fed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the discussions had been aimed at identifying &quot;potential market vulnerabilities in the wake of an unwinding of a major financial institution and to consider appropriate official sector and private sector responses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Futures pegged to the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 300 points in electronic trading Sunday evening, pointing to a sharply lower open for the blue chip index this morning. Asian stock markets were also falling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement early today, Lehman Brothers said that it would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investment bank said it is exploring the sale of its broker-dealer operations and is in &quot;advanced discussions&quot; to sell its investment management unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All potential buyers walked away from Lehman on Sunday after the U.S. Treasury refused to budge on its refusal to provide any takeover aid, as it had done six months ago when Bear Stearns faltered and earlier this month when it seized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expectations that the 158-year-old Lehman would survive dimmed after Barclays PLC withdrew its bid to buy the investment bank. Lehman is foundering under the weight of $60 billion in soured real estate holdings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurer AIG, hit hard by deterioration in the credit markets, said Sunday it is reviewing its operations and discussing possible options with outside parties to improve its business after a week when its stock dropped 45 percent amid concerns about the company's financial underpinnings.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merrill Lynch, another investment bank laid low by the crisis that was triggered by rising mortgage defaults and plunging home values in the U.S., agreed to be acquired by Bank of America for $29 a share, according to the Wall Street Journal. That's a premium to its closing price on Friday of $17.05 but only a fraction of its price of almost $100 a share early in 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America has the most deposits of any U.S. bank, while Merrill Lynch is the world's largest brokerage. A combination of the two would create a global financial giant to rival Citigroup Inc., the biggest U.S. bank in terms of assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal would not come without risks, however. Merrill Lynch, like many of its Wall Street peers, has been struggling with tight credit markets and billions of dollars in assets tied to mortgages that have plunged in value. Merrill has reported four straight quarterly losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Bank of America's own finances are far from robust. As consumer credit deteriorates, the bank has seen its profits decline, and the company is still in the midst of absorbing the embattled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial, which it acquired in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Election affected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stunning weekend developments took place as voters, who rank the economy as their top concern, prepare to elect a new president in seven weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weekend's developments will likely spur a much greater focus by presidential candidates - Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama - and members of Congress on the need for stricter financial regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samuel Hayes, finance professor emeritus at Harvard Business School, said President George W. Bush's administration may get a lot of blame for the situation, which could benefit Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just the psychological impact of this kind of failure is going to be significant,&quot; he said. &quot;It will color people's feelings about their well-being and the integrity of the financial system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paulson was huddled through the weekend at the New York Federal Reserve's fortress-like building in downtown Manhattan with executives from major banks and investment houses to hash out the fate of Lehman Brothers and to stanch the bleeding on Wall Street that threatened to shatter investor confidence around the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's clear we're one step away from a financial meltdown,&quot; said Nouriel Roubini, chairman of the consulting firm RGE Monitor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meetings that began Friday night were a who's who of financial heavyweights: Paulson, Timothy Geithner, president of the New York Fed, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox, and a host of CEOs, including Vikram Pandit of Citigroup Inc., Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., John Mack of Morgan Stanley, Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s John Thain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all their efforts, Lehman appeared ready to file for bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More banks falter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The end of Lehman may not stop the financial crisis that has gripped Wall Street for months, analysts said. More investment banks could disappear soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The independent broker-dealers &quot;are going the way of the dodo bird,&quot; said Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va.-based banking consultant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's partly because some of the firms, particularly Merrill, made bad bets on real estate. But several analysts said that investment companies will need the deep pockets of commercial banks to survive the next few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roubini said with no deal for Lehman, Merrill and the other investment firms would have been hit with a &quot;run on the bank,&quot; as hedge funds and other clients withdraw funds and banks become reluctant to lend to them. Many of the investment banks rely on short-term loans to finance day-to-day operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of insuring financial firms' debt from default has been soaring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rise in the cost of the insurance, known as credit default swaps, indicates debt holders believe there is a greater chance of default by the financial companies. Especially over the last week, those insurance costs have been increasing rapidly as more debt holders fear companies like Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual Inc. could collapse and not be able to repay their debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swaps on most financial firms are likely to get even worse during the upcoming week, analysts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, there was also an emergency trading session being held at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association to &quot;reduce risk associated with a potential Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy.&quot; The ISDA, which arranges trades for derivatives, said it was allowing customers to make trades and unwind positions linked to Lehman - but that those trades would be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roubini said it's difficult to accurately gauge the health of companies like Merrill because their financial health depends on how they value complex securities. As a result, their finances aren't very transparent, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That can lead to a loss of confidence in the financial markets, he said, which can overwhelm an investment bank even if it is financially healthy by some measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ely said similar shake-outs have happened in other parts of the financial industry, such as credit cards and thrifts. Bank of America acquired independent credit card issuer MBNA in 2005, for example, while credit card company Capital One Financial Corp. has diversified itself by purchasing regional banks in Louisiana, Texas and New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The common denominator of the financial crisis, analysts said, is the bursting of the housing bubble. Home prices have dropped on average 25 percent so far. Roubini predicted they could drop another 15 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crisis has begun to slow the broader economy as banks make fewer loans and consumers have begun cutting spending. Many economists are now forecasting that the economy could slip into recession by the end of this year and early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, in turn, could cause additional losses for commercial banks on credit cards, auto loans and student loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates steady at 2 percent when it meets Tuesday. It was possible, however, that the central bank might decide in coming weeks to cut rates if such a move is seen as needed to calm turbulent financial markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Monetary Fund predicted earlier this year that total losses from the credit crisis could reach almost $1 trillion. So far, banks have only taken about $350 billion in losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commercial banks are also starting to feel the pinch. Eleven have closed so far this year, including Pasadena, Calif.-based IndyMac Bank, which had $32 billion in assets and $19 billion in deposits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher Whalen, managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics, a research firm, predicts that about 110 banks with $850 billion in assets could close by next July. That's out of 8,400 federally insured institutions, he said, which together hold $13 trillion in assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individual customers are starting to get nervous about the financial health of their banks for the first time in generations, he said. Whalen's firm analyzes the safety and soundness of banks for business clients, but began receiving inquiries from individuals in the past two months for the first time, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we don't get ahead of this, we are going to face a run on the retail banks by election day,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW York - A failed plan to rescue Lehman Brothers was followed Sunday by more seismic shocks from Wall Street, including an apparent government-brokered takeover of Merrill Lynch by the Bank of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A forced restructuring of the world's largest insurance company, American International Group Inc., also weighed heavily on global markets as the effects of the 14-month-old credit crisis intensified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A global consortium of banks, working with government officials in New York, announced late Sunday a $70 billion pool of funds to lend to troubled financial companies. The aim, according to participants who spoke to The Associated Press, was to prevent a worldwide panic on stock and other financial exchanges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten banks - Bank of America, Barclays, Citibank, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS - each agreed to provide $7 billion &quot;to help enhance liquidity and mitigate the unprecedented volatility and other challenges affecting global equity and debt markets.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Reserve also chipped in with more largesse in its emergency lending program for investment banks. The central bank announced late Sunday that it was broadening the types of collateral that financial institutions can use to obtain loans from the Fed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the discussions had been aimed at identifying &quot;potential market vulnerabilities in the wake of an unwinding of a major financial institution and to consider appropriate official sector and private sector responses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Futures pegged to the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 300 points in electronic trading Sunday evening, pointing to a sharply lower open for the blue chip index this morning. Asian stock markets were also falling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lehman Brothers may be forced to seek an orderly unwinding of its businesses. All potential buyers walked away after the U.S. Treasury refused to budge on its refusal to provide any takeover aid, as it had done six months ago when Bear Stearns faltered and earlier this month when it seized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expectations that the 158-year-old Lehman would survive dimmed after Barclays PLC withdrew its bid to buy the investment bank. Barclays and Bank of America were considered front-runners to buy Lehman, which is foundering under the weight of $60 billion in soured real estate holdings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurer AIG, hit hard by deterioration in the credit markets, said Sunday it is reviewing its operations and discussing possible options with outside parties to improve its business after a week when its stock dropped 45 percent amid concerns about the company's financial underpinnings. It was working with New York Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo and a representative of the governor's office through the weekend to craft a solution that protects policyholders, according to Dinallo's spokesman David Neustadt.</SPAN></P>

Here are comment highlights from the Talk of the Day on STLtoday. com: ON JOBS AND THE ECONOMY: &quot; I think the economy is stuck. Going nowhere fast. Some sectors are doing better than last year and some aren't. It's almost like everyone is standing on the sidelines waiting to see what the other guy is going to do... Things will probably start to move more once the election is over, but which way is anyone's guess. ....&quot; - Tim &quot; The number of jobs are not increasing at the present time, and will decrease for the next 6 months at least.&quot; - johnh &quot; The economy will not improve until there is more visibility on whether we will have a capitalist or socialist in the White House.&quot; - jjk &quot; I predict that after one solid year into the new administration, the economy will begin to improve. ANY change will be welcomed and viewed as a positive. In the meantime, we all have to cut back and simplify a bit: less entertainment outside the home, maybe a commitment to 3 more years driving the old Chevy, postponing building that new home, looking more closely at the sales racks in the stores.&quot; - Ryan On The Euphonium ON COMMEMORATING 9/ 11: &quot; I will ask my children to be more tolerant of things they cannot understand. I will remind them that kindness to ALL people is the only answer to senseless violence. I will weep for those touched by this tragedy just as I did 7 years ago.&quot; - Maria &quot; I'm wearing red, white and blue and we put up the fl ag at home. I will observe moments of silence throughout the morning and will say a prayer for those who lost their lives 7 years ago and for those who continue to defend America.&quot; - AL ON RAISING THE DRIVING AGE: &quot; If you live outside the city limits in St. Louis, you need to be able to drive. The transit here is deplorable and limited and even unavailable at times like Sundays. Better driver's ed is a good idea. Raising the age is not.&quot; - Kathy What will we be talking about this week?

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain's campaign keeps telling voters that Sarah Palin opposed a federally funded Bridge to Nowhere when the facts are otherwise. It accuses Democrat Barack Obama of calling Palin a pig, which did not happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in a political culture accustomed to truth-stretching, McCain's skirting of facts has stood out this week. It has infuriated and flustered Barack Obama's campaign, and campaign pros are watching to see how much voters disregard news reports noting factual holes in the claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That voter reaction could help determine who wins this presidential election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians usually modify or drop claims when a string of newspaper and TV news accounts concludes they are untrue or greatly exaggerated. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, for example, conceded she had not come under sniper fire in Bosnia after a batch of debunking articles subjected her to ridicule in her primary contest against Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's persistence in pushing dubious claims is all the more notable because many political insiders consider him one of the greatest living victims of underhanded campaigning. Locked in a tight race with George W. Bush for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000, McCain was rocked in South Carolina by a whisper campaign claiming he had fathered an illegitimate black child and was mentally unstable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaken by the experience, McCain denounced less-than-truthful campaigning. He even apologized to journalists for his own reluctance to criticize the flying of the Confederate flag at South Carolina's state Capitol in a bid for votes. When the so-called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth attacked the military record of Democrat and fellow Navy officer John Kerry in 2004, McCain called the ads &quot;dishonest and dishonorable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, top aides to McCain include Steve Schmidt, who has close ties to Karl Rove, Bush's political adviser in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and his running mate, Palin, the Alaska governor, were defiant this week in the face of fact-checking news reports. Day after day, she said she had told Congress &quot;no thanks&quot; to the so-called Bridge to Nowhere, a rural Alaska project that was abandoned when critics challenged its costs and usefulness. For nearly a week, major news outlets had documented that Palin supported the bridge when running for governor in 2006, and she turned against it only after it became an embarrassment to the state and federal dollars had been pulled back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain-Palin campaign made at least three other aggressive claims last week that omitted key details or made dubious assumptions to criticize Obama. It equated lawmakers' requests for money for special projects with corruption, even though Palin has sought nearly $200 million in such &quot;earmarks&quot; this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It produced an Internet ad implying that Obama had called Palin a pig when he used a familiar phrase, which McCain also has used, about putting &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; to try to make a bad situation look better. McCain supporters said Obama was slyly alluding to Palin's description of herself as a pit bull in lipstick, but there was nothing in his remarks to support the claim. Obama accused the GOP campaign of &quot;lies and phony outrage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lipstick wars were fully engaged when the McCain campaign produced another ad saying Obama favored &quot;comprehensive sex education&quot; for kindergartners. The charge triggered the sort of headlines becoming increasingly common in major newspapers and wire services monitoring the factual content of political ads and speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ad on Sex Education Distorts Obama Policy,&quot; was the headline on a New York Times article Thursday. &quot;McCain's 'Education' Spot is Dishonest, Deceptive,&quot; said The Washington Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major news outlets have written such fact-checking articles for years. &quot;But in the last two election cycles, the very notion that the facts matter seems to be under assault,&quot; said Michael X. Delli Carpini, an authority on political ads at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surveys already show that most people believe Obama would raise their taxes - a regular McCain claim - even though independent groups such as the Tax Policy Center concluded that four out of five U.S. households would receive tax cuts under his proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds defended the campaign's statements. &quot;We include factual back-up in every one of our TV spots,&quot; he said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, of course, has made exaggerated or questionable assertions as well. Earlier this year, for instance, he repeated a claim that more black men are in prison than in college, after news accounts refuted it. He also used a McCain remark about having troops in Iraq for &quot;100 years&quot; to exaggerate McCain's proposals for being fully engaged militarily in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In general, however, Obama has been quicker to react to news accounts challenging his accuracy. Faced with skeptical reports this year, he stopped saying he &quot;worked his way&quot; through college, and instead credited hard work and scholarships.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thrown off stride by a hard-charging campaign from Republican rivals John McCain and Sarah Palin, Barack Obama moved Friday to reclaim the spotlight and assure worried supporters that he can and will fight back. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will respond with speed and ferocity to John McCain's attacks and we will take the fight to him,&quot; Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said in a memo Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we will do it on the big issues that matter to the American people. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama immediately launched a new ad that notably omitted any mention of Palin - an abrupt switch after days of criticizing her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The makes a none-too-subtle dig at McCain's age. It shows McCain at a hearing in the early 1980s, wearing giant glasses and a now-out-of-style suit. Other images include a disco ball, clunky phone, outdated computer and Rubik's Cube. &quot;Things have changed in the last 26 years,&quot; the announcer says, &quot;but McCain hasn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He admits he still doesn't know how to use a computer, can't send an e-mail, still doesn't understand the economy, and favors $200 billion in new tax cuts for corporations, but almost nothing for the middle class,&quot; the commercial says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has said he relies on his wife and staff to work the computer for him and that he doesn't use e-mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Obama supporters tried to seize on a comment McCain made the night before at a forum on service in which he defended Palin's experience as a small-town mayor by saying she was closer to real people than he was in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's easy for me to go to Washington and frankly be somewhat divorced from the day-to-day challenges people have,&quot; McCain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama pounced on Friday in New Hampshire, saying, &quot;From where he and George Bush sit, maybe they just can't see. Maybe they are just that out of touch. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama hoped the steps would calm donors and a base that's been agitating for more fight from him. Although the race is neck and neck, many Democrats think that Obama should be ahead given broad public dissatisfaction with President George W. Bush and the Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain responded with a new ad of his own, aimed at simultaneously ridiculing Obama and keeping the focus on Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They lashed out at Sarah Palin,&quot; the new ad says. &quot;Dismissed her as good-looking. That backfired, so they said she was doing what she was told. Then desperately called Sarah Palin a liar. How disrespectful.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If St. Louis and St. Louis County would collect the taxes already on the books, there would be no need for additional taxes. Sales taxes in some areas, such as Eureka, are now almost 8 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many naive voters don't realize what these sales taxes amount to. If one or more of these taxes are approved in November, many communities will have sales taxes of more than 8 percent. On the purchase of your average new car that is about $2,000. Now calculate the amount of other purchases, and you will see these that taxes are much more than the naive voter understands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales of items sold on eBay, Overstock, Amazon and a host of other websites are not taxed. Some people will drive 10 miles out of their way to save a nickel on a gallon of gas. Think how much they save when they avoid sales taxes for everyday purchases. Some websites offer discounts on bulk items, much like warehouse clubs. Websites such as these hurt the local economy because sales taxes are not collected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until sales taxes are collected on all sales, includingonline sales, I don't think anyone should vote for additional sales taxes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So get out and vote your opinion in November. I suggest that you vote no on all sales taxes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too much change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to &quot;Chicago's public schools face boycott threat today&quot; (Sept. 2), the Chicago public schools are a mess. Amazingly, the &quot;ailing&quot; district spent more than $11,000 per student last year, placing it well above the national average. Even more amazing is the suggested tonic for their ailment: a $120 million pilot program that would give the state legislature the &quot;chance to prove that money does make a difference in school performance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the state's junior U.S. senator is otherwise engaged, his former colleagues are proposing an all-too-familiar solution: pouring more taxpayer dollars into a broken system. One hundred and twenty million dollars is a bit too much pocket change for me to believe in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Margret Graham | St. Louis County</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silent epidemic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Death of girl is linked to aerosol hair spray&quot; (Aug. 29): The huffing epidemic is killing many of our young men and women. I lost my oldest son to huffing on Christmas Eve in 2006. Until my son died, I had never heard of huffing. When I talked to the DARE officer at my son's school, I was told that even DARE doesn't go into detail about huffing. They more or less just say, &quot;Don't do it.&quot; But after talking to police officers, I learned that this epidemic has been going on for many years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My son was 17. You have to be 18 to buy the product that killed him, but the clerk at the store where the product was purchased did not verify anyone's age. The company that makes the product has known for years that its product is harmful but refuses to put a bittering agent in it because it makes the product &quot;smell bad.&quot; I tried sued the company and the store, and I was slapped with a gag order.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No hot dog is a safe hot dog</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a dietitian with the nonprofit organization that produced the provocative &quot;Protect Our Kids&quot; anti-hot dog TV commercial, I think Americans deserve to know about the compelling scientific evidence linking processed meat consumption to increased risk of colorectal cancer (&quot;Deadly 'dogs',&quot; Aug. 29). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A landmark report released last year by the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund concluded that no amount of processed meat is considered safe to eat; ideally, it should be avoided completely. After reviewing 58 large scientific studies, researchers with the two cancer organizations concluded that processed meats increase the risk of colorectal cancer by 21 percent for every 50 grams of processed meat consumed daily (a 50-gram serving is about the size of a typical hot dog). As with all carcinogens, longer exposure probably means greater risk. That's why it's so important to get hot dogs and other processed meats out of the school lunch line and help kids develop healthy eating habits that can protect them from cancer later in life.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slice of Americana</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were glad to see the Post-Dispatch cover &quot;Deadly 'dogs'&quot; (Aug. 29). And we couldn't agree more with the paper's opinion that eating hot dogs is OK, as long as you save them for an occasional treat. We feel that eating hot dogs is a heavenly slice of Americana, a pastime worth savoring and saving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hot dog has a storied history in St. Louis. Wasn't it at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition (World's Fair) that some ingenious food vendor had the idea to put the wiener and the bun together and created the original hot dog? And St. Louis is home to many long-time restaurants and establishments that regale and revere the hot dog to cult status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advice that Virginia should ask that Mom, Dad and the lunch lady &quot;serve good-quality dogs, not cheapos&quot; is right on the money. We invite Virginia to join us at ToastedRav.com's &quot;Tour de Frankfurter,&quot; a quest to eat 24 hot dogs in 24 places within 24 hours on Sept. 11. We will share the joy and pleasure of eating hot dogs. We'll even spring for a hot dog for Virginia's lunch lady.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big enough to lose</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're not big enough to lose, you're not big enough to run,&quot; are words I remember my dad saying when he ran for a second term in Congress. He never sold out. I'm deeply saddened to see national political aspirants who are willing to twist in any direction in order to win.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whiners and empathizers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his column &quot;Is it as simple as: Democrats care and Republicans don't?&quot; (Sept. 2), Paul Krugman hit the ball out of the park. A great difference exists between Democratic and Republican leaders of today. The Democrats have compassion and empathy for those who desperately need help, such as those without health insurance. Republicans believe that those people who need help are just a bunch of whiners. If they need health care, just let them go to an emergency room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does America want four more years of President George W. Bush's policies of astronomical tax cuts for the rich and to heck with everybody else? Hope is the mother of all men and women. Democrats bring us hope for a compassionate, competent and equitable America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dick Reeves | Kirkwood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Informed decisions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain's central arguments is that his experience helps inform better decision-making and judgment. His hurried choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to be his vice presidential running mate is a clear indicator of his decision-making ability. Embarrassing revelations are coming by the minute. She's not been truthful so far (her statements about opposing the &quot;bridge to nowhere are discredited by 2006 reports and quotes). And it looks as if Mr. McCain's team never really looked into Ms. Palin's record. Reports from the Anchorage, Alaska, newspapers indicate the Republicans arrived after her selection to look into Ms. Palin's record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This &quot;shoot from the hip&quot; decision-making is consistent with Mr. McCain's past, and it proves fairly conclusively that he lacks the temperament and judgment needed for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Osborn | Olivette</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Odious comparison</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can R.J. Matson continue to get it so completely wrong? His Aug. 28 editorial cartoon, &quot;Backstage at the DNC Convention,&quot; is the latest example. Comparing Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee for president, to Abraham Lincoln and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is laughable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most obvious gaffe is that both Lincoln and King were Republicans. Why would they be celebrating at the Democratic National Convention? Lincoln used U.S. blood and treasure to unite the country and abolish slavery; King used his faith in Jesus and his moral strength to abolish the Democratic party's Jim Crow laws. Mr. Obama wants to take away our freedoms with high taxes and odious regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a television draw, John McCain was every bit the equal of Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP presidential candidate attracted roughly the same number of viewers to his convention acceptance speech Thursday as Obama did before the Democrats last week, according to Nielsen Media Research. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican convention was the most-watched convention on television ever, beating a standard set by the Democrats a week earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's ratings, with an average of 34.5 million viewers watching the GOP convention over three days, proved people are becoming more interested in what the Republicans have to say. The Democrats had an average audience of 30.2 million over four days, Nielsen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one really thought they had it in them in terms of pulling off this amazing convention,&quot; said Jay Wallace, vice president for news and editorial at Fox News Channel. But Hurricane Gustav pulled people into the news networks over the weekend, he said. People also were intensely curious about McCain's pick of Sarah Palin as a running mate, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nielsen said that 38.9 million people watched McCain accept the GOP nomination Thursday on either ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel or MSNBC. PBS, which has a more imprecise estimate based on samples in a few big cities, said 3.5 million watched on its network. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Obama's speech in Denver was seen by 38.4 million on 10 commercial networks, and an additional 4 million on PBS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's McCain, 42.4 million, to Obama, 42.4 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one can really tell who truly had the biggest audience, because C-SPAN also showed the speeches, and Nielsen doesn't measure the channel's viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain caught a break Thursday when the opening NFL game between the New York Giants and Washington Redskins finished a few minutes before he took the stage, Wallace said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More men (17.9 million) watched McCain speak than watched Obama (16.2 million), Nielsen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox was the most-watched network all three nights of the GOP convention, duplicating its feat from the 2004 GOP convention. CNN was the most popular destination for Obama's speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox had 9.2 million viewers for McCain's speech, followed by NBC - which aired the football game - at 8.7 million. ABC, CBS, CNN and MSNBC followed in order, Nielsen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday's edition of Fox's &quot;The O'Reilly Factor,&quot; featuring the first part of Bill O'Reilly's interview with Obama, was the second-highest rated edition of his show ever, topped by a night in March 2003 when the Iraq war was breaking out.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Danforth decries attacks on Palin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., said attacks lobbed at Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin remind him of the criticism hurled at Clarence Thomas after he was nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1991. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Danforth, who used to be Thomas' boss in the Missouri attorney general's office, led the contentious Senate fight that won Thomas' confirmation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is very reminiscent of what was done to Clarence - off-the-wall attacks,'' said Danforth, referring to left-wing bloggers, some women's groups and media inquiries into Palin's personal life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They want to smash her as a person,'' he said, adding: &quot;She's tough ... she won't be smashed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MINNEAPOLIS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin points finger at Obama's supporters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a fundraising letter Thursday, Palin blamed supporters of the Democratic presidential ticket for spreading &quot;misinformation and flat-out lies&quot; about her and her family. &quot;The Obama-Biden Democrats have been vicious in their attacks directed toward me, my family and John McCain,&quot; the letter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Palin's spokeswoman later said Barack Obama's campaign was not responsible. That campaign has raised questions about Palin's qualifications, but Obama himself has said her family should be off-limits. He also said he would fire any staffer who talks about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked who was to blame, the spokeswoman said, &quot;You want me to tick through all the stuff that's been ticking through all the blogs the past few days? &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community organizers defend themselves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angry community organizers defended their work, and that of former organizer Obama, as they fought back Thursday against speakers at the Republican National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers described their jobs as helping powerless people join forces to demand better schools and safer streets, often by working through churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday night, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani referred to Obama's organizing work as &quot;the first problem on the r&eacute;sum&eacute;.&quot; Palin, a former mayor, said: &quot;I guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a community organizer, except that you have actual responsibilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin's TV audience on par with Obama's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 41 million people tuned in to the Republican convention Wednesday to hear vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That audience rivaled the one for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama last week. Nielsen Media Research estimated 37.2 million people watched Palin on either ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel or MSNBC. PBS estimated it had four million viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama had 38.4 million viewers on commercial networks, and 40 million with PBS and C-SPAN included.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are bigger audiences than the &quot;American Idol&quot; finale or the Academy Awards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viewers were far more interested in Palin than Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden, whose speech was seen by an estimated 24 million people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independents will be key in vote, poll finds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A National Journal poll released Tuesday showed something remarkable for this stage of the campaign: 85 percent of Republicans are firmly for John McCain and 84 percent of Democrats are squarely behind Barack Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That commitment leads pollsters to conclude that this election will be decided by independents and a relatively small number of voters in the middle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Missouri and other battleground states, the candidates' best route to those voters - and perhaps to victory in November - is connecting on the cluster of economic issues that are worrying the public, analysts said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vetting of Palin was thorough, McCain says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain said Tuesday he's satisfied that Sarah Palin's background was properly checked out before the Alaska governor joined the Republican ticket. He predicted that public excitement about her candidacy will increase after her address to the GOP convention tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain visited firehouses in Ohio and Pennsylvania on Tuesday, and was due to arrive at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minn., today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about whether Palin's background was thoroughly checked out before he selected her, McCain told reporters in Philadelphia: &quot;The vetting process was completely thorough, and I'm grateful for the results.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASILLA, ALASKA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bristol's boyfriend heads to the GOP convention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bristol Palin's boyfriend plans to join the family of the Republican vice presidential candidate at the GOP convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Levi Johnston's mother said her 18-year-old son left Alaska on Tuesday morning to join the Palin family in St. Paul, Minn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sherry Johnston also said there has been no pressure put on her son to marry Bristol Palin, the pregnant daughter of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Absolutely not,&quot; Sherry Johnston told reporters. Johnston said the two teens already had plans to marry before they knew she was pregnant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest Obama, McCain ads highlight familiar themes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama and John McCain punched up the themes that will drive the fall presidential campaign in new and expanded commercial spots airing Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama linked McCain to President George W. Bush. McCain portrayed Obama and congressional Democrats as heralds of higher taxes and increased spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BLOOMINGTON, MINN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romney says he's 'not disappointed at all'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney said Tuesday he was &quot;not disappointed at all&quot; at being passed over for the Republican vice presidential nomination, and also said he wouldn't be interested in a Cabinet post in a McCain administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish I were the Republican presidential nominee,&quot; Romney said before addressing Massachusetts delegates to the Republican National Convention. &quot;That's what I fought hard for, but you know, John McCain won fair and square. I salute him for that, congratulate him for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Briefly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Missouri's role: Missouri will be among five states to formally nominate Sen. John McCain for president this evening. That vote initially had been planned for Monday, then Tuesday due to Hurricane Gustav but was moved again when the hurricane damage was less than feared.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next 65 days, Americans will be presented with two very different visions of the role of government, one anchored in the verities of the past, the other urging something that hasn't been tried for a while.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first will be articulated by Sen. John McCain of Arizona, an old warrior who embodies duty, honor and country. At his side will Sarah Palin, moose-hunting mom and daughter of the Alaskan frontier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next four days at their convention in St. Paul, Minn., Republicans will nominate Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin as president and vice president. They'll offer a kind of post-feminist John Wayne vision of America as a place where rugged individuals will continue to unleash the forces of creative capitalism as they've always done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second vision will be articulated by Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, the personification of a new polyglot, transracial America, and Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, who's been agitating for change for most of his 65 years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week in Denver, the Democrats nominated the Obama-Biden ticket as ready, indeed eager, to remake America - in Mr. Obama's words - as &quot;one American family,&quot; where the highest goal is the common good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race is on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The messages are shorthand, and the whole truth is far more complicated and nuanced than the message makers would have us believe. America is 300 million people with almost that many sets of interests. The electorate will be sliced, diced and microtargeted in a million ways between now and Nov. 4, the messages amplified and distorted by hundreds of millions of dollars worth of television commercials. Much of the message won't stand up to scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider Mr. McCain's choice of Ms. Palin as his running mate, Calamity Jane to his Wild Bill Hickok. Here's the standard bearer of the party whose base is old white men choosing a young woman as his running mate, a bold attempt to capitalize on cracks inside that happy Democratic family. Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York, in perhaps the best speech of her political career, did her best last week to spackle over those cracks, but it remains to be seen whether the patches will hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is insulting to think that Mrs. Clinton's only attraction to voters was her gender. And aside from their paired X chromosomes, Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Palin appear to have little in common. The former has been in politics most of her life, the latter only since 1992, when she joined the Wasilla, Alaska, City Council the same year Mrs. Clinton was helping her husband become president of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One is pro-choice; the other pro-life. One is anathema to family-values voters; the other is a champion. One was a feminist lawyer; the other was elected Miss Congeniality in the 1984 Miss Alaska contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Palin's elective experience is limited to town politics in Wasilla, an Anchorage suburb with a population of 8,471, and 20 months as governor of a state with two-thirds the population of St. Louis County. So in his first presidential-level decision, John McCain placed her in position to be within one beat of a 72-year-old heart from the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And to think, the motto of the Republican Convention is &quot;Country First.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain may have done the Democrats a favor in selecting Ms. Palin. By comparison, with eight years in the Illinois Senate and four in the United States Senate, Mr. Obama now looks like a grizzled veteran. His choice of Mr. Biden, a 36-year Senate veteran, looks ... dare we say it ... presidential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to Mrs. Clinton's graciousness, however belated, the Democrats managed to get out of Denver looking unified. Their convention was carefully choreographed to allow all the fractious elements of the party a moment in the sun, though plenty of sunscreen was applied. When Rep. Jose Serrano from the Bronx submitted the text for the speech he delivered at Monday's session for approval, the Obama campaign scrubbed it of the line, &quot;let us build bridges of friendship and cooperation with our Southern neighbors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No sense raising the sticky issue of immigration reform, particularly as Mr. McCain himself supports (or at least he used to) giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to U.S. citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bigger problem for the Democrats this fall is the very audaciousness of what Mr. Obama represents. Not only is he the first African-American to be nominated for president by a major party, but also he is challenging Americans to confront change and embrace it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His speech Thursday night was not soaring rhetoric but a litany of the dislocation that Americans feel: &quot;[O]ur nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil and the American promise has been threatened once more. Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay and tuition that's beyond your reach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama dealt forthrightly with the fact that fundamental assumptions of the last 50 years have been shaken: Gasoline no longer is cheap and plentiful, good jobs are disappearing and higher education may be out of reach for many families. Economic models aren't holding, social boundaries are falling and African-Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian-Americans are crowding the table, which feels threatening to those whose own place at the table no longer feels secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His message was that America has to change and adapt and build a bigger table to contain what he called &quot;the promise of America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden will spend the fall laying the blame for America's failure to adapt on President George W. Bush, and by extension, on Mr. McCain. They will try to sell the notion, embodied in Mr. Obama himself, that Americans of every race share common goals and aspirations and that government has a role in helping us achieve those goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our government should work for us, not against us,&quot; he said. &quot;It should help us, not hurt us. It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who is willing to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the promise of America, the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not a new vision for America, but it is one that has fallen on hard times in the last 40 years. The &quot;Me Generation&quot; did damage to it in the 1960s and 1970s; the Reagan revolution undermined it in the 1980s; the booming economic times in the 1990s made it less pressing; and the Bush administration of this decade all but killed it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin have the easier job, selling the idea that we can have change without changing very much, that the market will cure our ills with just a tweak here and there, that if government would just stay out the way, the good ship America will right itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These two threads - the common good and individual rights - have run through American history since the Pilgrims hit our shores. Balancing them always has been the trick. It remains so this fall.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON, Pa.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain showed off his vice presidential running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania Saturday as Democratic rival Barack Obama's campaign aired a new TV ad urging voters not be distracted by McCain putting a woman on the GOP ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten thousand people filled the stands and infield of Southwestern Pennsylvania's 3,200-seat Consol Energy Park - home of independent baseball's Washington Wild Things - to see McCain introduce his running mate. Palin is only the second woman in American history to be a vice presidential candidate from a major party. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had a lot of good people to choose from,&quot; McCain told the enthusiastic crowd. &quot;I have found the right partner. ... I found someone who has accomplished reform, who has accomplished and managed a multibillion-dollar budget and fought against corruption and the failed politics of the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin told the crowd she's not interested in being vice president to maintain the status quo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't get into government to do the safe and easy thing,&quot; she said. &quot;It's like the that old adage 'A ship in harbor is safe, but that's not why the ship is built.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin repeated many of the lines she delivered in her introductory speech Friday in Dayton, Ohio, including remarks praising Sen. Hillary Clinton for breaking the political glass ceiling and collecting 18 million votes in the Democratic presidential primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But where the Clinton line drew cheers in Dayton, it was lustily booed in this town, located about 30 miles southwest of Pittsburgh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain and Palin were headed to St. Louis later Saturday and were to appear at a rally Sunday in O'Fallon, Mo. Later Sunday, the candidates planned to fly to Mississippi to check on people preparing for Hurricane Gustav.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats' ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and running mate Joe Biden, meanwhile, stumped in Ohio Saturday. At the same time, their campaign unveiled a 30-second national TV ad that says McCain's selection of Palin should not obscure the fact that McCain candidacy represents a continuation of President George W. Bush's policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, while this may be his running mate,&quot; an announcer says with a photo of Palin on the screen, &quot;America knows this is McCain's agenda.&quot; The visual then switches to a shot of McCain and Bush. &quot;We can't afford four more years of the same.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama himself offered a noncommittal assessment of Palin during a television interview released Saturday. Speaking during a taping of CBS' &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; Obama said of Palin, &quot;Obviously, she's a fine mother and an up and coming public servant&quot; but added &quot;It's too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate she'll be. My sense is that she subscribes to John McCain's agenda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and Biden hit the diner circuit in Ohio before attending a funeral service in Cleveland for the late U.S. Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones. The Ohio Democrat was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and a staunch support of Hillary Clinton during the primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama told reporters he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about the threat of Hurricane Gustav to New Orleans and had asked his staff to monitor the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said in a taped segment of &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; that this week's Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minn., might be trimmed or altered because of the threat from the storm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cahokia Mounds site is doing quite well under state control</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Proposal may incite turf war&quot; (Aug. 24): So, a couple of out-of-town academics want to move decision-making for Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site from Springfield, Ill., to Washington, D.C. Professors Thomas Emerson and Timothy Paukatet fawn over the alleged superiority of the National Park System and claim Illinois' stewardship is lacking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are there no resource issues in the National Park Service? As a visitor to the National Parks from 1952 to the present, I can catalog a litany of neglect and disrepair in our nation's parks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, an NPS contractor recruited and imported young people for seasonal work from Singapore, among other places. Young Americans who might live near the parks were denied jobs in their homeland. Do the professors favor such distortion, pirating of resources and intrusion into America's heartland? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Visitors' Center at Mesa Verde National Park, there is no access for mobility-challenged people. Do the professors favor excluding the differently abled from the experience of Cahokia Mounds as well?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a volunteer for more than seven years at the Cahokia Mounds exhibit area, I have heard appreciation and praise from visitors from around the world. One gentleman from the Washington, D.C., area compared the museum favorably to ones he had visited in Beijing and Moscow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the professors really want to enrich the site, let them buy a table at the Museum Society's next trivia night. Otherwise, they would do well to stay within their area of expertise: archeology. The suggestion to transfer &quot;the Mounds&quot; to the National Park Service is clumsy and ill-informed. It does not satisfy the needs of the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard V. Wagner | Highland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like flies to honey</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A developer is calling on Affton (&quot;Developer eyes Affton, seeks to buy businesses, 120 homes,&quot; Aug. 19). You almost can hear him saying, &quot;Hello, Affton. You have such a nice climate, I would like to visit for awhile. If I enjoy my stay, I might even buy homes and businesses. I might make part of Gravois a 'commercial destination point.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis County Councilman John Campisi expects that some form of economic incentive would be offered, possibly tax increment financing. Mr. Campisi said, &quot;I would not support this plan unless residents are offered at least one-and-a-half times the 2007 assessed value of their homes.&quot; Mr. Campisi should have told the homeowners and business people, &quot;Remember Sunset Hills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Property owners should sign no papers and make no comment until they have a certified check in their hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the developer, Mr. Campisi should say, &quot;Show me the money first; then we will talk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sunset Hills homeowners bought new homes and committed to new mortgages, only to learn the developer had no money. What happened to those folks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri's revised eminent domain laws are not property-rights friendly. As the law now is written, Missouri will attract out-of-state developers like flies to honey. We can stop eminent domain abuse only by changing the state constitution. And soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aim Calzone | Manchester</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life's injustices</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is one of life's injustices that young men must fight the wars that older men begin. To a great extent, therefore, the lives and hopes of the present student generation turn on the wisdom and judgment of the men of an older generation to whom the people have entrusted political power. Surely, considering what they have at stake, it is not improper for young people to question the wisdom and judgment of the makers of our foreign policy. Surely it is the right of citizens in a democracy, especially citizens of military age, to ascertain that the great decisions of war and peace are made with care and deliberation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The calling of public men to account unquestionably adds to their burdens, but the convenience of policy-makers is not sufficient reason to shut down public discussion. The responsibilities of high office are burdensome, indeed, but they are borne, let it be remembered, by men who actively sought or freely accepted them, men who accepted not only the obligation to use power, but also the obligation to account for its use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edward Johnson | St. James, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haters and traitors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gratitude to President George W. Bush for his unrelenting courage in keeping America from being attacked again on his watch is ingrained deeply in many of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disaster might have ensued if we had left Saddam Hussein available to al-Qaida. That would have been very dangerous to all Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If our military had been allowed to respond as the Greatest Generation did in World War II, the war would have ended almost immediately, with little bloodshed and cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition to Mr. Bush has been demeaning and unintelligent. If you find fault, you must have proof, not repeated lies from haters and losers. The opposition's contribution has been hate rather than help. They prevented Mr. Bush from performing in the best interest of our country. Lies embolden the enemy and should be challenged in court during war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura Bush, are among the finest people on this planet. They do not express anger. I hope that their kind always will be there for us. It is left for historians to decide about haters and the traitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Barry | Town and Country</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Objectifying behavior</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As usual, Colleen Carroll Campbell conveniently ignores a wide swath of reality while lecturing to us about how important values are in our political world (&quot;McCain's clarity trumps Obama's dexterity,&quot; Aug. 21). Apparently, in Ms. Campbell's worldview, ignoring the Ten Commandments is fine in a politician just as long as he votes pro-life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She wrote, &quot;McCain seized opportunities to articulate a conservative philosophy of ... traditional values.&quot; Mr. McCain just recently offered up his wife in a topless beauty contest. At the Saddleback forum, Mr. McCain mentioned his admitted adultery, which Ms. Campbell doesn't mention, even though her previous columns defend marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Bible makes it clear to avoid even the appearance of wrongdoing, and so the parade of conservative pundits refuse to talk about Mr. McCain's staff's worrying over his relationship with a lobbyist so much that they intervened to stop the behavior. And Mr. McCain doesn't deny using pejorative words toward his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though it was ignored as if it didn't happen, Mr. McCain offered up his wife in an objectifying, lewd contest and was quite clear about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marian Boston | Edwardsville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unconventional coverage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I reluctantly left the sports department to become the Post-Dispatch's first television columnist in the 1970s - my beloved NBA Hawks had been sold to Atlanta - I wasn't much good at reporting inter-station rivalries and gossip, but I did devote an inordinate amount of time and space to KETC (Channel 9) and public television. I never was prouder of that effort than when I watched PBS coverage of the Democratic National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When my wife and I fled NBC's &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; at 7 p.m. on Aug. 25 and found the convention coverage on KETC, we stayed. We saw three hours of interesting reporting by reliable, trusted newsmen and never were tempted to switch to the commercial networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Way to go PBS. My, how you've grown!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John J. Archibald | Webster Groves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heartwarming sympathy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isn't it heartwarming to observe the outpouring of sympathy and compassion from Republicans toward Hillary Clinton and her followers? These are the same people who dragged the Clintons through the mud for eight solid years. Do they really think the American voters are that stupid?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alfred Scherer | Mehlville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DNC morality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats cleaned things up to show they can claim the high ground in morality. It is almost certain that today's professional reporters will seize upon this to show the &quot;new Democrats.&quot; One can only wait with bated breath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrats suddenly have developed a keen sense of morality. Former U.S. senator and presidential candidate John Edwards was denied the opportunity to make a speech the Democratic Convention because he had an extramarital affair and lied about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still welcome to speak, though, was former President Bill Clinton.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain picks his No. 2 but stays tight-lipped</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain decided on a running mate early Thursday, and one top prospect, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, abruptly canceled numerous public appearances. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona senator will appear with his No. 2 at an Ohio rally today, aides said, though they provided no details on whom McCain had picked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others believed to be in contention for the No. 2 slot on the GOP ticket included former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who was meeting with donors throughout California, and Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who was vacationing on New York's Long Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, too, was still a possibility, as was the idea that McCain would choose a dark horse from any number of names that have circulated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Close race is due to fear of change, Gore says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Gore told Democrats Thursday night that the 2008 election is close because defenders of the status quo &quot;are desperately afraid of the change Barack Obama represents.&quot; And the former vice president said he knows something about close elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gore said that if he had been elected in 2000, the United States would not be bogged down in Iraq or facing &quot;a self-inflicted economic crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain ... is now openly endorsing the policies of the Bush-Cheney White House and promising to actually continue them, the same policies all over again.&quot; Gore said he's for recycling, &quot;but that's ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama supporters push for new voters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the hours before Obama made his entrance, supporters at Invesco Field were asked to text messages and make phone calls from specially tailored call sheets as part of an unprecedented effort to mobilize voters and get nonvoters to register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign has identified 55 million voting age Americans across the country who are not registered to vote. Campaign officials estimate more than two-thirds would vote for Obama.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain congratulates Obama in TV ad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain is airing a one-evening-only ad with a simple message for Barack Obama: &quot;Job well done.&quot; The ad coincides with Obama's nomination acceptance speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad was to run Thursday on national cable television before and after Obama's address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain says: &quot;Senator Obama, this is truly a good day for America. Too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed. So I wanted to stop and say, congratulations. How perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day. Tomorrow, we'll be back at it. But tonight Senator, job well done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Briefly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- More than 84,000 people jammed into Invesco Field at Mile High stadium to hear Barack Obama's historic acceptance speech, city officials said. The stadium normally holds 76,125, but additional seats were placed on the football field where the Denver Broncos play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden made an unscheduled appearance at the stadium. His assignment was to precede a lineup of Democrats from many walks of life to help set up Obama's speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">671 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of all the 23 gazillion words written, uttered, blogged, Twittered, texted, broadcast, cablecast, uploaded or downloaded during the first day of the Democratic National Convention, here are some of the more prescient:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Humorist Dave Barry, writing for The National Journal Online: &quot;Sen. [Hillary] Clinton is scheduled to address the convention Tuesday night, when she will either call her supporters to unite behind [Barack] Obama, or attempt to snatch the nomination and escape with it by helicopter to a secret mountain fortress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- An unnamed &quot;senior Obama supporter&quot; tells Politico.com that aides to Mrs. Clinton negotiating over her role at the convention act &quot;like Japanese soldiers in the South Pacific still fighting after the war is over.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as the Democrats in Denver try to bring unity to their fractious party (the convention's slogan, according to Mr. Barry, is, &quot;A Unified Party, United in Unity, Together as One, Undivided&quot;), the party's genetic coding for self-destruction was taking over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, the Gallup Organization released a poll saying that fewer than half of those who supported Sen. Clinton of New York during the primaries said they definitely will vote for Sen. Obama of Illinois in November. Forty-seven percent of Mrs. Clinton's supporters said they are solidly behind Mr. Obama; another 23 percent said their support is soft. Thirty percent said they'd vote for Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona or sit out the election altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party's impressive response team was ready with a campaign spot featuring a Clinton supporter who now supports Mr. McCain, as well as a second spot questioning why Mr. Obama chose Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware over Mrs. Clinton as his running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of which suggests that when she speaks tonight in prime time, Mrs. Clinton will have the important role in the convention that she demanded, although not the precise one she wanted. She will have to be an agent of unity. Given her Bataan Death March primary campaign, it's not a role that fits her very well. She'll have to be a lot more persuasive - and, we dare say, sincere - than she has been to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most voters alive today can't remember when the nominating conventions last included any meaningful suspense, when ballot followed ballot and floor whips twisted arms and made outrageous promises in return for votes. Today's conventions (of both parties) belong to marketers and message experts, to say nothing of the corporate lobbyists who tiptoe through new ethics rules (bagels for breakfast, OK; eggs for breakfast, not OK; quesadillas con queso, OK; quesadillas con carne, not OK) in wining and dining the powerful and the would-be powerful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political junkies have the opportunity to overdose on this all day long (Wow! Claire McCaskill!) on cable networks and websites. But the true public work of the convention is reserved for the prime-time hour between 9 and 10 p.m. each night (Central time) when the broadcast networks beam convention events to a mass audience. Michelle Obama, the candidate's wife, got last night's key slot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday night went to Mrs. Clinton; her husband, the former president, is scheduled for a non-prime-time slot on Wednesday, playing second fiddle to Mr. Biden, presented to the world early Saturday morning as Mr. Obama's choice as running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a solid choice. Those who know Mr. Biden only for his self-indulgent rhetorical excesses are missing one of the brightest minds in the U.S. Senate. He is a formidable campaigner; quick on his feet and deft with the needle. His foreign policy experience fills a gaping hole in Mr. Obama's bona fides. At least 90 percent of a president's job lies in picking smart, independent people to carry out his policies. If a President Obama's appointments are as good as Candidate Obama's first appointment, the nation would be well served.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But first there is a campaign to be waged and an election to be won. What Mrs. Clinton says tonight - and how she says it - could have a great deal of bearing on that.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe said in a sidewalk interview Monday that it wasn't his idea to withdraw all those Democratic workers from Missouri in October 2004 - an act that essentially ceded the state to Republican George W. Bush, who handily carried the state a few weeks later. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McAuliffe said the pullout was the decision of the losing Democrat, John Kerry, who moved most of his Missouri forces to Colorado, where he thought he might have a last-minute shot. He didn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't want it to be done,&quot; McAuliffe said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durbin pushed Obama to run, still counsels him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illinois' &quot;other&quot; senator, Dick Durbin, has a close, mentoring relationship with his fellow Illinoisan, Barack Obama. He recalls counseling Obama to think about running for president not long after Obama's seminal speech to the last Democratic convention four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In politics, you can pick a time, but the moment has chosen you,&quot; Durbin recalls telling Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His advice to Obama now is to get busy with the pocketbook issues people care about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My recommendation to the campaign is to get as close to street level as possible,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain called rival Barack Obama his &quot;very honorable opponent&quot; on Monday as he began a busy week of low-key events while Democrats prepared to nominate Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain visited the Phoenix high school where his wife, Cindy, graduated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain, who turns 72 on Friday, got a boost from Daddy Yankee, a Puerto Rican star of reggaeton, a mix of reggae, rap and Latin music styles. Students squealed with delight as Yankee appeared and endorsed McCain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama&nbsp;ad replies to one about ties to radical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama has quietly begun airing a television ad countering an outside group that is spending $2.8 million in an attempt to highlight his recent relationship with a former 1960s radical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-second TV spot is a response to an ad by the conservative American Issues Project, a nonprofit group that questions Obama's ties to William Ayers, a founder of the Weather Underground organization that took credit for a series of bombings, including nonfatal explosions at the Pentagon and U.S. Capitol four decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With all our problems, why is John McCain talking about the '60s, trying to link Barack Obama to radical Bill Ayers?&quot; the Obama&nbsp;ad states. &quot;McCain knows Obama denounced Ayers' crimes, committed when Obama was just 8 years old.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexi Giannoulias, the first-term treasurer of Illinois, was one of several speakers Monday night before the prime-time addresses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the biggest audience he had ever faced, yet Giannoulias, 32, said before the speech that he felt calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like I should be more worried,&quot; he said as he walked into the Pepsi Center.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without women, Democrats can't win. Missouri Democratic delegate Kristy Manning of St. Peters knows it, and so does her party's presumptive presidential nominee, Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The importance of female voters to Democrats has been a given since 1980, when experts began realizing that women as a bloc tend to lean Democratic, in some cases by double digits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And because women have cast a majority of the nation's presidential votes since 1964, their strong preference for a particular Democrat can help that candidate weather the usual leanings of male voters toward Republicans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, if female voters defect in large numbers, the Democrat loses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a key reason why so many of this year's convention events in Denver celebrate and promote the rising political influence of women since they garnered the right to vote 88 years ago today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The importance of female voters also helps explain why Obama and the Democratic Party can't afford to ignore the lingering concerns - and in some cases outright anger - expressed by some supporters of Obama's last major rival for the nomination, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of women did believe that this was going to be 'Year of the Woman,'&quot; said state Sen. Joan Bray, D-University City, one of Missouri's Clinton delegates at the convention. &quot;When a lot of expectations are made and not met, there's some threshing about as a result.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi acknowledged to reporters that Democrats are not yet united after the bitter primary fight. &quot;But to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others are more blunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of girls are pissed,&quot; said Democratic consultant Judi Roman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roman is among dozens of St. Louis area Clinton supporters who aren't delegates but made the trip to Denver anyway to cheer her on during tonight's prime-time speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton and Obama were working out a deal to give her some votes in the Democratic roll call for president. Democratic officials involved in the negotiations said Monday that the plan calls for a state-by-state vote for the presidential nomination Wednesday night, with delegates casting their ballots for Clinton or Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the voting would be cut off after several states, the officials said, perhaps ending with New York, when Clinton herself would call for nomination of Obama by acclamation from the convention floor.Manning, the St. Peters delegate, says she hopes tonight's celebration of Clinton's second-place finish and her expected endorsement of Obama will persuade her supporters to follow suit. But Manning, 29, observed that resentment is particularly strong among older women who see Clinton's defeat &quot;through the prism of all they had to face growing up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Betty Van Uum, a Democrat and the first woman elected to the St. Louis County Council in the 1970s, recalls how she and other party activists worked so hard to force through the decades-old requirement that at least half of the Democrats' presidential delegates be women. The national Republican Party doesn't have that mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it's not just Clinton's defeat that upsets some of her allies in St. Louis. Feelings are still raw, said Roman, from the narrow loss Aug. 5 of another Democratic woman, state Rep. Margaret Donnelly, in the party's contest for Missouri attorney general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Uum, like Bray, emphasized that she will vote for Obama. But Van Uum recounted the private talk she has heard from other Clinton supporters who won't back him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's stunning to me, the level of their fury,&quot; Van Uum said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., says she has felt the brunt of some of that anger since she decided months ago to endorse Obama instead of Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's fair to say that a number of my supporters are upset with me,&quot; said McCaskill, who also addressed the convention Monday night. &quot;I'm not sure some will ever enthusiastically support me again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCaskill agrees that Obama risks defeat in November if Clinton's women supporters don't embrace his candidacy. For that reason, she said, the candidate and all Democrats must emphasize the stakes if Republican John McCain is elected president instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has opposed efforts to protect women from discrimination in pay, and to expand access to day care and early childhood education. He also opposes abortion rights, an important issue to many Democratic women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yolanda Wheat, vice chairwoman of the Missouri Democratic Party, was neutral during the primary contest but now backs Obama. She says party leaders &quot;have got to forcefully and effectively address the issues that women care about on a daily basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such concerns include the rising costs of milk and gasoline, and the growing lack of access to health care, Wheat said. &quot;Those concerns aren't exclusive to women, but they will greatly influence who they vote for in November.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign says he will attract more female voters with his promise to keep taxes low and his strong stance on national security issues. McCain also has begun to reach out to Clinton's supporters with a new TV ad that recounts some of her criticisms of Obama during their primary fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said in a briefing Monday to reporters from targeted battleground states, including Missouri, that the Democratic ticket plans to make it clear to female voters in stark terms what they risk if McCain wins. He cited McCain's anti-abortion statements at the Saddleback Forum, where he also pledged to appoint more socially conservative judges to the U.S. Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail Elble, president of the St. Louis Stonewall Democrats, a gay-rights group, said her fears about McCain's potential Supreme Court appointments are a major reason why she will vote for Obama - despite her lingering resentment over the party's treatment of Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for now, Elble - sporting a vest packed with pro-Democrat and pro-Clinton campaign buttons - says she can't bring herself to campaign for Obama. No pro-Obama button is on her vest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explained Elble with a sigh, &quot;I'm not there yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Joe Biden has emerged as the clear favorite among Democrats to be Barack Obama's running mate for his understanding of foreign policy in grave global times and his fighting spirit against the rival Republican ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is keeping his decision quiet, but his staff in Chicago and party activists who await a decision are buzzing about Biden in large part because he can address two of Obama's biggest weaknesses - his lack of experience, especially on world affairs, and his reluctance to go on the attack. The speculation among Democrats is less of an indicator of whether Biden will ultimately be Obama's pick, and more of a recognition of the challenges their candidate faces at this pivotal moment in the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama plans to appear with his newly selected running mate Saturday, with the pick announced via text message to supporters. Obama also is widely thought to be considering Govs. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas and Tim Kaine of Virginia, and Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden, 65, was first elected to represent Delaware in 1972. He is a charismatic and hard-charging campaigner with a compelling personal story - his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident a few weeks after he was first elected, but two sons survived serious injuries in the same crash. Biden commuted home to Wilmington daily from the Senate to care for them. The older son, Beau, is now Delaware's attorney general and a National Guard member whose unit is being deployed to Iraq in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden got another scare 10 years ago, when two brain aneurysms kept him out of the Senate for several months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden returned Monday from a trip to Georgia at the invitation of the embattled country's president, a well-timed reminder of the value he could bring to Obama's ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's GOP rival John McCain brings a military background and leadership on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Obama only has served three years in Washington, but Biden is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on which he has served for 33 years. Polls show the race between Obama and GOP rival John McCain tightening, and Obama is responding by stepping up his attacks in speeches and commercials targeted to key states. Obama has never been entirely comfortable going negative, a move that threatens his call for civility in politics, but Biden has never shied from a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden is &quot;passionate, he's articulate and he's persuasive,&quot; said Democratic consultant Steve McMahon, among those who consider Biden Obama's smartest pick. &quot;I think he would do for Senator Obama what Lyndon Johnson did for John Kennedy. He's got serious foreign policy experience, a long and distinguished Senate r&eacute;sum&eacute; and he is one of the most effective surrogates that Senator Obama has right now who can go toe-to-toe with any Republican on any issue at any time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama could have been describing Biden when he said in a speech Tuesday that he wants his running mate to be &quot;somebody who is mad right now&quot; about the state of the economy, an independent who will speak out when he's wrong and help him through major issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">obama barbs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Democratic primary when he also ran for the presidential nomination, Biden often made the most memorable impression in debates even though he was barely registering in the polls. He got big laughs for accusing Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani of mentioning three things in every sentence - &quot;a noun, a verb, and 9/11&quot; - and also leveled barbs at Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he didn't think Obama was ready to be president, saying it's &quot;not something that lends itself to on-the-job training.&quot; He offended some blacks when he tried to compliment Obama as &quot;the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean.&quot; He dropped out of the race after a poor showing in Iowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans would be sure to revive Biden's criticisms of Obama and already envision a line of attack that says Obama is so inexperienced he needs a running mate who has been in Washington longer than McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden is famous for being able to talk at length - sometimes a mind-numbing length - on any topic, but he has enhanced his standing in the vice presidential race by avoiding discussion of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden bluntly acknowledged that he'd take the job if asked, while jokingly warning Obama might not want him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I made it clear to him and everybody else, I never worked for anybody in my life,&quot; he told reporters last month. &quot;I got here when I was 29. I never had a boss. I don't know how I'd handle it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">LETTERS FROM READERS</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; Pg. C10</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1404 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penalizing hospitals for unavoidable error will harm health care</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most health care providers are dedicated to providing quality care in a compassionate, caring manner. We work with patients and their families for optimal care. We encourage and appreciate patient and family participation to ensure that we are aware of special needs, previously prescribed medication and care routines. Patients and their families always should feel comfortable asking questions about their care so that they understand how we are treating their medical issues and can facilitate safety initiatives to prevent injury or error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial &quot;The economics of error&quot; (Aug. 6) noted that Medicare plans to stop paying doctors and hospitals for extra costs associated with medical errors. Private insurance companies surely will follow. What the editorial failed to point out is that health care providers already are overburdened with more than 47 million uninsured people. Patients are admitted to hospitals with acute and complex medical problems. The resources and reimbursement rates are shrinking, and an ongoing nursing shortage exacerbates quality-of-care concerns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospitals that treat frail or high-risk patients will be penalized. Additional screenings will be done for all patients to identify potential preexisting infections that previously might not have been detected at admission. If you went to the the emergency department with a possible heart attack, would you want me to swab every orifice, draw blood and collect a urine sample before I admit you to the intensive care unit or rush you to the catheterization lab? I would have to do so to protect my hospital's reputation and provide documentation of a preexisting infection before admission or risk losing reimbursement for your care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of reducing or withholding payment for care or complications that are not always preventable, why not applaud efforts to implement best practices? Why not provide funding to train more nurses and nurse educators? Can't we work together to turn the failing health care system around?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Barlett | Alhambra</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not so far away</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was awesome to see 100 Army guys parachuting from two planes at MidAmerica St. Louis Airport near O'Fallon, Ill., last week. The planes made three passes over the airport, and the men floated down from about 1,000 feet. I've only seen that in old war movies. The ceremony was moving, too, with many retired 82nd Airborne paratroopers shaking hands with the new guys and all of them thanking each other for being there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My nephew, Mike, parachuted down with his Advanced Infantry medal in his pocket. He had been awarded the medal earlier that week. After the jump, we congratulated him, and he pulled the medal out of his pocket and gave it to his dad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war can seem very far away until you stand next to someone who has been there, and he hugs you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosemary Kilgore | Oakville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bandits, not kings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A-B chiefs make out like ... bandits. That's what the headline on the story &quot;A-B chiefs to make out like kings&quot; (Aug. 17) should have said. The Anheuser-Busch executives awarded themselves the spoils in the company's surrender. But then, kings and bandits are similar: Both gratify themselves with impunity at others' expense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But is any reward warranted for executives who left A-B prey to its nimbler competitor? Executives justify their inexcusable compensation by claiming just the kind of skill, expertise and foresight that should have averted A-B's submission to InBev. Four hundred million dollars for the noble executives whose failure of leadership left vulnerable an Amercan icon and its employees? This can't be the reward system that Americans believe in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Grote | Creve Coeur</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equal billing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the front page of the Aug. 15 Post-Dispatch were three pictures of Olympic gold medalists, all men. On the first page of the Sports section were two small pictures of women competitors and another huge headline, picture and story about phenomenal gold medlist Michael Phelps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what about the women gold medalists? What about Nastia Liukin, whose breathtakingly exquisite gymnastic performance earned her a gold medal, closely followed by Shawn Johnson for the silver?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about Rebecca Soni, who broke the previously held world record in the women's breaststroke?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is thrilling to watch the superb prowess of our athletes. All of them, female and male, are a source of pride to all Americans. The women - as well as the men - deserve to have their achievements and their photographs given top billing by the Post-Dispatch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Margaret P. Gilleo | Ladue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omitting details</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any progress the Post-Dispatch had made in an objective approach to the presidential election, especially calling out the candidates for manipulating people with lies about offshore drilling, was stripped away with the recent article comparing the candidates on the &quot;energy crunch&quot; (&quot;Quest for energy fix fuels race,&quot; Aug. 10).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of providing readers with an objective look at the facts behind each candidates' proposed energy policies, the article reminded me of listening to the opinions of those who gain their sole political education from watching campaign commercials. The story did not mention presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama's recently released eight-page energy policy plan (readily available for anyone to read online) and the experts' accolade of said plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's energy plan offers details and well-thought economic strategies that Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has failed to offer. I recommend the Post-Dispatch place both candidates' proposed plans in writing, without any convenient omissions, and let the readers formulate their own opinions based on actual facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article painted a wholly inaccurate and incomplete picture of the two candidates' stances on the energy economy. I was disappointed and alarmed that such a biased piece might be printed anywhere other than the editorial page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tim Maher | St. Louis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time to rebuild</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Mink's column &quot;Bush's attack on the law; we will need a long time to heal&quot; (Aug. 13) was a strong and effective analysis of the way the Bush administration has undermined the basic institutions of our democratic government. It should be posted in every college and high school across this land. Before it is too late, the call must come to begin rebuilding our most cherished American instruments of government and remove them from the hands of the political hacks and ideologues planted in every agency in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most damaging is the undermining of our moral outrage and the dilution of our most cherished ideals and practices. We now have a generation of people who assume that we can continue to evade our fiscal responsibilities, do away with the middle class, strip the central government of its authority, stack the courts and politicize the halls of justice, ignore the expert advice of our scientists, substitute pablum for performance in our educational system, continue to borrow from others as we continue our fiscal irresponsibility and wipe out the system of checks and balances, that system of delicate scales that continually adjudicates between the vital interests of powerful elements in our diverse society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don and Mart Morey | St. Louis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Words that haunt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I read President George W. Bush's reaction to Russia's recent military actions in Georgia, I cringed. His accusing Russia of &quot;bullying and intimidation&quot; proves my grandmother's proverb about &quot;the pot calling the kettle black.&quot; It is beyond any explanation that Mr. Bush could accuse Russia of these tactics without admitting that his administration has done the same in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our country has lost credibility in the world under Mr. Bush's watch. From human rights violations in secret CIA prisons abroad to domestic spying on U.S. citizens without warrants, to knowingly misleading our country into war, this administration leaves office having ruined America's reputation as being the land of the free and the home of the brave. How sad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christine Busch-Nema | Kirkwood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Birds of a feather</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one should be surprised at Russia's move into Georgia. When Vladimir Putin started hanging out with President George W. Bush down at the ranch in Texas, we all should have known that it was just a matter of time until Russia would find some small country to invade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Birds of a feather tend to flock together.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">559 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week's headlines trumpeted a story guaranteed to provoke outrage: Two-thirds of American corporations pay no taxes in any given year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Great Corporate Tax Heist,&quot; one website screamed. &quot;The Corporate Free Ride,&quot; a New York Times editorial proclaimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, are greedy business bigwigs conspiring to bilk Uncle Sam? The Government Accountability Office, which did the headline-grabbing study, makes no such claim. It just presents the numbers, along with a discussion of why foreign-owned companies paid less taxes than domestic ones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transfer pricing abuse - manipulating the prices on intracompany transactions to make them look unprofitable - might explain the disparity, the GAO says. But there are innocent explanations, too, such as the fact that many foreign-owned companies are new and not yet profitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outrage dissipates, in fact, when one reads the numbers carefully. Why do two-thirds of companies pay no taxes? A lot of them are small and, according to Eric Toder of the Tax Policy Center in Washington, &quot;they aren't what you think of as corporations with a separation of ownership and control.&quot; In many small businesses, the owner draws just enough salary to make sure most taxes are incurred at the individual level, not the corporate one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ah, but even among large corporations, nearly a quarter pay no income tax. Isn't that abusive on its face?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, it's not. Most of those big deadbeats gained their no-tax status the old-fashioned way: They lost money. Ford, General Motors, American Airlines and Citigroup are among the big companies currently engaging in this tax dodge, and they have plenty of company. Only a few got their liability to zero using special provisions in the law, such as credits or tax-loss carryforwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you want to read a shocking fact about our corporate tax system, it's this: Our marginal tax rate on corporate income is the second-highest among countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, our combined state and federal rate of 39.3 percent is far above the OECD average of 26.6 percent. The conservative Tax Foundation claims that the high rate hurts the U.S. economy by giving multinational companies an incentive to invest elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toder takes issue with that argument: He says the effective tax rate, after all deductions and credits, is what matters for investment decisions. Nevertheless, he agrees that the nation would benefit from an overhaul of its corporate tax system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be desirable if we could eliminate some preferences, have a broader base of taxable income and lower the rates,&quot; Toder said. &quot;Higher rates give companies an incentive to shift their income to lower-tax countries. You would have less of that profit-shifting going on if you could bring the rates into line with our trading partners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's some hope that the next president will tackle this issue. Republican candidate John McCain's economic plan calls for reducing corporate tax rates. Democratic candidate Barack Obama wants to close corporate loopholes, and he told The Wall Street Journal in June that he'd be open to lowering rates, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We may have the beginning of a consensus, then. The real message of the GAO study isn't that evil, greedy corporations are manipulating the system and evading taxes; it's that our corporate tax system is broken and badly needs fixing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How old is John McCain?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So old he remembers when Johnny Carson quipped, &quot;Did you know Richard Nixon is the only president whose formal portrait was painted by a police sketch artist?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in the 1970s, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; was America's top source for political humor. Today, comedians can mock McCain's age on any number of network and cable stations, blogs and websites. And they're not just cracking jokes about McCain's prostate, but also John Edwards' sleazy dalliance, the media's infatuation with Barack Obama and our politicians' inherent inability to pick a position and stick to it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the biggest viral smash came this month when online comedy site Funny or Die spoofed a recent McCain&nbsp;ad. In case you haven't already seen the video, it features a bikini-clad Paris Hilton proclaiming she's &quot;not from the olden days and I'm not promising change like that other guy ... I'm just hot.&quot; She then delivers an energy plan that sounds pretty darn smart. The video has drawn 7 million views and spawned spoofs of its own. But before Hilton, there was Obama Girl, the super-hot chick who sang the hit, &quot;I Got a Crush on Obama&quot; (&quot;Universal health care reform. It makes me warm ... You can Ba-Rock me tonight&quot;). That video instantly turned producer BarelyPolitical.com into a cultural phenomenon. Founder Ben Relles said the birth of YouTube has unleashed America's funniness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 2004, there was no YouTube,&quot; Relles said. &quot;People weren't creating and posting videos online. There was JibJab (a website), but that was done by a production crew. What you're seeing now are individuals participating in the process and that's really exciting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the news, funny now happens around the clock. No need to wait for late-show monologues or the morning comics. Hours, sometimes minutes, after news breaks, comedians are on the job tearing down our nation's leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So often with these it's not the huge production values that make them work,&quot; said Relles, whose typical budget is about $200 per video. &quot;In a couple of hours, we can turn something around. It's the ideas behind them, not the money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a great time to be young and cynical and not just because of the Internet, said Second City actor Seth Weitberg, 27. &quot;Deface the Nation,&quot; Second City's take on American politics, will stop at the Touhill Performing Arts Center Sept. 17-20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What makes this such a fun election is that there is so much awareness. It's like when you're at the water cooler and everybody watched the same television show the night before. People are just really ready to be engaged,&quot; Weitberg said. &quot;Then, of course, there's just so much to rip on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New stars of political humor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are a few of the fresh comic voices who have made this election so laughable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob Riggle and Larry Wilmore &quot;Daily Show&quot; correspondents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">www.thedailyshow.com and www.indecision2008.comJoining &quot;The Daily Show&quot; in 2006, Riggle and Wilmore are comic equals to the ever-funny Jon Stewart. The fearless Riggle has covered the war in Iraq, the Olympics and a Barack Obama rally, where cameras caught him screaming like a little girl at a Jonas Brothers concert. Senior black correspondent Wilmore - we love the title - is less doting. Last spring, Wilmore predicted Obama's running mate would turn him into &quot;the magical negro,&quot; i.e. &quot;the guy who sits on the sidelines teaching the white guy valuable lessons like Bagger Vance, the big magical brother from 'The Green Mile' or when Shaq played Kazaam.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BarelyPolitical.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mixing sharp analysis and hot chicks, BarelyPolitical made a big splash in 2007 with its debut video &quot;Crush on Obama&quot; starring &quot;Obama Girl&quot; Amber Lee Ettinger. Since then, the site has produced more than 100 videos, including &quot;Al Gore's Voicemail&quot; where presidential hopefuls try to curry favor with the former VP (McCain: &quot;I want to bomb Iran using ... solar powered nuclear weapons.&quot;) and &quot;Hillary Wasn't Lying!,&quot; which features faux footage of heads exploding while a calm Clinton greets children in &quot;snipery&quot; Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">236.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comic arm of the Huffington Post (already considered a joke by some), 23/6 features videos, columns by liberal comedians, animated comics and running features such as &quot;If they IM'd,&quot; imaginary instant-message exchanges between politicians. In the &quot;Swift Kids for Truth,&quot; adorable toddlers mispronounce Barack Obama's name (&quot;Black-o-Rama? Bama-lama? Do we want a president with a name like that?&quot;), and &quot;A Message to Voters Older than McCain&quot; lays out McCain's plan for seniors: &quot;Apple butter will no longer be a second-class condiment. Dinner shouldn't be so spicy. Sen. McCain promises never to negotiate with Prussia. And yes, if elected, Sen. McCain will vote yes on cats being soft.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Margins of Error blog</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">www.hmatkin.blogspot.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Average Americans are getting into the act, posting their own columns, cartoons and videos to the Internet. But our favorite isn't a registered voter, but Australian Hugh Matkin, 24. His video &quot;Barack Roll,&quot; splices the phrases and words from various Obama speeches to re-create the Rick Astley hit, &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up.&quot; Even funnier is the unaltered clip of Obama getting down with Ellen DeGeneres. He gives Hillary the same treatment in another viral parody. We can't tell you the name, but let's just say Sarah Silverman and Matt Damon would be proud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmed Ahmed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">www.ahmed-ahmed.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmed Ahmed, 28, only lived in Egypt for his first month of life, but his heritage has provided plenty of fodder for his stand-up routine. Ahmed appeared in the not-so-funny &quot;Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show,&quot; but really knocked them dead - eek, wrong phrase for someone constantly mistaken for a terrorist - during the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; comedy tour, co-starring Maz Jobrani and Aron Kader. &quot;Whenever I get on a plane I know who the air marshal is. It's always the guy holding the People magazine upside down looking right at me,&quot; cracks Ahmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain&quot; and &quot;new&quot; seem like mutually exclusive concepts. After all, the dude is &quot;crazy old,&quot; according to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;looks like the guy at the hardware store who makes the keys,&quot; says David Letterman. But McCain has hit his comic stride this election cycle. He rejected federal funding to jam Gaydar on &quot;SNL&quot; (&quot;That's something best left to state and local government&quot;), revealed busybody Dwight Schrute of &quot;The Office&quot; would serve as his running mate on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and has cracked wise about his age on all of the above (&quot;I have the oldness it takes to protect America, honor her, love her and tell her what cute things the cat did.&quot;). McCain's new Web ad, &quot;Fan Club,&quot; mocks American girls going ga-ga for Obama. After one girl compares Obama to Bono and another swoons over his &quot;very soft eyes,&quot; a cheesy announcer urges viewers to &quot;act now and don't delay. We know he doesn't have much experience and isn't ready to lead but that doesn't mean he isn't dreamy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith Knight, aka Keef</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">www.kchronicles.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith Knight calls himself the &quot;other black cartoonist&quot; and like &quot;Boondocks&quot; creator Aaron McGruder, Knight isn't afraid to use a little profanity to make a political point, often at the expense of President George W. Bush's administration. In &quot;With Friends Like These,&quot; Bush offers McCain help winning the election (&quot;We can start up that rumor about you having a black baby with a prostitute&quot;) while &quot;Bush's Other Twins&quot; shows two babies fused at the head. &quot;But sir, it would be healthier for the two if they were separated,&quot; the surgeon tells Bush. &quot;No. You leave church and state alone,&quot; Bush responds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Movie that denigrates people with disabilitiesis far from funny</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read with much dismay the review of the movie &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot; starring Ben Stiller (&quot;Stiller's gem keeps you laughing,&quot; Aug. 12). The review completely overlooked the fact that the movie denigrates and makes fun of individuals with a mental disability. The review fails to mention that the movie often refers to the character in a subplot as a &quot;retard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I certainly have a sense of humor, but the blatant and careless use of the &quot;R&quot; word is far from humorous. In fact, the &quot;R&quot; word is hate speech, plain and simple. What is even more disturbing is that absolutely no positive information is put forth about mental disabilities. In one instance, a character in the movie expresses that he is ashamed of his child who has a mental disability. This movie is hateful toward anyone who has a mental disability and harmful to any organization that attempts to raise awareness of mental and intellectual disabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When choosing what movie you are going to attend next, I strongly urge people to look beyond &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot; and spend their money on entertainment that does not resort to denigrating a segment of our society for the sake of attempted humor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matt Lauer | St. Louis St. Louis Metro Area Director, Special Olympics Missouri</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why pay premium price for bland, nostalgic beer?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks for the &quot;'Staff shortage&quot; (Aug. 9), a &quot;Short Take&quot; on resuscitated Schlitz Beer. While Milwaukee isn't the beer capital it once was, SAB/Miller has two breweries there. Another brewery is in Chippewa Falls, Wis. And LaCrosse, Wis., is the home of the Heileman/Old Style brewery, sold by Pabst in 1999, now known as City Brewing. Wisconsin still must be considered a strong contender for brewing capital of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pabst products are brewed under contract by others, primarily by SAB/Miller (under an agreement put together when Stroh's was divided between Pabst and Miller in 1999). Pabst's market share in 2007 was 2.8 percent, compared to 48.2 percent for Anheuser-Busch and 29.5 percent for SAB/Miller including Molson/Coors. That 2.8 percent includes sales of several traditional urban leaders: Old Style (Chicago), Stroh's (Detroit) and Schaefer's (Brooklyn/New York City).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In beer, market share is everything. Leaders have large, efficient plants and clout with suppliers, distributors and retailers. They have advertising dollars to attract young, new customers, who, thanks to brand loyalty, may buy their products for life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nostalgia beers such as Schlitz or Falstaff may be viable, but market share numbers tell the story. They will be a novelties intended to attract attention to a product line. Profitability requires premium pricing. But why pay premium prices for a bland American lager, when you could have a full-flavored craft brew for the same money?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul E. Eckler | Wildwood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waste of money</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Campus life? It's the high life&quot; (Aug. 10): How wonderful it is to see Washington University drumming up tourism for the region. I can see the ad now: &quot;The Danforth Resort; Chic restaurants and a state-of-the-art of the art 'fun room' for the low price of $36,000 a year!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This monstrosity of a &quot;student center&quot; shows the misplaced priorities of Washington University. The $43 million spent to pamper the students would have been better used to award scholarships to high-achieving high school and community college students. If the university can afford such a plush luxury, I don't think expecting a decrease in tuition is out of the question. Despite how fun a Nintendo Wii may be, a world-class education for a deserving student is a much better investment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Granting salvation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Robert Hermann, the St. Louis Archdiocese's interim leader, is quoted in &quot;Two more members of church now face sanctions&quot; (Aug. 11) as saying that if the candidates for the board at St. Stanislaus Kostka Catholic Church don't remove their names for consideration for election they are, &quot;in danger of losing the eternal salvation of your soul.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I thought that the Almighty himself, and only he, could grant eternal salvation. I must have been wrong, because Bishop Hermann apparently has a say in it as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Patterson | South St. Louis County</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't count him out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't count Republican presidential contender Sen. John McCain of Arizona out just yet. The political polls mean nothing until the conventions are said and done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential race truly will begin after the vice presidential choices have been made. Mr. McCain may pick former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney for his family values and his popularity in Michigan, a key state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps Mr. McCain and his military background will be needed because he knows how to secure our nation and give a boost to the future wars that are ahead. Let's face it: records count, and Mr. McCain has one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joshua Udell | Webb City</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rove must be proud</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me get this straight: Two oil men - President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney - and their cronies run the country for seven and a half years and gas soars from $1 to $4 a gallon. But, according to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the likely Republican nominee for president, it is the fault of his Democratic opponent, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is amazing spin. Karl Rove could not have done better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Pappas | Wentzville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unintended consequences</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A letter writer recently asked why the United States is putting more troops in Afghanistan. He said the Soviet Union was unsuccessful in Afghanistan for 10 years and finally withdrew without victory. Though I understood that we could not let al-Qaida's Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, go unanswered, I shared similar concerns about ultimate success when we went into Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Soviet's final withdrawal occurred in early 1989 during the few weeks we were hosting a high school exchange student from Moscow. As we all watched TV reports of the last troops crossing a bridge out of Afghanistan, he told us that when Mikhail Gorbachev announced the withdrawal a year earlier, the student's mother and all the other mothers said, &quot;There is a God in the sky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reason for the Soviet defeat was assistance provided to Afghanistan rebels by the United States. Given the many complexities and changing loyalties in that region of the world, I continue to question whether &quot;success&quot; is possible, however it is defined. I also am concerned about future unintended consequences from U.S. actions and alliances taken in attempts to achieve that success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peggy Kruse | Florissant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saving wildlife is worth any cost</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is appalling that the Bureau of Land Management and a &quot;blue-ribbon panel&quot; of the American Ornithologists' Union find it too costly to try to maintain wild native American species in what is left of their own habitat (&quot;U.S. wants to cull herds of wild horses&quot; and &quot;Condors hang by a thread in the wild,&quot; both Aug. 10).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unfortunate that when wildlife becomes too bothersome to the public or interferes with income from ranching, farming or building, they get labeled as a &quot;nuisance&quot; instead of &quot;endangered&quot; or &quot;protected,&quot; as they once were by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should be a priority for the United States to keep these animals around. The article about horses said, &quot;Efforts to date have been successful in placing 235,000 wild horses into adoption in the past 37 years&quot;; and the California condor was &quot;rescued from extinction&quot; in &quot;an elaborate and expensive recovery effort.&quot; Why not keep these efforts going?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of government funds go toward &quot;expensive&quot; projects, many of which do not have the same goal as saving creatures that have been with us for thousands of years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I have anything to say about where my tax money goes, I certainly would prefer to see it spent on preserving habitat and recovery for our native American wildlife.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Withholding information from review boards shows lack of transparency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two new disclosures in court records cast further aspersions on Bishop Wilton Gregory, who led America's bishops during the high-profile years of the Catholic church's ongoing child sex abuse and cover-up scandal (&quot;Sex abuse panel lacked key data, member reports,&quot; Aug. 9)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While head of the Belleville Diocese, Bishop Gregory won praise in 1993 for setting up a review board to look at allegations against abusive clerics. The trouble is that the former head of that panel now has testified that no information about pedophile priests prior to 1993 was given to board members. She also testified that Bishop Gregory and his staff never brought child molestation reports against the Rev. Raymond Kownacki to the board in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is further proof of what we've long said: These hand-picked abuse panels often get no information, little information or biased information from church officials. So they end up functioning more as a public relations tool than an investigative tool. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As president of the U.S. Bishops Conference in 2002, Bishop Gregory repeatedly promised to be open and transparent about clergy sex abuse. Yet just two years later, he was found in contempt of court for refusing to turn over documents in a civil child molestation case. And in 2006, newspapers disclosed that an admitted predator priest quietly moved into the Belleville Diocese four years earlier at the very same time Bishop Gregory was touring the nation and pledging reforms. He has yet to explain his own continuing secrecy surrounding this move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As more cases come forward and depositions are taken and documents are disclosed, it increasingly seems as though Bishop Gregory's well-crafted public image of reform is just that: a well-crafted image.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 60th anniversary of the abolition of segregation in the military was last month. It was a courageous decision for President Harry S Truman, and the right thing to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the commemoration, leaders of Congress, the secretary of the Defense Department, a few veterans and Colin Powell (who didn't need notes) extolled the virtues of desegregating the military and praised the contributions of blacks from the Revolutionary War to the present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LaVena Johnson from Florissant, an African-American female honor-roll student and Army private serving in Iraq, was found dead in 2005 in a military contractor's tent. The Army ruled it a suicide. Her nose was broken, and she had a black eye, burned hands, loose teeth and what appeared to be lye in and around the vaginal area. She was shot in the head and allegedly had been raped. The Army steadfastly maintnqains that it was a suicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her parents have been fighting an uphill battle in trying to get a congressional hearing to investigate the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glowing words of praise from important people about African-American contributions in building America ring empty for Ms. Johnson. Her contribution will be obscured until her story is investigated and justice is secured.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's see, how many ways could the article &quot;Rezko judge is a big punch in small package&quot; (Aug. 10) put a competent woman judge - Judge Amy St. Eve - in her place? Emphasize over and over, even in the headline, that she is a small person? Then mention her being a &quot;pretty pom-pon girl&quot;? Express surprise that she is &quot;no pushover&quot;? Quote men who think she looks like a &quot;high school cheerleader&quot; and are surprised that she knows her stuff?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's sad that she tried to bring the reporter back to respect and away from sexism: &quot;I prefer to remember myself as student-body president and valedictorian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd like to see the paper write articles about all the short male leaders, expressing amazement that these pint-sized guys actually have a brain. And be sure to include their frivolous high school activities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's all about the money</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The short article &quot;Cameras may catch highway speeders&quot; (Aug. 8) again shows the greed and lack of regard for citizens shown by government use of cameras. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story said the money &quot;would generate $40 million in the first year.&quot; That's further proof that camera enforcement is just viewed by government officials as a money maker. A fine ($75; more for most stop sign offenses) is charged, but no points are given against the driver's license. Nothing - nothing - is done to remove these recalcitrant drivers from the street. The government just keeps taking the money.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moral outrage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are a nation of hypocrites. Former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards confessed to an extramarital affair and the nation goes crazy. We get nonstop coverage. Reporters are delighted. The columnists and the hate-mongers are breathless with glee and excitement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, our president and his lackeys have destroyed the Constitution, broken numerous laws, taxed the poor and rewarded the wealthy and lied. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worst of all, President George W. Bush, who claims to be pro-life, has caused the death of hundreds of thousands of Americans and Iraqis, destroyed a country, ruined our national image and plunged us into astronomical debt, yet he suffers little or no serious criticism. Where is the moral outrage?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Mr. Edwards did is none of my business. What Mr. Bush did and still is doing is my business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever happens in November, we deserve what we get.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth from Hollywood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have followed presidential campaigns for 50 years, but I finally have to give up. Politicians and Washington insiders cannot or will not admit that the common citizen thinks that the politicians have forgotten what is important to them. To the common American, the politicians are all lost in their own gobbledegook and obviously feel that the public will accept whatever they say as intellectual brilliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Example: Paris Hilton's explanation of what we should do to combat the ongoing energy crises made more sense than anything we have heard from either Sen. John McCain or Sen. Barack Obama on the energy problem. She mentioned immediate steps to take to alleviate our current crises and long-range steps to take to prepare our country for our energy use in the future. Why haven't we heard anything like these basic, simple ideas from either of our presumptive presidential candidates?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, Ms. Hilton's video was made as a humorous rebuttal to a McCain&nbsp;ad, but as often is the case anymore in D.C., our leaders don't or won't get it. They can't see that the common-sense truth is not spoken by them, but by a Hollywood &quot;celebrity&quot; in a funny video clip.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ignoring oil shale</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1948, I was a student at St. Louis University. I toured a plant in Lousiania, Mo., that recovered oil from oil shale. Although the process worked, it cost more than crude oil. But it was a beginning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that there are a trillion barrels of shale oil in the Green River Formation of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, and all of it is on government land. There may be 50 billion barrels of crude oil in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republicans, who believe national defense is their forte, want to search and drill. The Democrats want to develop alternative energy. How much longer will oil shale be ignored?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1494 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giving consumers $1,000 energy rebates. Drilling for more oil offshore. Inflating our tires properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These and other proposals by presidential hopefuls highlighted an increasingly fractious debate over energy last week, as Americans said sky-high gas prices would play a big role in how they vote in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy experts were heartened that an overdue discussion about the nation's energy future has begun in earnest. But they worried that much of what voters hear is long on gimmickry but short on frank talk and long-term solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The campaigns are operating at a superficial level,&quot; said Robert Alvarez, a former Energy Department official in the administration of President Bill Clinton and a senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies, a think tank in Washington. &quot;It's like magical thinking, with no one bothering to scratch the surface.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenneth Green, an energy expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said candidates were in &quot;full-on pander mode, flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And neither candidate is addressing the biggest issue of them all, said Robert Kaufmann, director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Studies at Boston University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That issue is an upcoming peak in global oil production followed immediately by decline as soon as the next decade, when the United States will have to be ready with affordable energy alternatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say that even though gas prices have dipped slightly of late, consumers can expect high costs and a volatile market from here on out, starting with painful heating-price increases this winter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As energy took center stage in the campaign last week, Republican John McCain stepped up efforts to promote offshore drilling, something that most Americans endorse and that Democrat Barack Obama also recently accepted after a change of heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaufmann says that having more drill rigs in the ocean is beside the point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saying that we can drill our way out of it, this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality,&quot; he said. &quot;And we see where denying reality has gotten us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Perfect storm'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians reflexively avoid giving voters bad news. During a brief oil crisis in 1979, President Jimmy Carter donned a sweater, installed solar panels in the White House and delivered a solemn speech trying to enlist Americans in an energy battle that he called &quot;the moral equivalent of war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carter's approval ratings sank further and he lost the presidential election to Ronald Reagan, who struck a more upbeat tone - and removed the solar panels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we are seeing now is far more serious than in the 1970s, &quot;a perfect storm,&quot; says Peter Garforth, who advises businesses and governments around the world on energy problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That coming storm will involve:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Uncontrolled and unpredictable energy prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Interruptions in supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Environmental damage from climate change beyond what many expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garforth argued that neither Obama nor McCain were communicating clearly that the nation had failed dramatically to conserve energy. Nor are the candidates saying enough about how Americans' waste - using twice as much energy per person than Europeans - is damaging the United States' ability to compete in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It may not be good politics, but it's not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem,&quot; said Garforth, who heads Garforth International LLC, based in Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nuclear solution?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the seriousness of the problems, 2008 may be recalled as the energy election. And no bolder and transforming plan has been introduced than McCain's proposal to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030 - even though no new reactors have been ordered in the United States since the late 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug-in electric cars, we need electricity to plug into,&quot; McCain said last week while touring a nuclear plant in Michigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illinois is the state with the most nuclear plants. Its junior senator, Obama, also has said that nuclear power needs to be an option after the nation deals more aggressively with nuclear waste and the security of nuclear fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy experts note that there has been little mention of Wall Street's aversion to funding nuclear energy because of risks and costs, which could leave taxpayers on the hook for more than $200 billion in loan guarantees under McCain's Lexington Project - far beyond the $18.5 billion in loan guarantees approved last year by Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building nuclear plants in France and Japan has been less challenging because those governments are financial partners with industry. Alvarez, a longtime nuclear critic, questioned whether American taxpayers were ready for what he called &quot;state capitalism, with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nuclear Energy Institute spokesman John Keeley acknowledged the need for ongoing federal support but said investors would be playing a bigger role in coming years when they saw the dividends of billions in taxpayer loan guarantees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Wall Street sees 4-8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years, on cost and on schedule, I think you're going to see robust support from the financial sector,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conflict over coal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech last month that roiled the waters among environmentalists and policymakers, Al Gore said the United States needed to end its reliance on fossil fuels within a decade because of the imminent threats of global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gore's challenge to phase out coal - which generates roughly half of the electricity in America - is one that fellow Democrat Obama has not taken up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech at Michigan State University last week, Obama reiterated his support for research into technology that would use more coal rather than phasing it out. He said that his goal was to build five coal-fired demonstration plants that capture and sequester the carbon pollution that worries Gore and environmentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, McCain wants to commit $2 billion annually for research to develop clean-coal technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Shilts, who heads the University of Illinois' Institute of Natural Resource Sustainability, argued that the candidates were wisely disregarding Gore's advice because it would be impossible to replace an equivalent amount of electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's just not a feasible or responsible thing to say,&quot; Shilts said. &quot;If we're going to cut down on greenhouse gases, we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renewable alternatives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians are among those paying attention to billionaire T. Boone Pickens' recent campaign to promote renewable energies - particularly wind farms. Pickens says in an Internet message: &quot;I have been an oil man my whole life, but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both major candidates point to their plans to promote wind energy, solar power, biofuels and other renewable energies. McCain wants to make tax credits that promote renewable energy permanent, although he has stressed offshore drilling of late over other options. Obama says extending the tax credits for five years would be a good start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither candidate has focused heavily on solar power, still an expensive technology but potentially a breakthrough if we can believe assertions that in one hour's time, enough sunlight hits the earth to meet the world's energy needs for a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Moynihan, an energy expert at NDN, a think tank in Washington aligned with Democrats, said the candidates needed a far more robust plan for solar power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On this issue, I think that Americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Kearney, an energy expert who heads the School of Public and International Affairs at North Carolina State University, offered an explanation as to why the major candidates seem to be talking about energy in piecemeal fashion: Voters don't like to deal with complicated matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kearney said that candidates need to find a way to communicate better about energy even though the issues may be complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our energy economy is undergoing a transformation, and we're just in the early stages,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Chris Koster, a Democrat who barely won his party's nomination for attorney general, spent more on TV ads in the state during the final week than any other candidate on Tuesday's primary ballot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Koster is the top spender on TV campaign ads during the last month - outpacing even the two presumptive nominees for president, Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koster spent at least $1.21 million over the last month to run 2,722 ad spots, most of them on TV stations in the state's three largest cities, according to TNSMI-Campaign Media Analysis Group, a nonpartisan firm monitoring campaign ad spending for the Post-Dispatch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a quarter of Koster's ad spending came in the final week. The ad getting the most airtime during the finals days of his campaign was a spot that targeted his two chief Democratic rivals: state Reps. Margaret Donnelly and Jeff Harris. Donnelly, of Richmond Heights, trailed Koster by less than 800 votes statewide in the final unofficial tally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donnelly spent at least $138,796 and Harris spent at least $220,487 on TV ads during the final week. Both candidates concentrated most of their ad buys in St. Louis and Kansas City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missourians for Honest Leadership, a campaign committee bankrolled largely by Koster's ex-wife, spent $142,311 to run 275 anti-Koster ad spots during the final week of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain actually ran the most Missouri ad spots of any candidate during the last week - 1,031. But McCain spent less than Koster because more of McCain's ads aired in lower-cost markets, including Columbia and Joplin, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last month, Obama spent slightly more than McCain on TV ads, but Obama's campaign spending dropped sharply during the last week. Even so, both presidential contenders spent more than $1 million apiece in Missouri during the last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Missouri's two Republican contenders for governor - U.S. Rep. Kenny Hulshof, the victor, and state Treasurer Sarah Steelman - almost matched each other in ad purchases during the final week and month of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All told, over the last month, Steelman spent $928,135 to run 2,320 ad spots. Hulshof spent $914,308 for 2,892 spots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic victor for state treasurer, state Rep. Clint Zweifel, spent $375,650 on ads running in the final two weeks of the campaign. According to the ad-monitoring firm, Zweifel was the only Democratic candidate for the post to air TV ads on broadcast stations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the inferior quality of Chinese-made all-terrain vehicles certainly is a safety issue, a much greater safety issue is the use of ATVs by children. The article &quot;Foreign ATVs may be new danger&quot; (Aug. 3) points out that while Missouri requires drivers of ATVs to be licensed drivers at least 16 years of age, in Illinois children of any age may operate ATVs. Illinois and the rest of the country would do well to emulate Missouri and treat ATVs as the motor vehicles they are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it seems inconceivable that a parent would allow a 7-year-old to operate a car, truck or motorcycle, some parents allow them to operate ATVs as if they were toys. ATV manufacturers deliberately build smaller machines targeted directly at children. Importation and sales of these vehicles should be prohibited. Parents who buy them for their children should have their heads examined. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri should strive to tighten enforcement of existing ATV laws. Where I live in rural Shannon County, I frequently see neighborhood children, some as young as 10, operating ATVs on my road. This is winked at by area law enforcement and condoned and even encouraged by parents. While I am not advocating giving 10-year-olds traffic tickets, it would be appropriate to charge their parents with felony child endangerment. After all, the 10-year-old did not buy that machine himself; somewhere an adult is enabling this dangerous and criminal behavior. While this sounds harsh, it is better than all the remorseful newspaper articles and editorials after some young life is snuffed out by the irresponsible operation of an adult motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Prostate cancer test is under fire&quot; (Aug. 5): The prostate-specific antigen study was financed by the insurance industry and a federal board packed with representatives from that industry. I guess 29,000 prostate cancer deaths a year are meaningless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am a seven-year survivor of a serious and uncured cancer. I fight each day to live. My cancer was not detectable by digital rectal exam. Most prostate cancer is detected by rectal exam, but if I had not had a biopsy, I would be dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No urologist will operate on one high PSA result. Several PSA tests are taken over several weeks or months. The levels of all the PSA tests done and the rise of the level over time determine if a biopsy is needed. A biopsy, while not pleasant, is over in 20 minutes, and the result of the biopsy determines the course of treatment, if needed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A city out of control</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope that Deborah Bailey, the woman who was given the run-around when she tried to retrieve her 1999 Escort from St. Louis Metropolitan Towing, can find a lawyer who will not be afraid to take a case that involves suing the city of St. Louis, the St. Louis Police Metropolitan Department and St. Louis Metropolitan Towing and its &quot;sales&quot; arm, Parks Auto Sales (&quot;Auto biography of one towed car,&quot; Aug. 3). Ms. Bailey deserves to be compensated for the entire cost of the Escort. She also should be awarded punitive damages for the bankruptcy she filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This city is out of control. The mayor and his cronies grab as much as they can for themselves, and the Police Department has been out of control for too many years. Shame on all of them, and may they be forced to make restitution for ruining this woman's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">T. Richardson | St. Louis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Move over, Detroit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, the city of St. Louis is well on its way to setting another homicide record for the year. Move over, Detroit; St. Louis is gaining on you. If St. Louis cannot manage a contractual relationship with a towing service properly and has a homicide rate to be ashamed of, perhaps the city should close and reorganize.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assured spectrum</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find it ironic that beginning with the Aug. 11 edition, all lottery results will appear on the same page, A2, as columnist Bill McClellan. They do seem to belong together. Devotees will search the entire publication to locate them, and, once found, each must be carefully read and digested. There could be joy, or there may be tears, but a spectrum of emotions always is assured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gordon Crow | St. Charles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimate leverage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri's citizens will become better informed voters when there is complete transparency, especially in the area of campaign finance. Knowing where a candidate is getting his funding helps me make a decision. Do I think this candidate's vote will be influenced by his contributors? Do I have ideological values that conflict with those contributors?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is nothing wrong with receiving campaign contributions in any amount. Organizations give to candidates who already align with their goals. It becomes a problem when those contributions are veiled and the voting public loses the ability to hold candidates accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limiting campaign contributions doesn't do a thing to limit influence. Instead of choosing the &quot;appearance&quot; of being unbiased, Missourians can make informed choices and use accountability to the public as the ultimate leverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim and Judy Boen | Ballwin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exploiting racism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue raised by probable Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain's' &quot;celebrity&quot; attack ad about U.S. Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., the probable Democratic presidential nominee, is not whether Mr. McCain is a racist; it is whether Mr. McCain is willing to exploit racism to win. Plainly, he is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad features the same undercurrent as the notorious &quot;playgirl&quot; attack ad against U.S. Senate candidate Harold Ford Jr. from Tennessee. Juxtaposing a young, beautiful white woman with a black man is the 21-century version of Lee Atwater's Willie Horton ad. Before his death, Mr. Atwater apologized for the ad's racial exploitation. Too bad Mr. McCain has not yet been so honest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sally E. Barker | University City</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tied: Health care and jobs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With American businesses spending more than twice as much for health insurance as most foreign competitors, is it any wonder they have a tough time competing with imports? Yes, it is only one factor in a very complicated economy, but health care spending is something that could be addressed if politicians would make it a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Americans want a market-driven health care system, then get rid of the mandates and rules that pile cost on top of cost. Cancel Medicare, Medicaid, the Veterans Administration and all government health programs. But let's be prepared to accept the premature loss of life that goes along with the denial of care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If, on the other hand, Americans want a system that covers everyone and spreads the risk and cost across all income levels, then &quot;Medicare for All&quot; is the way to lower cost. Let's stop the insanity of having private insurance cover the young, healthy, wealthy and working population - the profitable segment - while saddling government programs with the elderly, ill, disabled and poor people. The existing system drives up the cost of care paid by our government. It also drives up the cost of private insurance, which means reduced business competitiveness and, thus, costs jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klaus Illian | Manchester</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nettles of allegory</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poor Maureen Dowd. Treading into the nettles of drawing an allegory to contemporary politics out of a romantic novel published in 1813 can be tricky (&quot;Obama as Mr. Darcy; America as Miss Bennet,&quot; Aug. 5). Whether because of space or ideological constraints, she sees the characters of Jane Austen's novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and America's presidential candidates from only one side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any high school English teacher would expect a student to recognize and articulate that each of the characters in Ms. Austen's novel displays the title traits. Fully developing Ms. Dowd's allegory to candidates John McCain and Barack Obama and the American public would cause us to consider Mr. Obama's prejudice (against Americans' freedom to live without the interference of the federal government?), or Mr. McCain's pride (rightly held but so rarely shown) or the American people's wish, similar to the Bennets' desire as parents, to raise their children well and see them become honorable people who live productive lives and contribute positively to society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Ms. Dowd is correct in drawing her comparison of Mr. Obama to Mr. Darcy and America to Miss Bennet, I hope that Mr. Obama can overcome his prejudice, as Mr. Darcy did when he realized that the good in Miss Bennet, like that in America, far outweighs her shortcomings and that he can accept her and love her for who she is rather than who he thought she should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leave all that out and, were I the teacher, &reg;cwould get a C.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, celebrity hotel heiress Paris Hilton announced she's in the race for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord, help us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hilton said Republican presidential candidate John McCain pulled her into the campaign with an ad equating Barack Obama to bubble-gum stars Hilton and Britney Spears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She released a retort Tuesday on the website &quot;Funny or Die - funnyordie.com. Taking an apparent swipe at McCain, 71, Hilton says she's &quot;not from the olden days.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm just hot,&quot; she coos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In tongue-in-cheek style, Hilton said she's in the race, because a &quot;wrinkly, white-haired guy&quot; used her in his campaign ad. &quot;Thanks for the endorsement, white-haired dude,&quot; she beams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the way to work Wednesday, I listened to KWMU host Don Marsh as he discussed Hilton and politics with three local political science professors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope the campaigns haven't boiled down to Paris Hilton and Britney Spears,&quot; said Steven Puro of St. Louis University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, professor, I'm afraid the pillars of this campaign already are rooted in the muck and mire of celebrity silliness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, for example, had to renounce another black person who made slanderous remarks. First, it was Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Then, it was his former pastor, Jeremiah Wright. Most recently, it was a rapper, Ludacris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Obama said the Grammy-award winning artist should be &quot;ashamed&quot; of his new rap song that made fun of McCain's age, called President George W. Bush &quot;mentally handicapped,&quot; and used the B-word to slam Sen. Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The song, Obama said, is &quot;outrageously offensive&quot; and insults those trying to raise children &quot;with the values we hold dear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe so. But I'm still trying to figure out how rap lyrics even became news fodder in this presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But wait, it gets even sillier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, actress Scarlett Johansson, 23, said she is embarrassed by the publicity over her so-called &quot;e-mail relationship&quot; with Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actress told reporters she sent Obama e-mails only to express support for his &quot;refreshing&quot; campaign. In response to the reports, Obama said he replied to one of Johansson's notes forwarded to him by an assistant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The communiques were manipulated into &quot;an unfortunate media frenzy,&quot; Johansson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's probably right, but in a society fixated on sleazy gossip, an innocent e-mail exchange can easily morph into a hot, clandestine politician-celebrity affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's behind all of this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These types of low-ball, sordid media stories are right out of the &quot;Karl Rove school of politics,&quot; Puro, the political science professor, said on the KWMU program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The idea is to divert attention from major ideas, to get the public talking about other issues with coded words that, apparently, the Republican Party understands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although I think the attention on Wright, Hilton or Ludacris goes deeper than the GOP and Rove, Puro's observation adds interesting perspective to current news stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a recent swing through Missouri, Obama told audiences that McCain will try to make voters &quot;scared&quot; of him because he doesn't look like past presidents and has a &quot;funny name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's playing the race card,&quot; McCain supporters charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, went on television, proclaiming that his team will not allow McCain &quot;to be painted as racist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, race is a still a hot-button issue in this campaign. A rapper who insults GOP politicos and allegations that Obama has stooped to race-baiting raises the ire of those voters who are already skittish about the notion of a milk chocolate president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which brings me back to McCain's&nbsp;Obama-as-celebrity campaign ad. It seemed sort of odd and counterproductive to show the candidate standing in front of 200,000 excited Germans, most shouting &quot;Obama!&nbsp;Obama!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although this statesmanlike image might be impressive on the world stage, among many in our tabloid news nation, it easily was depicted as nothing more than a Hannah Montana concert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, we are a nation addicted to entertainment. Why do you think &quot;American Idol&quot; and &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; got the top TV ratings last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the media-driven gossip makes complex issues of off-shore drilling, the crisis in Darfur and the slumping U.S. economy seem downright boring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a competitive world. In order to hold the fleeting attention of voters, politicians need Ludacris, Britney and tidbits about race and celebrity dalliances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord help us, but Paris Hilton could run for president. She already introduced a slogan that would resonate soundly with entertainment-addicted Americans:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vote for me. I'm just hot.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">675 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sad duty of politics is to establish justice in a sinful world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So wrote the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, a Wright City native who wrote a lot about the relationship between Christianity and democracy. As Mr. Niebuhr well knew, to reform a sinful world a politician first must get elected, which sometimes involves compromising political principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it is in the early stages of this year's presidential campaign. Both of the presumptive candidates, Republican Sen. John McCain and Democratic Sen. Barack Obama, are honorable men who want what's best for their country. But they are blurring their principles in the quest for votes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This sort of thing tends to win elections, but it's not pretty to watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Republican primary campaign, Mr. McCain had to appease a party base that he often had irritated. So he promised to extend the Bush administration's tax cuts, which he had voted against in 2001 and 2003. He also abandoned the enlightened immigration reform plan that he'd championed in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, Mr. McCain launched a pair of low-road TV commercials that attempted to liken Mr. Obama's popularity to fawning over such celebrities as Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. So much for his famous &quot;straight talk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McCain made his reputation as a maverick willing to battle his party's leadership for what he believed in. That's what made him so attractive to middle-of-the-roaders. But he since has morphed into a Republican conformist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, too, has taken to flipping and flopping. His biggest about-face was his decision to shun public financing after promising to accept it. That shocked some of his supporters, who are appalled by the ability of big donors to warp government policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Obama emerged from the Chicago school of hard-nosed politics, where he became a master at courting both the Democratic machine and reformers alike. The first lesson on the curriculum: The candidate with the most money usually wins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama also riled civil libertarians by voting for a compromise bill, favored by the Bush administration, making changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Mr. Obama initially had threatened to filibuster the bill over its grant of immunity to telecom companies that may have cooperated illegally with U.S. intelligence agencies. By changing his position, Mr. Obama gained some protection from any soft-on-terror charges that Republicans surely would have launched against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes a &quot;flip-flop&quot; is actually an adjustment to changed circumstances. So it was with Mr. McCain's switch to support of offshore oil drilling in the face of $4-per-gallon gasoline. The $1.1 million he received from oil industry executives and employees in the month after he switched may have been merely a fortuitous coincidence. Mr. Obama, too, now says he'd vote for limited offshore drilling if it would help pass a compromise energy bill with funds supporting the development of alternative fuels. Thus far, this position that has not produced a sudden influx of oil-borne campaign contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gasoline issue has thrown both sides into full pander mode. Mr. McCain's plan for a summer gas tax holiday would have encouraged more consumption, generated less money needed for highway construction and done nothing to solve our oil dependency problem. Mr. Obama has proposed giving $1,000 to every American family, paid for by taxing the windfall profits of oil companies. That might make voters happy, but it would discourage investment in oil production, which the nation sorely needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trick for voters is to distinguish between flip-flops and principled changes of position, and what any changes say about how either man would behave in the White House. The best bet: They will revert to their old selves, Mr. McCain as a moderate conservative with a bent for practical problem-solving, and Mr. Obama as a pragmatic progressive with an eye for reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men are better than their recent campaign maneuvers would indicate. Will the real Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain please stand up?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama chides McCain over tire inflation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama taunted Republican presidential rival John McCain on Wednesday for first ridiculing him for advising voters to keep tires inflated and then later acknowledging that the practice saves gasoline. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be interesting to watch this debate between John McCain and John McCain,&quot; Obama said as he campaigned in Indiana with Sen. Evan Bayh, widely considered a top-tier candidate for his Democratic running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama had noted that keeping tires inflated and cars tuned was endorsed by both NASCAR and AAA and should be part of any comprehensive plan to reduce reliance on imported oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In mocking Obama on Monday, McCain told a motorcycle rally in Sturgis, S.D.: &quot;My opponent doesn't want to drill, he doesn't want nuclear power, he wants you to inflate your tires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday night, McCain said he wasn't opposed to Obama's suggestion, &quot;but I also don't think that that's a way to become energy-independent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, McCain criticized Obama for not fully embracing nuclear power as part of a comprehensive energy solution and called on Congress to return from its summer recess to address immediately the U.S. energy crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RALEIGH, N.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats want Edwards to answer Enquirer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John Edwards has a deadline to save his spot on the national stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With two weeks to go before their national convention, a number of Democrats are saying that Edwards needs to publicly address National Enquirer stories that have alleged he had an affair with a campaign worker and fathered her baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edwards' political currency declines with each day the story goes unresolved, former Democratic National Committee Chairman Don Fowler and other Democratic strategists said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Edwards fails to clear up the story in short order, he risks party officials' deciding not to have him speak or, if they do, creating a distraction from a week focused on Sen. Barack Obama's acceptance of the nomination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Olympics ads: McCain plans to run $6 million worth of TV commercials on NBC broadcast and cable channels during the Olympics in Beijing. Obama's campaign already signaled its intention to spend some $5 million on ads during the Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Tired of Obama? Nearly half the people who responded to a poll released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center said they're tired of hearing about Obama. Just 26 percent said the same about McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Nader's goal: Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader said Wednesday he plans to get on the ballots in 45 states by the November election, but complained that he and other third-party candidates still struggle for attention in the nation's two-party political system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no cheap energy anymore, but there's an absolute glut of energy policy proposals from the two guys running for president, who seem to be stalking each other from one end of the country to the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Democrat Barack Obama was in Lansing, Mich., talking up and tweaking the comprehensive energy plan he announced in Las Vegas on June 24. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain showed up in Michigan on Tuesday, touring the Fermi 2 nuclear power plant in Newport and talking up the comprehensive energy plan he announced in Las Vegas on June 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What actually is surprising about the candidates' energy plans is how similar they are. Both acknowledge that America's dependence on oil is unsustainable in the long run, damaging to the environment and dangerous to our national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both say we need to diversify the sources and kinds of energy we use, raise the mileage and lower the emissions of vehicles, update the nation's electric grid, improve the energy efficiency of new and existing commercial and residential buildings and make the federal government itself an example of state of the art energy practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are, of course, differences: McCain embraces nuclear power; Obama - reluctantly - won't rule it out. McCain recently (last month) endorsed lifting the ban on offshore drilling; Obama even more recently (Friday) said he'd consider it, but only as part of a broad congressional compromise that would include incentives to encourage and develop non-petroleum alternatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the more substantive difference between them is philosophical:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has confidence in &quot;the power and innovation of free markets&quot; to solve these problems, as he put it in an energy-related speech last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, looking at the historical record, believes we can't depend on the profit motive alone, so the government's job is to define the problems, set the priorities and use its collective power to ensure success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lisa Margonelli isn't impressed. &quot;The current dialogue is profoundly depressing and fake,&quot; she told me. &quot;I think both candidates need to be more honest about our options.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Margonelli is a California-based fellow at the high-powered New America Foundation policy think tank in Washington and the author of the fascinating and immensely entertaining best-seller &quot;Oil on the Brain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Published last year and issued recently in paperback with an essay updating some of her observations, &quot;Oil on the Brain&quot; is the result of three years of field reporting and research that took Margonelli across America and to China, Iran, Nigeria, Chad and Venezuela. She even wormed her way into the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dotted with respectful and sometimes affectionate profiles of improbably colorful characters, the book documents how oil is discovered and recovered; how it's refined, wholesaled and retailed; how it's priced and sold worldwide as a commodity and as a financial instrument; how it's wound through the social fabric of America and the lives of individuals; and how it shapes politics, diplomacy, democracy, autocracy, psychology, sociology and economics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I reached Margonelli via cell phone, she was riding shotgun in a van chugging through California's Sierra Nevada mountains heading for Colorado to help a friend move. The vehicle, she admitted, was exceeding the speed limit from time to time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The energy debate has been disappointing, she said, noting the &quot;theatrical approach to high gas prices&quot; that involves talking about what amount to more subsidies and taxes to pay for more driving. We need to be talking about driving less, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsidies speak to one of the recurring concepts of &quot;Oil on the Brain&quot;: the hidden penny. That 9/10 of a cent tacked on to the price of a gallon of gas stands for countless costs that aren't paid directly, she writes, &quot;from air pollution and greenhouse gases, to traffic congestion and tax breaks for oil companies, to taxpayer-subsidized oil investments in developing countries, to the costs of the U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Margonelli criticized the idea Obama floated Monday of using some of the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve stocks near the Gulf Coasts of Texas and Louisiana. &quot;If you want to use it to moderate prices,&quot; she said, &quot;you need to set a target and say 'If oil hits, say, $150 a barrel, we're going to release, say, 750,000 barrels a day.' Ideally, you'd never have to use it, but it says we're going to do something. It's more potent as a future step,&quot; she said, and it could tamp down prices in the short term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's enthusiasm for offshore drilling, she says, is likewise out of whack. It amounts to to a giveaway to the oil companies, Margonelli said, because operating in U.S. waters is safe, legal contracts are dependable and the royalties exacted by the U.S. government are much lower than those of other countries. On top of that, as she notes in her book, advances in technology have long since taken most of the uncertainty out of drilling, although &quot;the myth of the lucky wildcatter lives on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want the oil companies to make money,&quot; she told me, &quot;but we want them to work for it.&quot; Offshore drilling, she said, is essentially &quot;free money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mostly, though, she'd like to see some courage from the candidates. &quot;I think they should say, 'Look, there are no quick fixes here for the mess we're in. I'm sorry I'm the person who has to say this, but we have to use our greatness to rethink the way we live.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And she expects this in an election year? &quot;I think someone needs to say it,&quot; she insisted. &quot;Both of these people want to be centrists. They could redefine the center.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I reminded her of what happened to Jimmy Carter when he told Americans hard truths about an earlier oil crisis. Margonelli replied, &quot;In fact, the country benefited from his energy policies and Jerry Ford's energy policies for years. We need to embrace our faith in our ability to transform the American economy and transform our lifestyles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government needs to have more guts,&quot; she said. &quot;It needs to start taking as activist a role in domestic energy policy as it does in pursing energy policies overseas. There have been a lot of political interests working to preserve the status quo, and that's not working for us as citizens anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The short analysis of the results of Tuesday's Missouri primary would be this: Money talked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In nearly every major race, the candidate with the deeper pockets won. Those candidates were able to afford a barrage of last-minute television ads and automated phone calls, some of them misleading and many of them negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this kind of campaigning wins primaries, when candidates ostensibly are on the same side, just imagine what the fall election will be like - particularly since the limits on campaign contributions to candidates for state office will be removed as of Aug. 28. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the top of the ticket, just below the presumptive presidential match-up between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain, will be Kenny v. Jay. It sounds like a Khoury League pitching match-up, not a governor's race. In more formal terms, the governor's race will pit Republican U.S. Rep. Kenneth C. Hulshof, 50, of Columbia by way of Bertrand, against Democratic Attorney General Jeremiah W. Nixon, 52, of Jefferson City by way of Hillsboro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two veteran party loyalists emerged from their respective primaries, Mr. Nixon unbruised and all but unopposed, Mr. Hulshof dinged up by a rugged primary battle with state Treasurer Sarah Steelman. Mr. Hulshof, who had the backing of most party leaders and major contributors, outspent her on television ads in the last month of the campaign by nearly two to one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Steelman ran a classic outsider's campaign, portraying herself as the &quot;people's candidate&quot; despite a long record of support for business interests. She attacked Mr. Hulshof, a veteran of 12 years in the U.S. House, for a record of support of pork-barrel spending projects and ethanol producers. The message resonated in many parts of southwest Missouri, but the turnout there wasn't large enough to offset Mr. Hulshof's big margins in St. Charles and St. Louis counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Hulshof, despite his years in Congress, had to introduce himself to most voters outside the 9th Congressional District of north central Missouri. He did so largely on television, emphasizing his farming background and solid conservative credentials. His task was made more difficult because, until January, incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Blunt had been expected to run for a second term. When Mr. Blunt dropped out, state Republicans - with the notable exception of Ms. Steelman - got in line behind Mr. Hulshof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mr. Nixon polled better than either Mr. Hulshof or Ms. Steelman, Mr. Hulshof is capable of making that ground up in a hurry, now that there are no limits on how much contributors can give directly to state office seekers. Mr. Nixon is no slouch as a fundraiser himself, suggesting that the fall campaign will easily shatter the record of $11.9 million spent in the 2004 governor's race between Mr. Blunt and Democrat Claire McCaskill, now a U.S. senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other statewide races, Republican Lieutenant Gov. Peter Kinder easily won renomination for a second term. He will face Democrat Sam Page of Creve Coeur, a physician and state representative, who outpaced five minor candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the race to succeed Mr. Nixon as attorney general, Republican state Sen. Mike Gibbons of Kirkwood, who was unopposed, will face either state Sen. Chris Koster of Belton or state Rep. Margaret Donnelly of Richmond Heights. At press time their race was too close to call, with Mr. Koster showing strength in the western side of the state, Ms. Donnelly closing fast in the St. Louis area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should Mr. Koster emerge, it will be remarkable, considering that he became a Democrat only a year ago. As a state senator, he was a loyal Republican voter, a fact he managed to obscure with heavy spending on television ads focusing on his record as a prosecuting attorney. Mr. Koster also was battered by Ms. Donnelly and a third candidate, state Rep. Jeff Harris of Columbia, for playing fast and loose with campaign funding restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the third contested statewide race, that for state treasurer, Republican state Sen. Brad Lager of Maryville was unopposed. On the Democratic side, it appeared for a while Tuesday night that Arnold Mayor Mark Powell would be the exception to the &quot;money talks&quot; rule. The party's unsuccessful 2004 candidate for treasurer, Mr. Powell ran a shoestring campaign this year, spending only about $25,000, some $450,000 less than state Rep. Clint Zweifel of Florissant. In the end, Mr. Zweifel, who had heavy support from organized labor, pulled away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money played a major role in the race for Mr. Hulshof's 9th district congressional seat. In the GOP race, the two candidates who could afford television ads, former state Rep. Blaine Luetekemeyer of St. Elizabeth and state Rep. Bob Onder easily outpolled state Rep. Danie Moore and former Mizzou football star Brock Olivo. Mr. Leutkemeyer won the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Democratic side, both state Rep. Judy Baker of Columbia and former House Speaker Steve Gaw of Holts Summit bought heavy television schedules, but Ms. Baker's heavy support in her home city of Columbia proved decisive. The other two Democrats in the race, Marion County Presiding Commissioner Lyndon Bode of Palmyra and former state Sen. Ken Jacob of Columbia, couldn't afford TV commercials and fell out of the running.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri wants to help makes decisions about state air quality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Missouri, Illinois battle EPA, separately&quot; (July 27): Everyone in Missouri needs and deserves clean air. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources wants the ozone standard decreased. Our lawsuit seeks to protect Missouri air quality, not prevent that protection. But we believe the Environmental Protection Agency needs to look at this at the national level, rather than state by state or urban area by urban area in piecemeal fashion. This lawsuit forces that issue. Being at the table ensures Missouri has the chance to provide input.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new federal standard will have a huge impact on Missouri. Currently, only one ozone monitoring station in the state would be in compliance with this new proposed standard, and that one would just barely meet it. We have no guarantee that new federal requirements will protect Missouri citizens who may be impacted by these regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is much easier to prevent a problem with federal regulations than to clean it up later. This is similar to the Mississippi River hypoxia issue: The state of Missouri expressed concerns about the impact on our citizens, with few benefits, of a pending federal agreement, and other states then joined us. Only then did the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency change the agreement to be more protective of the environment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one questions that ozone is a problem that must be addressed to protect the health of Missouri citizens. However, a one-size-fits-all solution won't work for the East Coast, West Coast and Midwest. We could spend a lot of resources and have very little impact on the health of our citizens. Entering the lawsuit is our way of being at the table if changes are needed and making sure any resources spent will have a positive impact on the health of our citizens and our air quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doyle Childers | Jefferson City Director, Missouri Department of Natural Resources</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health should be No. 1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hoped that Doyle Childers, director of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, is interested in protecting citizens' health more than the questionable economic benefit of keeping the air as dirty as it is now, but his quote in &quot;Missouri, Illinois battle EPA, separately&quot; (July 27) demonstrates that such is not the case. In fact, Mr. Childers wishes to sue the Environmental Protection Agency for its audacity in lowering the ozone standard to protect public health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri has a Department of Economic Development that protects and advocates for businesses. The Department of Natural Resources is to protect and advocate for our natural environment, including clean air. In taking a position against the modest steps that EPA is taking, Mr. Childers has come down on the side of industrial interests. With friends such as him, those interested in clean air don't need enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Midkiff | Columbia, Mo. Conservation Chair, Osage Group Sierra Club</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Double down on MetroLink</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next MetroLink line?&quot; (July 29) accurately pointed out that if voters had passed a small sales tax for Metro in the mid-1990s, lines to St. Charles County and Madison County might have been in place today for riders to use and avoid the high price of gasoline. The article could have said the same thing about St. Louis County. Had St. Louis County voters passed a quarter-cent sales tax in 1997, which passed then in the city of St. Louis, another MetroLink line might have been near completion at a time when people are clamoring for more MetroLink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters in St. Louis County have a chance to rectify the mistake of a decade ago and support a measure in November to fund the expansion of MetroLink. The 43 miles of MetroLink that the region has put in place over the last 20 years has proven its ability to offer people a great alternative to $4-a-gallon gasoline. We need to be thinking about doubling the system over the next 10 to 15 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, recent reports about Sunnen's plan to build a $500 million mixed-use development anchored by the Manchester and Sunnen MetroLink stations in Maplewood is an excellent example our investment in the Cross County line getting an immediate return to the region. We just need more of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandy MacLean | St. Louis Board of Directors, Citizens for Modern Transit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missed the train</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How and why did we miss the train on rebuilding U.S. Highway 40/Interstate 64 without including light rail? I live in South St. Louis and work in West County and would love the opportunity to take mass transit to work. With gas at $4 a gallon, I go through what I would spend on a monthly Metro pass ($60) in about seven working days - not counting insurance cost, wear and tear, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The added benefits: I would be a better steward of our Earth by creating less pollution and using resources better. This should not happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Williams | St. Louis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Routing decisions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A map with the story &quot;Next MetroLink line?&quot; (July 29) showed the proposed MetroLink line to St. Charles as going over the old Highway 115 bridge. It left the reader thinking that the line just somehow left Lambert International Airport to get to that point. In reality, the St. Charles line would have left the current line near the intersection of Interstates 170/70 and proceeded south alongside I-170 to near Page Boulevard and continued west alongside the old Rock Island Railroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current thinking, with the help of St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley, is to use the same routing (albeit running north, out of Clayton) in going to Westport, if the November sales tax initiative passes. This line probably would leave the railroad right of way and go west on the north side of Page. With the St. Charles proposal of 1996, after getting to Westport, the line was to head northwest toward the old 115 bridge through St. Charles and on to the Mid-Rivers area of St. Peters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remarkable tribute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Conservation Corps alumni museum is closing here&quot; (July 28): The Civilian Conservation Corps Alumni Headquarters and Museum in Jefferson Barracks Park now has closed forever. I live close to it and had visited it several times. It is a remarkable tribute to one of the greatest ideas and programs that government ever created. In the Great Depression, the CCC was formed to put youth to work while training them in a trade and building infrastructure. This allowed them to support their families through a period of massive unemployment and poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All across this nation, you still can see evidence of the CCC. Most of the state and national parks contain structures and roads built by and forests planted by the young men of the CCC. Seventy years later, much of their work still is used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lest we ever forget, the CCC was born in a nation experiencing economic hard times and world turmoil. It exemplified the spirit that we all are in this together. Its good works have far outlasted the program's existence. We need that kind of leadership today, not leadership based on greed. We need leadership that recognizes that we can pull together and help each other and that government has a role in doing that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am saddened that this memorial is gone. It commemorated government that brought out the best in our people. Would that there were more like it, that people would be reminded of the virtues of self-sacrifice, teamwork and everyone doing his part in a great endeavor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rich Brown | Lemay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why do they hate us?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Geologic Survey says there are 90 billion barrels of oil in the Arctic, enough to take care of U.S. needs for 12 years. The Democratic Party refuses to allow us to develop it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why do the Democrats hate us so much?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack Collins | Kirkwood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look at the record</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his latest ad, U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the presumptive Republican nominee for president, accuses his Democratic rival, U.S. Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., of not supporting U.S. troops fighting in the Middle East. A closer examination of the two senators' records reveals that it is Mr. McCain who consistently has opposed legislation in support of our men and women in uniform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the TV ad says that Mr. McCain is &quot;always there for our troops,&quot; he opposed the new GI Bill recently passed by Congress. The bill expanded benefits for military veterans. In 2005, Mr. McCain voted against a bill to provide $360 million for armored tactical wheeled vehicles for units deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr. McCain also voted against increased funding for veterans' health care on multiple occasions in 2006, but he did vote for tripling veterans' health care fees. Mr. McCain's rhetoric may favor our military men and women, but his record does not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a tradition at many kitchen tables to yell at the newspaper. At John McCain's kitchen table, it is becoming a tradition to yell at one paper in particular: The New York Times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest dustup between the Republican presidential candidate and the &quot;All the News that's fit to Print&quot; newspaper centered on the editorial board's criticisms of McCain, one dispatch accusing him of taking the low road and another contending that he was playing politics with race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response from the McCain campaign was equally cutting. &quot;If the shareholders of The New York Times ever wonder why the paper's ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking, they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the paper's editors to any slight, real or imagined, against their preferred candidate,&quot; said McCain campaign spokesman Michael Goldfarb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relationship between McCain - a frequent reader of the newspaper - and the Times has been rocky. Yet such a grudge could pay political dividends for McCain, as criticizing the liberal media often improves a candidate's standing with Republican conservatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in January, the Times endorsed McCain's candidacy for the Republican nomination, saying, &quot;Sen. John McCain of Arizona is the only Republican who promises to end the George Bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small, angry fringe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, it's been McCain v. The New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, the newspaper printed a story about McCain and a female lobbyist, reporting that unnamed McCain associates years ago had become concerned the relationship may have become sexual. Both McCain and the lobbyist have unequivocally denied that it was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month later, McCain flashed his temper at a Times reporter, repeatedly cutting her off when asked whether he had spoken to Democratic Sen. John Kerry about being Kerry's vice president in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then last month, Republicans complained that the paper rejected an Op-Ed piece by McCain about the Iraq war after one by Obama was printed. The paper said it had only tried to get McCain to be more specific about his plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Paul, a former aide to New York Republicans, said several recent moves by McCain showed he was turning toward more conservative positioning &quot;and some of that includes not being afraid to go negative, not being afraid to call a liberal a liberal, and not being afraid to go after a newspaper.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNION, MO. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama promised enthusiastic crowds Wednesday in stops across southern Missouri that he would attack economic and energy problems that he said are responsible for Americans &quot;losing faith in the essence of the American dream.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is what's at stake in this election,&quot; Obama said in Union, his last stop and one that took place in a park pavilion amid a pouring rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama told several hundred supporters, some clustered under umbrellas, that many Americans fear that &quot;we're going to have an America that we pass on to our children that's a lot poorer&quot; than the country and the economy that they inherited from their parents and grandparents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That fear will come true, he said, unless the nation and its leaders change direction - the cornerstone of his campaign for the White House. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday night, Obama's Republican rival - John McCain - was in Kansas City for a private fundraiser. McCain made no public remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But several Missouri Republican allies, including U.S. Sen. Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Bond and Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, spent Wednesday publicly jabbing at Obama's energy proposals and his opposition to the expansion of offshore drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a conference call with reporters, Emerson accused Obama of a &quot;lack of vision ... in not trying to use every single thing we could possibly use to increase our independence from those who hate us and to reduce our reliance on imported gasoline and diesel fuel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reply, Obama asserted that Republican critics were failing to tell the public that oil companies already had leases on 68 million offshore and on-land acres, but weren't drilling on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First, let's get the oil companies to use what they've got,&quot; Obama said in a brief interview in Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the United States can get control of the energy problem only if it expands the use of alternative sources of energy and increases conservation of fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to be a lot more honest with Americans,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama suggested that the heightened Republican attacks, including a new TV ad that portrays him as an empty-headed celebrity, stem from the GOP's fear that its own lack of policy proposals will be rejected by voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;John McCain spent the last month talking about me,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If McCain had serious proposals for addressing the nation's problems, he'd be talking about those instead, Obama added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said that the best part of Wednesday's bus tour, where he stopped at four communities along Interstate 44, was to see support in what he acknowledged was traditional Republican turf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also heard first-hand about the economic woes plaguing rural Missouri communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a question-and-answer session at the Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla, Wade McBride recounted how he'd recently lost his job at Briggs and Stratton's local engine-manufacturing plant, which was replaced by an identical operation in China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McBride, 31, said he'd trained some of the Chinese workers who took over the job he had held for nine years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said he may not be able to prevent all plants from closing and the jobs being shipped overseas, but, if elected president, he said he could stop the tax breaks that often reward such behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expanded on that pledge in Union. &quot;We're not going to stand idly by and let jobs get shipped overseas,&quot; Obama said, igniting cheers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Obama's day-long trek was as much about promoting his personal attributes - and dispelling Internet smears - as his policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say he's arrogant, not patriotic, blah, blah, blah,&quot; said Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., as she introduced Obama in Union. The truth, she continued, is &quot;he's humble, he's patriotic, and he's a devout Christian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not everyone who showed up Wednesday to see Obama agreed with her. &quot;For me, he's just too liberal,&quot; said Tyrone Kozlowski, among roughly 20 protesters who mingled with Obama supporters across the street from the park in Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the protesters had disappeared when Obama walked over to the crowd, despite the rain, to shake hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on past voting, the Missouri counties Obama visited Wednesday are a lock for Republicans. Four years ago, almost two-thirds of Phelps County's ballots went for President George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Franklin County, the Democratic presidential ticket snagged only 40 percent of the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But two years ago, McCaskill performed a few percentage points better in each county - additional votes that she says made the difference in her successful Senate bid against the Republican incumbent, Jim Talent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's targeted audience Wednesday included rural Democrats such as retired teacher Jude Wilson, who had preferred Hillary Rodham Clinton in Missouri's Feb. 5 presidential primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Obama narrowly carried the state, Clinton carried all of the rural counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson was among several Clinton supporters from rural Mountain View who traveled to Rolla to hear Obama. All said Wednesday that there's no question that they'll vote for Obama in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Debi Larson, a retired psychologist: &quot;The Republicans have made such a god-awful mess of things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But random interviews in downtown Rolla found a wide range of opinions of Obama - and some erroneous beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chuck Mayes, 28, a construction worker from nearby Belle, Mo., said he was ardently against the election of Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone I've talked to doesn't want him in there,&quot; Mayes said, referring to the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first reason is his name,&quot; Mayes continued. &quot;Second, he wasn't born here,&quot; referring to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When told that Obama was born in Hawaii and was indeed an American citizen, as required by the U.S. Constitution, Mayes expressed surprise: &quot;I didn't know that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the street, retired Highway Patrolman Tony Viessman said he wasn't surprised to hear that false information about Obama continues to circulate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he was a white man, he'd be elected tomorrow,&quot; said Viessman, 74, who was holding up one end of a large banner that declared, &quot;Rednecks for Obama.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viessman had paid for the banner himself. The opposite end was held up by a friend, Leslie Spencer, a retired insurance agent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men said they strongly support Obama's views on the economy and many other issues. &quot;He's brilliant,&quot; Viessman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viessman and Spencer added that they are confident Obama could get more votes in southern Missouri than recent Democratic contenders, though they had no illusions that he would carry their hometowns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Obama dared to campaign in Rolla at all, said Spencer, showed that he wasn't writing off rural parts of the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the interview, Obama said that if he got that point across, Wednesday's bus trip achieved its goal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As John McCain and Barack Obama tangle over Iraq and the surge, they're also waging a less-noticed military-related battle:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each is vying to be the voice of America's veterans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The importance of this effort is reflected in the vigor with which Obama's campaign stresses the work he's done on veterans issues during his relatively brief time in Washington, and his bid to contrast that with McCain's positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is reflected in the time McCain spent last week organizing a veterans organization in Missouri and reminding members of his own service and sacrifices in Vietnam. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is reflected in the haste with which the McCain campaign jumped on Obama's decision not to visit wounded troops in Germany last week, a flap featured in a new McCain&nbsp;ad. On Tuesday, the McCain campaign used that incident to question Obama's capacity to serve as commander in chief. In response, McCain's contention was labeled as &quot;disgraceful&quot; by an Obama adviser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is truly a remarkable election in terms of the attention that's being paid to veterans,&quot; Terry Madonna, who directs the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College, said Tuesday. Unlike the Vietnam era, even antiwar forces are showing respect for veterans, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the political maneuvering is taking place in conference calls, press releases or quiet visits with veterans, but it matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- There are 23.4 million veterans, including 522,798 in Missouri and 822,104 in Illinois, and with the 2.2 million active-duty troops and reservists, almost 26 million Americans have worn or are wearing the uniform. They form strong voting blocs in key states such as Florida. Other swing states, including Ohio and Missouri, have some combination of large veteran populations, sizeable military bases, major defense contractors or key legislators on military committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Establishing trust and confidence with veterans groups helps a candidate build credibility with the public as a potential commander in chief. This is particularly important for Obama, given his lack of military experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The veterans issue is important to both candidates. Veterans are a natural constituency for McCain, but the administration's problems in meeting their needs, from substandard conditions at Walter Reed Hospital to gaps in providing mental health care, provide Obama an opening. Meanwhile, Obama's work on the Senate Veterans Committee has led to some demonstrable achievements, though potential missteps such as refusing to recognize the surge's success allow his foes to raise questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Obama traveled overseas last week, McCain helped set up veterans organizations, including Missouri Veterans for McCain, in about 20 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's been shot at, he's been a POW, and he knows what is required when he sends young men and women off to defend our nation,&quot; said Jack Jackson, a retired colonel and former Missouri state representative. Missouri state Rep. Jason Brown, a co-chairman of the veterans group who returned last year from 14 months in Iraq as an Army reservist, accused Obama of using veterans issues to &quot;shore up his credibility in an area, foreign policy, he's weak in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign counters by citing key areas where he has helped spur changes, including aiding homeless veterans, cutting red tape after the Walter Reed scandal, improving disability pay for veterans in Illinois and sparking a Pentagon review of its practice of discharging veterans for alleged &quot;pre-existing personality disorders.&quot; The Post-Dispatch reported last year that more than 22,000 troops have been told by the military that they don't have post-traumatic stress disorder but rather brought personal problems into the service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain acknowledges problems in veterans care. He told the American GI Forum in Denver a few days ago, &quot;When our government forgets our debts to you, it is a stain upon America's honor. ... We should give veterans the option to use a simple plastic card to receive timely and accessible care. ... I will not stand for requiring veterans to make an appointment to stand in line for substandard care of the injuries you have suffered to keep our country safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, predicts Obama will get a fair hearing from veterans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Veterans understand the issues before our country,&quot; Skelton said. &quot;I think veterans want someone who will listen to them and understand their challenges. I've found that to be true. (House Democratic Leader) Nancy Pelosi got a tremendous award from the American Legion last year, and she's not a veteran - but she understands their issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political importance of veterans, especially after years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, is magnified by their mounting problems with health and relationships, Madonna says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They not only have votes,&quot; he said, &quot;they live in families and families have votes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the last two weeks, Missouri TV viewers have faced a barrage of campaign ads - at least 7,200 spots - from candidates who have spent more than $2.7 million to promote themselves and their views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The avalanche of ads largely reflects the ramping up of the contests in the Aug. 5 primary, notably the Republican battle for governor between U.S. Rep. Kenny Hulshof and state Treasurer Sarah Steelman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when it comes to TV ads, Hulshof and Steelman are being outspent by others - some of whom won't be on that ballot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the last two weeks, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama has been the biggest ad-spending candidate in the state, even though he and Republican rival John McCain won't face Missouri voters until Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since July 10, Obama has spent at least $516,410 to run TV ads in the state, compared with $408,567 for McCain. Obama outspent McCain in every major Missouri media market except Joplin, Mo., according to figures compiled by TNSMI/Campaign Media Analysis Group. The nonpartisan ad-monitoring firm is tracking campaign spending for the Post-Dispatch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain actually outspent Obama statewide during the last week. Presumably, the Democratic contender sharply curbed his Missouri ad buys because of the free TV coverage of Obama's overseas trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evan Tracey, the ad-monitoring firm's chief operating officer, said the TV spending makes clear that McCain and Obama are targeting Missouri voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is running ads in fewer swing states than Obama, Tracey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dave Robertson, a political science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said McCain's&nbsp;ad spending here reflects the fact that &quot;he must win Missouri&quot; in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Obama, Missouri may be less crucial if he carries other swing states, Robertson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the candidates on the Aug. 5 primary ballot, the biggest ad spender is state Sen. Chris Koster, a Democratic candidate for attorney general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since July 10, Koster has doled out at least $429,595 to air 1,061 ad spots. Most of those ads have aired on TV stations in St. Louis and Kansas City, where the bulk of Missouri's Democratic voters live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koster's spending, so far, has overwhelmed that of his Democratic opponents. State Rep. Margaret Donnelly has paid $264,684 for 477 spots, all running on St. Louis or Kansas City stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No figures were available for state Rep. Jeff Harris, whose campaign said he was slated to begin airing ads Sunday night. Harris led in the recent Post-Dispatch/KMOV poll of likely Democratic primary voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Republican contest for governor, Steelman and Hulshof have been neck and neck in TV ad buys. During the last two weeks, she has slightly outspent Hulshof statewide. But he has run more ad spots because he's airing some in cheaper, rural TV markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since July 10, Steelman spent $330,968 for 905 spots, compared with $303,587 (1,093 spots) for Hulshof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hulshof is running more ads on St. Louis and Springfield TV stations, and is overwhelming Steelman in Joplin, a GOP stronghold. However, she has had the airwaves to herself on Kansas City stations, which reach Republican-leaning suburban voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the likely Democratic nominee for governor, Attorney General Jay Nixon, has spent almost $209,000 to run ads on stations in Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. His campaign ads didn't run in St. Louis during the last two weeks. However, an independent group - the Service Employees International Union - spent $195,000 to run ads in St. Louis and other media markets around the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When John McCain's economic adviser recently pooh-poohed the country's fiscal troubles as a &quot;mental recession,&quot; Barack Obama's campaign had a ready retort - from Claire McCaskill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Missouri Democrat zipped in to the Senate Radio/TV gallery, where she generated soundbites for nationwide broadcast blasting the comments from ex-Sen. Phil Gramm as &quot;Exhibit A of which candidate for president is not in touch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCaskill's appearance was evidence of something else: her increasing prominence as one of a handful of top surrogates in Obama's presidential bid. While others, such as Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., may hold more sway in Obama's inner circle, McCaskill is one of several politicians that the campaign is increasingly turning to for TV and campaign-trail appearances and for behind-the-scenes advice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- On Monday, she was on the Fox News Network defending Obama's plan for a phased withdrawal from Iraq and an increased focus on Afghanistan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- On Tuesday, she was on a conference call with reporters blasting a new McCain&nbsp;ad criticizing Obama on gas prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Today, she's to be on another call - this one a private strategy session with a few top campaign advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- On Sunday, she's scheduled to be back on Fox, talking about the economy opposite McCain campaign adviser and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's someone we have no hesitance in putting on TV or on the road because she understands and reflects the message of this campaign perfectly,&quot; said David Axelrod, Obama's chief campaign adviser. &quot;She makes sense. She doesn't sound like the typical Washington palaver.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCaskill makes political sense for Obama, too, said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. &quot;She was with him early. She reaches out to women, which he needs to do after defeating Hillary Clinton and she's from a swing border state,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Fenn, a Democratic strategist not affiliated with the Obama campaign, said McCaskill's surprise endorsement last January helped cement her role in the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She was very reasoned and articulate&quot; and &quot;that didn't go unnoticed,&quot; he said. &quot;It doesn't escape anyone that Missouri is tight and is potentially in play here, so her being visible nationally as an Obama spokesperson I think helps Obama in Missouri.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RURAL PITCH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her role as an adviser, McCaskill has weighed in on strategy, such as where to deploy ground troops in advance of Missouri's Feb. 5 primary, which Obama narrowly won; and on policy, such as Obama's position against a gas-tax holiday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCaskill said she talks by phone or e-mail to Obama's top campaign strategists &quot;every couple of days&quot; and with his Missouri aides even more often.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes it's to dissect Missouri politics, sometimes it's to get briefed in advance of a TV appearance, and &quot;sometimes it's ticky-tacky strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What kind of advice is she giving?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been sounding pretty much one note for a while: If you want to win, you have to get outside the traditional Democratic strongholds,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCaskill said her latest pitch is for a rural tour of key states, such as Missouri, Ohio and Indiana, to focus on McCain's record on farm issues. She has argued for getting local farmers, not big-name campaign surrogates, to host the events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Axelrod said the campaign is chewing over a memo from McCaskill on that idea now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, he said, &quot;You'll see as much of Claire McCaskill as she's able and willing to commit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VP BUZZ</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the visibility has created fresh buzz about McCaskill's prospects as a vice presidential candidate, and she's repeatedly appeared on lists of possible choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some pundits have noted that McCaskill wouldn't help Obama quiet questions about his experience, particularly on foreign policy. And picking a woman who is not Hillary Clinton could look like a slight to the New York senator just as he's trying to win over her supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Axelrod and McCaskill sidestepped the veep question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never discuss that,&quot; Axelrod said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCaskill also declined to talk about the issue, except to play down her chances of landing on the ticket. Still, she doesn't seem to mind all the attention and declined to take herself out of the running, as some have done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How could anyone really honestly say they're not interested?&quot; she asked.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who's excited?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain faced an excitement deficit as a poll showed that his backers were less fired up than Barack Obama's. About four times as many Obama supporters say the election is exciting than McCain backers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iraq-usation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain launched a new television ad that accused Obama of switching positions on Iraq &quot;to help himself become president.&quot; It aired as Obama's commitment to withdrawing combat troops within 16 months of becoming president has come under question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spoken like a car salesman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain pledged to help auto workers rebuild their industry and in the process jump-start the entire U.S. economy. Standing in a town hall meeting with hundreds of people and several shiny new cars, McCain sounded at times like a confident, encouraging salesman as he praised General Motors' plans for a long-range electric car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Invitation rescinded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Georgia Sen. Max Cleland, who was an icon of Sen. John Kerry's 2004 campaign, was abruptly disinvited from appearing with Obama in Atlanta on July 8. His offense? He's a registered lobbyist. Obama's policy is to ban lobbyists from participating in fundraising or giving money. An associate of Cleland's said he has never actually lobbied in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quoted</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain TV ad hits Obama on Iraq policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican John McCain launched a new television ad Friday that accuses presidential rival Barack Obama of switching positions on Iraq &quot;to help himself become president&quot; just as the Democratic candidate prepared to make a high-profile trip to Baghdad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's sharply worded criticism was not limited to the ad. He said Friday that Obama would be facing a far less secure Iraq &quot;if we had done what he wanted to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30-second ad, running on national cable and in 11 battleground states, is the hardest hit aimed at Obama so far by McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama never held a single Senate hearing on Afghanistan,&quot; the ad's announcer says. &quot;He hasn't been to Iraq in years. He voted against funding our troops. Positions that helped him win his nomination. Now Obama is changing to help himself become president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad suggests that Obama was placing politics ahead of the country's interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to the ad, Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said, &quot;Given his calls for a civil campaign, it's disappointing that Senator McCain has slipped so easily into the same, tired campaign tactics that have become so familiar to the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's backers lagging on enthusiasm, poll finds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain is facing an excitement deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While overall interest in the presidential campaign has swelled since last fall, backers of Democrat Barack Obama are more fired up and express more loyalty to their candidate than McCain's do, a poll by The Associated Press and Yahoo News reported Friday. In addition, individual groups backing Obama - African-Americans, Democrats and liberals - are more enthusiastic than whites, Republicans and conservatives, who are more aligned with McCain, GOP senator from Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama faces hurdles of his own. The poll shows lagging fervor for the Illinois senator by supporters of his vanquished rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton. And there are lots of dispirited and undecided independents, who are expected to be pivotal on Election Day, now less then four months off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The passion and interest shown by blocs of voters are important because they affect who will be motivated to vote. For now, the numbers favor Obama: 38 percent of his supporters say the election is exciting compared with 9 percent of McCain's. Sixty-five percent of Obama's backers say they are hopeful about the campaign, double that of McCain's, and the Democrat's supporters are three times likelier to express pride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BERLIN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama to visit Thursday with German chancellor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German Chancellor Angela Merkel will welcome Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama to her office in Berlin on Thursday of next week, her spokesman said Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's stop in Berlin is part of a tour of the Middle East and Europe aimed at burnishing the his foreign policy credentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also is expected to deliver a speech in Berlin. It remains unclear where that event might take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign officials have announced stops in Jordan, Israel, Germany, France and England. Obama also has pledged to travel to Iraq and Afghanistan this summer, but aides have not said whether those war zones will be part of the same trip.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain reports raising more than $21 million in June - his best fundraising month so far - and spending nearly $26 million, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spent more than $16 million on advertising during the month, five times more than he spent in May, when the Democratic presidential primary was still being contested by Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis television viewers are getting their first look at a campaign ad promoting Attorney General Jay Nixon, the likely Democratic nominee for Missouri governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ad isn't from Nixon's campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was produced and paid for by the Service Employees International Union, which plans to spend $450,000 to air the ad statewide over the next two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is, by far, the most ad money spent this year by an independent group for a Missouri candidate. The spending doesn't count as a donation, as long as there's no coordination with the candidate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To put it in perspective, SEIU is spending more than the combined tally for the past two weeks (roughly $281,000) spent by the two chief Republican contenders for governor: U.S. Rep. Kenny Hulshof and state Treasurer Sarah Steelman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEIU spokeswoman Sara Howard, who's based in St. Louis, said the union's hefty ad buy is &quot;clearly a recognition of how important this election is, and how much it matters who's elected governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SEIU ad is focusing on health care and the 2005 budget cuts that tossed about 100,000 people off Missouri's Medicaid roles. Nixon has promised to restore that coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixon spokesman Oren Shur said the campaign had no input on the ad, and no advance knowledge of SEIU's help. Shur said campaign staffers first read about the ad on the Post-Dispatch's political blog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coincidentally, the SEIU ad began airing Tuesday, the day Nixon launched his own first campaign ad: a 60-second biographical spot that features Nixon driving a car and speaking to the camera about his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, Nixon's own campaign ad is not running in the St. Louis area. Shur said Nixon will air ads soon in St. Louis, in the state's most expensive media market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked about both ads, Hulshof spokesman Scott Baker asked, &quot;Why now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike Hulshof and Steelman, Nixon faces no major opponent in the state's Aug. 5 primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's supposed to be the candidate hoarding money and standing on a big lead in the polls,'' Baker said. &quot;What do they know that has made it important for them to get on the air now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEIU's Howard replied: &quot;This is a perfect time to remind voters they have a pretty clear choice in November.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shur offered a similar view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But another reason may be to whip up Democratic voters for the Aug. 5 primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Republican battle for governor is garnering headlines, there has been some behind-the-scenes speculation that voter turnout - particularly among Democrats - could be down for Aug. 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In St. Louis County, for example, Republican elections director Joe Goeke said the absentee ballot traffic so far has &quot;been slow.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With about three weeks remaining, 2,392 county residents have cast absentee ballots. That compares to 13,674 absentee ballots cast overall for the August primary in 2004. The current pace could hint at a lower final tally this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lower-than-expected August turnout in Missouri would be bad news for either major party, especially after the record-setting turnout in the Feb. 5 presidential primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A low August turnout could signal potential voter burnout, which neither major party wants to see, heading into the November presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCCASKILL MUM ON VP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After months of serving as a preferred surrogate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama, U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill continues to attract speculation that she might be under consideration as his running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and McCaskill have each played down such talk. Last Sunday, while on NBC's &quot;Meet The Press,&quot; McCaskill told moderator Tom Brokaw that she wouldn't bet on her chances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, she's told aides that she'll no longer comment at all on the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCaskill's strengths include her close political and personal ties to Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if selected, her family's finances - notably, the business dealings of husband Joseph Shepard - could come under public and press scrutiny again. Shepard, a successful developer and financier, was a target of GOP ads in McCaskill's failed bid for governor in 2004, and her successful campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any event, McCaskill underscored her loyalty to Obama this week when she loaned her communications director, Adrianne Marsh, to his presidential campaign. Marsh, who asked for the leave, will work for Obama in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIBERTARIAN ROOT IN TOWN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain isn't the only White House aspirant in town this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libertarian vice presidential nominee Wayne Allyn Root is flying in today for a two-day foray around the state. Root is the running mate of Libertarian presidential nominee Bob Barr, a former GOP congressman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment, the Libertarian ticket is the only third-party pairing to qualify for Missouri's November ballot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; Pg. B6</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1438 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protect the park: No land-grab at the Arch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am appalled that anyone, particularly the good former Sen. John Danforth, would not see the folly in attempting to take land away from the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial in order to promote narrow, short-term commercial interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a 32-year veteran of the National Park Service and speaking for the 650-member Coalition of National Park Service Retirees, we strongly are opposed to any effort to tamper with NPS management and control of this important unit of the National Park System. The Arch already contributes enormously to the economic viability of St. Louis, by way of its 250,000 annual visitors who are attracted to one of the most widely recognized architectural symbols in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The existing museum, under the Arch, was designed to avoid detracting from the central feature. Taking land to build an above-ground building would be a travesty. Furthermore, it simply would not work. Does anyone really believe that someone would be induced to drive to St. Louis to see another museum on the grounds, much less one that would detract from the existing open space? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, open space is at a premium in this area. A quick glance at any map reveals that there are plenty of buildings, roads, parking spaces and hotels outside the park grounds. The green space, like Central Park in New York City, is much more valuable as it is. If the mayor and the Danforth Foundation want to help, why not put a facility just outside the park where there are plenty of unused buildings?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We do agree with placing a lid over Interstate 70, since that would help both the city and the park visitors. We urge area residents to tell their elected representatives to not allow the land-grab and to protect the national memorial for all people for all time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don Castleberry | Little Rock, Ark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burke is a true believer in the safety of children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the editorial &quot;The true believer&quot; (June 29): The Catholic Church laments the very real damage done to those who were sexually abused by priests. Archbishop Raymond Burke strongly has supported all efforts to protect our children since the day he arrived in St. Louis in 2004. His commitment to the safety of children is unwavering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Archdiocese disputes the statement from the Survivor's Network of those Abused by Priests, a statement the Editorial Board did not verify with the Archdiocese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Archdiocese of St. Louis has no knowledge of any priest against whom a credible accusation of sexual abuse against a minor has been proven holding any pastoral role within the Archdiocese of St. Louis. Those are the priests for whom the archbishop is responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Burke's record on child safety stands for itself. The Archdiocese of St. Louis had an extremely strong showing when it was audited last year for compliance to the Safe Environment Program, mandated by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Not only did the Archdiocese pass the audit, it was commended as one of the strongest programs in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compliance figures compiled for June 30 this year show that than 99.6 percent of all the 35,000 local church employees and volunteers - everyone from the archbishop to soccer referees - are in full compliance with the SEP. The remainder are those who have just begun the compliance process. Thanks to the strong leadership of Archbishop Burke, archdiocesan institutions and activities are safe for children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By repeating in print unproven and spurious assertions, the Post-Dispatch is complicit in perpetuating a myth and is giving credibility to information that is simply not true. It was an example, par excellence, of journalism at its weakest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monsignor John Shamleffer | St. Louis Judicial Vicar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monsignor Richard Stika | St. Louis Vicar, Office of Child and Youth Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deacon Phil Hengen | St. Louis Director - Office for Child and Youth Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spinning Cerberus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial &quot;Failure in Fenton&quot; (July 2) was outrageous and well outside the boundary of spin in which newspapers such as the Post-Dispatch are allowed by the First Amendment to operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cerberus did not sign an agreement to acquire econtrol of Chrysler until mid-May 2007, and did not acquire control until August. To imply that Cerberus is responsible for Chrysler's present circumstances, that Cerberus broke promises and failed Fenton and the United Auto Workers, that Cerberus drove Chrysler into a ditch or that because of Cerberus, Chrysler has not innovated is dishonest and holds Cerberus to impossible standards. No one could turn Chrysler around in nine months, especially in the present economic environment. But Cerberus is ahead of schedule to turn Chrysler around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial should have called on us and on Chrysler to learn from past mistakes, roll up our sleeves and get on with competing in a world driven by competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My deepest concern is the impact the editorial could have on anyone who might consider St. Louis as a home for a new or expanding business. Who would want to invest in St. Louis, risking both fortune and a good name to the mendacity of the editorial page?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John L. Davidson | Des Peres</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set on war</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few months ago, Iran held an American woman and accused her of anti-Iranian activity. The United States denied the charge and said America doesn't do things like that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent issue of the New Yorker reports that Congress has appropriated $400 million for anti-Iranian activities. Is it possible that the woman was guilty as charged? Is Bush set on war?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Elliott | Florissant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">History repeats</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President George W. Bush probably will start a preemptive war with Iran before his term is out to boost his legacy and power. Whiteman Air Force Base is preparing bombers and weapons for the purpose of war with Iran. Funds were approved by Congress. The Lieberman-Kyl amendment that threatens to &quot;combat, contain&quot; and stop Iran with &quot;military instruments&quot; was passed in the Senate in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Mr. Bush, both Sen. Barack Obama and John McCain, the probably nominees for president, are ignoring the December 2007 National Intelligence Estimate that that Iran halted its nuclear weapons operations in 2003. Recently, people visiting Iran have found incredible hospitality and generosity among its people toward the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bush's position has been that Iran is evil and a threat and that &quot;military options are not off the table.&quot; In addition, he is striving to gain congressional validation for military action against Iran. With an attack on Iran, the entire Middle East could flare up and cause a loss of Iranian oil, which could send the price to $200 a barrel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, is this for control of oil and power in the Middle East? Will we have more loss of life and limb, total chaos and debt disaster again - just as in Iraq and Afghanistan?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ava Jordan | St. Louis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protected status</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story &quot;Federal law is now a shield against employee benefits&quot; (July 6) told about a dying Spherion employee who was misled by his employer, which had switched insurance carriers, resulting in his widow being denied $426,000 in benefits, and the beneficiary of a deceased man's retirement plan that lost $500,000 in account value due to Schwab's 16 months of delays. The law, as it is being interpreted, is a shield protecting employers from lawsuits for such losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporations are legal fictions possessing all the rights of natural persons. Apparently, they have all the rights except the ones from which they can be protected - including being sued. How oddly Orwellian that some &quot;natural persons&quot; may be &quot;more equal than others&quot; in the eyes of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Jestic | O'Fallon, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theft by small-print</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Federal law is now a shield against employee benefits&quot; (July 6): Strangely enough, the law designed to protect employees is being used to take away their benefits. It's hard to believe - but perhaps to be expected in our society. It seems to be a case of small-print theft, a variation on white-collar crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No wonder our economy is in disarray if the law has been perverted so that the rich and wealthy are able to profit from the distress of the poor and disadvantaged. There doesn't seem to be any enthusiasm on the part of government, Congress or the courts to rectify the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been all this talk of patriotism. What is patriotism? I think it's very simple: spirited defense of freedom, liberty and justice for all. I would like to see it from the Congress, the courts and the executive branch. But cases such as those described in the article indicate that patriotism is in short supply in the places where its needed the most.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain distances himself from adviser's remarks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate John McCain sharply broke from an economic adviser who dubbed the United States &quot;a nation of whiners&quot; in a &quot;mental recession&quot; as he sought to counter criticism that he's weak on the economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I strongly disagree&quot; with Phil Gramm's remarks, McCain told reporters in what amounted to nothing short of a smackdown against one of his top surrogates and longtime friends. &quot;Phil Gramm does not speak for me. I speak for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain said a person who just lost a job or a mother struggling to pay for a child's education &quot;isn't suffering from a mental recession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gramm, a former Texas senator who is a vice chairman of the Swiss bank UBS and has a doctorate in economics, made the remarks in an interview with the Washington Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning in Fairfax, Va., Democrat Barack Obama used Gramm's comments to say McCain is out of touch: &quot;America already has one Dr. Phil. We don't need another one when it comes to the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">June is McCain's best fundraising month</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign officials say Republican John McCain raised more than $22 million last month for his presidential bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's McCain's best month yet. He ends the month of June with nearly $27 million cash on hand, according to campaign officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said Thursday that McCain and the national Republican Party together entered this month with about $95 million in the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money has given McCain the ability to outspend Democratic rival Barack Obama on television advertising in key battleground states, Davis says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has not yet revealed his June fundraising.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the past three weeks, presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain has been heavily outspending Democratic rival Barack Obama on TV ads in Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McCain may not match Obama's plans for a huge field operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within weeks, Democrats say, Obama should have more than 100 paid staffers in the state - some estimate 150 - and should have opened roughly 35 field offices, most of them in rural areas. That's far more than the 15 or so offices and 80 full-time staff that Sen. John Kerry posted in the state, for a time, during his 2004 Democratic presidential bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will be the largest political commitment in Missouri by a Democratic presidential campaign, ever,'' said local Democratic consultant Mike Kelley, former executive director for the Missouri Democratic Party. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's new Missouri spokesman, Debbie Mesloh, would not confirm specific numbers but didn't dispute the gist. On Wednesday, the campaign announced the hiring of at least a half-dozen senior staffers to oversee two tandem field operations. One, called the Missouri Campaign for Change, will be solely a voter contact organization led by paid Democratic operatives with Missouri ties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rural communities expected to see Obama offices include Cape Girardeau, Maryville, West Plains and Kennett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're making a significant investment,'' Mesloh said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain regional campaign manager Gentry Collins said the campaign had a few paid staffers in Missouri at present. The McCain operation is coordinating its efforts with the Missouri Republican Party, which Collins said already has opened a half-dozen offices around the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State GOP Executive Director Jared Craighead said he has seven campaign field workers in place and several more soon to be hired. Field offices in St. Louis and St. Charles should be opened within the week, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to deploy the resources we need to deliver Missouri for John McCain,'' Craighead said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also disputes how big of an operation Obama will place in the state. &quot;There's absolutely no way they're going to devote 150 full-time paid staff in Missouri,'' Craighead said. &quot;I believe they'll pull out staff and send them to states that Obama has a better chance of carrying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins, with the McCain campaign, contended that its hefty outlay for Missouri ads is a better indication of which candidate is more committed to the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since June 3, McCain has spent at least $850,787 to air TV ads on Missouri stations, according to Campaign Media Analysis Group, a nonpartisan Virginia-based firm monitoring ad spending for the Post-Dispatch. That compares to $312,898 for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clay backs Koster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Obama's biggest area boosters is U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis, the region's most prominent African-American elected official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this week, Clay shifted his attention to another contest: his party's nasty three-way primary fight for Missouri attorney general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clay announced he was supporting U.S. Sen. Chris Koster, D-Harrisonville. Clay also joined Koster, a St. Louis native, at several stops this week in north St. Louis County. Clay's endorsement puts him at odds with Koster's rivals, state Reps. Margaret Donnelly of Richmond Heights and Jeff Harris of Columbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clay praised Koster's &quot;great courage to cross over into the light'' when he switched political parties last year. Clay also chastised Koster's opponents for repeatedly questioning whether he's a true Democrat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clay's support comes as Koster has been under fire for his campaign fundraising practices. Most of Koster's campaign money originated from a few wealthy individuals, including multimillionaire Rex Sinquefield, who gave to numerous campaign committees that donated to Koster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clay's endorsement appeared aimed at helping Koster woo African-American votes. Koster also has hired former state Rep. Yaphett El-Amin, D-St. Louis, as part of that outreach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koster spokesman Danny Kanner denied behind-the-scenes talk that the campaign also has hired state Rep. Juanita Head Walton, or her husband, former state Rep. Elbert Walton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hulshof and Steelman Agree on many issues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Area Republicans heard little dissent Tuesday night during the first local forum featuring Missouri's two Republican candidates for governor - state Treasurer Sarah Steelman and U.S. Rep. Kenny Hulshof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Held at the Brentwood Community Center, the event underscored that Hulshof and Steelman agree on many issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both support lower taxes, fewer regulations on businesses and expanding the right to carry concealed weapons. Both oppose abortion, embryonic stem-cell research and the use of eminent domain for private developments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; Pg. D6</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1411 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite poor management, we can help prevent tragedy in future floods</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As many families grapple with catastrophic flooding in our region and others, my thoughts and prayers are with those in harm's way. My home is out of danger, but the entrance to my village closes when the water rises. That is to be expected with how the river is managed: narrower rivers cause higher flood waters. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers keeps building navigation structures that narrow the river, and it permits the building of levees around floodplains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My colleagues at the National Wildlife Federation and Washington University's Department of Earth and Planetary Science and I agree: We must adopt policies that restrict new building behind decertified levees and restrict the building of any levee that encourages development in high-risk areas. There are also things we can do now to reduce floodplain risk:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Review all significant dams and levees for risks and public safety; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Increase wetlands protections to reduce flooding and keep people safe;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Recommit to a national hazard mitigation policy with emphasis on voluntary buyouts of high-risk, flood-prone properties and dedicating high-risk, flood-prone lands to open-space uses;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Increase the nation's commitment to updating and improving floodplain maps, including urbanization;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Reduce global warming pollution that is fueling a warming climate and making tragedies such as these more frequent and more intense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We now have a more chaotic, more flood-prone river; we can't even predict when the historical spring-rise flood will occur. That's not good for the environment, fishermen, barge employees trying to get their products to market or residents of flooded towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress passed the Water Resources Development Act in November. It includes funding for an ecosystem-restoration program for the Upper Mississippi River. Many projects will require up to 35 percent cost-share funding from the states. Legislators must secure the funding to take advantage of the federal money for floodplain purchasing from willing land owners. Our flooded towns, fishermen, towboat operators and environment will thank them for being proactive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christine Favilla | Elsah Three Rivers Project Coordinator, Piasa Palisades Group of the Sierra Club</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No more levees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent flooding, both here and in Iowa, and in the spring in Valley Park, proves it is time for the state and federal governments to step in and stop the building of levees and the insuring of homes and businesses in floodplains. You can't control Mother Nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let these plains and river bottoms be used for farming and other basic uses without buildings or levees. We have enough government debt. We do not need more foolish development. Never mind that we are losing agricultural land and need more crops for our own use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Herr | Florissant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfettered greed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the editorial &quot;Failure pays&quot; (June 23): To the words &quot;obscene&quot; and &quot;unfair,&quot; as the paper characterized the payout packages for corporate executive failure, we might add &quot;embarrassing,&quot; &quot;fraudulent&quot; and &quot;legal embezzlement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress should reconsider the fact that corporations are considered legal entities shielded and protected to a degree from the welfare of public policy. And institutional and individual shareholders must continue to object strongly to the mismanagement of corporate pay in all its freebie forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that boards of directors listen to consultants and design executive contracts loaded with stock options, restricted stock and bonuses to attract top talent is a fiction. If these managers believe in their own ability, they can buy into their own stock with after-tax dollars, just like every other shareholder does. Managers and boards are running amok. If this unfettered and unwarranted greed is not contained, we may see the end of capitalism as we know it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can express our &quot;customer satisfaction&quot; rating by boycotting General Motors and Chrysler vehicles, tearing up Citicorp credit cards, moving brokerage accounts out of Merrill Lynch, and passing up lunch at Panera's Bread Co. And then &quot;short&quot; the stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laurence C. Day | Ladue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spreading the wealth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial &quot;Failure pays&quot; (June 23) addressed the money given wealthy CEOs, especially to those who are incompetent and lose their positions. The point about those wealthy individuals would be more credible if the paper would have included others whose wealth is subsidized by the average American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial omitted failing sports teams whose players draw millions per year. It omitted the owners who get tax advantages and who have the nerve to ask for new stadiums and other expensive items, expecting people to come up with the money instead of taking it from their own bloated pockets. It omitted wealthy businesses that have the nerve to ask for tax breaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It failed to point out the entertainment industry, which is raking in billions and then paying exorbitant salaries. Average citizens pay for this, through such means as increased prices for the items advertised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, there are the congressmen, senators, judges, etc., who can serve a short time and receive inflated retirement and health benefits for the rest of their lives. And there are all the add-ons to bills that provide luxury pork to countless areas and groups. Who pays for that? We do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of focusing on only one aspect of undeserved wealth, let's look at the wider picture. The Post-Dispatch should be a leader in this effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruth Hemmann | Des Peres</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working the advantages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Brooks marshals a kitchen sink-full of specious arguments to convince us that U.S. Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, is a sell-out &quot;Fast Eddie&quot; (&quot;Obama: 'Slick' doesn't even come close,&quot; June 24).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama did not take positions on politically sensitive issues in the Illinois legislature? Never mind that his non-votes reflected solidarity with the strategies of the Democratic leadership on issues on which there was no chance of prevailing and where votes might endanger at-risk Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He finally disavowed the Rev. Jeremiah Wright's rhetoric? If guilt-by-association won't work, crucify him because, after continuing provocations, he finally let Mr. Wright know that enough is enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not a workhorse senator? Mr. Obama was involved with more than 500 pieces of legislation that addressed such significant issues as foreign policy, legislative ethics, environmental and climate change, veterans' benefits, homeland security, consumer protection and education, among others. Compared to other junior senators, his record is outstanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brooks professes to be shocked that Mr. Obama exploits his campaign advantages, seeking some control over the terms of debate and selecting campaign finance protocols that may be most beneficial to him in an environment in which the public financing system already is broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is Mr. Brooks not equally concerned with the maneuvering of U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the presumptive Republican nominee, who poses as Mr. Clean while staffing his campaign with corporate lobbyists, embracing 527s, accepting special interest contributions and on and on ad nauseam? It is very clear to me which candidate is the real Fast Eddie who so disgusts Mr. Brooks, and his name is not Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willy Kessler | Ballwin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meet the new new, same as the old new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post-Dispatch positively gushed like a schoolgirl when it endorsed U.S. Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., trumpeting his candidacy as if he represented something new and refreshing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It hasn't taken long, however, to see that Mr. Obama is no different from candidates of the past. Despite being the least-experienced candidate in recent memory, Mr. Obama has shown that when it comes to flip-flopping, he's a veteran politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post-Dispatch lauded in glowing terms Mr. Obama's speech in which he stated that he could no more turn his back on the Rev. Jeremiah Wright then he would his very own family. Fast-forward a couple months, and Mr. Wright was tossed aside for political purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama vowed to participate in the public financing process if Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., did the same. Mr. McCain agreed, only to see Mr. Obama break his pledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Add his connection to convicted political fixer Tony Rezko, and Mr. Obama looks every bit the tawdry politician that he claims not to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he goes back on his word so readily now, why should we expect any different if he's elected in the fall?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amy (Shailene Woodley), a 15-year-old band geek, gets a big surprise when she finds out she's pregnant in the premiere of this new series from the creator of &quot;7th Heaven.&quot; Amy's mom is played by former teen queen Molly Ringwald, who starred in the teen pregnancy movie &quot;For Keeps&quot; in 1988.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want my candidate on MTV!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MTV has been active in trying to get its young viewers interested in politics. Now the network is looking to profit from it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MTV is selling time for political spots this election season, meaning pictures of Barack Obama and John McCain may turn up among the women of &quot;The Hills&quot; and souped-up vans on &quot;Pimp My Ride.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The network hasn't taken political advertising since its &quot;Choose or Lose&quot; political activism campaign in 1992, spokeswoman Jeannie Kedas said. &quot;Given where we are and how the young voters have become increasingly engaged, we decided political advertising would be a good fit for our audience,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MTV's corporate parent Viacom recently reported that its second quarter domestic advertising revenue growth would be 3 to 4 percent, after earlier forecasting a growth of 7 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strong ad sales for the fall and strong ratings, along with the political ad money, should help revenue growth, said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at Pali Capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kyle Roberts, president of Smart Media, a Washington-based firm that buys advertising time for GOP candidates, said, &quot;From a financial perspective, now is the best time ever because young people are going to have more of an impact on this election than ever before.&quot; The decision is most likely to benefit Democrat Obama, he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since his visit to southwest Missouri last week, presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain has aired more than three times as many campaign commercials in the state as his Democratic rival, Barack Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign outspent and out-aired Obama in every major media market in Missouri, including St. Louis, from June 19 through Wednesday. McCain held a town hall forum in Springfield, Mo., on June 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates' ad spending in Missouri and Illinois is being monitored for the Post-Dispatch by the Campaign Media Analysis Group, a Virginia-based, nonpartisan firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spent $224,696 for 791 spots that ran on local broadcast stations around Missouri. That compares to $115,054 spent by the Obama campaign to air 212 spots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's more aggressive spending comes as both campaigns say that Missouri is among their targeted states as they head into the remaining four months before the Nov. 4 general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is returning to Missouri on Monday, with a stop in Independence. That's his second visit to the state since he won enough delegates on June 3 to become the presumptive Democratic nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is running no TV ads on local stations in Illinois, while Obama is spending about $25,000 for spots airing in Southern Illinois markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama&nbsp;ad airing in Missouri is a 60-second biographical spot, while McCain's two ads each run 30 seconds. McCain's newest ad, which began airing Friday, promotes his energy proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both campaigns are running the bulk of their ad spots during morning and evening TV news programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both also seem to be targeting women and the elderly, running spots on Oprah Winfrey's talk show, the Wheel of Fortune game show and Entertainment Tonight, a celebrity gossip show.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama is targeting Missouri with some of his strongest campaign operatives, as well as ads, as part of a serious effort to carry the state in November, his national campaign manager said Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to mount as vigorous a campaign as we can in Missouri,'' said campaign manager David Plouffe in a conference call with reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It'll be close,&quot; he acknowledged, referring to Obama's Republican rival, John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri already is among 18 states, most of them swing states or Republican leaning, where Obama is running his first general-election ad. The 60-second spot is largely biographical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri television viewers with cable also are seeing some McCain spots on national cable stations such as MSNBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama narrowly carried Missouri in the Feb. 5 Democratic primary, defeating Hillary Rodham Clinton. McCain was the Republican victor in the GOP primary, although he received fewer votes than Obama or Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a general election, Missouri hasn't been captured by a Democrat since 1996, when Bill Clinton won re-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat John Kerry in Missouri by more than 200,000 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, Plouffe contends, Missouri is fertile territory for Obama's message. &quot;Foundationally, people in Missouri are looking for change,'' he said, adding that they were &quot;very unhappy about the economy&quot; and &quot;the way Washington works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're obviously going to have to do a very good job of optimizing the Democratic base,'' he said, adding that Obama's Missouri campaign operation was among his strongest on Feb. 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign is sending some of its &quot;strongest operatives'' into Missouri now, Plouffe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain spokesman Jeff Sadosky replied that their camp agreed with Plouffe's general assessment of the discontent among Missouri voters and the potential closeness of the contest between the candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sadosky predicted that, by November, Missouri voters would reject Obama's message and the man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's life history, he said, shows that he &quot;put his country ahead of his personal political ambitions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, said Sadosky, &quot;time and time again ... has placed his own personal and political ambitions ahead of the good of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 60-second commercial, called &quot;Country I Love,&quot; is a biographical portrait that seeks to reintroduce Obama to voters by stressing his mother's family's roots.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walking to save cash is a natural reaction to $4-a-gallon gas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One recent morning, in my unemployed splendor, I walked to the bank - much to the chagrin of every other person on the road. With gas at $4 a gallon and the price of every item on every shelf increasing seemingly by the day, I wanted to save money. So I decided to walk. It isn't very far from my home, and I did sweat a little, but the awkward looks that I received from passers by when I had to cross Big Bend Boulevard were remarkable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every head in every car stared at me as if I were an anomaly of nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I strolled through the crosswalk as people looked at me as if I were crazy. What is wrong with walking? Why has the American society turned its back on such a natural gift? I know it was hot, but it wasn't painful or uncomfortable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eisenhower Interstate project may be to blame, bisecting our city, segmenting and chopping our neighborhoods into small pockets of unused sidewalks. Perhaps our discomfort with being slightly uncomfortable has created the car culture, with air-conditioned seats and climate-controlled cup holders. We are resigned to an unnatural state of living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sweating is a natural reaction to the summer months; walking is a natural reaction to $4 gas. I urge St. Louis to get up and walk to the nearest grocery, coffee shop, bank or drug store and let's see how much gas our Midwestern city can save. I'm not a proponent of changing everything, and I know that if you live in Brentwood and you work downtown, driving is essential. But once you get home from work, don't get back in the car; instead, walk to local businesses to support your health and your neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Presson | Richmond Heights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toot St. Louis' horn</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How inspirational it is that the bi-state region was named an &quot;All-America City&quot; for the first time since 1956. More than 100 communities competed this year, and the St. Louis region was the only metropolitan area, rather than just a city, to receive the award. What's disappointing is that the story of this prestigious national-level recognition was buried on page A15 of the Saturday paper (&quot;'All-America City' title is bestowed on this region,&quot; June 7). When will our mainstream media move past the mentality of &quot;when it bleeds it leads&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people of the St. Louis metro region are accomplishing outstanding deeds that are remarkable in terms of the sacrifice and creative approaches to problem solving often involved. This May, FOCUS St. Louis honored 20 regional success stories at our annual &quot;What's Right With The Region!&quot; awards celebration. These successes - and the three projects that just won us the All-America City award - are major stories, each worthy of a large headline on the front page. Will we ever see them there?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christine A. Chadwick | St. Louis Executive Director, FOCUS St. Louis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we open it, they will come</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis Convention &amp; Visitors Commission Chairman Dan Dierdorf's responsibility is far greater than keeping a football team in St. Louis for eight to 10 macho, high-decibel, manic Sundays a year. He is charged with recovering for St. Louis a healthy flow of conventions, associations meetings, travel groups and people who travel from one area to another for entertainment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means Kiel Opera House, a 100-nights-a-year Muny and, as the cherry on the sundae, the Goldenrod Showboat on the riverfront.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breeder reactors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;2nd nuclear plant is back in play in Callaway County&quot; (June 9): It is good news that AmerenUE is considering another nuclear plant. The next step is to get the government off its duff and allow the building of breeder reactors. A breeder reactor produces more fuel than it consumes, with no waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R.N. Kersting | Sunset Hills</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spirit of A-B</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Years ago, I moved to St. Louis with TWA. Before, during and after those wonderful years, Anheuser-Busch was important to me as a product and as a representation of what a corporate citizen should be. We spoke of the Busch family as if we knew them personally and defended the brand to all comers. I even booked travel for the cockatoo when I worked at Maritz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have been back in North Carolina for three years now, and I still tear up at Clydesdale commercials and Bud Light radio spots. I recently spent a month in the United Kingdom on business and was pleased to see Budweiser prominently displayed and consumed. I miss seeing the big neon eagle on Interstate 64/U.S. Highway 40 and the camels at Grant's Farm. The day the stockholders sell their souls to InBev, I will have had my last A-B product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pamela Gladney | Charlotte, N.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Louis could be beer capital of the world</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why can't St. Louis be the beer capital of the world and not just the United States? St. Louis has the tradition, the resources and certainly the competitive spirit in Anheuser-Busch. It's common knowledge that the consumption of beer is going up in Latin America, and even more so throughout Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A loss of Anheuser-Busch could mean the loss of thousands of jobs and a further weakening of the city's reputation as a corporate headquarters center. It certainly would make the city less of a tourist and convention attraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By all means, our civic leaders and media should encourage all shareholders of Anheuser-Busch stock to reject any possible offer coming from Belgium or Brazil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of what some people say, they don't like us in brewing circles in Europe. St. Louis is a great city, and we all should fight to make it better and more successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louis F. Desloge Jr. | Creve Coeur</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victory for rule of law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court should be applauded by every lawyer in America. Whether you are John Adams, Woodrow Wilson, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson or George W. Bush, you may not step outside the boundaries of the law. The decisions were a major victory for the rule of law in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rory Ellinger | O'Fallon, Mo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not the end, a beginning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton's concession speech was her first campaign speech of the 2012 election contest. The Clintons know that U.S. Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, is not electable (and they said so during the nomination campaign) and is going to lose to U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the presumptive Republican nominee, in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That leaves 2012 up for grabs, and Bill and Hillary Clinton eagerly are awaiting another chance. Although graciously pledging to support Mr. Obama, as a good Democrat should, she must hope he will lose in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She will be only 64 years old in 2012. If Mr. McCain decides to run again, at age 76, Ms. Clinton should be a shoo-in against such a lackluster opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles E. Williams | St. Charles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What price will we pay?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Obama's health care RX&quot; (June 11): U.S. Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, accompanied a nurse during her shift at Barnes-Jewish Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who are uninsured need to be cared for. As a society, we need to help our neighbors in need. That is not the issue. The issue is whether we want to provide universal health care for everyone or provide only for those who are uninsured or underinsured because of financial hardship? And how much are we willing to pay?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few years ago, we visited friends in Brussels and talked at length about the soft socialism that defines Europe. People in most Europeon countries are cared for from cradle to grave. In some countries, housing, higher education and health care are provided. It all sounds wonderful. But there are problems that are not discussed. It isn't all happiness and light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To pay for all of this, Europeans are taxed, taxed and taxed some more. In Belgium, people are taxed if they have more than one television, inheritance taxes are over the top and income is taxed. You name it, and it probably is taxed and taxed heavily. This doesn't even begin to discuss the bureaucracy and rules governing all of these &quot;free&quot; programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to be very careful as a nation as we decide what price we are willing to pay. No matter what, it will cost us and it could cost every individual dearly in terms of independence and freedom. Americans value our rights to freedom, privacy and independence from government intervention in our lives. We are treading on very shaky ground.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama and John McCain are billing themselves as distant from special interests. It doesn't take a very deep look into their White House bids to see that's not quite the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential races tap into the same political circles that keep lobbyists employed and the revolving door spinning. Obama and McCain have a long way to go to free themselves of insiders and special interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roughly one-third of 93 &quot;Reagan alumni&quot; who endorsed McCain have been or are registered to lobby, though McCain never said so. The Florida fundraising team for McCain and the Republican National Committee, announced last week, includes at least two Florida lobbyists: Fred Karlinsky is Florida counsel to the Property Casualty Insurers Association, which lobbies in Washington on consumer issues, disaster planning and insurance; the other, Thomas Panza, was on Florida business regulation and health care study commissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's team in Nevada included at least two lobbyists: one who represented Barrick Gold of North America, a mining company that also lobbies in Washington, and another whose clients included U.S. Airways, Corrections Corp. of America and the consulting firm Accenture, which lobby in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's advisory committee on legal issues, announced last month, included at least nine lobbyists, but McCain didn't identify them as such. Instead, his campaign listed their former government positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama accepted an endorsement from former Sen. Don Riegle of Michigan but never mentioned Riegle also is a Washington lobbyist whose clients include London-based metals merchant Norimet Ltd. and Geneva-based liquor distributor SPI Group SA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama and the Democratic National Committee announced Thursday that the party will follow Obama's policy of turning away donations from Washington lobbyists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, McCain adopted a conflict-of-interest policy that drove some Washington lobbyists from his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To consort only with outsiders, McCain and Obama would have to shun leaders of their own parties. The Democratic and Republican national committees include well-known Washington lobbyists among their top officials. Some Democratic superdelegates are lobbyists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lobbyists have made campaign appearances for McCain. They include former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, chief executive of the American Council of Life Insurers and co-chairman of &quot;Catholics for McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 17 lobbyists are among McCain's top fundraisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's biggest fundraisers include Charles Adams Jr., a partner in Hogan &amp; Hartson, a law and lobbying firm active in Washington, and Michael Froman, an executive at Citigroup, which spent $8 million lobbying in Washington last year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama and John McCain turned their eyes to fundraising Monday, with their reputations as campaign reformers on the line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first week of the general election campaign for the presidential nominees-in-waiting saw Obama at a fundraising stop in St. Louis, while McCain appealed to contributors in Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's appearance in a St. Louis hotel ballroom was an old-school event for the politician who has moved the money chase into cyberspace, raising $265 million in the process. Nonetheless, his local backers hoped Monday's fundraiser would snag $1 million for the campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has built a party-sized donor base of over 1.5 million people, and on Monday he appealed for 30,000 more in an e-mail asking supporters to continue building the organization &quot;by stepping up and owning a piece of the campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, McCain is raising money in New York today after two events with donors in Virginia on Monday. His campaign repeated its call for Obama to live up to an earlier pledge to submit to public funding and spending limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Senator McCain made a pledge to do that, and we expect that Senator Obama will stand by his pledge to accept public financing,&quot; said McCain spokeswoman Crystal Benton, adding that McCain was &quot;moving toward&quot; accepting federal funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's Internet money machine - buttressed by Hillary Rodham Clinton's financial backers signing on - could overwhelm McCain's fundraising operation, experts said Tuesday. But they expect McCain to be well-funded with the help of the Republican National Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain had a moderately strong April, bringing in $21.5 million, and his $37 million on hand enabled him to unleash an early ad campaign in Missouri and several other swing states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benton contended that McCain &quot;will be well-positioned to run an aggressive and competitive campaign through the general election.&quot; McCain aides pointed to the help they can expect from the RNC, whose $50 million war chest can be diverted to McCain's use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being amply funded in the months ahead will be vital, given both campaigns' stated intentions to expand the usual electoral map. Obama wants to focus on Republican-voting states like Virginia and Colorado, while McCain tries to reverse pro-Democrat voting patterns in the upper Midwest and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disarmament?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign has not said whether he will follow up on an earlier assertion that it would &quot;aggressively pursue&quot; an agreement with McCain to take public financing, which would provide about $85 million for each candidate from September through the Nov. 4 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidates who agree to accept the public money are then bound by spending limits, which have yet to be set. That would not prevent spending by the national committees and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spokesman Bill Burton said the campaign would decide &quot;soon&quot; on general election financing. He noted that the broad participation the Obama campaign has generated is a goal of campaign finance reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To many Obama partisans, submitting to the federal system would have the effect of &quot;unilateral disarmament&quot; given the fundraising trails the Illinois senator has blazed through the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., developed the reputation as one of his party's most astute financial operatives, raising money first for Bill Clinton's presidential campaigns and later for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that orchestrated a takeover in the House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his fundraising efforts for Clinton were &quot;horse-and-buggy&quot; compared with Obama's computer-generated millions. &quot;They hit shift-F7, there's no sweat equity, no time difference, and you produce millions of dollars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">obama's decision</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Corrado, a fundraising expert and a professor at Colby College in Maine, said he expects Obama to have a significant fundraising advantage. But he added that McCain will still have plenty of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corrado said each campaign likely will have about $50 million to $60 million for operating until the political conventions in late August and early September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the $85 million in public financing, McCain could raise $10 million to cover legal and accounting expenses, then spend another $19 million in coordination with the RNC. The Republican effort could total a respectable $250 million this fall, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Obama, deciding to take the federal money also could limit his campaign's ability to control its message. Asking his supporters to direct their contributions to the national Democratic Party would complicate advertising and other facets of an Obama operation that so far has been tightly and frugally run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corrado is among those who expect Obama to be a realist rather than a reformer. &quot;The practical reality of wanting to win is going to trump any desire to abide by public funding for the sake of abiding by public funding,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public finance advocates argue that while Obama's grass-roots fundraising has reduced the prevalence of big-money contributors, he could impede broader reform if he chooses to become the first presidential candidate in more than a generation to run solely on private contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocates like Craig Holman, a campaign finance expert for the nonprofit Public Citizen, say Obama could send a damaging message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's still raising money from donors who want favors from the Obama administration,&quot; Holman said, adding that self-described reformers should &quot;not be the ones presiding over the selling of the White House this time around.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's the deal?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama was coming to town and I complained to my wife about not getting a call or a visit from the assumed Democratic presidential nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, Vicki knew I was kidding. But she played along anyway: &quot;It's probably because you were such a naysayer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's right. I was initially an &quot;un-decider&quot; when it came to Obama's campaign. I still kick myself when I think back to my brief, one-on-one meeting with the candidate last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There I was, all racked with doubt, trying to get Obama to share my gloomy perspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's cut to the chase,&quot; I said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;OK, let's,&quot; he responded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I spouted reasons he couldn't win: fear of a black president, claims that he wasn't &quot;black enough,&quot; his middle name (Hussein), dirty political tricks, and so on and so forth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama just flashed that toothy smile of his and talked about the nation's desire for change and the unbeatable power of &quot;hope.&quot; Once voters really get to know him, he said, &quot;I have no doubts we'll do very well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, I still had doubts back then. I even wrote about them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guess that's why he didn't call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, a fella can dream, right? I certainly did - big time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I imagined my &quot;friend&quot; Barack and I sitting in my den, sipping pi&ntilde;a coladas, watching DVDs of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright sermons, discussing his Republican opponent, John McCain, and my potential gig as the next White House press secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I suppose his fundraiser Monday was a tad more important than hanging out with his bud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the very least, Michelle Obama could have checked in. After all, I was among the few who defended her &quot;First time in my adult life ... I am really proud of my country&quot; comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I agreed with her, writing that I was pleasantly shocked we've evolved to a point where a woman or black man could be our next president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps Mrs. Obama forgot that she was the one who pulled me aboard her husband's bandwagon when we talked in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, I tried my negativity spiel on &quot;The Closer.&quot; Michelle Obama wasn't having it. She whipped out the civil rights card, reminding me of the sacrifices of icons Medgar Evers, Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been quite a ride ever since. I've gone from &quot;no hope&quot; to &quot;hopeful,&quot; back to &quot;hopeless&quot; and now, cautious optimism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's that Rev. Wright issue. It reminds me that race is still Obama's handicap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a Pew Research Center study last week, the Rev. Wright &quot;scandal&quot; was the most widely heard campaign story so far, with more than 60 percent of those surveyed saying they heard a lot about Wright's speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exit polls during the Indiana and North Carolina primaries showed that nearly half the Democratic voters said the &quot;Wright issue&quot; was an important factor in choosing a candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was shocked when Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell said in February that there were whites who aren't ready to vote for a black president. The statement wasn't surprising, but the fact that he said it publicly certainly was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently, he wasn't just talking about Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few months ago, a good lawyer friend of mine told me that some of his contemporaries weren't voting for Obama because they fear that, once elected, black activists such as the Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton would have open access to the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, these are not the sentiments of so-called &quot;working-class whites&quot; who, we're told, haven't connected with Obama. These are college-educated professionals clinging to this irrational notion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While America was in a state of shock over words uttered by a black preacher years ago, I was stunned by the comments of a right-winger three months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How did Pat Buchanan summon the gall to write that blacks ought to &quot;thank God&quot; they were brought here on slave ships, &quot;introduced to Christian salvation&quot; and &quot;allowed&quot; to reach great levels of &quot;freedom and prosperity&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where was the outcry, the calls to denounce and reject? Buchanan's comments didn't anger as many as Wright's. Why? Because Buchanan is seen as a singular, loudmouthed windbag. He's no real threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But somehow, Wright is. As irrational as it is, blacks are widely viewed as a monolithic people. Apparently, we share the same passions and frustrations. Therefore, when Wright speaks, he's speaking for us all, including the black presidential candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This explains my attitude of cautious optimism. Racial hang-ups are still deeply rooted in this country. How much has really changed since 1988, when an ad featuring a black convicted murderer, Willie Horton, scared voters away from Michael Dukakis?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, I'm excited about Obama's chances, but I fear the obstacle of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oops. There I go again - going all negative. It's probably a good thing Obama didn't call.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's no mystery why Barack Obama will return Monday to the bellwether state of Missouri a week after sewing up the Democratic presidential nomination. But what was he doing in traditionally Republican Virginia on his first trip since clinching?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what was John McCain thinking last week when he campaigned in Wisconsin, so heavily Democratic in some years that Michael Dukakis won it in 1988? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answers lie in the belief of this year's nominees-in-waiting that there are new opportunities in some states in their quests for the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changing voting patterns is a tall order: In 2004, 47 states voted in the same red-blue pattern of 2000. The only states to change were Iowa and New Mexico (to Republican) and New Hampshire (to Democratic).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, Obama and McCain see a playing field that is changing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is sending early signals of how the map is changing, running statewide television ads in Missouri, as well as in Michigan, Colorado and Nevada, and targeted ads in New Mexico. Meanwhile, Obama, who deployed a masterly small-state strategy to win the nomination, sees expanded opportunity in Virginia, North Carolina and perhaps even Georgia and Mississippi, with their large black voting blocs, by virtue of his status as the first African-American to win a major-party nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats also believe that the rising influence of Hispanics in American politics is on the verge of changing the electoral map in their favor, especially in New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada. With 15 percent of the population, Hispanics are America's largest minority. They could make up nearly 30 percent of the U.S. population by 2050.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he has set the table for a new map,&quot; said Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., one of the Senate's most energetic Obama backers. &quot;If the map turns out at the end of the process to be similar, he will have at least made this election about the people of the country rather than a chess match.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hard To Flip</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigns begin by committing to the swing states. Often, they are states the other party barely won the time before: In 2004, George W. Bush narrowly captured Florida, Ohio and Nevada just as John Kerry (and Al Gore before him) scored narrow wins in states such as Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Add to that the historic candidacy of Obama and an economy favoring Democrats, and you have the makings of a political map strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidates will have geography in mind when choosing running mates. For instance, Southwestern governors Bill Richardson (New Mexico) and Janet Napolitano (Arizona) have been mentioned on the Democratic side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For McCain, the electoral map likely will be a factor as he sizes up potential running mates, such as Florida Gov. Charlie Crist and ex-Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his broader strategy, McCain sees openings in the upper Midwest and Democratic-leaning states where Obama lost to Hillary Clinton among working-class whites. McCain also has his eye on New Hampshire, which voted Democratic in 2004 but where he has twice won stirring primary victories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think that McCain can expand the number of states where we have been competitive in the last two cycles, and places like Missouri and Iowa are key on the list,&quot; said Gentry Collins, a McCain regional director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to his identity as a maverick, McCain also might compete strongly in Ohio, Pennsylvania and other states where another Republican might have faltered, party analysts believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton's terrific performance in Ohio really puts that state at risk for Obama,&quot; said Neil Newhouse, a GOP pollster in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans view Michigan as primed for takeover. Obama's name wasn't on the ballot of that state's all-but-meaningless Democratic primary, and therefore he didn't build the type of organization he has in other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michigan pollster Ed Sarpolus said that Mitt Romney, whose family has deep roots in the state, would clearly be an asset there for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's basically a 50-50 state here, and neither candidate really has an edge,&quot; Sarpolus said. &quot;People are waiting to hear Obama's economic message. All they've heard is 'change' and his war message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hispanics Rising</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans see hope in Obama's difficulty attracting the votes of Hispanics. Clinton won more than 60 percent of Hispanic votes in the primary season, adding an exclamation point with her emphatic victory in Puerto Rico last Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, McCain began running ads on Spanish-language radio stations in the Southwest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colorado GOP chair Dick Wadhams said that despite Democratic hopes to capture his state, he believes McCain can blunt Obama's inroads into the Hispanic vote while beating him handily in rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think Obama's discouraging words on rural voters will go over well in Colorado,&quot; Wadhams said, referring to Obama's remark this spring that certain voters cling to guns and religion out of bitterness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg contended that McCain's&nbsp;ad buy in the Southwest was a &quot;sign of weakness, not strength.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Obama's problems with Hispanics, Rosenberg, president of the New Democratic Network think tank, argued that McCain has no chance to match George W. Bush's success in drawing 40 percent of the Hispanic vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obama is going to be able to communicate in Spanish that John McCain threw Hispanics overboard when he dropped the immigration bill,&quot; Rosenberg said, referring to McCain's decision to renounce some of his moderate views on immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wherever candidates end up going, it's a sure bet that Missouri will be on the travel schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCaskill said that winning statewide in Missouri, particularly in rural areas, is a challenge for any Democrat. But she added: &quot;As people get comfortable with (Obama's) life story, when they see that he has traveled a difficult journey and earned everything he's gotten, I think they will be drawn to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Replied McCain strategist Collins: &quot;The fact of the matter is that Senator McCain is a known quantity and has the experience to lead the country forward. I think he's a much more appealing candidate to middle America and to rural voters in places like Missouri.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The blond heroine of the campy television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&quot; as well as other works by creator Joss Whedon, is to be the focus of an academic conference this weekend at Henderson State University. The show starring Sarah Michelle Gellar won cult fame and critical praise during its seven seasons on The WB and UPN networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since it ended, the series has spawned enough academic books on the philosophy surrounding the roles of friendship and feminism to fill a 15-foot-wide bookshelf at the college in Arkadelphia, Ark., said Kevin Durand, an associate professor of philosophy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has staying power,&quot; Durand said. &quot;It's like I tell my students in philosophy a lot of times: We're not so much about necessarily finding all the answers as wanting to ask better questions. 'Buffy,' I think, does that. 'Buffy' never really leaves you with nice, pat answers. You have even more questions than when you started.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMahon, 85, appeared with his wife, Pamela. The couple said they are $644,000 behind on their mortgage payments and are in negotiations with lender Countrywide Home Loans Inc. to set a foreclosure date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMahon, in a neck brace, said he had stopped working since he broke his neck in a fall 18 months ago. He didn't elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMahon, who was Johnny Carson's sidekick on the &quot;Tonight&quot; show, said the house had been on the market for two years and that although 50 organizations or individuals had looked at it, no one had made an offer. Documents show McMahon has a $4.8 million mortgage on the home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publisher sues Victoria Gotti</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victoria Gotti, daughter of the late mob boss John Gotti, was sued by HarperCollins Publishers Worldwide for failing to complete a memoir about her life or return a $70,000 advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gotti, 45, a former columnist for the New York Post and sister of accused gangster John A. &quot;Junior&quot; Gotti, starred in the reality television show &quot;Growing Up Gotti&quot; about her life with her three sons, which was broadcast on A&amp;E.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stars shine at NBA Finals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local troubadour James Taylor welcomed his hometown team back to the NBA Finals on Thursday night in Boston, singing the national anthem before Game 1 of the Boston Celtics' 98-88 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actors Bruce Willis and Leonardo DiCaprio, who have made the TD Banknorth Garden a second home while filming movies in town, were also in the star-studded crowd. So were &quot;Grey's Anatomy&quot; star Ellen Pompeo and Chris Tucker of the &quot;Rush Hour&quot; movies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court was ringed by members of the New England Patriots - including Randy Moss, Richard Seymour and Rodney Harrison - and Celtics and Lakers alumni from Bill Russell and John Havlicek to Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd also took time out to send its best wishes to Sen. Ted Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who is recovering from brain surgery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN's queen of quirk keeps</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">her sense of humor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, man. One little joke about Barack Obama and that Middle Eastern fellow with the rhyming name, and her inbox is piled high with squawky offended e-mail. It's enough to make Jeanne Moos wish she were back interviewing three-legged pantyhose or even two-headed turtles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm used to doing dog stories,&quot; says CNN's queen of quirk, shaking her head as she leafs through outraged denunciations ranging from not particularly bright to how low can you sink? &quot;Dogs don't write in. I've never gotten any angry e-mails from dogs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there's one lesson Moos has learned in the 12 months since becoming a regular on Situation Room, the network's daily campaign roundup, it's that political activists have much less of a sense of humor than the average canine. Whether she's musing on John McCain's difficulties using a teleprompter or Hillary Clinton's befuddlement at the technology of convenience-store coffee machines, Moos has drawn almost daily fire.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two presumptive presidential nominees, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain, are kick-starting their campaigns in Missouri in moves that underscore the state's political importance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign announced Friday that he'll spend Monday and Tuesday in Missouri - a longer visit that initially announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidate's first stop will be an evening fundraiser Monday at the Renaissance Grand Hotel downtown, where tickets will range from $500 to $2,300 apiece. The event is otherwise closed to the public, and press access will be limited to a few media outlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign schedule for Tuesday was unclear as of Friday, but local supporters say tentative plans call for some sort of issue-oriented event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, McCain was slated today to launch TV ads in Missouri and nine other states deemed crucial to his White House bid. The first ad will focus on national security, his campaign has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's campaign also announced Friday that it has hired a state campaign director, Dave Hageman, who now is executive director of an Ellisville-based political consulting firm, Victory Enterprises-Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 2003 to 2007, he was executive director of the state House Republican Campaign Committee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain wasted no time Tuesday night in launching his first general-election broadside against Sen. Barack Obama, casting the Illinois Democrat as an out-of-touch liberal who offers a false promise of change. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a prime-time speech designed to upstage Obama on the night he claimed the Democratic nomination, McCain began what top aides and other Republicans promise will be an aggressive effort to claim the mantles of reform, experience and mainstream values. Obama is an &quot;impressive man,&quot; McCain said, but one with a thin record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For all his fine words and all his promise, he has never taken the hard but right course of risking his own interests for yours; of standing against the partisan rancor on his side to stand up for our country,&quot; McCain said less than two hours before Obama spoke in the same St. Paul, Minn., arena where McCain, of Arizona, will claim the Republican nomination in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain began his speech by praising Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who in the Democratic primary race won over many rural and working-class voters whom McCain hopes to capture in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the father of three daughters, I owe her a debt for inspiring millions of women to believe there is no opportunity in this great country beyond their reach,&quot; McCain said. &quot;I am proud to call her my friend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two McCain aides said his speech was the beginning of a &quot;great debate&quot; on the direction of the country. It will be followed quickly by a television ad campaign aimed at reinforcing McCain's core message: that Obama's sweeping rhetoric offers little real promise of changing the political culture in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confronting what his aides expect to be Obama's principal attack against him, McCain explicitly rejected the idea that he represents President George W. Bush's third term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why does Sen. Obama believe it's so important to repeat that idea over and over again?&quot; he asked. &quot;Because he knows it's very difficult to get Americans to believe something they know is false.&quot; As evidence of his independence, McCain highlighted his breaks with Bush on Iraq, energy and climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech, Obama honored McCain's service but derided the Republican's claim to stand for change, linking him to what he called the &quot;failed&quot; foreign and economic policies of Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So I'll say this - there are many words to describe John McCain's attempt to pass off his embrace of George Bush's policies as bipartisan and new,&quot; Obama said. &quot;But change is not one of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
