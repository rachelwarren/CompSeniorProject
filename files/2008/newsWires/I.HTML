</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bolstered by this year's elections, local television ad revenue is projected to be near a record high. But with the economic swoon and no political ad campaigns in 2009, TV ad revenue could hit a 10-year low next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historically, there's no mass medium that benefits more from an election year than TV, and this year's tight primary and general election races&nbsp;along with a boost from the Summer Olympics&nbsp;are pushing ad revenue even higher than previously projected by industry experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest projections have 2008 TV ad revenue for all local stations edging toward $ 205 million, according to BIA Financial Network Inc., a Virginia-based financial and strategic consultancy for the TV and communications industries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's up from $ 192.4 million a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The market's TV revenue record came in 2006, when the economy was still robust. That year, advertisers bought $ 203 million in advertising. This year's record number comes as the economy unravels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political advertising has absolutely saved the broadcasters in the Indianapolis market,&quot; said BIA Vice President Mark Fratrik, an economist who closely tracks TV ad revenue nationwide. &quot;The revenue has been pushed up substantially by the Obama-Clinton primary battle and the Obama-McCain general election. Indiana is benefiting from the type of spending usually reserved for swing states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has spent $ 11 million and counting on advertising in this market, industry experts said. That number could easily hit $ 12 million by the Nov. 4 election. Gov. Mitch Daniels, who is running against Democrat Jill Long Thompson, has spent $ 11 million statewide, with a good deal of that in the Indianapolis market, industry experts said. McCain, who has chosen to focus on other states, has spent $ 3 million in this market, and Thompson, who isn't as well-funded as Daniels, has spent $ 2 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, industry experts estimate that political campaigns bought $ 30 million worth of advertising in central Indiana during 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has never been a political buy in this state of this size never, ever, ever,&quot; said Bill Perkins, a longtime local media buyer and president of Perkins Nichols Media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could have been even better if not for weak spending in the 7th Congressional District race between Democrat Andre Carson and Republican Gabrielle Campo and in the 9th District where Republican Mike Sodrel and Democrat Baron Hill have been unusually quiet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In several cases, the spending on local races just didn't rise to the level it has in the past,&quot; said Jim Tellus, general manager at WTHR-TV Channel 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Olympics, which industry experts estimated added $ 4 million to $ 5 million in TV advertising to the market, also helped bolster the year. Much of that went to WTHR, an NBC affiliate that broadcast the Summer Games. Tellus said WTHR beat revenue projections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Olympics were phenomenal for us,&quot; Tellus said. &quot;This market had the highest ratings in the Eastern time zone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without political and Olympics ads to lean on, the economic downturn is expected to take TV advertising&nbsp;locally and nationally&nbsp;to new lows. The 2009 projections are startling, BIA's Fratrik said, because TV has so far not bent to many of the forces that have plagued radio, newspapers and other print publications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;TV has been more Web-proof,&quot; Fratrik said. &quot;It's remained a place where people continue to go for information and entertainment despite all the technological advancements we've seen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BIA earlier this year projected the local market would bring in $ 190.8 million in 2009 ad revenue. Fratrik has since revised that to $ 185 million. &quot;That might be optimistic,&quot; he said. &quot;We just don't yet know the depth of this downturn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a particularly critical time for broadcasters, with the stations' conversion to digital and high-definition in full swing. Capital needed to make the leap from analog to digital has reached into the millions for most local broadcasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Luckily, our transmitters, our editing equipment, our cameras have all been switched to digital,&quot; said Don Lundy, WRTV-TV Channel 6 general manager. &quot;That puts us in a much better position to weather whatever the future brings. If this economic downturn had happened a year or two ago, it would have been much worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the demands of keeping up with technology are intense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an acutely competitive industry, so there's always pressure to push forward with technology,&quot; said Robert Unmacht, principal of iN3 Partners Inc., a Nashville, Tenn.-based media and investment banking consultancy. Unmacht said stations have spent heavily to keep up with the demands of streaming video and other Web technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the biggest concerns for 2009 is that falling demand for advertising will start a pricing war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In some cases this year, broadcasters have completely sold out their inventory, especially in the last half of October, due to the demand of political advertisers,&quot; Perkins said. &quot;That has kept rates inflated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local media buyers reported that 30-second spots on some local TV stations in the last month are going for 50 percent higher than the norm. For instance, a 30-second ad during some local newscasts, media buyers said, is going for $ 1,200 to $ 1,800. Normally, those rates would be $ 700 to $ 1,200, depending on the time and station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BIA's Fratrik said next year will be a switch from a seller's market to a buyer's market. Already, TV stations are seeing a dramatic drop&nbsp;up to 40 percent over the last three months&nbsp;in automotive advertising, typically TV's biggest ad category. Advertising by entertainment outlets, restaurants, hotel and travel-related businesses is also down double-digit percentages, according to BIA figures. Those trends are expected to continue in 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are indications that the softness in 2009 could lead to an ad rate war,&quot; Perkins said. &quot;I think TV ad revenue next year could sink lower than it's been in a decade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WISH-TV Channel 8 General Manager Jeff White has little doubt the industry will bounce back. He points to data from New York-based Nielsen Media Research that shows local TV viewership in the last seven years has increased 7 percent to 21 percent, depending on the time of day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fratrik thinks the economy will rebound in time to push TV advertising to a double-digit percentage increase in 2010 over 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not seeing an erosion of viewers,&quot; White said. &quot;The reason TV ad revenue is going down is, the economy is going down. This is a situational change, and not a paradigm shift of viewers away from television.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVANSVILLE Ind.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's unprecedented campaign in Indiana to win the state's 11 electoral votes kept up in the last weekend before Election Day. Republican John McCain, meanwhile, is on his way back as he hopes to hold onto the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden's stop Saturday in the southwestern tip of the state followed a Friday night rally by Obama in northwestern Indiana that drew about 40,000 people in a final push by Obama to become the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Indiana in 44 years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three statewide polls released this week have shown the race between Obama and McCain to be in a dead heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden told about 1,600 people at a downtown Evansville rally that he and Barack Obama would take a bipartisan spirit to the White House and work to revive the nation's economy and restore America's reputation in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to unite this country,&quot; Biden said. &quot;We need to move past the political attacks that we have seen in the last few weeks of this campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden urged those in the fired-up crowd, some waving placards and at times chanting &quot;Yes we can,&quot; to vote early. He noted that they could do so after the rally at a nearby civic center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state has a record 4.5 million voters registered this year, and election officials have encouraged early voting to ease congestion at the polls on Election Day. As of Friday morning, more than 455,000 people had cast early ballots statewide, and Secretary of State Todd Rokita has predicted a record turnout for Election Day on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Perry, 42, of Evansville said he attended the rally on Saturday to show his support for Obama and Biden, especially their message of change on the economic front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his wife, Valerie, already had voted early and he planned to do the same right after the rally &quot;because I think it's going to be chaos at the polls&quot; on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's rally speech in Highland Friday night was his eighth campaign stop in Indiana since mid-July, following 40 stops leading up to the state's May primary. Biden's trip to Evansville was his second solo stop since being named Obama's running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has scheduled an airport rally for Monday in Indianapolis. His last previous stop in the state was on July 1, but that wasn't even an appeal to Indiana voters as he spoke to a national sheriffs convention and then to a private fundraiser in Indianapolis. Palin has made three trips to Indiana since mid-October, drawing big crowds to rallies in Noblesville, Fort Wayne and Jeffersonville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans say they believe McCain and running mate Sarah Palin appeal to the state's long-standing conservative leanings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Rep. Mike Pence, whose district covers much of eastern Indiana, said in an interview that he expected a McCain victory in Indiana because of his record on national defense, as a fiscal conservative and his anti-abortion stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Pence also said he was not surprised that Obama decided to make a major push in Indiana after the state's hotly contested Democratic primary between the Illinois senator and Hillary Rodham Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe he recognized the way a neighbor does that Hoosiers have a much greater bipartisan tradition than generally shows up on the board during Election Night on presidential years,&quot; Pence said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign spent about $6 million on TV commercials in Indiana leading up to the May primary, and has spent at least that much on television ads in the state since June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Television ads on McCain's behalf did not begin in the state until late September and even then he has been heavily outspent. The Obama campaign spent nearly $1.25 million on Indiana advertising during Oct. 21-28, nearly four times the $336,000 spent on McCain ads, according to an analysis by the Wisconsin Advertising Project at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also has had an almost-constant stream of events around the state with prominent politicians and celebrities, such as former &quot;Today&quot; show host Jane Pauley and hip-hop music pioneer Russell Simmons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Democratic Sen. Birch Bayh has made dozens of stops in smaller towns across the state over the past month. The father of current Sen. Evan Bayh typically told his audiences about how he won his first U.S. Senate race in 1962 by an average of two votes per precinct, and urged everyone to find a couple more votes for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the first time since people can remember that their vote really can make a difference,&quot; Bayh said. &quot;This is a chance for Hoosier voters to really make a difference because we don't know how the other electoral votes are going to shake out. I think it's fair to say that if Indiana casts its 11 electors for Barack Obama, he's going to be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama's unprecedented campaign in Indiana to win the state's 11 electoral votes kept up in the last weekend before Election Day. Republican John McCain, meanwhile, is on his way back as he hopes to hold onto the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden's stop Saturday in the southwestern tip of the state followed a Friday night rally by Obama in northwestern Indiana that drew about 40,000 people in a final push by Obama to become the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Indiana in 44 years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three statewide polls released this week have shown the race between Obama and McCain to be in a dead heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden told about 1,600 people at a downtown Evansville rally that he and Barack Obama would take a bipartisan spirit to the White House and work to revive the nation's economy and restore America's reputation in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to unite this country,&quot; Biden said. &quot;We need to move past the political attacks that we have seen in the last few weeks of this campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biden urged those in the fired-up crowd, some waving placards and at times chanting &quot;Yes we can,&quot; to vote early. He noted that they could do so after the rally at a nearby civic center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state has a record 4.5 million voters registered this year, and election officials have encouraged early voting to ease congestion at the polls on Election Day. As of Friday morning, more than 455,000 people had cast early ballots statewide, and Secretary of State Todd Rokita has predicted a record turnout for Election Day on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Perry, 42, of Evansville said he attended the rally on Saturday to show his support for Obama and Biden, especially their message of change on the economic front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his wife, Valerie, already had voted early and he planned to do the same right after the rally &quot;because I think it's going to be chaos at the polls&quot; on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's rally speech in Highland Friday night was his eighth campaign stop in Indiana since mid-July, following 40 stops leading up to the state's May primary. Biden's trip to Evansville was his second solo stop since being named Obama's running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has scheduled an airport rally for Monday in Indianapolis. His last previous stop in the state was on July 1, but that wasn't even an appeal to Indiana voters as he spoke to a national sheriffs convention and then to a private fundraiser in Indianapolis. Palin has made three trips to Indiana since mid-October, drawing big crowds to rallies in Noblesville, Fort Wayne and Jeffersonville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans say they believe McCain and running mate Sarah Palin appeal to the state's long-standing conservative leanings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Rep. Mike Pence, whose district covers much of eastern Indiana, said in an interview that he expected a McCain victory in Indiana because of his record on national defense, as a fiscal conservative and his anti-abortion stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Pence also said he was not surprised that Obama decided to make a major push in Indiana after the state's hotly contested Democratic primary between the Illinois senator and Hillary Rodham Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe he recognized the way a neighbor does that Hoosiers have a much greater bipartisan tradition than generally shows up on the board during Election Night on presidential years,&quot; Pence said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign spent about $6 million on TV commercials in Indiana leading up to the May primary, and has spent at least that much on television ads in the state since June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Television ads on McCain's behalf did not begin in the state until late September and even then he has been heavily outspent. The Obama campaign spent nearly $1.25 million on Indiana advertising during Oct. 21-28, nearly four times the $336,000 spent on McCain ads, according to an analysis by the Wisconsin Advertising Project at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also has had an almost-constant stream of events around the state with prominent politicians and celebrities, such as former &quot;Today&quot; show host Jane Pauley and hip-hop music pioneer Russell Simmons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Democratic Sen. Birch Bayh has made dozens of stops in smaller towns across the state over the past month. The father of current Sen. Evan Bayh typically told his audiences about how he won his first U.S. Senate race in 1962 by an average of two votes per precinct, and urged everyone to find a couple more votes for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the first time since people can remember that their vote really can make a difference,&quot; Bayh said. &quot;This is a chance for Hoosier voters to really make a difference because we don't know how the other electoral votes are going to shake out. I think it's fair to say that if Indiana casts its 11 electors for Barack Obama, he's going to be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oct. 27--John McCain has acknowledged on more than one occasion that the economy is not his strongest issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his self-professed discomfort with the issue that likely northeast Indiana voters overwhelmingly consider the most important has not kept the Republican presidential candidate from building a commanding lead over Democratic opponent Barack Obama, according to a News-Sentinel/News Channel 15 poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With most polls last week showing Obama in the lead -- up by 7.1 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics national average -- McCain's 15-point lead in the 3rd Congressional District surprised party leaders and independent analysts alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It just shows that northeast Indiana is more conservative than I thought, and that voters here will stay with the GOP independent of the issues,&quot; said James Lutz, chairman of the political science department at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I'm a bit surprised voters think McCain would do a better job on the economy, when the national trend is the opposite. Republicans controlled the White House and Congress for six years, but (to voters) the subliminal message is like, 'the Republicans messed it up, but Democrats would mess it up even worse.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifty-three percent of all likely voters in the local poll supported McCain, 38 percent Obama and 3 percent favored other candidates. Even accounting for a margin of error of 4 percentage points and the 6 percent of the voters who remain undecided, McCain would retain a substantial lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're encouraged to see that voters in the 3rd district are voicing their support for John McCain,&quot; said Jennifer Hallowell, McCain's regional campaign manager. &quot;There are fundamental differences between Barack Obama, who wants Hoosiers to put all their faith in government and take more of their money to grow it, and John McCain, who puts his faith in Hoosiers and Americans to decide best how to spend their money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonathan Swain, Indiana communications director for the Obama campaign, said, &quot;We feel confident about our position going into the final days. We've worked hard to put this state in play, and statewide polls show the race in Indiana is a dead heat. Over the next several days, we will continue to work hard to share Barack Obama's plans for helping Hoosiers deal with the tough economic challenges they are facing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those economic challenges make McCain's lead especially noteworthy, because issues normally perceived to be Republican strong points have been deemed relatively unimportant by voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked to name the issue that will most determine their choice of president, respondents named the economy (32 percent), taxes/spending (12 percent) and gas/energy costs (11 percent) -- pocketbook issues that together represent the priorities of 55 percent of voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, moral issues/gay marriage and the war on terror were each named just 10 percent of the time, and immigration 9 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's wide lead in the poll largely evaporated, however, when voters were asked which candidate they trust more to handle the economy, which was marked by sharp market downtowns shortly before the poll was taken. Forty-one percent said they trust McCain more, compared with 39 percent for Obama and 20 percent not sure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversely, 53 percent said they trust McCain more to handle the war in Iraq, compared with 40 percent for Obama and just 7 percent unsure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's funny how the war in Iraq has dropped off the radar,&quot; said Allen County Democratic spokesman Kevin Knuth said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's because of our success in Iraq,&quot; countered Allen County Republican Chairman Steve Shine. &quot;These results are wonderful, and I'm relieved. Not because support for Obama is so deep, but because our market has been bombarded with Obama&nbsp;commercials and visits by him and his wife. But we have to keep moving, because any lead can evaporate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday's visit by vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin was a big step in that direction, Shine added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knuth, former Democratic Party chairman, said he doubts McCain's 15-point lead, in part because of other contradictory polls and in part because &quot;of 12,000 new registrations in Allen County; 9,000 were turned in by the Obama campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll illustrates McCain's advantage over Obama in ways that are more subtle, but no less important to the eventual outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifty-five percent of voters have a favorable opinion of McCain, for example, compared with 42 percent for Obama. Just 38 percent think unfavorably of McCain, compared with 45 percent for Obama -- a figure higher than his &quot;favorable&quot; rating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain is favored by 57 percent of men and 49 percent of women, compared with 38 percent and 37 percent, respectively, for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain does better with independents and members of the opposite party, too, supported by 88 percent of Republicans, 14 percent of Democrats and 53 percent of independents. Obama is supported by 79 percent of fellow Democrats and 36 percent of independents, but just 4 percent of Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Issues are always in flux, and it's not just the economy (earning support for McCain),&quot; Shine said. &quot;You have to look at the whole mettle of the person. Northeast Indiana's moderate-to-conservative beliefs don't waver, even with the greatest media onslaught in history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, the very ads and issues that serve Obama well in many other parts of the country -- his proposals for expensive new federal programs, for example -- may be holding him back in this and other traditionally conservative areas, Lutz said. &quot;Obama saying he wants to 'redistribute the wealth' probably won't be popular in Indiana,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For that reason, Lutz doubts Obama can make up a 15-point deficit in the next week -- if the poll is accurate, that is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shine and Knuth both acknowledge changes in technology complicate polling. Because of increased use of cell phones, for example, younger voters are sometimes underrepresented in samples -- voters who may be more Democratic than the population at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lutz, meanwhile, suspects Obama's status as the first African American to be nominated for president may also be skewing the results in McCain's favor. But the opposite could be true, too: When Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley ran for governor in 1982, he was ahead in many polls but ultimately lost -- a defeat many attributed to the fact that voters were reluctant to tell pollsters they favored another candidate for fear of being called racists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts say this so-called &quot;Bradley Effect&quot; can overestimate support for minority candidates by about 5 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite what this and other polls say between now and Nov. 4, both Shine and Knuth said their parties will work to energize supporters and make sure they get to the polls. &quot;The McCain campaign will ensure that Hoosiers across the state know the stark differences in the candidates' economic philosophies,&quot; Hallowell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knuth, meanwhile, said the fact that Obama had to fight so hard against Hillary Clinton in the Indiana primary equips him to narrow the gap, since it gave him a campaign presence in Indiana that McCain has yet to match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've always said that a poll is just a snapshot,&quot; he said. &quot;Who knows what will happen Election Day?&quot;</SPAN></P>

But the opposite could be true, too: When Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley ran for governor in 1982, he was ahead in many polls but ultimately lost -- a defeat many attributed to the fact that voters were reluctant to tell pollsters they favored another candidate for fear of being called racists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts say this so-called &quot;Bradley Effect&quot; can overestimate support for minority candidates by about 5 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite what this and other polls say between now and Nov. 4, both Shine and Knuth said their parties will work to energize supporters and make sure they get to the polls. &quot;The McCain campaign will ensure that Hoosiers across the state know the stark differences in the candidates' economic philosophies,&quot; Hallowell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knuth, meanwhile, said the fact that Obama had to fight so hard against Hillary Clinton in the Indiana primary equips him to narrow the gap, since it gave him a campaign presence in Indiana that McCain has yet to match.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBUS Ohio</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political allegiances are as divided as football loyalties in the country's heartland, home to deeply depressed economies, middle America values and profound doubts about whether either Barack Obama or John McCain will be able to reverse the worst financial turmoil this country has seen since the Great Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want four more years of Republicans, let alone eight,&quot; said independent Craig Phipps, echoing nearly everyone else decked out in Ohio State University gear during a pre-game tailgate party. All but one in this group agreed when Phipps said: &quot;McCain is no different than President Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the parking lot, under a Purdue University tent, it was McCain who was the favorite by default, it seems. Obama, although a fellow Midwesterner, &quot;doesn't understand our values at all even though Chicago's in the Midwest,&quot; said Tami Lee. She's a Democrat who once backed Obama but later became disenchanted with him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not far out from Election Day, weighing their choices in the midst of an economic crisis, there were still plenty of undecided voters in this swath of tailgaters, many of whom echo the doubts of Shannon Wells: &quot;I'm not convinced that either one of them can change anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is how many distill their choices: Obama, a first-term Democratic senator from liberal Chicago who is 47 years old and would be the country's first black president. McCain, a 72-year-old, four-term Republican senator running to succeed an unpopular president when most people think the country is headed in the wrong direction. Neither one, it seems to these voters, offers much hope for an economic turnaround.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political winds strongly favor Obama, though Republicans and Democrats alike say McCain still has a shot. Most national polls show Obama with a lead of varying degrees but some, including an Associated Press-GfK survey, show the race a dead heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interviews on a recent weekend with more than two dozen people in the economically ailing Midwestern battlegrounds of Ohio and Indiana, which lean more conservative than liberal, showed that the contest still is volatile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters express the same doubts about the candidates as they have all year that Obama is not the right fit, and that McCain represents a continuation of Bush. Those who have settled on a candidate explain their preferences by laying out what they don't like about the other guy. And, those who are undecided say they're turned off by both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anxiety is palpable as many people wonder aloud if anyone knows how to handle the economic crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Castle, Ind., has seen better times. Boarded-up storefronts in this factory-and-farming town attest to that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amber Hall is about to lose her job as a payroll supervisor at a plant that's closing. &quot;We're in real trouble,&quot; she said as she pumped $23.01 in gas. &quot;My concern with either one of the candidates is whether they can do enough to turn it around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She doesn't ascribe to a political party and said she'll probably vote Obama for one reason: &quot;I think we need something different. McCain is along the same lines as Bush.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Down the road, eating at the Bob Evans, the Marckels, who call themselves conservatives and abortion opponents, were siding with McCain. They don't want to risk an Obama presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's untested,&quot; Les Marckel said. Wife Cindy Marckel was turned off by anti-McCain literature from Obama filling her mailbox, and said: &quot;I can't trust somebody like that. That raises serious suspicions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Wilmington, Ohio, &quot;Help Wanted&quot; signs hanging from businesses belie the city's expected job losses when shipping-company DHL closes its local hub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waitress Deanie Pendall, who claims no party affiliation, lamented fewer tips as she plugged quarters into a laundromat washing machine and said she had little faith that anyone could fix &quot;the mess.&quot; Put her down as a likely McCain voter if only because of running mate Sarah Palin and her discomfort with Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's just something about him,&quot; she said of Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know when you see someone for the first time and you just get a feeling?&quot; Pendall said, though quickly added that the issue wasn't his skin color.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat John Dumolt said Obama's race is an issue for some folks in southern Ohio, though not for him: &quot;It's time that the country sees everyone as equal, and I think he can do the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's backing Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, Dumolt, who lost his 13-year job &quot;swinging a hammer&quot; for a homebuilder and now is a truck driver, was uncertain that Obama really could do anything to strengthen the economy nor any president for that matter. Climbing back on his Harley Davidson after fueling up, he said with a shrug: &quot;It's bad everywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's no wonder voters sound so sour about the country and the candidates themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since early September, Wall Street crumbled, stocks fluctuated, government intervened, layoffs rose and money was siphoned from people's retirement accounts. Voters depressed with the direction of the country became even more dispirited. Just 9 percent in a recent Gallup survey said the country was on the right track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Obama and McCain have been working relentlessly to plant negative impressions of one another in voters' minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain has sought to stoke voter unease about Obama, tagging him as the Senate's most liberal member while painting him as an unknown and unacceptable option. He's also raised Obama's links to questionable characters, including 1960s radical William Ayers, a founder of the anti-war Weather Underground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who is Barack Obama?&quot; McCain has asked. Palin's answer: &quot;This is not a man who sees America like you and I see America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democrat is countering with an ad that bespeaks Americana. It shows pictures of him with his white mother and grandparents, and talks of the values that shaped his life. &quot;Hard work, honesty, self-reliance, respect for other people, kindness, faith. That's the country I believe in,&quot; Obama says in the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama continues to cast McCain as no different from Bush. The argument has resonated even more since the economic crisis put the president's policies back in the spotlight. &quot;We just can't afford more of the same,&quot; Obama's ads say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also has repeatedly asserted that McCain has been unsteady in his response to the crisis, saying: &quot;I don't think we can afford that kind of erratic and uncertain leadership in these uncertain times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's rejoinder: &quot;I am not George Bush.&quot; He's also now running an ad that says: &quot;The last eight years haven't worked very well, have they? I'll make the next four better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Listening to tailgaters at the Ohio State-Purdue game was like watching each candidate's TV commercials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Herderick family's spot amid chicken sizzling on the grill, beer chilling in coolers and a sea of Buckeye scarlet and gray all but one person backed Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is clearly a Midwesterner with Midwestern values. And McCain has shown himself to be erratic,&quot; said Ed Herderick, 25, a graduate student and a Democrat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tim Herderick, 50, a flight attendant and an independent, lamented his thinning pension and said: &quot;We had eight years of Republicans and look what they got us into.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lifelong Republican, Katie Herderick, the family matriarch at 78, explained why she's breaking with her party: &quot;I just don't like McCain&quot; and Palin wouldn't be a good president if needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political sentiments as well as team allegiances were just the opposite in a nearby tent, where most people talked of supporting McCain as they snacked on deviled eggs, bags of chips and a vegetable tray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's more about Republican Party values than McCain himself,&quot; said Republican Mark Iiames, 31, decked out in Purdue blue and gold. Of Obama, he said: &quot;I don't know that I've heard or seen enough of him to say whether he's truly in touch with Midwestern values.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee, a 40-year-old teacher, voted for Obama during the primary but came to believe he couldn't relate to heartland voters when he said that Pennsylvania voters frustrated with the economy &quot;cling&quot; to guns and religion. Now, she said: &quot;I'm really voting for Palin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the crew, only independent Marie Budd, a 31-year-old teacher, said she was willing to choose Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why not?&quot; she said. &quot;I'm ready for a change. I'm ready for a new path.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding a Tribune article on Sept. 11 about young people dressing down in church: It's always bothered me to see the church denigrated like this. Girls go around in mini-skirts, shorts and flip-flops. Why wear revealing clothing? Can't they leave the &quot;lust after me, boys&quot; routine behind for a couple of hours? Can't they show some class and dignity and dress like a lady for a change? The boys are just as bad. I saw one come in wearing a T-shirt, shorts, tennis shoes with no socks, and of course, the symbol of rocket scientists everywhere, the baseball cap backward. The whole purpose of going to church is to worship God. How can you worship God when you don't even think enough of him to dress decently? You dress decently to show respect. And if you can't respect him, why even bother showing up? Do you dress like a bum to attend a funeral or wedding? No, because you want to be respectful to the person. How is it then that these people are more deserving of respect than Jesus Christ? Who or what deserves more respect? </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chilling </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in Pakistan, as was her father before her. She was a member of the opposition group trying to lead the country to democracy when she was gunned down. I was reminded of that tragedy when I heard the crowds at Sarah Palin's rally shouting &quot;Kill him&quot; referring to Barack Obama. It sent a chill up my spine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What are we becoming as a nation if we would kill those who disagree with us? Isn't that how terrorists operate? Isn't that how dictators rule? Assassinating a candidate would destroy the very fabric of our democracy. We need to cool the rhetoric and remember that smearing and demonizing candidates leads to political violence.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way it is </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Move over, &quot;Joe the Plumber,&quot; here's a real perspective from a small businessman, with 15-plus years as president of a well-run small business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In about 2000, we found new strange competitors: American companies taking manufacturing plants out of the United States, overseas computer programmers and health insurance cost rising so fast that we had to drop company coverage for individuals. I'm all for competition, but we are fighting an uphill battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lost manufacturing jobs and plants reduce our opportunities to sell, the increased number of visas for foreign programmers decreases opportunities for our citizens, and continual rising business costs erode our nest eggs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the Bush administration, small businesses have been crippled by extremely unfavorable business policies. I have heard nothing but George Bush policies from John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, &quot;Joe the Plumber,&quot; here's my advice: Vote Obama-Biden and receive tax breaks on your wages and your business net profits. You and your employees also can benefit from the Obama-Biden health insurance plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When American companies are motivated to build plants here in the USA, both &quot;Joe&quot; and I will benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Joe&quot; won't get much if any break from McCain. Been there, seen that for the last eight years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Change </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days before the election, as you change the time on your clocks, remember why you have to do it. Gov. Mitch Daniels said it would bring jobs to Indiana. I just read that Indiana lost more than 64,000 jobs since last year. Unemployment is above the national average.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Take a drive across what used to be our Indiana Toll Road. When you exit, be prepared to pay double if you want to use American currency instead of giving your personal banking information to the foreign operators to establish an IPASS account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Daniels raves about not increasing taxes. How quickly he forgot the 44-cent increase in the tobacco tax, the 16 percent increase in sales tax and the property tax increases. My property taxes increased in both 2007 and 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Daniels told me that Indiana's cost for school construction at $148 per square foot is one of the highest in the nation and he was going to do something about it. I guess he forgot to tell Cheryl Musgrave, his commissioner of the Department of Local Government Finance. She approved an unnecessary intermediate school building project at a cost of $192 per square foot for Union North United School District.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are some of the reasons I will not vote for Daniels. It's time for change.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal hate </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watching and reading articles over the past several months, I have come to the conclusion that the liberal left is just filled with hate. The majority of letters to the Voice are filled with so much hatred toward the Republicans. Hate mail is being sent to homes that dare display a McCain poster. These are the same people who four years ago said they would move to Canada if Bush was re-elected. I see they are still here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Republicans would never say they are going to move to Canada. That's because Republicans have a love and pride for this country; we would rather stay and fight than run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barack Obama may very well win this election. God help us all. The socialist Marxists will take over this country with their far-left liberal agenda; he's already admitted that he wants to spread the wealth around. Taxes will go through the roof and the economic downturn will be the worst ever. More of your paycheck will go to those who don't work and help pay their medical bills as you pay more for yours. You think things are bad now? Wait until Obama ruins the country.</SPAN></P>

This would be, to the women of the USA, their finest hour.&quot; Unfortunately, I believe he spoke with sincerity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His comments are an insult to women. The fact that he believes women would, and should, vote for a candidate simply because of gender insults my intelligence as an individual and as a woman. John McCain lost my respect when he apparently also thought women would vote simply on gender lines and nominated an unqualified woman as his vice presidential running mate, a position a heartbeat away from the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women's finest hour will be when a woman runs for high office and both men and women voters look beyond the candidate's gender to the candidate's qualifications to hold that office when casting their vote. That will be our finest hour.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a Catholic myself, it was ironic that on the day that I read the Sept. 23 letter in Voice, I was listening to EWTN, the Catholic radio network. One caller asked: If the two presidential candidates have opposing views on abortion, what should a Catholic do? The entire Catholic panel responded emphatically that a Catholic cannot under any circumstances vote for the pro-abortion candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our &quot;committed&quot; Catholics wrote that they had other concerns besides abortion. However, they failed to mention one vital concern: Barack Obama's relationship with Tony Rezko, convicted for corruption, with unrepentant Weather Underground activist Bill Ayers and with Obama's mentor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright who damned America and honored Louis Farrakhan (the biggest anti-Semite).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, during the Democratic National Convention Archbishop Charles Chaput of Denver, the well-respected theologian and an authority on Catholic doctrine, severely chastised both &quot;Catholic&quot; Sen.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If we think the only option for a daughter pregnant at 17 is to marry her off before she even gets to college, we will vote for John McCain. (Sarah Palin opposed and vetoed funding for pregnant teens, according to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Shultz, D-Calif., interviewed by Larry King.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I believe that Americans are smarter than to fall for a ploy in which the GOP coerced McCain to select a conservative woman to be his running mate in order to get the right wing and Hillary Clinton votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let us as working stay-at-home moms, career working women surviving on minimum wages, retired and elderly women, women on Medicare or Medicaid, do the right thing and vote smart ? for Barack Obama. Why? Because we're worth it!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This Election Day, voters can choose from 11 other presidential candidates, including Green Party candidate Cynthia McKinney. Someone suggested a vote for McKinney is tantamount to a de facto vote for an undesirable candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For me, a vote for anyone other than McKinney is a vote against my conscience. McKinney's stance on universal health care and her brave congressional record on women's, voters' and human rights, environmental issues and her vote against the war in Iraq aligns squarely with my values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McKinney is a write-in candidate on Indiana's ballot. In the last two elections, the St. Joseph County Election Board failed to count all write-in votes for legitimate candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year, the League of Women Voters as well as write-in candidates and their parties will be watching the results carefully. At the end of Election Day, it doesn't matter who you vote for if the vote-counters don't think you count.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Palin insists that lack of revenue is not a problem for the federal government. Yet the red ink in George Bush's budgets has skyrocketed during his eight years in office and our national debt has jumped from $5.7 trillion to more than $10 trillion. John McCain should be asked if he agrees with her and, if not, how he justifies choosing someone with such outlandish opinions to be his running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When questioned about which newspapers or periodicals she regularly reads, Palin was unable to name even one.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reasons to vote no include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1) Conflict of interest between the Board of Public Works which would prepare the rate increases and also oversee the South Bend Water Works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2) There would be no independent entity to provide oversight of the city for unsupported rate increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3) There would be no advocate on behalf of residents for burdensome rate hikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4) With no oversight, the Board of Public Works is operated entirely by politicians. Whose interests will be represented?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Nov. 4, be sure to turn to the back side of the ballot and vote no to the question asking the municipally owned utility be taken out of the jurisdiction of the IURC.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These council members purposefully denied citizens who had patiently sat through three hours of council business their right to speak on a bill establishing tax abatement criteria. This bill had been before the council since Sept. 3 - giving plenty of time for consideration and study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What constructive end was this obviously-orchestrated act meant to achieve? If our elected officials leave meetings every time they do not agree with an ordinance, then what are we left with? Certainly not democracy. The walkout denied residents a public hearing, and prevented the remaining five council members and the public from engaging in the democratic process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It took them a long time to get started. I didn't know what was taking so long, but I soon learned what the holdup was. There really was a long agenda.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Suddenly, there was a request for another five-minute break. Those who left were Dale DeVon, R-District C, Mark Root, R-District I and Dennis Schafer, R-District F. Then I heard someone say that it takes six members of the council to be present in order to have a quorum. Then it suddenly occurred to me what all these breaks were for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those men never came back! They should have stayed and voted no. It showed a lack of character to leave people without a vote.

These words can have the same psychological effect as &quot;for the students.&quot; A person who is pro-choice is not pro-abortion, as McCain repeated over and over the other night. In the same way that Prohibition did not stop people from drinking alcohol, making abortions illegal will not stop women and children from having abortions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1) The decision to raise taxes on hardworking productive citizens of St. Joseph County has already been made by the County Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2) Unless control of the County Council changes in November, shortly after the fall elections, hardworking productive citizens of St. Joseph County will see an increase in the COIT (county option income tax), CEDIT (county economic development income tax), and /or the implementation of the new LOIT (local option income tax), confusing letters which just mean the politicians in charge in this county will continue to tax and tax and tax).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3) The new taxes will be imposed right away, not in a year or two as the codified version of the Circuit Breaker suggests, due to a sneaky non-code provision that permits the local taxing units to wait until right after an election to raise taxes rather than doing so prior to the election in the summer as is otherwise the case.

They grumble about the crooks in Indianapolis and Washington, but by not voting they allow them to keep coming back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is time to send a message. The best way to do it is to send all the incumbents packing, and make them get real jobs and see what a mess our country is in. We hear about working across the aisle until they are elected but they soon forget it. Let's forget the two-party system and work on what will be good for the country. The best way out of this mess is to get out and vote! Reclaim our government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider Jesus' pro-life stance. He fed the hungry, healed the sick, respected children and offered love and forgiveness to individuals rejected by society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To eliminate abortion, we must eliminate the desperate circumstances which force women to consider it. The U.S. abortion rate is four times that of Belgium and Holland, countries with strong social safety nets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John McCain has suddenly co-opted the term &quot;pro-life&quot; after spending eight years supporting an administration which refused to help 9 million U.S. children without health care, the same administration which controlled Congress, enjoyed a sympathetic Supreme Court and refused to challenge abortion laws it still claims to hate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain's current tax plan only promises more breaks for the wealthy. What has he promised the poor?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barack Obama's health care plan provides coverage for every American (without raising middle-class taxes), including 800,000 Hoosiers without health insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I believe my vote for Obama will obey Jesus' words, stated in Matthew 25: &quot;I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink ... just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Oct. 14, more than 50 people showed up to be heard on the Responsible Tax Abatement Ordinance. This ordinance was to be heard by the St. Joseph County Council as the last item of business on the agenda. The people in the audience waited to be heard for more than three hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unfortunately, three members of the council chose to disregard democracy and walk out. This left the remaining members of the council unable to conduct further business because they did not have a quorum, as one of the council members was attending his brother's wedding out of town. This left more than 50 members of the public out in the cold so to speak and having wasted three hours of their time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three members who left are usually very responsive to the public and diligent in their civil responsibilities. I can only hope that this is a one-time occurrence. In general, we all work well together on the council and I hope we will do so in the future. I apologize to the members of the public who waited and hope they will return when the public hearing on the abatement ordinance is heard in the near future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to recommend a friend of mine to the voters of St. Joseph County. I met this man a few years ago when he was the chairman of the economic development committee of the City Plan of South Bend. He has spent many years actively involved in the Northeast Neighborhood Association. He is a small business owner who understands what it takes to bring new businesses to our community. He will bring new ideas to county government and provide the leadership necessary to fix the financial mess we are currently in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is intelligent, experienced and committed to making South Bend and St. Joseph County a better place to raise our children and grandchildren. His name is Wayne Curry, and he is running for county council representative of District G.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many in our community have a tendency to dismiss quality candidates because of their party affiliation. With all of the financial problems this community and our nation are having, it is time to take a good look at every candidate. The old ways of doing business are not working. We need new leadership in our community. Curry is the kind of leadership we need.</SPAN></P>

Thomas loves to meet and greet people and learn more of people's needs. Thomas delivers food to the needy from the food pantry of St. Vincent DePaul. He is very helpful to the poor and needy. I've seen the dedication he has for those in need. Currently, Thomas is a local accountant. He graduated from Bethel College. An accountant is needed to work on the budget and tax problems.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding a Tribune article on Sept. 11 about young people dressing down in church: It's always bothered me to see the church denigrated like this. Girls go around in mini-skirts, shorts and flip-flops. Why wear revealing clothing? Can't they leave the &quot;lust after me, boys&quot; routine behind for a couple of hours? Can't they show some class and dignity and dress like a lady for a change? The boys are just as bad. I saw one come in wearing a T-shirt, shorts, tennis shoes with no socks, and of course, the symbol of rocket scientists everywhere, the baseball cap backward. The whole purpose of going to church is to worship God. How can you worship God when you don't even think enough of him to dress decently? You dress decently to show respect. And if you can't respect him, why even bother showing up? Do you dress like a bum to attend a funeral or wedding? No, because you want to be respectful to the person. How is it then that these people are more deserving of respect than Jesus Christ? Who or what deserves more respect? </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in Pakistan, as was her father before her. She was a member of the opposition group trying to lead the country to democracy when she was gunned down. I was reminded of that tragedy when I heard the crowds at Sarah Palin's rally shouting &quot;Kill him&quot; referring to Barack Obama. It sent a chill up my spine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What are we becoming as a nation if we would kill those who disagree with us? Isn't that how terrorists operate? Isn't that how dictators rule? Assassinating a candidate would destroy the very fabric of our democracy. We need to cool the rhetoric and remember that smearing and demonizing candidates leads to political violence. That isn't the way it is done in a democracy. That isn't the way it is done in America.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way it is </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Move over, &quot;Joe the Plumber,&quot; here's a real perspective from a small businessman, with 15-plus years as president of a well-run small business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In about 2000, we found new strange competitors: American companies taking manufacturing plants out of the United States, overseas computer programmers and health insurance cost rising so fast that we had to drop company coverage for individuals. I'm all for competition, but we are fighting an uphill battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lost manufacturing jobs and plants reduce our opportunities to sell, the increased number of visas for foreign programmers decreases opportunities for our citizens, and continual rising business costs erode our nest eggs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the Bush administration, small businesses have been crippled by extremely unfavorable business policies. I have heard nothing but George Bush policies from John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, &quot;Joe the Plumber,&quot; here's my advice: Vote Obama-Biden and receive tax breaks on your wages and your business net profits. You and your employees also can benefit from the Obama-Biden health insurance plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When American companies are motivated to build plants here in the USA, both &quot;Joe&quot; and I will benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Joe&quot; won't get much if any break from McCain. Been there, seen that for the last eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Charles Gaby </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Bend </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Change </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days before the election, as you change the time on your clocks, remember why you have to do it. Gov. Mitch Daniels said it would bring jobs to Indiana. I just read that Indiana lost more than 64,000 jobs since last year. Unemployment is above the national average.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Take a drive across what used to be our Indiana Toll Road. When you exit, be prepared to pay double if you want to use American currency instead of giving your personal banking information to the foreign operators to establish an IPASS account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Daniels raves about not increasing taxes. How quickly he forgot the 44-cent increase in the tobacco tax, the 16 percent increase in sales tax and the property tax increases. My property taxes increased in both 2007 and 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Daniels told me that Indiana's cost for school construction at $148 per square foot is one of the highest in the nation and he was going to do something about it. I guess he forgot to tell Cheryl Musgrave, his commissioner of the Department of Local Government Finance. She approved an unnecessary intermediate school building project at a cost of $192 per square foot for Union North United School District.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are some of the reasons I will not vote for Daniels. It's time for change.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plymouth </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal hate </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watching and reading articles over the past several months, I have come to the conclusion that the liberal left is just filled with hate. The majority of letters to the Voice are filled with so much hatred toward the Republicans. Hate mail is being sent to homes that dare display a McCain poster. These are the same people who four years ago said they would move to Canada if Bush was re-elected. I see they are still here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Republicans would never say they are going to move to Canada. That's because Republicans have a love and pride for this country; we would rather stay and fight than run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barack Obama may very well win this election. God help us all. The socialist Marxists will take over this country with their far-left liberal agenda; he's already admitted that he wants to spread the wealth around. Taxes will go through the roof and the economic downturn will be the worst ever. More of your paycheck will go to those who don't work and help pay their medical bills as you pay more for yours. You think things are bad now? Wait until Obama ruins the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Odd, but refreshing, to hear no racial ranting and other claptrap from Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson about the coming election. Gagged and bound for Barack Obama's benefit by the Democratic National Committee perhaps?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dave De Fauw Mishawaka Who pays? Barack Obama promised us tax cuts and affordable health care and said he will get the money from the fat cats of the big companies, which means we will pay. They will just add it to their product and we will pay more for what we need. He has promised too much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joe Biden said President Franklin Roosevelt went on television and talked to the people about the Depression. The Depression began in 1929. Herbert Hoover was president and we had radio, not television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If he doesn't know our own history he should not be vice president.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who pays?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Years ago, before I retired, I had a talk with my supervisor about tax. He asked me if I had any idea how much tax the company paid. I told him, &quot;Yes, I know, they pay nothing.&quot; I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">went ahead and told him that they simply added it to the cost of their product and the little guy paid it for them. He knew I was right and he walked away.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finest hour </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please tell me Ed Balla's tongue was firmly planted in his cheek when he wrote &quot;every woman should realize that this occasion is their golden hour of opportunity to act united and support Sarah Palin with their vote. This would be, to the women of the USA, their finest hour.&quot; Unfortunately, I believe he spoke with sincerity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His comments are an insult to women. The fact that he believes women would, and should, vote for a candidate simply because of gender insults my intelligence as an individual and as a woman. John McCain lost my respect when he apparently also thought women would vote simply on gender lines and nominated an unqualified woman as his vice presidential running mate, a position a heartbeat away from the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women's finest hour will be when a woman runs for high office and both men and women voters look beyond the candidate's gender to the candidate's qualifications to hold that office when casting their vote. That will be our finest hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Susan K. Parkman </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Granger </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Catholic </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an independent voter, I feel that a national leader should personify the characteristics of integrity, sincerity, trust and, above all, love and concern for his country and its people. After scrutinizing both candidates, I strongly feel that Sen. John McCain fits the criterion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a Catholic myself, it was ironic that on the day that I read the Sept. 23 letter in Voice, I was listening to EWTN, the Catholic radio network. One caller asked: If the two presidential candidates have opposing views on abortion, what should a Catholic do? The entire Catholic panel responded emphatically that a Catholic cannot under any circumstances vote for the pro-abortion candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our &quot;committed&quot; Catholics wrote that they had other concerns besides abortion. However, they failed to mention one vital concern: Barack Obama's relationship with Tony Rezko, convicted for corruption, with unrepentant Weather Underground activist Bill Ayers and with Obama's mentor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright who damned America and honored Louis Farrakhan (the biggest anti-Semite).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, during the Democratic National Convention Archbishop Charles Chaput of Denver, the well-respected theologian and an authority on Catholic doctrine, severely chastised both &quot;Catholic&quot; Sen. Joe Biden and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi for their views on abortion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Be careful </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters beware - be very careful who you choose to lead. Remember, the United States fought to get out from under Great Britain's terrible tax system long ago. Barack Obama will surely bring it back if you let him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I, for one, would rather trust our future to a wise and tested American hero rather than a silver-tongued, ambitious but inexperienced politician who promises you much that he can never deliver in exchange for your precious vote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mishawaka </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worth more </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women supporters of Hillary Clinton, like me, realize that Sarah Palin is not Hillary Clinton. Voters like me will not ignore that half a million women lost jobs during the Bush regime, as Kiki McLean, former Clinton adviser stated on &quot;Larry King Live.&quot; Voters like me do not believe that government has a right to decide whether we should mother a child conceived out of incest or rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If we think the only option for a daughter pregnant at 17 is to marry her off before she even gets to college, we will vote for John McCain. (Sarah Palin opposed and vetoed funding for pregnant teens, according to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Shultz, D-Calif., interviewed by Larry King.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I believe that Americans are smarter than to fall for a ploy in which the GOP coerced McCain to select a conservative woman to be his running mate in order to get the right wing and Hillary Clinton votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let us as working stay-at-home moms, career working women surviving on minimum wages, retired and elderly women, women on Medicare or Medicaid, do the right thing and vote smart ? for Barack Obama. Why? Because we're worth it!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Watching corporate-sponsored pseudo debates is like enduring an extended commercial for which cola company has the fanciest packaging for its high-fructose corn syrup. You know neither of them has the healthiest recipe for the common good, yet if you relied only on corporate-owned media, you'd believe these were your only choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This Election Day, voters can choose from 11 other presidential candidates, including Green Party candidate Cynthia McKinney. Someone suggested a vote for McKinney is tantamount to a de facto vote for an undesirable candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For me, a vote for anyone other than McKinney is a vote against my conscience. McKinney's stance on universal health care and her brave congressional record on women's, voters' and human rights, environmental issues and her vote against the war in Iraq aligns squarely with my values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McKinney is a write-in candidate on Indiana's ballot. In the last two elections, the St. Joseph County Election Board failed to count all write-in votes for legitimate candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year, the League of Women Voters as well as write-in candidates and their parties will be watching the results carefully. At the end of Election Day, it doesn't matter who you vote for if the vote-counters don't think you count.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin choice </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are we to think when Sarah Palin claims experience in foreign policy simply because she is governor of a state which borders Russia? Or when she claims expertise in energy but mistakenly believes that federal regulations severely restrict the sale of Alaskan oil abroad?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Palin insists that lack of revenue is not a problem for the federal government. Yet the red ink in George Bush's budgets has skyrocketed during his eight years in office and our national debt has jumped from $5.7 trillion to more than $10 trillion. John McCain should be asked if he agrees with her and, if not, how he justifies choosing someone with such outlandish opinions to be his running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When questioned about which newspapers or periodicals she regularly reads, Palin was unable to name even one. It is painfully obvious that she does not know enough to be next in line to become president nor has she shown enough curiosity or intellect ever to be entrusted with the job.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I urge you to vote no to the public question regarding whether the South Bend Water Works should be taken out of the jurisdiction of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IURC is a fact-finding entity with the purpose of balancing the interests of both the public utility customers and the utility provider. The IURC hears evidence and makes decisions to ensure the utilities provide adequate and reliable services at reasonable prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reasons to vote no include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1) Conflict of interest between the Board of Public Works which would prepare the rate increases and also oversee the South Bend Water Works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2) There would be no independent entity to provide oversight of the city for unsupported rate increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3) There would be no advocate on behalf of residents for burdensome rate hikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4) With no oversight, the Board of Public Works is operated entirely by politicians. Whose interests will be represented?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Nov. 4, be sure to turn to the back side of the ballot and vote no to the question asking the municipally owned utility be taken out of the jurisdiction of the IURC.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For St. Joseph County Council members Dale Devon, R-District C; Dennis Schafer, R-District F; and Mark Root, R-District I, to call a recess, depart and not return to council chambers, forcing the cancellation of remaining business on the Oct. 14 agenda, was an irresponsible and reprehensible act that mocks our democratic process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These council members purposefully denied citizens who had patiently sat through three hours of council business their right to speak on a bill establishing tax abatement criteria. This bill had been before the council since Sept. 3 - giving plenty of time for consideration and study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What constructive end was this obviously-orchestrated act meant to achieve? If our elected officials leave meetings every time they do not agree with an ordinance, then what are we left with? Certainly not democracy. The walkout denied residents a public hearing, and prevented the remaining five council members and the public from engaging in the democratic process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> St. Joseph County does not need spoiled brats as elected county officials. There must be others who would take the job of representing citizens more responsibly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It took them a long time to get started. I didn't know what was taking so long, but I soon learned what the holdup was. There really was a long agenda. There was a request for a five-minute break about three-fourths through the meeting. Bill 90-08 was last on the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Suddenly, there was a request for another five-minute break. Those who left were Dale DeVon, R-District C, Mark Root, R-District I and Dennis Schafer, R-District F. Then I heard someone say that it takes six members of the council to be present in order to have a quorum. Then it suddenly occurred to me what all these breaks were for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those men never came back! They should have stayed and voted no. It showed a lack of character to leave people without a vote. I don't consider that playing politics; that just shows no character. Maybe they had the count of who was and wasn't going to vote &quot;yea&quot; and &quot;nay&quot; on the issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pro-choice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have some friends in the Middlebury School district who took issue with the excessive spending on the new Northridge High School. Their opponents called themselves &quot;for the students,&quot; and now the new high school is being built with a second Olympic-size swimming pool, a heated driveway and all of the other things that most of us would consider excessive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And now I'm running into people who are voting for John McCain simply because he is pro-life. These words can have the same psychological effect as &quot;for the students.&quot; A person who is pro-choice is not pro-abortion, as McCain repeated over and over the other night. In the same way that Prohibition did not stop people from drinking alcohol, making abortions illegal will not stop women and children from having abortions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It takes a broad-minded humanitarian to be pro-choice. It takes a very narrow-minded individual to vote for someone strictly on one issue while the entire world falls apart all around us.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barrels of oil </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One million barrels of oil. That's the cost of Eastern Daylight Time. A University of California-Santa Barbara study found that Eastern Daylight Time in Indiana used up to $8.6 million or 4 percent more in electricity than Indiana used before it observed Eastern Daylight Time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What effect would saving a million barrels of oil a summer have on oil and gasoline prices? A significant effect? And the easiest part about it is that it's simple: Either don't change our clocks or move to the Central time zone (our natural geographic zone, and not our politically manipulated zone).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Property tax reform is a joke. Put a cap on rates at 1 percent, 2 percent and 3 percent of assessed value. Keep raising the assessed value and the cap is meaningless. Let's be bold and cap the assessed value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Gov. Mitch Daniels is following the play book of his mentor George W. Bush, he made his unpopular moves early in his term, tempered his actions in the second half, and will revert to early-term form as soon as he's re-elected. Do you want four more years of Bush in Indiana? The choice is yours.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Predictions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1) The decision to raise taxes on hardworking productive citizens of St. Joseph County has already been made by the County Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2) Unless control of the County Council changes in November, shortly after the fall elections, hardworking productive citizens of St. Joseph County will see an increase in the COIT (county option income tax), CEDIT (county economic development income tax), and /or the implementation of the new LOIT (local option income tax), confusing letters which just mean the politicians in charge in this county will continue to tax and tax and tax).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3) The new taxes will be imposed right away, not in a year or two as the codified version of the Circuit Breaker suggests, due to a sneaky non-code provision that permits the local taxing units to wait until right after an election to raise taxes rather than doing so prior to the election in the summer as is otherwise the case. Why? Obviously, so voters don't realize that they have been hoodwinked until after they elect or re-elect those who have the power to tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sure do wish I wasn't so good at predicting the future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We need a clean energy economy fueled by green jobs. We have seen what happens when the oil and coal industries spend millions lobbying the politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice President Dick Cheney invited the oil companies in behind closed doors to write our last energy bill. It is essential we elect intelligent politicians who have the interests of the middle class in mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We see what has happened in the last eight years when the polluters are invited in to write the &quot;clean&quot; energy and &quot;clean&quot; air laws. America, as well as the rest of the world, cannot survive another four years of such arrogance that assumes Wall Street and business corporations serve the interests of middle-income Americans. We know whose interest their greed serves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is evident that the United States cannot survive more of the same. It is time for bold leadership which supports the interest of middle-class America rather than Wall Street and corporate America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our economy can be revitalized with good jobs, clean renewable energy and a healthy climate. To do otherwise courts disaster.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am honored to share the personal insight I have about South Bend Community School Corp. Board of Trustees candidate Kyle Chamberlin. I have known Kyle since he was an energetic middle school student and I was an assistant principal. Upon learning that Kyle was running for school board, I jumped at the chance to speak on his behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As superintendent of Logansport Community Schools, I know well the importance of a cohesive, effective and vision- focused school board. We can all take comfort in knowing that someone of Kyle's character is willing to dedicate the time and energy needed to ensure all students receive nothing less than the best education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kyle will provide a much needed fresh voice and new insight to help move the schools forward. My husband is a South Bend police officer. Three of his children attended Riley High School; we know the importance of good education, education that begins with a shared vision among educators, administrators, superintendent, school board and the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kyle comes from a family of dedicated educators, and Kyle exemplifies the importance of living the philosophy of what it takes to work toward a shared vision for children.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am supporting Carol Higgins for District 59 Michigan State Representative because she supports universal health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am a 59-year-old single woman with a disability. I have been working part time for a company that mainly hires part-time workers because it cannot afford the cost of health insurance for all employees. Private health insurance would cost $200 to $300 a month and is completely unaffordable for me. There doesn't seem to be any public assistance for a person in my situation. I need to apply for disability, but first, I need to see a doctor which I can't afford because I don't have insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a desperate need for people like me to get regular medical care. Carol Higgins will work to make this happen. Please vote for her Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transforming </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nov. 4 will become one of the most significant elections in our lifetimes. We will have the opportunity to transform our country and set a new direction for government that is responsive to the needs and wishes of the American people as envisioned by our Founders when they established this republic. We have seen both state and federal governments ignore our wishes whether it was leasing of our Toll Road or de-regulating our industries so they could place profit before principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Daniels managed to &quot;sell&quot; our Toll Road to a foreign corporation and suggest in so doing that Americans can't run our own infrastructure. Our unemployment rate increased from 4.5 percent to 6.4 percent in 12 months (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2008).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John McCain, similar to Mitch Daniels, ignores the concerns of the people. He needs to address his complicity in the massive deregulation of the financial services industry during his years in Congress and the resulting financial industry debacle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We can change the direction as well as the political tone of our county and society by prudently voting for positive change on Nov. 4. Vote for Barack Obama for president and for Jill Long Thompson for governor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A message </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone is playing the blame game for our economic problems. The truth is, it is the fault of all Americans for allowing it to happen. For years our country has been governed by about 20 percent of the people while the others sit on the sidelines, not bothering to vote or take part in any way. They grumble about the crooks in Indianapolis and Washington, but by not voting they allow them to keep coming back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is time to send a message. The best way to do it is to send all the incumbents packing, and make them get real jobs and see what a mess our country is in. We hear about working across the aisle until they are elected but they soon forget it. Let's forget the two-party system and work on what will be good for the country. The best way out of this mess is to get out and vote! Reclaim our government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider Jesus' pro-life stance. He fed the hungry, healed the sick, respected children and offered love and forgiveness to individuals rejected by society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To eliminate abortion, we must eliminate the desperate circumstances which force women to consider it. The U.S. abortion rate is four times that of Belgium and Holland, countries with strong social safety nets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John McCain has suddenly co-opted the term &quot;pro-life&quot; after spending eight years supporting an administration which refused to help 9 million U.S. children without health care, the same administration which controlled Congress, enjoyed a sympathetic Supreme Court and refused to challenge abortion laws it still claims to hate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain's current tax plan only promises more breaks for the wealthy. What has he promised the poor?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barack Obama's health care plan provides coverage for every American (without raising middle-class taxes), including 800,000 Hoosiers without health insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I believe my vote for Obama will obey Jesus' words, stated in Matthew 25: &quot;I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink ... just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walkout </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Oct. 14, more than 50 people showed up to be heard on the Responsible Tax Abatement Ordinance. This ordinance was to be heard by the St. Joseph County Council as the last item of business on the agenda. The people in the audience waited to be heard for more than three hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unfortunately, three members of the council chose to disregard democracy and walk out. This left the remaining members of the council unable to conduct further business because they did not have a quorum, as one of the council members was attending his brother's wedding out of town. This left more than 50 members of the public out in the cold so to speak and having wasted three hours of their time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three members who left are usually very responsive to the public and diligent in their civil responsibilities. I can only hope that this is a one-time occurrence. In general, we all work well together on the council and I hope we will do so in the future. I apologize to the members of the public who waited and hope they will return when the public hearing on the abatement ordinance is heard in the near future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to recommend a friend of mine to the voters of St. Joseph County. I met this man a few years ago when he was the chairman of the economic development committee of the City Plan of South Bend.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is intelligent, experienced and committed to making South Bend and St. Joseph County a better place to raise our children and grandchildren. His name is Wayne Curry, and he is running for county council representative of District G.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many in our community have a tendency to dismiss quality candidates because of their party affiliation.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've been reading opinions of Gov. Sarah Palin's performance on the campaign trail and, most specifically, the vice presidential debate. It seems there are some in every crowd who mention her accent as an actual factor in their decision-making. I am a truck driver by trade, having spent much too much time on the road. I've been through this great country far and wide. One of the more endearing charactistics of its people is the variety of dialects and accents. You know when you're talking to someone from Tennessee, Minnesota, New York, Maine or Montana. I've always taken a delight in this distinction of American culture. I know I'm talking to a fool when they judge not what you say but the way you say it. As if an accent or dialect disqualifies someone from good sense. Even if the opinion is similar, somehow it doesn't sound quite right to them. We are a nation of individuals homogenized in the concept of freedom and democracy, the standard of hard work and paying your own way. Those who think someone is disqualified by mannerisms and accents are a homogenious group with a distinct pitch that is punched, puckered and petty. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of us? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seriously? I mean, really? Sarah Palin? Is she the best candidate to run with John McCain? This person can't even protect her own e-mail account and we're going to trust her with national security? During her debate with Joe Biden, she used such words as &quot;y'all&quot; and &quot;darn right.&quot; Many of The Tribune's pundits described her as &quot;down to earth,&quot; you know, one of us common folk. Seriously? Really? Have you watched a reality show? These people are often referred to as &quot;one of us.&quot; Have we been politically dumbed down the last eight years of lowering our standards to the point that we ask, &quot;Is this is someone I'd like to have a beer with?&quot; I mean, it's only potentially the highest office in the land. Why strive for excellence? Wake up, people. The politicians we vote for will have a direct effect on our lives. Using Palin's philosophy, I can see Elkhart from my back porch, that would make me a good candidate for mayor. Then governor. Heck, in eight years I could be on the national ticket. Vote for me. Yee haw! Kevin Fyffe </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For children </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I support Don Wheeler, at-large candidate for the South Bend Community School Corp. Board of Trustees. Wheeler has proposed an initiative that would reward outstanding teachers who are willing to take on more challenging positions as needed to improve our schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his &quot;Teach For South Bend&quot; proposal, Wheeler suggests that we approach the business community to help establish and administer a fund which would offer incentives to talented teachers willing to take on more challenging assignments. Another key element of the program would be to establish a robust mentoring program for those teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Programs like this have failed elsewhere because they lacked the mentoring component.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I agree with Wheeler that it's time to start taking strong action towards positive results. Our children and our community deserve no less.</SPAN></P>

It's not a tax refund! It's called wealth redistribution!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Challenges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here are some of the challenges we know the United States will face in the next four years:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Helping the working poor regain dignity and security; helping the middle class stop slipping into bankruptcy and poverty; overseeing the banking and investment systems that have recently crumbled; rebuilding our bridges, roads and other infrastructure; figuring out how to prevent health care costs from destroying individual and collective well-being; getting schools to focus on educating (not punishing or warehousing) children from the poorest as well as the wealthiest backgrounds; transforming our entire conception of society from one with infinite resources to one that must respect nature's limits; reconnecting with alienated nations in the world; ending the Iraq war; attempting to cool some of the threats to world peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There will also be unforeseen challenges. In the end the presidency is not a matter of slogans or of whipping up crowds, but of patient, careful assessment of realities and analyses, consideration of alternatives and then of decisive action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I feel confident that if anyone can lead us forward through the forest of difficulties that surely awaits us, Sen. Barack Obama - President Obama - can do it. I wouldn't want this job, but I'm glad he does.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rich</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seemingly all I hear is that we should put higher taxes on the rich so the lower income people have more to spend on their needs. Although some Americans are born to wealth such as the Kennedys or the Hearsts, I believe most are like the people I know who took risks and gave up time in their lives to achieve the American Dream of being rich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rich people are punished with higher taxes just because they are rich. One might think that because they paid for their own education, as most Americans do and they gave up years of their lives going to school and lived very poorly until their loans were paid off, that they would be held in a different light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> America is the only country I know where those who make the right choices pay a tax for those right decisions. If you make a bad choice such as dropping out of school or learning no trade, people feel sorry for you and tell you it is OK, you don't have to pay any taxes. And so goes America.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stolen rights </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had a real awakening on a recent morning. Someone stole my Obama and Levin signs from my front lawn. Much has been made in the coming election about the role of patriotism. My neighbor's McCain-Palin sign was still standing. While I had spent hard-earned money to purchase these signs, what really upset me was the knowledge that for four years we have heard how anyone who disagrees with the current administration is less patriotic than those who agree. What I love about my country is our freedoms, our basic human rights as laid out in the Constitution. But somehow in the dark of the night, my First Amendment rights were taken away from me, right in my home. I'm a taxpayer, an American; I love my country. Because someone disagreed with me, I am no longer entitled to even voice my opinion? When did we lose our love and knowledge of the Constitution and rights? In the end, who is less patriotic, the sign displayer or the thief in the middle of the night? Thank goodness I still can use my right to really voice my opinion, in the voting booth! </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palin surprise </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read with great interest the Oct. 16 Viewpoint, &quot;Palin not the ticket for the vice presidency&quot; by Kristen Dold. I count myself among those who have serious concerns about the potential for Gov. Sarah Palin's ascent to the presidency. Immediately after her selection as Sen. John McCain's running mate, there was much speculation among the media that the McCain campaign's vetting process was flawed. Her daughter's pregnancy, Troopergate and her lack of foreign policy knowledge were all cited as examples of the candidate screening process gone wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further evidence of the McCain campaign's error is revealed in Dold's article, when she writes of McCain, &quot; ... he threw a woman on his ticket. Lipstick, check. Y chromosome, check.&quot; Y chromosome? Wow! Sarah Palin is actually a man wearing lipstick! McCain's operatives really should have been more careful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beware </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters beware. If we have a Democratic president and Democratic-controlled Senate and House, what type of policies will they pass? How far left does this country want to go? Be careful of what you ask for. Think carefully before you vote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter ID </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With all the criticism in the press concerning politicians on both sides of the aisle, I'd like to commend our Indiana General Assembly for having the guts and foresight to pass voter ID legislation last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new process was tested in the primaries and it has been proven to work. Now, when I vote in November, I will know that my ballot was not neutered by the illegal vote of a non-resident college student who may also be voting in his or her home state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ohioans are not so lucky. No proof of residency is required to register. Many thousands of newly registered names were added to Ohio's voting roster, and Ohio State University students from other states have already cast absentee ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Indiana, no matter how many forged voter applications were filled out, I know that the voter's legitimate photo identification will be required for that vote to be processed. So, win, lose or recount, we voters of Indiana at least will have the comfort of knowing that the upcoming national election was not stolen due to butterfly ballots or bad registration laws in our state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When capital markets and investment banks began to spin out of control, the Bush administration and politicians from both parties rushed to use government to stop the chaos. This demonstrates that conservatives' idea of government is not and never has been the enemy they made it out to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To this end a Barack Obama administration and a Democratic Congress alone can honestly use the combination of government and the private sector to lead the nation forward by harnessing the power of our economy to serve the common good. This is what our Constitution promises and this is what we as a people need to do.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not first time </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A TV ad currently being run by Barack Obama says that John McCain will tax health premiums paid by employers for the first time ever. Thus, workers will be required to pay income tax on premiums paid by their employers. Whether his reference as to what McCain will or will not do is true, I do not know. However, I do know that his stating such taxing of health benefits would be a first is not true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For many years federal and military retirees have paid income taxes on that portion of their health premiums paid by their former employer. Current federal employees, including members of Congress, do not pay income taxes on that portion of their health premiums paid by the government. And retirees in the private sector do not pay income taxes premiums paid by their former employers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association has tried for years to secure from Congress some relief from these unfair policies, but to no success. Many members of Congress sign onto the proposal to eliminate the unfair treatment, but it never comes to a vote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having known Don Wheeler and having worked with him on projects in our community, I know him to be a person of intelligence and integrity who is committed to social justice. I strongly support him as at-large candidate for the South Bend Community School Corp. Board of Trustees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wheeler's Web site (http://wheeler4rkids.org/) includes descriptions of some of the innovations he proposes as concrete ways to improve our schools. As an involved parent, successful business owner and active community member, Wheeler has shown he is a thoughtful person who can get the job done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Please join me in voting for Don Wheeler on Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Don Cooney's life work demonstrates he knows how to be the latter. I believe in doing what you can, where you are, with what you have. Apparently, so does he. This is a man of integrity and character, who has been an educator, community organizer and leader in our community for over 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cooney has the vision to see where we need to go as a community and a nation. His work with the civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movement speaks for itself. He has a clear vision, speaks for the voiceless and fights for justice everyday. This is the kind of congressman we need to represent us. Join me in voting Cooney for Congress on Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At-large seat </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I heartily endorse Don Wheeler for an at-large seat on the South Bend Community School Corp. Board of Trustees. Wheeler is exactly what our school corporation needs: committed, responsible, thorough, thoughtful and independent. With a kindergartner of his own, he also has a personal stake in the long-term success of our school system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have had children in the South Bend schools for the last 20 years, and I continue to be appalled by the school board's inability to address the problems that plague our schools and hamper our children's achievement and success. We need school board members who can move beyond internecine squabbles and imagined personal slights. We need school board members who can identify and focus on the most important problems our schools face, investigate these problems thoroughly and rationally, work together to solve them, plan creatively for the future, and work in harmony with the school corporation administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Electing Don Wheeler to the SBCSC school board will be a first step in achieving these goals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this time of transition for the South Bend Community School Corp. Board of Trustees, the voters would do well to consider the candidacy of Don Wheeler for member at-large. His grasp of the issues and steady hand are needed in times like these.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only an award-winning business owner, Wheeler has found the time for extensive volunteer work within our community, including working with Habitat for Humanity as a crew leader and with the Dream Team for Unity as a mentor for our youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Add to this his openness to citizen input and his common-sense approach to problem solving, and you will find an unusually well qualified candidate for the board of trustees. When you look over your ballot on Nov. 4 and see all the people running as at-large candidates for the school board, please take the time to find and vote for the candidate by the name of Don Wheeler.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain's selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate is reckless and has endangered this country. Her performance during the debate with Joe Biden was outrageous and her refusal to answer moderator's questions underscored that she is seriously and dangerously unprepared. It was obvious that she was spoon-fed information and had no grasp of issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She has remained reluctant to speak to the press and this is truly frightening. Maybe she has forgotten that it is the American people who hire our politicians and that, ostensibly, they work for us. More worrisome was her inability to name any newspapers she reads. Reminds one of the present occupant of the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We desperately need someone as president who is intelligent, thoughtful, transparent, educated and who is a thinker. That person is Sen. Barack Obama. Has anyone forgotten that Palin has been accused of abuse of power in her home state? We are in dire straits in this country and must vote for a change ? and that is a clean sweep of this administration and those who have supported this disastrous presidency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama has never been a Muslim. He is a practicing Christian.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His son, Admiral John Sidney &quot;Jack&quot; McCain Jr. (II) was also a four-star admiral, commander of submarines in the next war. He and his father were the only father and son four-star admirals to serve their country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've been reading opinions of Gov. Sarah Palin's performance on the campaign trail and, most specifically, the vice presidential debate. It seems there are some in every crowd who mention her accent as an actual factor in their decision-making. I am a truck driver by trade, having spent much too much time on the road. I've been through this great country far and wide. One of the more endearing charactistics of its people is the variety of dialects and accents. You know when you're talking to someone from Tennessee, Minnesota, New York, Maine or Montana. I've always taken a delight in this distinction of American culture. I know I'm talking to a fool when they judge not what you say but the way you say it. As if an accent or dialect disqualifies someone from good sense. Even if the opinion is similar, somehow it doesn't sound quite right to them. We are a nation of individuals homogenized in the concept of freedom and democracy, the standard of hard work and paying your own way. Those who think someone is disqualified by mannerisms and accents are a homogenious group with a distinct pitch that is punched, puckered and petty. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seriously? I mean, really? Sarah Palin? Is she the best candidate to run with John McCain? This person can't even protect her own e-mail account and we're going to trust her with national security? During her debate with Joe Biden, she used such words as &quot;y'all&quot; and &quot;darn right.&quot; Many of The Tribune's pundits described her as &quot;down to earth,&quot; you know, one of us common folk. Seriously? Really? Have you watched a reality show? These people are often referred to as &quot;one of us.&quot; Have we been politically dumbed down the last eight years of lowering our standards to the point that we ask, &quot;Is this is someone I'd like to have a beer with?&quot; I mean, it's only potentially the highest office in the land. Why strive for excellence? Wake up, people. The politicians we vote for will have a direct effect on our lives. Using Palin's philosophy, I can see Elkhart from my back porch, that would make me a good candidate for mayor. Then governor. Heck, in eight years I could be on the national ticket. Vote for me.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For children </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I support Don Wheeler, at-large candidate for the South Bend Community School Corp. Board of Trustees. Wheeler has proposed an initiative that would reward outstanding teachers who are willing to take on more challenging positions as needed to improve our schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his &quot;Teach For South Bend&quot; proposal, Wheeler suggests that we approach the business community to help establish and administer a fund which would offer incentives to talented teachers willing to take on more challenging assignments. Another key element of the program would be to establish a robust mentoring program for those teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Programs like this have failed elsewhere because they lacked the mentoring component.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I agree with Wheeler that it's time to start taking strong action towards positive results. Our children and our community deserve no less.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Challenges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here are some of the challenges we know the United States will face in the next four years:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Helping the working poor regain dignity and security; helping the middle class stop slipping into bankruptcy and poverty; overseeing the banking and investment systems that have recently crumbled; rebuilding our bridges, roads and other infrastructure; figuring out how to prevent health care costs from destroying individual and collective well-being; getting schools to focus on educating (not punishing or warehousing) children from the poorest as well as the wealthiest backgrounds; transforming our entire conception of society from one with infinite resources to one that must respect nature's limits; reconnecting with alienated nations in the world; ending the Iraq war; attempting to cool some of the threats to world peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There will also be unforeseen challenges. In the end the presidency is not a matter of slogans or of whipping up crowds, but of patient, careful assessment of realities and analyses, consideration of alternatives and then of decisive action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I feel confident that if anyone can lead us forward through the forest of difficulties that surely awaits us, Sen. Barack Obama - President Obama - can do it. I wouldn't want this job, but I'm glad he does.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rich</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seemingly all I hear is that we should put higher taxes on the rich so the lower income people have more to spend on their needs. Although some Americans are born to wealth such as the Kennedys or the Hearsts, I believe most are like the people I know who took risks and gave up time in their lives to achieve the American Dream of being rich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rich people are punished with higher taxes just because they are rich. One might think that because they paid for their own education, as most Americans do and they gave up years of their lives going to school and lived very poorly until their loans were paid off, that they would be held in a different light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> America is the only country I know where those who make the right choices pay a tax for those right decisions. If you make a bad choice such as dropping out of school or learning no trade, people feel sorry for you and tell you it is OK, you don't have to pay any taxes. And so goes America.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stolen rights </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had a real awakening on a recent morning. Someone stole my Obama and Levin signs from my front lawn. Much has been made in the coming election about the role of patriotism. My neighbor's McCain-Palin sign was still standing. While I had spent hard-earned money to purchase these signs, what really upset me was the knowledge that for four years we have heard how anyone who disagrees with the current administration is less patriotic than those who agree. What I love about my country is our freedoms, our basic human rights as laid out in the Constitution. But somehow in the dark of the night, my First Amendment rights were taken away from me, right in my home. I'm a taxpayer, an American; I love my country. Because someone disagreed with me, I am no longer entitled to even voice my opinion? When did we lose our love and knowledge of the Constitution and rights? In the end, who is less patriotic, the sign displayer or the thief in the middle of the night? Thank goodness I still can use my right to really voice my opinion, in the voting booth! </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read with great interest the Oct. 16 Viewpoint, &quot;Palin not the ticket for the vice presidency&quot; by Kristen Dold. I count myself among those who have serious concerns about the potential for Gov. Sarah Palin's ascent to the presidency. Immediately after her selection as Sen. John McCain's running mate, there was much speculation among the media that the McCain campaign's vetting process was flawed. Her daughter's pregnancy, Troopergate and her lack of foreign policy knowledge were all cited as examples of the candidate screening process gone wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further evidence of the McCain campaign's error is revealed in Dold's article, when she writes of McCain, &quot; ... he threw a woman on his ticket. Lipstick, check. Y chromosome, check.&quot; Y chromosome? Wow! Sarah Palin is actually a man wearing lipstick! McCain's operatives really should have been more careful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter ID </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With all the criticism in the press concerning politicians on both sides of the aisle, I'd like to commend our Indiana General Assembly for having the guts and foresight to pass voter ID legislation last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new process was tested in the primaries and it has been proven to work. Now, when I vote in November, I will know that my ballot was not neutered by the illegal vote of a non-resident college student who may also be voting in his or her home state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ohioans are not so lucky. No proof of residency is required to register. Many thousands of newly registered names were added to Ohio's voting roster, and Ohio State University students from other states have already cast absentee ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Indiana, no matter how many forged voter applications were filled out, I know that the voter's legitimate photo identification will be required for that vote to be processed. So, win, lose or recount, we voters of Indiana at least will have the comfort of knowing that the upcoming national election was not stolen due to butterfly ballots or bad registration laws in our state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serve people </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When capital markets and investment banks began to spin out of control, the Bush administration and politicians from both parties rushed to use government to stop the chaos. This demonstrates that conservatives' idea of government is not and never has been the enemy they made it out to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To this end a Barack Obama administration and a Democratic Congress alone can honestly use the combination of government and the private sector to lead the nation forward by harnessing the power of our economy to serve the common good. This is what our Constitution promises and this is what we as a people need to do.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not first time </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A TV ad currently being run by Barack Obama says that John McCain will tax health premiums paid by employers for the first time ever. Thus, workers will be required to pay income tax on premiums paid by their employers. Whether his reference as to what McCain will or will not do is true, I do not know. However, I do know that his stating such taxing of health benefits would be a first is not true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For many years federal and military retirees have paid income taxes on that portion of their health premiums paid by their former employer. Current federal employees, including members of Congress, do not pay income taxes on that portion of their health premiums paid by the government. And retirees in the private sector do not pay income taxes premiums paid by their former employers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association has tried for years to secure from Congress some relief from these unfair policies, but to no success. Many members of Congress sign onto the proposal to eliminate the unfair treatment, but it never comes to a vote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having known Don Wheeler and having worked with him on projects in our community, I know him to be a person of intelligence and integrity who is committed to social justice. I strongly support him as at-large candidate for the South Bend Community School Corp. Board of Trustees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wheeler's Web site (http://wheeler4rkids.org/) includes descriptions of some of the innovations he proposes as concrete ways to improve our schools. As an involved parent, successful business owner and active community member, Wheeler has shown he is a thoughtful person who can get the job done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Please join me in voting for Don Wheeler on Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Don Cooney's life work demonstrates he knows how to be the latter. I believe in doing what you can, where you are, with what you have. Apparently, so does he. This is a man of integrity and character, who has been an educator, community organizer and leader in our community for over 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cooney has the vision to see where we need to go as a community and a nation. His work with the civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movement speaks for itself. He has a clear vision, speaks for the voiceless and fights for justice everyday. This is the kind of congressman we need to represent us. Join me in voting Cooney for Congress on Nov. 4.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At-large seat </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I heartily endorse Don Wheeler for an at-large seat on the South Bend Community School Corp. Board of Trustees. Wheeler is exactly what our school corporation needs: committed, responsible, thorough, thoughtful and independent. With a kindergartner of his own, he also has a personal stake in the long-term success of our school system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have had children in the South Bend schools for the last 20 years, and I continue to be appalled by the school board's inability to address the problems that plague our schools and hamper our children's achievement and success. We need school board members who can move beyond internecine squabbles and imagined personal slights. We need school board members who can identify and focus on the most important problems our schools face, investigate these problems thoroughly and rationally, work together to solve them, plan creatively for the future, and work in harmony with the school corporation administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Electing Don Wheeler to the SBCSC school board will be a first step in achieving these goals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steady hand </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this time of transition for the South Bend Community School Corp. Board of Trustees, the voters would do well to consider the candidacy of Don Wheeler for member at-large. His grasp of the issues and steady hand are needed in times like these.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only an award-winning business owner, Wheeler has found the time for extensive volunteer work within our community, including working with Habitat for Humanity as a crew leader and with the Dream Team for Unity as a mentor for our youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Add to this his openness to citizen input and his common-sense approach to problem solving, and you will find an unusually well qualified candidate for the board of trustees. When you look over your ballot on Nov. 4 and see all the people running as at-large candidates for the school board, please take the time to find and vote for the candidate by the name of Don Wheeler.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bad choice </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain's selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate is reckless and has endangered this country. Her performance during the debate with Joe Biden was outrageous and her refusal to answer moderator's questions underscored that she is seriously and dangerously unprepared. It was obvious that she was spoon-fed information and had no grasp of issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She has remained reluctant to speak to the press and this is truly frightening. Maybe she has forgotten that it is the American people who hire our politicians and that, ostensibly, they work for us. More worrisome was her inability to name any newspapers she reads. Reminds one of the present occupant of the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We desperately need someone as president who is intelligent, thoughtful, transparent, educated and who is a thinker. That person is Sen. Barack Obama. Has anyone forgotten that Palin has been accused of abuse of power in her home state? We are in dire straits in this country and must vote for a change ? and that is a clean sweep of this administration and those who have supported this disastrous presidency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I made my decision after listening to countless political ads plus four debates. Media coverage has had little effect on my decision. Most news reports have turned into just another Hollywood production and a grab for ratings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I do not want a person in the commander-in-chief's chair who is supported by extremists preaching hate. I do not want someone who will let other world leaders decide our fate. I don't want someone who uses schoolchildren to sing their praises on nationwide TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What's next, their picture on the sides of public transportation, statues erected of them in public parks, excerpts from books written about them inserted in schoolbooks?</SPAN></P>

What a nasty, nasty act of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am wondering: What kind of a country do I live in?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democracy is the privilege of voting for who we think is the best candidate; it is the privilege of having the choice of putting political signs on our lawns; it is the privilege of having the choice to go from door-to-door talking to people about our favored candidate and making sure each person is registered to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The people who do the kinds of things which were done to my property, and to the property of Mike Gray whose letter was in Monday's paper, know nothing about democracy and do not belong in this country. They are ignorant as to their and their fellow citizens' rights and have chosen to be so.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is truly amazing that she would recall that Barack Obama actually knew Bill Ayers back when he was organizing the Weather Underground, and Obama was only 8 years old. I imagine Ayers taught Obama all kinds of neat stuff about how to blow up railroads, sabotage munitions shipments to Vietnam and to raise Cain in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ah, Obama, how do we know thee? Let me count the ways. Obama the saboteur. Obama the rebel. Obama the insurgent, the traitor, the revolutionary, and of course, the terrorist.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama grew up in Hawaii and spent several years in Indonesia. While there he attended both public and Catholic schools. He never attended a Muslim religious school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama has never been a Muslim. He is a practicing Christian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He never took his oath of office for the Senate on the Koran. He used the family Bible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> False rumor: Obama is of the elite class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After coming back to Hawaii, he was raised by his mom and later his grandmother. Using loans to get through Columbia, he graduated in 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He spent a few years in New York. Then he moved to Chicago to work with people affected by the closing of steel plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After working in Chicago, Obama went to Harvard Law School and graduated in 1991. While there he was president of the Harvard Law Review (only very smart people do this). Then he moved back to Chicago and taught constitutional law (only very smart people are able to teach constitutional law). The times we are now in call for a very smart person.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His grandfather was Admiral John Sidney &quot;Slew&quot; McCain I, the Pacific Carrier Commander, Naval Academy Class of 1906, who died on Sept. 6, 1945, the day after he returned from service in the Pacific after World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His son, Admiral John Sidney &quot;Jack&quot; McCain Jr. (II) was also a four-star admiral, commander of submarines in the next war. He and his father were the only father and son four-star admirals to serve their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Sidney McCain III, as we all know, graduated from the Naval Academy in 1958 and served his country as a pilot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His son, John Sidney &quot;Jack&quot; McCain IV is in the Naval Academy right now. His other son, James H. McCain, was in the Marines and served already in Iraq.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indiana Republicans remain confident of keeping the state in the GOP column for John McCain on Election Day even as Democrat Barack Obama keeps up an unprecedented campaign for the state's 11 electoral votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign has ramped up its activities in recent weeks and started airing television commercials in Indiana after going months without responding to Obama's organizing and advertising efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans, though, are also relying on the state's long-standing conservative leanings most prominently displayed in its 40-year run of backing GOP presidential nominees. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama spent much of his speech Thursday before a crowd of thousands that packed the American Legion Mall in downtown Indianapolis defending his tax proposals from the criticisms of McCain and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rex Early, a former Indiana Republican chairman who led the state campaigns for Ronald Reagan and Bob Dole, said he believed the state's voters would turn away from Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he's for bigger government. I think he's for more taxes,&quot; Early said. &quot;I have confidence that Indiana is going to do what it's always done, which is back the most conservative candidate, which happens to be McCain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh, who joined Obama on stage Thursday, said the importance of the economic slowdown and the unpopularity of President Bush was helping build support for the Illinois senator among Indiana voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People know that the price John McCain had to pay to win his party's nomination was to embrace most of the Bush agenda,&quot; Bayh said. &quot;So you get independents and moderate Republicans who just don't want four more years of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's rally speech was his seventh campaign stop in Indiana since mid-July. The highest-profile response by the McCain campaign has been a visit by running mate Sarah Palin to a rally in Noblesville last week and another rally with Palin is scheduled for Saturday in Fort Wayne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain's last stop in the state was on July 1, but that wasn't even an appeal to Indiana voters as he spoke to a national sheriffs convention and then to a private fundraiser in Indianapolis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels has said he believed McCain needed to pay more attention to Indiana, others don't feel the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican state Rep. Jackie Walorski, whose district covers a strongly GOP area near South Bend, said she thought the McCain campaign was making the correct decision by concentrating on states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the Obama campaign had failed to gain the support it should have with the millions of dollars it had spent in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think people aren't convinced. He ought to be walking away with this state by now with the money he has thrown in here and he is not,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't need the 'American Idol' kind of celebrity sweep-throughs to convince me who has a better plan for middle-class Hoosiers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A public poll released Thursday showed Obama with a lead of 51 percent to 42 percent over McCain. The Big Ten Battleground Poll is the first public poll of Indiana to show Obama with a lead over McCain outside the margin of error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retired General Motors worker Linda Ort of Fort Wayne said as she left Thursday's Obama rally that she was hopeful of the Republican presidential winning streak ending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the people are such staunch Republicans that they'll never change, said Ort, 61. &quot;More of the last eight years is what we'll see if McCain is in there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

I was born nearly three decades after the war ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let's hope that the partial nationalization of America's banking system isn't equally &quot;temporary.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a dramatic meeting Monday between Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and the heads of the nine biggest banks, the U.S. government made the financial industry an offer it couldn't refuse: Uncle Sam is buying big chunks of your banks whether you like it or not. Paulson didn't say, &quot;I can either have your signature on this contract or your brains,&quot; the way Don Corleone explained things to Johnny Fontaine's bandleader in &quot;The Godfather,&quot; but you get the picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Extraordinary crises sometimes require extraordinary measures. The danger is that the extraordinary could become merely ordinary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fannie Mae and related institutions were created during the New Deal to help expand homeownership. It was - and is - a laudable goal, and the government can point to some real successes, particularly when such programs were fundamentally conservative in their practices. But even then, the government was simultaneously subsidizing bad risks - hence making them seem less risky than they really were - while delaying the day when those toxic loans would reach critical mass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We've hit that day, and it has cost us trillions of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bush administration's shock trauma team has been doing things they once considered unimaginable and even today find philosophically repugnant. But again, we do things to patients in an emergency that we would never do when they're healthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The federal government's mandatory quarter-trillion-dollar buy-in to the American banking system, we're told, is a temporary measure. The terms of the loans rammed down the bankers' throats are designed to encourage them to pay it all back within five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But who says those terms will stay that way? After all, the government now has a more real and explicit ownership position in these &quot;private&quot; banks than it ever did in Fannie and Freddie, which were so-called Government Sponsored Enterprises. More important, the Bush team is heading out the door. When the next squad comes in, they might discover they like being co-owners of America's banking system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democrats in Congress had great fun using Fannie and Freddie as public policy piggy banks, rewarding constituencies, funding pet projects, forcing the private sector to dance to their tune. What's to stop them from renegotiating this week's deal after the election and using Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and the others as Fannie Mae 2.0?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Please don't say that the terms of the deal are set and the government can't revise them. If there's one thing the last month has hammered home, it's that nothing is written in stone. Besides, the banks may grow to like the security of partial nationalization and even lobby to Congress to stay on as less-than-fully-silent partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Heck, that way they wouldn't have to pay back the loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barack Obama already has a strong record of sympathy for &quot;public-private partnerships&quot; and other schemes that put government in the driver's seat. ACORN, the militant wing of the Democratic Party, has been trying to shake down banks for years, and Obama is on record as saying it and similar groups will have a major role in helping him craft policy. And it's hardly reassuring that Barney Frank, Chris Dodd and Nancy Pelosi will be running Congress. It doesn't seem crazy to suspect that a crowd that sees nationalization of health care as a vital public policy goal will not be dogmatically adverse to the nationalization of the credit markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John McCain is better about such things, but not by much. An avowed disciple of Teddy Roosevelt, McCain has a record of whipping the private sector - even Major League Baseball! - to do his bidding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Teddy Roosevelt himself revised his faith in &quot;trust-busting,&quot; preferring instead to let big business grow bigger so long as it agreed to follow the orders of even bigger government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Wednesday's night's third presidential debate, CBS's Bob Schieffer missed a vital opportunity to ask both candidates whether they would pledge not only to abide by the bailout's sunset provisions but to further promise to get the government out of Wall Street as quickly as possible. Such pledges wouldn't be legally binding, but they would help create political pressure from the right direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That didn't happen. So now we'll just have to trust that the politicians and Wall Street won't mess things up. Anyone feeling good about that?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After weeks without television commercials, the Democrat's gubernatorial campaign was scheduled to hit the airwaves statewide today with a new commercial called &quot;We won't,&quot; saying the state's in bad shape and that her administration won't follow the same policies as that of Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indiana Republican Party spokesman Jay Kenworthy noted an e-mail from Long Thompson's campaign sent Monday that offers a sneak peek at the TV spot in exchange for a $25 donation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What does a campaign desperate for cash look like?&quot; Kenworthy said in an e-mail. &quot;Send me $25 and I'll tell you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Long Thompson's campaign says it's ramping up for the two-week sprint to Nov. 4, including canvassing and an ambitious statewide bus tour, said Jason Tomsci, spokesman for the Long Thompson campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Daniels, meanwhile, probably will have some campaign events, but spends most of his time on official matters, said Cam Savage, his campaign spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He will have some more campaign stops, make some more time to be on the road, available,&quot; Savage said. &quot;Most of that's been limited to the weekends over the last year or so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andy Horning, the Libertarian candidate for governor, said he's making two or three public appearances every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this has been one of the more frustrating elections he can remember.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm trying to spread the message, I'm trying to get votes all at the same time,&quot; he said. &quot;I can't say that there's going to be any great epiphany and people are going to realize we need to change directions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presidentially ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With Indiana considered a &quot;battleground&quot; state, the major party presidential campaigns also are pushing hard to the end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sen. Barack Obama's Indiana campaign says it's going to use the last two weeks to capitalize on the organization it's been building in Indiana over the last several months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At the end of the day, it's about getting the voters out,&quot; Jonathan Swain said. &quot;We're going to have our field staff as well as the thousands of volunteers across the state just really focused on our get out the vote efforts, including pushing early voting over the next two weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sen. John McCain's team also will be canvassing and making phone calls, but also promoting early voting, said Kenworthy, of the Indiana Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state GOP speaks on behalf of McCain's campaign in Indiana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Republican Party has a history of closing well in elections,&quot; he said. &quot;And we expect this one to be no different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state's Libertarian Party is hoping to spread the word about former U.S. Rep. Bob Barr, running for president on the party's ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We're getting volunteer inquiries every day. We've ordered some yard signs for the state office to distribute for people,&quot; said Todd Singer, chairman of the Libertarian Party of Indiana. &quot;The TV buys are pretty much out of the picture for us around here, but we are running some radio ads around the Indianapolis area.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUTH BEND - Before Wednesday night's presidential debate began, The Tribune's political panelists were questioning the event's worth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Panelist David Van Dyke, a public school teacher who lives in Buchanan, said he expected it to be &quot;two real big commercials.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seven of The Tribune's political panelists - a group of 18 voters we assembled to weigh in on the presidential campaign - met Wednesday night at The Tribune's downtown South Bend offices to watch, and react to, the final debate between Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About a half an hour into the debate, as discussion between the two senators turned to who wronged whom in speeches and campaign ads, panelist Nancy Biggum started shaking her head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're both fundamentally nice people,&quot; Biggum said. &quot;How did we get to this dog and pony show?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even panelist Dave Cook, who in earlier stories has said he enjoys political attacks and negative campaigning, got frustrated as the two senators went back-and-forth over the tone of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We've gotta move on, people,&quot; he said to the television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They might have been fed up with some of the discussion, but they still had strong opinions on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cook and Van Dyke vigorously disagreed when talk turned to William Ayers, a former member of the Weather Underground, a group that was responsible for bombings of government buildings in the 1970s, including the U.S. Capitol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And they exchanged words again when McCain brought up Obama's possible ties to ACORN, a community organizing group that's been under investigation for allegedly filing fraudulent voter registration forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Right there, right there,&quot; said Cook, who runs a lumber company in Dowagiac. &quot;That could bury Obama. He knows it, too. Look at his face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Oh yeah, he's gonna lose big,&quot; Van Dyke said sarcastically in response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Panelist Merrill Clark, an organic farmer from Cass County, Mich., said it would be nice for the debates to return to a looser, but more dignified, structure. She talked about hearing a re-enactment of the debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas on public radio.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUTH BEND - Before Wednesday night's presidential debate began, The Tribune's political panelists were questioning the event's worth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Panelist David Van Dyke, a public school teacher who lives in Buchanan, said he expected it to be &quot;two real big commercials.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seven of The Tribune's political panelists - a group of 18 voters we assembled to weigh in on the presidential campaign - met Wednesday night at The Tribune's downtown South Bend offices to watch, and react to, the final debate between Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About a half an hour into the debate, as discussion between the two senators turned to who wronged whom in speeches and campaign ads, panelist Nancy Biggum started shaking her head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're both fundamentally nice people,&quot; Biggum said. &quot;How did we get to this dog and pony show?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even panelist Dave Cook, who in earlier stories has said he enjoys political attacks and negative campaigning, got frustrated as the two senators went back-and-forth over the tone of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We've gotta move on, people,&quot; he said to the television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They might have been fed up with some of the discussion, but they still had strong opinions on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cook and Van Dyke vigorously disagreed when talk turned to William Ayers, a former member of the Weather Underground, a group that was responsible for bombings of government buildings in the 1970s, including the U.S. Capitol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And they exchanged words again when McCain brought up Obama's possible ties to ACORN, a community organizing group that's been under investigation for allegedly filing fraudulent voter registration forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Right there, right there,&quot; said Cook, who runs a lumber company in Dowagiac. &quot;That could bury Obama. He knows it, too. Look at his face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Oh yeah, he's gonna lose big,&quot; Van Dyke said sarcastically in response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Panelist Merrill Clark, an organic farmer from Cass County, Mich., said it would be nice for the debates to return to a looser, but more dignified, structure. She talked about hearing a re-enactment of the debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas on public radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It wasn't fisticuffs,&quot; she said. &quot;They just stood up and rattled off stuff. They're standing up there, no lights, no camera, no action - it's just what you would consider now deadly boring, because it didn't have all the sheen or shine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Panelist Harry Singleton, a 61-year-old South Bend accountant, said he'd be surprised if there are many people making up their minds based on Wednesday's debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, Singleton said, he wishes the candidates had put their campaign war chests to better use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Look at the state of the economy right now,&quot; he said, &quot;and all the money wasted on this negative campaigning.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know St. Joseph County is heavily Democratic, and will remain that way, but that doesn't mean there aren't residents who are just as passionate about Republican candidates. I see countless Voice of the People letters touting Sen. Barack Obama's ideas, how he will unite us, the real instrument of change, and Sen. John McCain's 90 percent agreement with President Bush, etc. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have not seen one letter where most of the information was not a sound bite brought to them by national television, left-leaning political writers or programmed by the news media. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush has less than a 28 percent approval rating, and McCain voted with him 90 percent of the time. Do we want eight more years of Bush? Hint: Bush isn't running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama voted 96 percent of the time with Democratic party leadership. Good for St. Joseph County, but not so good for other more conservative counties. Congress has a 17.8 percent approval rating. Democrats have controlled Congress for 38 out of the last 50 years. They have controlled the Senate for about half the time during the Bush presidency. A 17.8 percent approval rating - do we want to elect someone who follows his leadership 96 percent of the time, considering that 17.8 percent approval rating, or the guy who follows his president, with a 28 percent approval rating, 90 percent of the time? Really, not much of a choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama argues he will reach across party lines to Republicans to unite the country. When will he do that? Because he hasn't done it to date. McCain has, in major legislation (McCain-Feingold bill). Ninety-six percent of the time Obama votes with party leadership. By contrast, he hardly ever votes for Republican ideas or principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2007, Obama was ranked the most liberal senator in America by the National Journal. Sen. Joe Biden was No. 3. I am a fiscal conservative. I am a social moderate. I plan to split my votes among party lines at the national and state level. I believe most people feel that way, but Obama's votes would not allow him to cross the aisle to include me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the campaign trail, Obama does not embrace, at least publicly, his ideological beliefs. In fact, in his 2004 Democratic National Committee speech he stated: &quot;Even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters, and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes ? Well, I say to them tonight, there is not a liberal America and a conservative America, there is the United States of America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beautiful words. Wonderful oratory. Unfortunately, just words. In 2007, Obama voted the liberal position on 65 of the key 66 Senate votes. He has garnered a perfect liberal score in both economic and social categories. In 2007, he didn't appear to reach across the aisle to the Republicans. Actions speak louder than words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an American, you have the right to vote. I encourage you to vote. If you agree with Obama, based on his actions, vote for him. If you believe that McCain is closer to your ideological beliefs, I am sure he would welcome your vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't listen to the words. Where did each of them stand on the votes that were important to you? You know, not many people really change. They are what they are. We can all promise change, but given the opportunity, do we really? Vote your belief system, and the candidate who will vote with your interests in mind.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BATTLE GROUND Ind.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American flags flutter merrily in this sleepy town, and you can get a mean tenderloin sandwich at one of its three eateries. But don't expect to find much talk about politics in the birthplace of the modern political campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a handful of campaign signs are on display in the town of 1,300. Even residents who've decided how they'll vote in the fierce presidential race between Barack Obama and John McCain are often reluctant to say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most people in Battle Ground are conflict-averse, and they would rather not commit than get into an argument over it,&quot; said Town Council President Steve Egly. &quot;I think there are a lot of people who just assume it's between them and the voting machine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a stark contrast to 1840, when tens of thousands of people gathered on a historic battlefield site here to help launch William Henry Harrison's bid for president in a rally that set the stage for the modern political campaign. The day featured bands, floats, stump speeches and songs based on the campaign's slogan, &quot;Tippecanoe and Tyler too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every campaign since has essentially followed the mold that was seen in the Indiana wilderness in 1840,&quot; said Gleaves Whitney, director of the Hauenstein Center for Presidential Studies at Grand Valley State University in Michigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 170 years later, Indiana could again make presidential history if Obama succeeds in his quest to turn the traditionally red state blue for the first time since 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New voter registrations are at a record since 2006, and election officials expect the highest turnout since 1992. Obama's campaign alone has pumped more than $7.5 million into ads since the run-up to the hotly contested May primary with Hillary Rodham Clinton. Thousands have turned out for Obama's nearly four dozen stops in the state this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls suggest the race may be too close to call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there's little evidence of that hoopla in Battle Ground, where Harrison all but ended the Indian wars in the Midwest when he and about 1,000 soldiers defeated warriors from a federation of tribes in the Nov. 7, 1811, Battle of Tippecanoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a crisp day just weeks before Election Day, many folks in the town about 65 miles northwest of Indianapolis were still on the fence in the presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm up in the air. I'm at a crossroads, you could say,&quot; said Amy Fetterling, 39, a nail technician at Shauna's Classicuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Battleground Trading Post Grocery half of it a tiny grocery store and half a cafe John Walter of nearby Brookston was just finishing lunch when an Obama campaign commercial aired on a wall-mounted television set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walter, a 58-year-old maintenance worker for landlords, tuned it out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he is one of the first 10 people in line to vote every election. But this year, he doesn't know who will get his nod for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't dislike any of the candidates, but I don't like any of the candidates good enough to hand them a dollar bill to put their bumper sticker on my car,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The salon and grocery store are two of the few businesses in Battle Ground, where the downtown consists of a single block that also houses a post office, bank, liquor store, fire station and a motorcycle shop. Every once in a while, a train chugs through town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The town's pride and joy is Tippecanoe Battlefield Park, a 96-acre national historic landmark with hiking trails, a nature center, a museum and an 85-foot marble obelisk that serves as a monument to the Battle of Tippecanoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Indiana communities have had battles of their own of late, suffering from the economic malaise that drove the state's unemployment figure to 6.4 percent in August, up nearly 2 percentage points from a year earlier. The state is consistently one of the leaders for foreclosures, and news of layoffs especially in the manufacturing and auto industries comes in a steady stream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though foreclosures are up, Battle Ground has been spared much of the pain being felt in other Indiana communities, Egly said. Many residents work in the neighboring cities of Lafayette and West Lafayette, and the county's August unemployment rate of 4.9 percent was ninth lowest in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the economy still weighs heavily on residents' minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the word would be anxious with a little fear mixed in,&quot; Egly said. &quot;For small-town folks, you see everything going on in Wall Street and people are in the mode of, 'I've got to ride it out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The struggling economy has the attention of Aaron Brewer, 28, who works at the B and C Cycles shop owned by his father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brewer isn't selling as many motorcycles now, but more people are bringing their old bikes for service to get them running so they can save on gasoline costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people he talks to are hurting, he said, whether it's from rising gasoline and food prices or a struggle to make their mortgage payments. But he knows some people still have questions about the candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There seem to be more people concerned with, you know, 'Is McCain the same-old, same old, and is Obama really for the middle class?'&quot; Brewer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At TC's Restaurant and Bar, nostalgia and a mean tenderloin twice the size of the bun it's served on are the main attractions. On one wall hangs a huge black-and-white picture of the 1963-64 Battle Ground High School basketball team after it won that year's Tippecanoe County championship game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sherry Adams and her husband, Curtis, from nearby Oxford reflected on the presidential race in Indiana during a stop for lunch. Sherry, a 59-year-old homemaker, said many Democrats in the area seem to be leaning toward McCain, while many Republicans like Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's not sure who she'll vote for but says she is certain of one thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whoever gets it is getting handed down a disastrous country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three weeks before the election, Republicans are growing increasingly concerned about John McCain's ability to mount a comeback, questioning his tactics and even his campaign's main thrust in a White House race increasingly focused on economic turmoil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has to make the case that he's different than Bush and better than Obama on the economy,&quot; said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, one of more than a dozen prominent Republicans who in interviews during the past week expressed concern over the course of McCain's bid. &quot;If he doesn't win that case, it's all over, and it's going to be a very bad year for Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Republicans, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid angering McCain, said the campaign should have sought to plant doubts about Obama's associations with 1960s-era radical William Ayers and others months ago, rather than waiting until the campaign's final weeks. Doing so now, they said, makes the 72-year-old McCain come off as angry, grouchy and desperate, playing into Democrats' hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, these Republicans said, McCain needs to strike a balance in his tone appearing presidential while also questioning Obama's readiness to serve and judgment to lead. And, several said McCain should close the campaign on an honorable note. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He doesn't need an attack strategy, he needs a comeback strategy,&quot; said Alex Castellanos, a longtime national GOP media consultant who worked for McCain primary rival Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unsolicited advice comes as McCain campaign officials are becoming increasingly discouraged. From junior aides to top advisers, the frustration is palpable. Some argue the media isn't giving McCain a fair shake and are weary of the increasingly problematic environment working against the GOP. Tensions have grown over how hard to go after Obama amid concerns about irreparably damaging McCain's straight-shooter reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the candidate himself, the target of a negative whisper campaign in the 2000 GOP primary, appears conflicted on the campaign trail. He's cheery and smiling during question-and-answer sessions with crowds but becomes visibly annoyed even surly when he reads aloud scripted attacks on Obama and Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the polls showing Obama with a lead nationally and challenging for states long in the Republican column, none of the Republicans interviewed said the race was lost. They said McCain can prevail if he presents himself as the optimistic visionary the public wants at deeply worrisome economic times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He needs to come forward with a serious new plan and announce it in a serious manner,&quot; said Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's 1996 campaign. &quot;McCain cannot outdo Obama in just expressing outrage over Wall Street greed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidates meet Wednesday in their third and final debate; it's McCain's best chance to make a lasting impression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has an opportunity to step up and be a forceful leader during these challenging times,&quot; said Ron Kaufman, a veteran party operative who also worked for Romney. &quot;McCain got the nomination because that's what his brand is, but somehow it's gotten muddled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior advisers insist McCain is trying to be such a leader. They note that his daily speeches are devoted heavily to the economy, including taxes and health care, and that he's been rolling out a series of prescriptions. They complain that McCain's not getting credit for those and argue that the media holds McCain to a higher standard than Obama, who they contend is getting a free pass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past week, McCain also has been assailing Obama's character in speeches and TV ads. They include one that, with little proof, accuses Obama of lying about his association with Ayers and assails Democrats as irresponsible liberals on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Republicans want McCain to keep it up, though strike a balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Steele, the former Maryland lieutenant governor and chairman of the candidate-recruiting organization GOPAC, said McCain must reassure people with a &quot;clear and concise&quot; economic message but also needs to &quot;smack the other guy around a little bit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio GOP chief Bob Bennett said the campaign must do more to &quot;close the sale&quot; on what McCain would do as president. But he also said: &quot;I think he needs to get tougher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others say the only thing McCain can do is hope Obama makes a huge mistake or an outside event changes the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Winning the campaign is totally out of McCain's hands,&quot; said Matthew Dowd, President Bush's senior political strategist in 2004, who now shuns the party label.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign struggled to find the right fit last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, running mate Sarah Palin accused Obama of &quot;palling around with terrorists,&quot; a clear reference to Ayers, and suggested McCain would go after Obama in last week's debate. Instead, the GOP nominee rolled out a proposal that the government buy bad home-loan mortgages. That drew the ire of conservatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Gingrich: &quot;I can't defend it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Monday, McCain gave a blistering speech asking &quot;Who is Barack Obama&quot; and asserting that Obama was not candid and truthful. He stood by as unruly GOP crowds hurled insults at Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, McCain called for the temporary suspension of the requirement that older investors liquidate their retirement accounts and defended Obama as &quot;a decent, family man&quot; the public shouldn't fear. That day, McCain's campaign also came out with its hardest-hitting ad yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been internal disagreements over how far to go, with some advisers pressing McCain to criticize Obama on his relationship with his incendiary former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. McCain earlier had ruled that out of bounds. Some advisers fear charges of racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One senior McCain adviser said the worry isn't just that McCain may lose but also that, in defeat, the attacks on Obama could cause long-term damage to McCain's image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not clear whether it's concern about McCain's legacy that prompted the senator to defend Obama on Friday, and advisers insisted there wasn't a conscious decision to soften the criticism. One, Mark Salter, told reporters traveling with McCain: &quot;He responded to questions he didn't think were appropriate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's been backlash to the negativity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is not the McCain I endorsed,&quot; former Michigan Gov. William Milliken told The Grand Rapids Press, calling the tenor disappointing. &quot;He ought to be talking about the issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps no place underscores McCain's woes better than Indiana, which hasn't voted for a Democrat in decades. Obama has spent an estimated $7 million on advertising there and polls show the race is tight. Republicans just went on the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's got a great story and a great case to make,&quot; Murray Clark, the state party chairman, said of McCain. &quot;Has he made that yet? Not really.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Sept. 26 Viewpoint piece Maggie Kernan reminded us of the important topic of &quot;equal pay for equal work.&quot; In his acceptance speech presidential candidate Barack Obama said, &quot;Now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work.&quot; Let's see how he does when he is in charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his Senate office, Obama's 28 male staffers average $54,397. His 30 female staffers average $45,152. (By comparison John McCain's 17 male staffers average $53,936. His 25 female staffers averaged $55,878.) I guess this is just another example of Obama saying one thing when the TV cameras are on and doing something else when they are not.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the summer my wife and I, recently retired academics, committed Catholic Christians and supporters of Sen. Barack Obama's candidacy, made a decision to pray for him daily. Specifically, we pledged to petition God for Obama's courage, discernment, integrity and protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have decided to invite other people of faith to join us in this &quot;Pray for Obama&quot; effort for three reasons:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Through the prayers of many, we want to entrust Obama and his family to God's guidance and care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * We want Obama to take courage from, as well as be strengthened in his accountability to, the many people who support him precisely because his character and many of his positions share the values of our faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * We want the broader public to know of the significance of faith for millions of Obama's supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As such, we are inviting persons of faith, whether Christians or those from other traditions, to consider making the following commitment:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I pledge myself to pray daily for God's blessings of courage, discernment, integrity and protection upon Barack Obama through the duration of this election campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are inviting those making this pledge to send their names to a dedicated email address, prayforobama@comcast.net We will then be passing those names on to Obama on a weekly basis. We are also encouraging those making the pledge to spread the news of this effort to other persons of faith.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the upcoming election, I've been doing my own snooping on the issues, especially drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I'd heard that the installation of a pump would harm the population of the porcupine caribou, which worried me greatly. I'd also heard that it would be destroying thousands and thousands of acres of Alaskan scenery. As someone who's actively involved in preserving the environment, this did not sit well with me, and so I ventured into this political issue dubiously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Indiana's 2nd congressional district, the man running for Congress against Joe Donnelly, D-Granger, is Republican Luke Puckett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Puckett recently took a trip to Alaska to visit the site where oil companies want to put in the second pump. What I learned was that the porcupine caribou population has actually increased fivefold since the installation of the first pump in Prudhoe Bay. In fact, ANWR's Web site, www.ANWR.org, has video and pictures of the caribou sleeping beside the pump!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The area that the drilling would occupy is 2,000 acres (about the size of the University of Notre Dame campus) out of approximately 19 million acres of nature preserve; seems pretty small to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Come on, guys. I love the environment as much as anyone, but we need oil.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there has ever been a time to throw out our public officials, that time has just arrived. The first two candidates must be House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. These two leaders(?) of Congress publicly admitted that they had no idea what to do about the financial crisis and left for home, while drawing large salaries for their incompetence. They have taken their constitutional obligation to guard our Treasury and given it to unelected officials in the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is neither federal nor does it have any reserves except the income tax it takes from taxpayers. What they have done is treason. After we oust them, we can begin trying the people who got us into this mess, including Barney Frank, D-Mass., and a whole host of Clintonistas who started this train wreck during the Clinton administration. What Americans need to learn is that we have been had by the world bankers who have slammed the trapdoor on uninformed taxpayers. Remember in November don't vote for any incumbent. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dumb plan </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After reading an article in The Tribune about the Democrats' plan for oil drilling, I've come to the conclusion that the Democrats care nothing about us. Their plan for drilling for oil is the dumbest thing I've even heard of. I doubt if the oil companies are willing to invest that much money where they may or may not strike oil. Some 90 percent of the oil is still off-limits. If the Democrats were really serious about helping us and creating thousands of jobs, they would allow drilling in Alaska and closer to shore. I've heard people talk about wind and solar energy for years. Well, this is America and Americans can do anything, just get those politicians out of the way. What we have is a government for the politicians, by the politicians. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Joseph County voters have an opportunity to shape the future of the South Bend Community School Corp. I encourage you to cast your vote for Ann Rosen for the board of trustees and help our public schools become centers of excellence. Rosen has clearly articulated a core set of beliefs, most especially that all children deserve an excellent education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She understands the importance of collaboration, negotiation, partnerships, always putting the best interests of children and families first. Rosen's professional life has been focused on listening and learning, on finding out what works best and then figuring out how to make it work in our community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rosen ran for school board in 2004 because she recognized the opportunity to share her knowledge of best practices in education, community needs and program development. Her thoughtful and calm leadership has helped to keep the school board responsive and willing to make hard choices, keeping in clear view the complex needs of children, families and school personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Re-electing Ann Rosen sends the message that you understand the importance of leaders who listen so that they can learn, learn so that they can teach and teach so that they can offer a more hopeful future for all of us.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have you ever watched a movie trailer and thought, &quot;That looks like a great movie,&quot; but after you see the movie you realize that it just didn't live up to the trailer? This describes the most recent ad for Gov. Mitch Daniels. Before you believe this ad, among others, do your research. Talk to some school administrators about funding and progress for schools, and look to see if more kids are graduating from high school. Talk to people in local government about funding for your local government services such as the health department, fire and police. Talk to senior citizens, needy people and people with disabilities who need food stamps and Medicaid who have been cut off benefits without understanding why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Try to figure out why a foreign company is better equipped to make money from the Indiana Toll Road than we are - either the state will lose out or the people who use the road will lose out in the end. Talk to one of many newly unemployed residents and find out how difficult it was to collect their unemployment. Watch the debates! Daniels' administration is just not as wonderful as his expensive movie trailer would have you believe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people think it's scary to think that the election of Sen. John McCain would place Sarah Palin one heartbeat from the presidency. It's absolutely terrifying to think of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi two heartbeats from the presidency. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an at-large candidate for the South Bend Community School Corp. Board of Trustees, I want to state my position on the most pressing issues facing future board members:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Money: Reduce the cost of busing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Introduce problem-based learning with the New Tech High School program. Such a model helps non-native-English speakers, and supports vocational education; such experiential learning is effective at all grades from kindergarten to high school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Select a superintendent who provides educational leadership for the teachers and communicates constructively with the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current school board members are disconnected from each other, the superintendent, the teachers, our community and, saddest of all, from the learning of our children. I will work to reconnect us all, utilizing parent, teacher and community input into all school board discussions and in making decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am parent of four boys, and currently serve on several statewide science education committees. I am director of a local organization, Northern Indiana Science, Math and Engineering Collaborative, providing financial support to local education and professional development to teachers in the St. Joseph County area.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reform? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attention Social Security recipients and future recipients: George W. Bush and now John McCain support the idea of channeling the Social Security funds into &quot;personal accounts&quot; that individuals would invest on Wall Street. Some of that money would be entrusted into firms that failed, such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. Imagine what this crisis would be like if Americans' Social Security benefits were evaporating along with their housing values and their 401K accounts. This is the man who's going to reform the economy?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critical issues </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many voters correctly point out that there are several truly important issues to consider when trying to decide who to vote for. Immigration issues, health insurance, the economy, unjust wars, etc., certainly fall into this category. But all these concerns, of their very nature, contain various shades of gray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thoughtful people can honestly differ on how to approach these problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are other issues though, by their very nature, which are always wrong. Some very relevant examples would be abortion on demand and so-called same-sex marriage. These practices are always abominations and are never, ever, allowed, no matter what any human laws might try to pretend to say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It follows, naturally, that no human being could ever vote for any politician who formally, publicly and profoundly supports such intrinsically evil causes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Bend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A new low</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just when I thought the McCain campaign had sunk as low as possible, it surprised me again. If you want to connect a politician to real terrorist ties, check out the Bush family and their longtime association with the bin Laden family. Yes, it's the same bin Laden family whose member attacked us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John McCain wants the focus off the economy because he knows he's part of the problem and he doesn't have a clue how to fix it. We don't need a president who has stated that he's weak on economic issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He gives up when the going gets tough ? his campaign is leaving Michigan because he feels it's a lost cause to win. Is that how he'll handle the country, give up when things don't go his way? We need someone who will hang in there and fight for lost jobs and health care and give us back the American dream.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I pledge myself to pray daily for God's blessings of courage, discernment, integrity and protection upon Barack Obama through the duration of this election campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are inviting those making this pledge to send their names to a dedicated email address, prayforobama@comcast.net We will then be passing those names on to Obama on a weekly basis. We are also encouraging those making the pledge to spread the news of this effort to other persons of faith.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the upcoming election, I've been doing my own snooping on the issues, especially drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I'd heard that the installation of a pump would harm the population of the porcupine caribou, which worried me greatly. I'd also heard that it would be destroying thousands and thousands of acres of Alaskan scenery. As someone who's actively involved in preserving the environment, this did not sit well with me, and so I ventured into this political issue dubiously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Indiana's 2nd congressional district, the man running for Congress against Joe Donnelly, D-Granger, is Republican Luke Puckett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Puckett recently took a trip to Alaska to visit the site where oil companies want to put in the second pump. What I learned was that the porcupine caribou population has actually increased fivefold since the installation of the first pump in Prudhoe Bay. In fact, ANWR's Web site, www.ANWR.org, has video and pictures of the caribou sleeping beside the pump!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The area that the drilling would occupy is 2,000 acres (about the size of the University of Notre Dame campus) out of approximately 19 million acres of nature preserve; seems pretty small to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Come on, guys. I love the environment as much as anyone, but we need oil.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there has ever been a time to throw out our public officials, that time has just arrived. The first two candidates must be House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. These two leaders(?) of Congress publicly admitted that they had no idea what to do about the financial crisis and left for home, while drawing large salaries for their incompetence. They have taken their constitutional obligation to guard our Treasury and given it to unelected officials in the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is neither federal nor does it have any reserves except the income tax it takes from taxpayers. What they have done is treason. After we oust them, we can begin trying the people who got us into this mess, including Barney Frank, D-Mass., and a whole host of Clintonistas who started this train wreck during the Clinton administration. What Americans need to learn is that we have been had by the world bankers who have slammed the trapdoor on uninformed taxpayers. Remember in November don't vote for any incumbent. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After reading an article in The Tribune about the Democrats' plan for oil drilling, I've come to the conclusion that the Democrats care nothing about us. Their plan for drilling for oil is the dumbest thing I've even heard of. I doubt if the oil companies are willing to invest that much money where they may or may not strike oil. Some 90 percent of the oil is still off-limits. If the Democrats were really serious about helping us and creating thousands of jobs, they would allow drilling in Alaska and closer to shore. I've heard people talk about wind and solar energy for years. Well, this is America and Americans can do anything, just get those politicians out of the way. What we have is a government for the politicians, by the politicians. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St. Joseph County voters have an opportunity to shape the future of the South Bend Community School Corp. I encourage you to cast your vote for Ann Rosen for the board of trustees and help our public schools become centers of excellence. Rosen has clearly articulated a core set of beliefs, most especially that all children deserve an excellent education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She understands the importance of collaboration, negotiation, partnerships, always putting the best interests of children and families first. Rosen's professional life has been focused on listening and learning, on finding out what works best and then figuring out how to make it work in our community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rosen ran for school board in 2004 because she recognized the opportunity to share her knowledge of best practices in education, community needs and program development. Her thoughtful and calm leadership has helped to keep the school board responsive and willing to make hard choices, keeping in clear view the complex needs of children, families and school personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Re-electing Ann Rosen sends the message that you understand the importance of leaders who listen so that they can learn, learn so that they can teach and teach so that they can offer a more hopeful future for all of us.</SPAN></P>

This describes the most recent ad for Gov. Mitch Daniels. Before you believe this ad, among others, do your research. Talk to some school administrators about funding and progress for schools, and look to see if more kids are graduating from high school. Talk to people in local government about funding for your local government services such as the health department, fire and police. Talk to senior citizens, needy people and people with disabilities who need food stamps and Medicaid who have been cut off benefits without understanding why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Try to figure out why a foreign company is better equipped to make money from the Indiana Toll Road than we are - either the state will lose out or the people who use the road will lose out in the end. Talk to one of many newly unemployed residents and find out how difficult it was to collect their unemployment. Watch the debates!

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Money: Reduce the cost of busing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Introduce problem-based learning with the New Tech High School program. Such a model helps non-native-English speakers, and supports vocational education; such experiential learning is effective at all grades from kindergarten to high school.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attention Social Security recipients and future recipients: George W. Bush and now John McCain support the idea of channeling the Social Security funds into &quot;personal accounts&quot; that individuals would invest on Wall Street. Some of that money would be entrusted into firms that failed, such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. Imagine what this crisis would be like if Americans' Social Security benefits were evaporating along with their housing values and their 401K accounts. This is the man who's going to reform the economy?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critical issues </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many voters correctly point out that there are several truly important issues to consider when trying to decide who to vote for. Immigration issues, health insurance, the economy, unjust wars, etc., certainly fall into this category. But all these concerns, of their very nature, contain various shades of gray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thoughtful people can honestly differ on how to approach these problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are other issues though, by their very nature, which are always wrong. Some very relevant examples would be abortion on demand and so-called same-sex marriage. These practices are always abominations and are never, ever, allowed, no matter what any human laws might try to pretend to say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It follows, naturally, that no human being could ever vote for any politician who formally, publicly and profoundly supports such intrinsically evil causes.</SPAN></P>

If you want to connect a politician to real terrorist ties, check out the Bush family and their longtime association with the bin Laden family. Yes, it's the same bin Laden family whose member attacked us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John McCain wants the focus off the economy because he knows he's part of the problem and he doesn't have a clue how to fix it. We don't need a president who has stated that he's weak on economic issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He gives up when the going gets tough ? his campaign is leaving Michigan because he feels it's a lost cause to win. Is that how he'll handle the country, give up when things don't go his way? We need someone who will hang in there and fight for lost jobs and health care and give us back the American dream.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have said they're confident McCain will win Indiana, while the Obama campaign insists the state and its 11 electoral votes are in play.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial in the Sept. 25 Tribune titled &quot;Four Winds' big payout to units overdue&quot; begs a question. It seems the Four Winds Casino in New Buffalo owes the state of Michigan, the county of Berrien, the township of New Buffalo and the city of New Buffalo nearly $20 million and has owed these revenue sharing tax payments from December 2007. The state of Michigan has threatened to sue Four Winds but to date has not. Any other business that openly defied the payment of revenue sharing taxes to the state would rightfully be closed down. What is stopping Gov. Jennifer Granholm from sending 100 Michigan State Police to the Four Winds Casino, emptying out the building and putting a logger's chain and lock on the door? Bet you this issue would be resolved in about 13 minutes, maybe less. Then I would make the Four Winds pay for the extra state police manpower to accomplish this goal. Next time the Four Winds Casino might think twice about deciding to withhold revenue sharing taxes to the state of Michigan. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I regret to see some more recreational vehicle facilities being closed in the Elkhart area. I wonder if there is a way to use these facilities, for example, for public projects or to manufacture items. Some light manufacturing products, say widgets or items such as solar cells or components for windmills, or perhaps raising agricultural products such as mushrooms or hydroponic gardens could take the place there. I am sure somebody out there is smart enough to initiate business. I am sure people will have super ideas for using these facilities and the labor force. In the beginning, wages might not be much more than unemployment compensation. We could use volunteer retired managers who are familiar with the manufacturing methods and good business principles. As an engineer and manager, I would be willing to donate my time to help Elkhart County's economic stability. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Well, I saw in the Sept. 14 Tribune that oil prices were all the way down from a high of $147 a barrel a few months ago to $101 a barrel. The only problem is that gasoline prices still hovered at the $4-a-gallon mark. Gasoline prices only moved pennies. Has corporate America and the Big Oil industry found yet another way to rip off and to cheat Americans at the gas pump? I say until Big Oil proves it can be trusted, nationalize the U.S. oil industry. Venezuela nationalized its oil industry and gasoline there is 12 cents a gallon. Last year, House Resolution 1252, price-gouging legislation, passed in the House of Representatives with a 284-121 margin. But the Big Oil industry doesn't have a worry; its best friend, George W. Bush said if 1252 comes on his desk, he will veto it. So much for promoting the general welfare of the people. </SPAN></P>

Do you remember how things started to go further downhill after the 2004 election? If you look at the big picture, what do you hope for? I would like to think that we are able to elect someone who will be a good steward of their office and try to solve some of the real problems that are facing us now. If you review what Sen. John McCain represented during his first campaign and the road that he is on now, do you see anything that resembles the original candidate? His wife, Cindy McCain, is an heiress to vast amounts of money and was reluctant to disclose her financial statements. Maybe there are so many tax breaks in her report that it would contradict what McCain claims he wants to change. Sarah Palin's position in Alaska as governor says many unspoken words about Big Oil.  A pit bull with lipstick won't be able to heal some of the wounds that have been created with our international relations these last eight years. This may have been a funny statement, but unfortunately these are not times that are very lighthearted. We need to look for the real solution to our economic problems. Please don't let the same group do the same things. Eight years is enough. </SPAN></P>

They use any means to win, such as misrepresenting facts or using silly issues like their false umbrage over &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; to draw attention away from the real issues important to American voters. Once elected, they can't effectively run the country. They failed to protect us from the 9/11 attack even though they had information that said Osama bin Laden was determined to strike. They presided over the Enron debacle and the meltdown of the mortgage industry that has resulted in bank failures and a huge taxpayer bailout. They failed to handle the emergency caused by Hurricane Katrina. They rushed to war in Iraq based on misinformation and without adequate planning. They had no exit strategy and we have been stuck in Iraq for nearly six years spending billions of dollars that our country needed for education, infrastructure and decent health care. They have given us rising unemployment and the largest deficit in our nation's history. We can't afford four more years of Republican mismanagement. We need to elect Barack Obama. Nancy K.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial in the Sept. 25 Tribune titled &quot;Four Winds' big payout to units overdue&quot; begs a question. It seems the Four Winds Casino in New Buffalo owes the state of Michigan, the county of Berrien, the township of New Buffalo and the city of New Buffalo nearly $20 million and has owed these revenue sharing tax payments from December 2007. The state of Michigan has threatened to sue Four Winds but to date has not. Any other business that openly defied the payment of revenue sharing taxes to the state would rightfully be closed down. What is stopping Gov. Jennifer Granholm from sending 100 Michigan State Police to the Four Winds Casino, emptying out the building and putting a logger's chain and lock on the door? Bet you this issue would be resolved in about 13 minutes, maybe less. Then I would make the Four Winds pay for the extra state police manpower to accomplish this goal. Next time the Four Winds Casino might think twice about deciding to withhold revenue sharing taxes to the state of Michigan. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I regret to see some more recreational vehicle facilities being closed in the Elkhart area. I wonder if there is a way to use these facilities, for example, for public projects or to manufacture items. Some light manufacturing products, say widgets or items such as solar cells or components for windmills, or perhaps raising agricultural products such as mushrooms or hydroponic gardens could take the place there. I am sure somebody out there is smart enough to initiate business. I am sure people will have super ideas for using these facilities and the labor force. In the beginning, wages might not be much more than unemployment compensation. We could use volunteer retired managers who are familiar with the manufacturing methods and good business principles. As an engineer and manager, I would be willing to donate my time to help Elkhart County's economic stability. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Well, I saw in the Sept. 14 Tribune that oil prices were all the way down from a high of $147 a barrel a few months ago to $101 a barrel. The only problem is that gasoline prices still hovered at the $4-a-gallon mark. Gasoline prices only moved pennies. Has corporate America and the Big Oil industry found yet another way to rip off and to cheat Americans at the gas pump? I say until Big Oil proves it can be trusted, nationalize the U.S. oil industry. Venezuela nationalized its oil industry and gasoline there is 12 cents a gallon. Last year, House Resolution 1252, price-gouging legislation, passed in the House of Representatives with a 284-121 margin. But the Big Oil industry doesn't have a worry; its best friend, George W. Bush said if 1252 comes on his desk, he will veto it. So much for promoting the general welfare of the people. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Representatives of the city of South Bend, the Center for History, the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers, Rose Brick and Materials and the local Oliver chapter of the Hart-Parr Oliver Collectors Association were in attendance along with many other people. Evidently coverage of events honoring local history are of little or no importance to most of the local media, as only WNDU bothered to cover the event.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please do not be caught up in the illusion that is being presented once more by the Republican Party. Do you remember how things started to go further downhill after the 2004 election? If you look at the big picture, what do you hope for? I would like to think that we are able to elect someone who will be a good steward of their office and try to solve some of the real problems that are facing us now. If you review what Sen. John McCain represented during his first campaign and the road that he is on now, do you see anything that resembles the original candidate? His wife, Cindy McCain, is an heiress to vast amounts of money and was reluctant to disclose her financial statements. Maybe there are so many tax breaks in her report that it would contradict what McCain claims he wants to change. Sarah Palin's position in Alaska as governor says many unspoken words about Big Oil.  A pit bull with lipstick won't be able to heal some of the wounds that have been created with our international relations these last eight years. This may have been a funny statement, but unfortunately these are not times that are very lighthearted. We need to look for the real solution to our economic problems. Please don't let the same group do the same things. Eight years is enough. </SPAN></P>

They use any means to win, such as misrepresenting facts or using silly issues like their false umbrage over &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; to draw attention away from the real issues important to American voters. Once elected, they can't effectively run the country. They failed to protect us from the 9/11 attack even though they had information that said Osama bin Laden was determined to strike. They presided over the Enron debacle and the meltdown of the mortgage industry that has resulted in bank failures and a huge taxpayer bailout. They failed to handle the emergency caused by Hurricane Katrina. They rushed to war in Iraq based on misinformation and without adequate planning. They had no exit strategy and we have been stuck in Iraq for nearly six years spending billions of dollars that our country needed for education, infrastructure and decent health care. They have given us rising unemployment and the largest deficit in our nation's history. We can't afford four more years of Republican mismanagement. We need to elect Barack Obama. Nancy K.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee has started running TV commercials in Indiana supporting John McCain the most visible GOP response to Democrat Barack Obama's push to turn this traditionally red state blue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats said the ads, coming five weeks before the election, are proof that Republicans finally realize Indiana may be up for grabs, as some recent polls suggest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They believe John McCain is in trouble in this state,&quot; said Jonathan Swain, Obama's communications director for Indiana. &quot;This isn't a state that they feel is solidly in their column right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have been confident that McCain would win Indiana, but say it was simply time to respond to Obama's efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't let millions and millions of dollars of negative ads go unanswered,&quot; said Luke Messer, co-chairman for McCain's Indiana campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RNC's independent expenditure unit started airing the ads Tuesday in all major Indiana television markets except the Louisville, Ky., area, said Brad Todd, a spokesman for the unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads, titled &quot;Worse,&quot; focus on the country's economic crisis and are also running in the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia. The ads will run initially for eight days and will cost $5 million to air in six states, Todd said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's campaign spent about $6 million on TV commercials in Indiana leading up to the May primary, and has run at least $1.5 million in television ads since June. Obama has made five stops in the state since mid-July and the campaign has set up more than 30 offices around the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain hasn't visited the state since July 1 and the campaign has no field offices, relying on state- and county-level organizations to build support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three polls conducted in September showed either a tight race between Obama and McCain, or McCain slightly ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swain said Obama is doing something new to many Indiana residents actively competing for Hoosier votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barack Obama was committed to Indiana from the beginning,&quot; Swain said. &quot;Meanwhile, Republicans have really taken this state for granted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans say Indiana voters' values are more in line with McCain's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to work hard and take nothing for granted,&quot; Messer said. &quot;We've got to earn the vote of every Hoosier in the state, and that's what we intend to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP has history on its side. Indiana, which carries 11 electoral votes, last went Democratic in the 1964 Lyndon Johnson landslide. George W. Bush won with 60 percent in 2004 and 57 percent in 2000.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This type of propaganda has torn this country apart. It can only be viewed as hatred and a willingness to do anything to degrade the entire political process. It brings our country to be viewed internationally as having the firm beginnings of a morally impaired society, whose contact with reality, dignity and decency are no longer valued with too many of its citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are no moral, family, Christian or any other values in the right wing politics of the last 30 years.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have never been very good at math and so I have been wondering why the South Bend Redevelopment Commission would wish to approve a plan to develop condominiums on the former Rink Riverside site at Colfax Avenue and Sycamore Street, sell the land to Place Builders Inc. for $150,000, help with cleanup and tree removal along the riverbank and allow for a five-year tax abatement for condo residents as reported by The Tribune (Sept. 6). The math I cannot figure out is selling the property for $150,000 when the land appraised at $337,500 in 2005 and the Redevelopment Commission bought the land from Thomas Brademas Jr. for $437,000 in 2004. Does that mean the commission will lose $287,000? Should there be an appraisal in 2008 for the land? Also, with a five-year tax abatement does that mean the city will get no tax revenue from the project for five years? I just was wondering why.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three years ago, my autistic son was severely depressed. I called upon Maura and Charlie Weis for support. My son is a huge University of Notre Dame fan. I am an alumna; his grandfather was an English professor. Charlie took the time to boost the morale of a lost young man, caught between two worlds. My son is so high functioning, he longed to be a normal honor student. That crisp autumn day, face to face with Coach Weis, my son lost all his disabilities and was amazed by his mentor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.The upcoming historical presidential election has its fate in the ladies' hands to elect a woman as vice president, the second highest governmental position in the USA.

This would be, to the women of the USA, their finest hour. Ed Balla South Bend Resolve My father fought in the South Pacific during World War II. He was a devoted Republican. He loved this country. Seven months before he died at age 88, he said he would never vote for Bush again. I thought that resolve was wasted because Bush was already in his second term. I was wrong. Bush is running again, in the form of John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I wonder what my father would think about the man who speaks about change but takes advice from Karl Rove, the Bush administration's architect, to help him win at all costs; who pushes for continued dependence on fossil fuels; who favors economic policies that privilege a small wealthy minority at the expense of the vast majority of Americans; who proposes a health care plan that falls far short of being of any real help to middle- and low-income families; and who chooses a running mate who is ignorant of the serious national and international issues facing our country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next time you look at your children and grandchildren, thank Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the Bush administration and the Republicans and Democrats for their gift to the financial industry and debt to our future of more than $1 trillion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The next generation isn't even out of diapers yet and already they are behind the eight ball and burdened with a debt they may not be able to repay. There is no American dream on the horizon for our young ones at this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a shame what this country is doing to our future. The mismanagement of this country continues to dig us deeper and deeper into a virtual hell for our children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sooner or later the American people will have had enough and speak out against our government - hopefully it's this November! </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why would anyone allow the racist distortions and outright lies to be printed in an ad in the Sept. 19 Tribune? Don't the folks at The Tribune have some discretion as to what they will and won't accept?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This type of propaganda has torn this country apart. It can only be viewed as hatred and a willingness to do anything to degrade the entire political process. It brings our country to be viewed internationally as having the firm beginnings of a morally impaired society, whose contact with reality, dignity and decency are no longer valued with too many of its citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are no moral, family, Christian or any other values in the right wing politics of the last 30 years. Only the most socially irresponsible media campaign devised since pre-war Germany could have brought this country to this point and time with so much economic and political damage. God save us!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Do the math </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have never been very good at math and so I have been wondering why the South Bend Redevelopment Commission would wish to approve a plan to develop condominiums on the former Rink Riverside site at Colfax Avenue and Sycamore Street, sell the land to Place Builders Inc. for $150,000, help with cleanup and tree removal along the riverbank and allow for a five-year tax abatement for condo residents as reported by The Tribune (Sept. 6). The math I cannot figure out is selling the property for $150,000 when the land appraised at $337,500 in 2005 and the Redevelopment Commission bought the land from Thomas Brademas Jr. for $437,000 in 2004. Does that mean the commission will lose $287,000? Should there be an appraisal in 2008 for the land? Also, with a five-year tax abatement does that mean the city will get no tax revenue from the project for five years? I just was wondering why.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right leader </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three years ago, my autistic son was severely depressed. I called upon Maura and Charlie Weis for support. My son is a huge University of Notre Dame fan. I am an alumna; his grandfather was an English professor. Charlie took the time to boost the morale of a lost young man, caught between two worlds. My son is so high functioning, he longed to be a normal honor student. That crisp autumn day, face to face with Coach Weis, my son lost all his disabilities and was amazed by his mentor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The true spirit of the Irish is in helping those who cannot help themselves. I believe ND chose the right coach to lead the Irish. It is not always about football. It is about compassion, and making the world a better place. That is what the Weises are doing. They are building a home for our unsung challenged souls, who cannot survive on their own. Their daughter, Hannah, is their inspiration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When you paint your body blue and green or wear the Golden Dome helmet, you are celebrating the spirit of a grander picture. My education from Notre Dame was the foundation to deal with what I thought was a tragedy. My son is a blessing. I am honored God chose me, to help raise his angel. I did win overall.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am supporting Barack Obama because he absolutely espouses all my beliefs regarding my country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His foreign policies match my own and I am so very impressed with his judgment and wisdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fact that he chose Sen. Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate also tells me he will surround himself with people of intelligence and experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a former secondary teacher, I also support his views of the importance of ensuring for our children the best possible education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am also impressed with the number of great Americans who support Obama.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vote </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.The upcoming historical presidential election has its fate in the ladies' hands to elect a woman as vice president, the second highest governmental position in the USA. Regardless of political party affiliation or prejudice, every woman should realize that this occasion is their golden hour of opportunity to act united and support Sarah Palin with their vote. This would be, to the women of the USA, their finest hour. Ed Balla South Bend Resolve My father fought in the South Pacific during World War II. He was a devoted Republican. He loved this country. Seven months before he died at age 88, he said he would never vote for Bush again. I thought that resolve was wasted because Bush was already in his second term. I was wrong. Bush is running again, in the form of John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I wonder what my father would think about the man who speaks about change but takes advice from Karl Rove, the Bush administration's architect, to help him win at all costs; who pushes for continued dependence on fossil fuels; who favors economic policies that privilege a small wealthy minority at the expense of the vast majority of Americans; who proposes a health care plan that falls far short of being of any real help to middle- and low-income families; and who chooses a running mate who is ignorant of the serious national and international issues facing our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I hope my father would have stuck to his resolve and not put another Bush in the White House. I hope he would have voted for Barack Obama, the only real voice for change.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In my 91st year, I find it imperative that I send my feelings to The Tribune. What George Bush and Dick Cheney have done to our country is incredible. Their undeclared war and their lack of understanding of Social Security and health care is beyond belief. It is time for change. The McCain-Palin ticket is the same old story. In Indiana, Gov. Mitch Daniels messed up our time and leased our Toll Road to a foreign country. It is time to elect my friend Jill Long Thompson and bring our state back to prominence as it was under Gov. Evan Bayh.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news media have been shamefully stoking the idea that the only way Barack Obama could possibly lose the presidential election is if American racists have their way. Indeed, the fact that Obama isn't leading in polls by a wide margin &quot;doesn't make sense ... unless it's race,&quot; says CNN's Jack Cafferty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Slate's Jacob Weisberg says Obama is losing among older white voters because of the &quot;color of his skin.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many journalists are so committed to the racism-explains-everything line they are labeling any effective anti-Obama&nbsp;ad as an attempt by John McCain to &quot;viciously exacerbate&quot; America's &quot;race-fueled angst,&quot; in the words of one New York magazine writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, a McCain&nbsp;ad noted that Franklin Raines, the Clinton-appointed former head of Fannie Mae who helped bring about the current Wall Street meltdown, advised the Obama campaign. Time's Karen Tumulty gasped that because Raines is black, McCain is playing the race card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why, she wants to know, didn't McCain attack Obama's even stronger ties to the even more culpable former Fannie Mae chairman, Jim Johnson, who had to resign from Obama's vice presidential search team because of his sketchy dealings with mortgage giant Countrywide Financial? &quot;One reason might be that Johnson is white; Raines is black,&quot; Tumulty suggests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Or another reason might be that the McCain campaign was saving that attack for its next ad, which is what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to critics, McCain's &quot;celebrity&quot; ads featuring Paris Hilton and Britney Spears were nothing but tawdry race-baiting because they subliminally played on white America's fear of black men violating the delicate flowers of white American womanhood. You'd think a cognitive warning bell would have gone off the moment anyone started suggesting that Paris Hilton and Britney Spears are icons of chastity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This spectacle is grotesque. It reveals how little the supposedly objective press corps thinks of the American people - and how highly they think of themselves ... and Obama. Obama's lack of experience, his doctrinaire liberalism, his record, his known associations with Weatherman radical William Ayers and the hate-mongering Rev. Jeremiah Wright: These cannot possibly be legitimate motivations to vote against Obama, in this view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, McCain's experience, his record of bipartisanship, his heroism: These too count for nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Racism is all there is. Obama wins, and America sheds its racial past. Obama loses, and we're a nation of &quot;Bull&quot; Connors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much of the argument for the centrality of race in this election hinges on the so-called Bradley effect. In 1982, Tom Bradley, Los Angeles' black mayor, was polling well among white voters in the race for California governor. Bradley lost, suggesting that large numbers of whites had lied to pollsters about their intention to vote for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have no doubt that the Bradley effect is real. But the Bradley effect does not reflect racism; it captures voters' fear of appearing racist. There's no reason to assume those who lie to pollsters are racists. But for Obama supporters and the media, poll results are some kind of sacred, binding covenant. If voters don't keep their promise, the media have no problem seeing racism at work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The media's obsession with race in this election is probably fueling the Bradley effect. Repeating over and over that voting against Obama is racist only makes non-racist people embarrassed to admit that they plan to vote for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another rich irony is that the only racists who matter in this election are the ones in the Democratic Party. News flash: Republicans aren't voting for the Democratic nominee because they're Republicans. A new AP-Yahoo News poll claims that racial prejudice is a significant factor among the independents and Democrats Obama needs to win, specifically among Hillary Clinton's primary voters. According to the pollsters' statistical modeling, support for Obama may be as much as 6 percentage points lower than it would be if there were no white racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I'm skeptical about those findings, as well as the overemphasis on race generally. But to the extent that race is a factor, here's the richest irony of all: Obama's problem is with precisely those voters the Democratic Party claims to fight for, working- and middle-class white folks. Of course, Democrats can't openly complain that their own vital constituency is racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the media were more objective, we'd be hearing a lot more about the racism at the heart of the Democratic Party. (Imagine if the black nominee this year were a Republican!) But such objectivity would cause too much cognitive dissonance for a press corps that defines &quot;racist&quot; as shorthand for Republican and sees itself as the publicity arm of the Obama campaign.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDIANAPOLIS </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats typically skip right over reliably Republican Indiana when plotting presidential campaign strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidate from next-door Illinois is bidding to flip the state into the Democratic column this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To that end, he is doing what no presidential candidate has done in decades spending significant amounts of money and time in the state, while Republican John McCain maintains a low profile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama narrowly lost the May primary here to Hillary Rodham Clinton. And in the process, he had &quot;the opportunity to at least define himself with Hoosier voters and that has lingered,&quot; said Kip Tew, a former state Democratic chairman who is a volunteer adviser to the Obama campaign. &quot;They competed with a ground game that no one's ever seen in the state.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indiana, with 11 electoral votes, is one of only a handful of states where Obama's advertising has been unanswered by McCain. The Democrat has 32 offices across the state and dozens of paid staffers. His campaign spent about $6 million on television advertising in Indiana leading up to the May primary and has aired at least $1.5 million in TV ads since June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has made five stops in the state since mid-July, and running mate Joe Biden was returning to the state Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McCain campaign, by contrast, is nearly invisible. It has no field offices or paid staffers working full-time in the state, and McCain hasn't visited the state since July 1. Republicans were expected to respond to Obama's&nbsp;ad presence in the state with ads of their own later this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates know history is not on Obama's side: For more than a generation, Indiana has been colored in for the GOP nominee soon after polls start closing. George W. Bush won with 60 percent in 2004 and 57 percent in 2000, and the state last went Democratic in the 1964 Lyndon Johnson landslide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Jessie Bochert, 45, who runs a business preparing houses for sale from her home in Granger, shows why Obama thinks he may have an opening in the state. Bochert, who voted for Bush in 2000 and 2004, initially supported McCain but switched to Obama and began volunteering for his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel guilty for all that has happened&quot; under Bush, she said. &quot;There are so many people I talk to, they can't afford their prescriptions, they don't know what to pay, they can't afford anything. It's really the economy, and that's what it's coming down to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Tim Surber said he believes McCain appeals to Indiana voters because of his military background and his push for more offshore oil drilling. Surber, 49, who runs a computer consulting office in Indianapolis, thinks McCain got a big boost among Indiana conservatives when he chose Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, he worries about the McCain campaign's low-key approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know they feel like it's a state they're going to win,&quot; he said. &quot;I really wish Palin would come in, I wish McCain would come in. ... They need to at least let us know that they know we're out here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public polls taken this month show the two candidates running about even or McCain slightly ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans say the numbers reflect the state's conservative-leaning voters and validate their approach, which involves working through state and county-level organizations to build support for McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the millions of dollars and months of staff time that Senator Obama has spent here, you question whether or not he ought to be doing a little better,&quot; said Luke Messer, the co-chairman of McCain's Indiana campaign and a former state GOP executive director. &quot;They were polling in May at 43, 44 percent and that's essentially where they remain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Democrats are buoyed by how close the race is. They note that three incumbent Republican congressmen lost re-election bids two years ago, and say the state's struggling economy makes voters more receptive to Obama. The state's unemployment rate hit 6.4 percent in August, up nearly 2 percentage points from a year earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An increase of more than 425,000 new voter registrations since the 2006 election, and Obama's name recognition in northwestern Indiana, a heavily Democratic area where more than 10 percent of the state's voters see Chicago TV stations, also could help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to win Indiana, Obama also must consolidate the support of Democrats in rural areas and the blue-collar factory towns that strongly backed Clinton in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Messer, the McCain campaign's state leader, said Obama faces an uphill fight in many parts of the state where Republicans are well organized. Several Obama campaign offices are in counties where most Republicans are unopposed in local races on the election ballot. No Democrat other than Sen. Evan Bayh has won a statewide race since 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're more interested in winning an election than putting on a show,&quot; Messer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tew, the Obama adviser, said it would take a significant strategy shift for McCain to more actively campaign in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they start to compete in Indiana then it's an admission that there's another state in play that they didn't think was ever going to be in play,&quot; Tew said. &quot;If they don't compete in Indiana, then they're in danger of losing it. So they're in a box.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The TV ad claiming that Barack Obama pushed &quot;comprehensive sex education&quot; upon kindergartners in Illinois has three things in common with a pamphlet mailed a dozen years ago in Indiana. The 1996 mailing denounced &quot;Congressman Tim Roemer's Sex Survey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both sought to frighten and anger voters about foisting inappropriate sex topics on kids. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both contained false allegations linked only by a thread to anything factual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both came in campaigns involving Steve Schmidt, now key adviser for John McCain's more aggressive campaign style. Back in '96, Schmidt was the aggressive young campaign manager for Roemer's Republican opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those similarities are cited in blogs, some quoting from articles I wrote about the race between Roemer, a South Bend Democrat seeking re-election in 1996, and Republican challenger Joe Zakas, then and now a state senator from Granger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The blogs suggest that Schmidt, now 37 and at the presidential campaign level, first practiced nasty attacks back in that Indiana congressional campaign. They also note that he is a Karl Rove prot&eacute;g&eacute;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's no surprise that Schmidt went on to bigger things. He came across during the congressional campaign as personable and knowledgeable and enthused about politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While it's unlikely that Schmidt personally designed either effort to sell sex as an issue, he has defended both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tactic didn't work against Roemer but perhaps has worked along with other attacks to take Obama off message and down in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain's 30-second TV ad features a narrator asking: &quot;Learning about sex before learning to read?&quot; The ad claims Obama favored just that as an Illinois state legislator with a &quot;comprehensive sex education bill&quot; that was his &quot;one accomplishment&quot; in the field of education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bill referred to certainly wasn't an Obama &quot;accomplishment.&quot; It never passed. Never even came to a vote in the Illinois Senate. Obama didn't sponsor it. And it didn't call for &quot;comprehensive sex education&quot; for kindergartners but rather some warnings about inappropriate approaches of pedophiles. Just a few flaws in the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A thread to reality is that Obama did vote for the bill in committee. The measure, backed by various education, medical and parent groups, was aimed at modifying sex education teaching in Illinois. It was dropped because of difficulty in achieving consensus on the sensitive topic, not due to teaching comprehensive sex before reading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But effectiveness of campaign ads isn't measured by whether fact-checkers promoting truth in campaigning find them misleading or even flat-out lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And this attack on Obama, along with others, including the suggestion that he called Sarah Palin a pig, put Obama on the defensive, took him off his message that had been working and helped McCain catch up in the polls and, for a time at least, to go ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, the '96 mailing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zakas campaign mailed 62,000 pamphlets suggesting that they were &quot;Congressman Tim Roemer's Sex Survey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Questions supposedly for adolescents were asked in explicit and offensive language and dealt with whether the person &quot;surveyed&quot; had engaged in various sex acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The survey wasn't Roemer's. He didn't send it, approve it, sponsor it or vote for it. No such survey like it was conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The thread to reality? There was a bipartisan House vote for funding a survey on health of teens and pre-teens, with Roemer among those voting for it. The survey amendment, however, prohibited the National Institutes of Health from asking questions on sexual behavior unless approved by an ethics review board and peer review board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roemer chose not to hit back with negative TV spots. He basically ignored the attack and went on with his campaign as planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Schmidt, who acknowledged that the mailing was strongly worded, said then that it was designed in part to create &quot;some controversy in the final week&quot; and force Roemer to engage Zakas directly in campaign give-and-take, in effect to get Roemer off message and into controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Schmidt said Roemer was taking a risk in not hitting back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roemer took that calculated risk. He won big over Zakas, an honorable and respected state legislator, who lamented after the campaign that he had not seen the final version of the &quot;sex survey&quot; in time to tone it down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roemer could ignore what Obama can't. Roemer was well ahead. Obama isn't. Roemer had become well known and respected in his district. Voters weren't going to believe that was his survey. Many voters still have questions about Obama and what he stands for. Some might actually think he stands for endangering kindergartners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Questions supposedly for adolescents were asked in explicit and offensive language and dealt with whether the person &quot;surveyed&quot; had engaged in various sex acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The survey wasn't Roemer's. He didn't send it, approve it, sponsor it or vote for it. No such survey like it was conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The thread to reality? There was a bipartisan House vote for funding a survey on health of teens and pre-teens, with Roemer among those voting for it. The survey amendment, however, prohibited the National Institutes of Health from asking questions on sexual behavior unless approved by an ethics review board and peer review board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roemer chose not to hit back with negative TV spots. He basically ignored the attack and went on with his campaign as planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Schmidt, who acknowledged that the mailing was strongly worded, said then that it was designed in part to create &quot;some controversy in the final week&quot; and force Roemer to engage Zakas directly in campaign give-and-take, in effect to get Roemer off message and into controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Schmidt said Roemer was taking a risk in not hitting back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roemer took that calculated risk. He won big over Zakas, an honorable and respected state legislator, who lamented after the campaign that he had not seen the final version of the &quot;sex survey&quot; in time to tone it down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roemer could ignore what Obama can't. Roemer was well ahead. Obama isn't. Roemer had become well known and respected in his district. Voters weren't going to believe that was his survey. Many voters still have questions about Obama and what he stands for. Some might actually think he stands for endangering kindergartners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Contrast that with Obama's lament that more Americans own cars &quot;you can't afford to drive&quot; and &quot;credit card bills you can't afford to pay.&quot; He concedes that these problems &quot;are not all of government's making&quot; and then proceeds to explain why they are all largely the government's responsibility to solve.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1586 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sep. 15--Rising energy prices are hurting Hoosiers today, but the federal response to that pain could bring new opportunities to the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their presidential campaigns, Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama embrace a similar goal: reducing or eliminating U.S. reliance on imported energy. Some of their strategies for reaching that goal have much in common.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whichever man wins the November election, big changes and promising opportunities are likely coming for the state. Both candidates advocate increasing solar and wind power. Both emphasize conservation, including more efficient new buildings and extensive building rehabs. Both want the federal government to pitch in on bringing hybrid and full-electric automobiles into production. Both pledge their support to expanding the use of biofuels, including ethanol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's too soon to count on a revamped energy system in the U.S. Both candidates are vague in many crucial points about their plans. But if the new president persuades Congress to follow through on his energy platform, it would bring an unprecedented federal overhaul of the way Americans fuel their transportation and power their homes and businesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rewiring the grid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain both say that modernizing the national grid for transmitting electrical priority is important. McCain would promote improving the grid through reducing regulatory impediments, while Obama includes upgrades for the grid as part of his plan to spend $150 billion over the next 10 years on green-energy development. Obama says the federal government also would pay 25 percent of the cost of grid upgrades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biofuels</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooking ethanol and diesel fuel from corn and soybeans already is big business in the state. Sens. Obama and McCain both say they support continued production of ethanol and biodiesel. In political terms, that means continued tax breaks to subsidize the cost of these fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kent Yeager, director of public policy for Farm Bureau of Indiana, said Obama has a better record of support for corn-based ethanol. In the past, such as his run for the presidency in 2000, McCain has opposed federal subsidies to support the production of ethanol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Biofuels is certainly not the strong point for Sen. McCain. Sen. Obama's record is much stronger. ... We're a little concerned about Sen. McCain's position,&quot; Yeager said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ethanol boom has been a bonanza for farmers here. Both corn and soybean prices hit new records this year -- double to triple the prices seen only two years ago. That's given farmers an infusion of revenue that trumps the higher costs of fuel and fertilizer they must pay as part of cultivating and harvesting crops. Last month, Purdue University reported that prices for farmland have shot up across the state by about a third since 2006. Now the average price of top-quality farmland in the state is $5,000 per acre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethanol from corn isn't necessarily the end of the boom. A second wave of ethanol technology is the focus of concentrated research. If universities and businesses figure out how to make ethanol from &quot;cellulosic&quot; ethanol, a wider range of plant material could be digested and converted into motor fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like so much else about the future of energy, there's no hard schedule for commercially practical cellulosic ethanol to come to market. Dan Lashof, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's Climate Center, says it appears likely that this second generation of ethanol could start appearing within five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solar power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither candidate's energy platform delves deeply into the specifics of how he would encourage the development of solar power. Obama lumps &quot;renewable energy&quot; among a raft of &quot;investments&quot; he would make in research and development, pilot projects, and accelerated commercialization of environmentally sensitive technologies. He also would require that 10 percent of energy come from renewable resources by 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain says he would prime the pump for solar power by making a longer-term commitment to a system of tax credits that businesses and individuals could count on in developing alternative energy. He would continue public support for such technology until it becomes economically competitive with other forms of electrical generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But whichever approach the country follows, building more solar-power equipment would draw on the talents and production of steelmakers, construction crews, electronics engineers and other specialists. Every property owner who purchases or commissions a solar-power system is a potential customer for installation teams that require special expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wind power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this part of the country, wind power is easier than solar power to scale up to the electrical output that makes it worthwhile for electrical utilities. Wind power already has a significant presence in the state. Earlier this year, construction started on a 750-megawatt wind farm in Benton County, on the western edge of Indiana. That's enough to power 200,000 average American homes. The Benton County wind farm will require a staff of about 10 people full time to monitor and maintain the turbines. During construction, about 375 people are employed assembling and raising the wind farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As is the case with solar power, neither candidate is specific about how his administration would stimulate the development of wind power. Under Obama's plan, it would be part of the $150 billion green-economy program, and he would require that 10 percent of U.S. electricity come from renewable sources by 2012. McCain says he would make a longer-term commitment to a system of tax credits that businesses and individuals could count on in developing alternative energy until it's competitive with the cost of other electrical generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building and installing these machines would help keep steelworkers, excavators, truck drivers, machinists and electricians employed. Wind power comes as a boon for rural landowners and communities, too, because property owners get yearly leasing fees from the companies that operate wind farms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're all pretty good at keeping it a big secret,&quot; Justin Schneider, an attorney with Indiana Farm Bureau, said of the Benton County landowners and their payments. But most reports he's heard about the lease payments put the figures at $5,000 to $8,000 per year per turbine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building renovations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates say higher energy efficiency for buildings will be part of their energy programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain says the federal government's 3.3 billion square feet of buildings offer a chance to &quot;lead by example.&quot; He would insist on higher efficiency standards for new constructions and retrofits for energy savings in existing buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama would go much further than McCain in increasing buildings' energy efficiency. He advocates making all new buildings carbon-neutral, or producing no emissions, by 2030. Toward that goal, Obama favors a national goal of a 50 percent increase in efficiency of new buildings and 25 percent increase in existing buildings in the next decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also advocates &quot;weatherizing&quot; a million homes for low-income families every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These commercial and residential building rehabs would employ construction workers, electricians, truck drivers, carpenters, roofers, building inspectors, heavy-equipment operators and construction managers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transportation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both presidential candidates emphasize the importance of developing zero-emissions and high-mileage cars. Indiana companies could play a large part in helping the country retool for smaller, more efficient vehicles, as well as for electric cars, as the rising price of gasoline hobbles American automakers because of their greater dependence on trucks and SUVs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lashof of the Natural Resources Defense Council says that Indiana's many precision-manufacturing companies would be well positioned to thrive in the conversion to a greener auto industry, as well as in an expanding wind-turbine business. The state is &quot;a great location for building components,&quot; Lashof said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama supports a $7,000 tax credit for the purchase of an &quot;advanced technology&quot; vehicle, such as the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt, scheduled to begin production in 2010. He backs an unspecified federal investment in research and development of the technologies needed to support super-efficient vehicles. He also would set a rising fuel-efficiency target, one that would increase 4 percent per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To keep automotive jobs in the U.S. for this new generation of greener cars, Obama would provide $4 billion in tax credits, plus loan guarantees, for auto companies and parts suppliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain advocates a $5,000 tax credit for every purchaser of a zero-emissions car. A more unusual approach to stimulating industrial research is his pledge to award a $300 million prize to the first company to develop a battery suitable for an all-electric car or plug-in hybrid. To be eligible, the new battery would have to deliver power at 30 percent of the cost of current batteries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain says he would toughen the federal government's enforcement of Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sep. 15--Rising energy prices are hurting Hoosiers today, but the federal response to that pain could bring new opportunities to the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their presidential campaigns, Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama embrace a similar goal: reducing or eliminating U.S. reliance on imported energy. Some of their strategies for reaching that goal have much in common.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whichever man wins the November election, big changes and promising opportunities are likely coming for the state. Both candidates advocate increasing solar and wind power. Both emphasize conservation, including more efficient new buildings and extensive building rehabs. Both want the federal government to pitch in on bringing hybrid and full-electric automobiles into production. Both pledge their support to expanding the use of biofuels, including ethanol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's too soon to count on a revamped energy system in the U.S. Both candidates are vague in many crucial points about their plans. But if the new president persuades Congress to follow through on his energy platform, it would bring an unprecedented federal overhaul of the way Americans fuel their transportation and power their homes and businesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rewiring the grid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain both say that modernizing the national grid for transmitting electrical priority is important. McCain would promote improving the grid through reducing regulatory impediments, while Obama includes upgrades for the grid as part of his plan to spend $150 billion over the next 10 years on green-energy development. Obama says the federal government also would pay 25 percent of the cost of grid upgrades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biofuels</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooking ethanol and diesel fuel from corn and soybeans already is big business in the state. Sens. Obama and McCain both say they support continued production of ethanol and biodiesel. In political terms, that means continued tax breaks to subsidize the cost of these fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kent Yeager, director of public policy for Farm Bureau of Indiana, said Obama has a better record of support for corn-based ethanol. In the past, such as his run for the presidency in 2000, McCain has opposed federal subsidies to support the production of ethanol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Biofuels is certainly not the strong point for Sen. McCain. Sen. Obama's record is much stronger. ... We're a little concerned about Sen. McCain's position,&quot; Yeager said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ethanol boom has been a bonanza for farmers here. Both corn and soybean prices hit new records this year -- double to triple the prices seen only two years ago. That's given farmers an infusion of revenue that trumps the higher costs of fuel and fertilizer they must pay as part of cultivating and harvesting crops. Last month, Purdue University reported that prices for farmland have shot up across the state by about a third since 2006. Now the average price of top-quality farmland in the state is $5,000 per acre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethanol from corn isn't necessarily the end of the boom. A second wave of ethanol technology is the focus of concentrated research. If universities and businesses figure out how to make ethanol from &quot;cellulosic&quot; ethanol, a wider range of plant material could be digested and converted into motor fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like so much else about the future of energy, there's no hard schedule for commercially practical cellulosic ethanol to come to market. Dan Lashof, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's Climate Center, says it appears likely that this second generation of ethanol could start appearing within five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solar power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither candidate's energy platform delves deeply into the specifics of how he would encourage the development of solar power. Obama lumps &quot;renewable energy&quot; among a raft of &quot;investments&quot; he would make in research and development, pilot projects, and accelerated commercialization of environmentally sensitive technologies. He also would require that 10 percent of energy come from renewable resources by 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain says he would prime the pump for solar power by making a longer-term commitment to a system of tax credits that businesses and individuals could count on in developing alternative energy. He would continue public support for such technology until it becomes economically competitive with other forms of electrical generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But whichever approach the country follows, building more solar-power equipment would draw on the talents and production of steelmakers, construction crews, electronics engineers and other specialists. Every property owner who purchases or commissions a solar-power system is a potential customer for installation teams that require special expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wind power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this part of the country, wind power is easier than solar power to scale up to the electrical output that makes it worthwhile for electrical utilities. Wind power already has a significant presence in the state. Earlier this year, construction started on a 750-megawatt wind farm in Benton County, on the western edge of Indiana. That's enough to power 200,000 average American homes. The Benton County wind farm will require a staff of about 10 people full time to monitor and maintain the turbines. During construction, about 375 people are employed assembling and raising the wind farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As is the case with solar power, neither candidate is specific about how his administration would stimulate the development of wind power. Under Obama's plan, it would be part of the $150 billion green-economy program, and he would require that 10 percent of U.S. electricity come from renewable sources by 2012. McCain says he would make a longer-term commitment to a system of tax credits that businesses and individuals could count on in developing alternative energy until it's competitive with the cost of other electrical generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building and installing these machines would help keep steelworkers, excavators, truck drivers, machinists and electricians employed. Wind power comes as a boon for rural landowners and communities, too, because property owners get yearly leasing fees from the companies that operate wind farms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're all pretty good at keeping it a big secret,&quot; Justin Schneider, an attorney with Indiana Farm Bureau, said of the Benton County landowners and their payments. But most reports he's heard about the lease payments put the figures at $5,000 to $8,000 per year per turbine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building renovations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both candidates say higher energy efficiency for buildings will be part of their energy programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain says the federal government's 3.3 billion square feet of buildings offer a chance to &quot;lead by example.&quot; He would insist on higher efficiency standards for new constructions and retrofits for energy savings in existing buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama would go much further than McCain in increasing buildings' energy efficiency. He advocates making all new buildings carbon-neutral, or producing no emissions, by 2030. Toward that goal, Obama favors a national goal of a 50 percent increase in efficiency of new buildings and 25 percent increase in existing buildings in the next decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also advocates &quot;weatherizing&quot; a million homes for low-income families every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These commercial and residential building rehabs would employ construction workers, electricians, truck drivers, carpenters, roofers, building inspectors, heavy-equipment operators and construction managers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transportation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both presidential candidates emphasize the importance of developing zero-emissions and high-mileage cars. Indiana companies could play a large part in helping the country retool for smaller, more efficient vehicles, as well as for electric cars, as the rising price of gasoline hobbles American automakers because of their greater dependence on trucks and SUVs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lashof of the Natural Resources Defense Council says that Indiana's many precision-manufacturing companies would be well positioned to thrive in the conversion to a greener auto industry, as well as in an expanding wind-turbine business. The state is &quot;a great location for building components,&quot; Lashof said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama supports a $7,000 tax credit for the purchase of an &quot;advanced technology&quot; vehicle, such as the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt, scheduled to begin production in 2010. He backs an unspecified federal investment in research and development of the technologies needed to support super-efficient vehicles. He also would set a rising fuel-efficiency target, one that would increase 4 percent per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To keep automotive jobs in the U.S. for this new generation of greener cars, Obama would provide $4 billion in tax credits, plus loan guarantees, for auto companies and parts suppliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain advocates a $5,000 tax credit for every purchaser of a zero-emissions car. A more unusual approach to stimulating industrial research is his pledge to award a $300 million prize to the first company to develop a battery suitable for an all-electric car or plug-in hybrid. To be eligible, the new battery would have to deliver power at 30 percent of the cost of current batteries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain says he would toughen the federal government's enforcement of Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is wrong with these people?&quot; was the nigh-upon-universal reaction among conservatives at the GOP convention last week. Liberal reporters inquired of conservative journalists, Republican delegates, right-leaning janitors, free-market short-order cooks, even the guys walking around in elephant suits: Will Sarah Palin drop out? What about the Eagleton Option?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For those who don't know, the Eagleton Option refers to Thomas Eagleton, George McGovern's first VP pick in 1972, who was forced to withdraw because allegations of mental illness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A hybrid of myth and deceit peddled by the chattering bandersnatches of the Democratic Party's backup communications offices at MSNBC and other press-release transmission belts of the Obama campaign, the whole pseudo-story was surely the brightest flare in the bonfire of asininity in St. Paul this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, it was hardly the only journalistic will-o'-the-wisp unleashed from the media bog. The claim that Palin was a Buchananite - and hence an acolyte of a &quot;Nazi sympathizer&quot; according to Florida Rep. Robert Wexler - was not true. The claims she cut funding for pregnant teens, that she was a member of the more-goofy-than-scary Alaska Independence Party, that Trig Palin - her special-needs baby - was really her daughter's: these were all bogus. As for the even more disgusting smears peddled at the Daily Kos and one blogger at The Atlantic - smears that drove much of the prurient investigation into the Palin family's privacy by more reputable sources - they were as untrue as they were repugnant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it was the Eagleton canard that spoke volumes. First, just as a matter of reportorial fact, as opposed to Keith Olbermann clicking his ruby-red slippers and wishing it were so, the idea that the rank and file of the GOP wanted her gone before her speech was distilled nonsense. Now, it's plain hilarious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the wake of Palin's performance Wednesday night, there's vastly more support among conservatives for flipping the McCain-Palin ticket to the Palin-McCain ticket. Send McCain to attend the funerals and cut the ribbons! Put the lipsticked pit bull at the lead of the Alaskanized GOP sled!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One good barometer of conservative support: Rush Limbaugh, who is rumored to kick his cat across the room in rage when he hears the name &quot;McCain,&quot; now calls the Arizona senator &quot;John McGenius.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For good or ill, going forward, Palin is easily the most popular Republican in the country, at least among people inclined to vote for the GOP. That may not last, of course (she has many trials ahead), but the instant decision of Beltway blowhards to push the Palin-as-liability fable says a lot about how little they understand much of the American electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One partial explanation for the feeding frenzy is the bowel-stewing fear among an Obamaphilic press corps that Palin might actually help McCain win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But another part of the answer is that the press was simply surprised. Cockroaches scatter when shocked by a flipped light switch. Grizzly bears attack when startled. And when caught napping by big news, the press corps floods the zone. Editors scream at underlings who missed the story. Networks fret they'll be scooped. And all of a sudden, the norms and standards become a blur in the race to be first. In the case of Palin, the press vaulted over every principle and standard they'd established about what is and isn't fair game, like O.J. Simpson leaping over luggage in the old Hertz commercials. It required the Jaws of Life to pry news of John Edwards' affair out the mainstream press. But when it came to the personal drama of Palin's 17-year old daughter, the press clawed for morsels like they were golden tickets from Wonka Bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They wouldn't have done the same thing if Palin were an unknown Democrat, because the press' reflex is to assume the worst of Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Eagleton Option exposed the press' gut instincts, and the viscera are not pretty. Eagleton dropped out because it was leaked that he'd received shock therapy for ill-defined mental problems. Many of those who expected Palin to withdraw see her values and her choices as proof of a mental problem. &quot;She's more a conservative man than she is a woman on women's issues,&quot; quoth a spokeswoman from the predictably shrill National Organization for Women, which always defines womanhood by a woman's commitment to left-wing feminist dogma. If you're pro-life, or even just a Republican, you're not a real woman, you're suffering from some sort of pernicious gender confusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How long before the Palin-haters insist she needs shock therapy, too? For her own good, of course.</SPAN></P>

Then I noticed a group along the roadway cleaning up the trash people senselessly throw out of their vehicle windows. These young people went above and beyond the call of duty. My hat is off to them all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another crew cleaned along the riverbank. They told me they were Bethel College freshmen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have lived in many places in the United States, but of all the places, this area is amazing: Habitat for Humanity, cleanups, coats for the needy, Pack-a-Backpack and other charitable programs. If you reside in this county and you have helped in anything, you are doing more than most would ever do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I often think of moving back toward Chicago, but I like it here that much!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recently stopped at the 1st Source Bank branch at Indiana 933 North and Cleveland Road to cash a check. As I was entering the bank, I noticed a mallard duck leading a newly-hatched brood of ducklings on bank property trying to cross Indiana 933 headed for the river. I knew her chances of making it were zero as traffic was terrible. Returning home, I called the St. Joseph County Humane Society, explained the situation and said I would appreciate them sending someone to retrieve the brood of ducklings. I returned to the bank to help in the rescue, only to find that Humane Society personnel had been there and left as they could not find the brood. Luckily, I was able to hail a passing South Bend policeman and, explaining the situation, asked him to call the Humane Society, which he did. Twenty minutes later, John Minier of the Humane Society arrived and together we captured all 12 ducklings, plus the mother, and delivered them safely to the river. My thanks to the Humane Society and the South Bend Police Department for their assistance in this matter. These two organizations are underappreciated. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Linda Pence, the Democratic candidate for Indiana attorney general, is exhibiting a troubling conflict of interest by accepting campaign cash from Indiana's largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood. The contributions specifically call into question what role  Attorney General Steve Carter's investigation into possible coverup of child sexual abuse by Planned Parenthood might have played in generating this type of abortion rights support for Pence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 2005, the attorney general's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit sought to verify that Planned Parenthood is properly reporting child sexual abuse by requesting the records of children younger than the age of 14 who indicated sexual activity. Instead of cooperating, Planned Parenthood of Indiana filed suit against the attorney general's office and eventually blocked access to these children's records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now Planned Parenthood is investing its political capital in Pence, a candidate who, if elected, may be compromised in her ability to uphold Indiana law because of her financial relationship with Planned Parenthood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pence's acceptance of campaign cash from Planned Parenthood, as well as money from the national abortion rights group Emily's List, places her candidacy in a shadow of suspicion and compromise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know there's a lot of stress in the world today, but is it so bad that our policemen are caught drunk, having more avoidable accidents and family fights? Then what comes out in the paper? A story that says, let's lower the drinking age. Come on, college presidents, do you think that 18-year-olds will handle drinking any better than some adults do? Maybe we should raise the drinking age. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impeach </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The late U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan, Democrat from Texas, speaking to the House Judiciary Committee in 1974, observed that Congress had been granted the power &quot;to remove the president in order to strike a delicate balance between a president swollen with power and grown tyrannical, and preservation of the independence of the executive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those words, &quot;a president swollen with power and grown tyrannical,&quot; are applicable today. George Bush has amassed near dictatorial power in the executive branch and in other ways violates and twists constitutional provisions which have guided American government for more than two centuries. Today, with impeachment off the table, our national government functions less well and is less cognizant of its citizens' constitutionally guaranteed liberties. Unfortunately, that is not likely to self-correct with a new administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to James Madison, attempting to subvert the Constitution makes a president impeachable. Scott Pontius suggests that congressional Democrats lack the courage to act (Aug. 25 Voice). He is obviously right, but Republicans in Congress are also sworn to defend the Constitution. Where have they been? Sadly, we have far too few in Washington today possessing courage and patriotism equal to those from both parties who put the brakes on President Nixon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I keep reading that the United States and other nations are putting pressure on Russia for giving &quot;formal recognition&quot; to the break away regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Isn't this a bit hypocritical since the United States set precedence by being the first country to recognize Kosovo as a breakaway region from Serbia? What is the difference in the two?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The media seems to forget that Georgia drew first blood by bombing South Ossetia and Russia responded to protect these people.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the United States has only 3 percent of the world's oil reserves. Given this fact, it is impossible to drill our way out of the high gasoline prices and foreign oil dependency. If oil is found not only will it be a small pittance relative to the annual U.S. usage, but, according to most experts, it will take from 10 to 12 years to get the gas pumps at a cost savings of 2 cents a gallon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How dumb to risk destroying our precious and fragile marine ecosystems and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which is one of the most important birthing grounds in the entire world, so we can pay 2 cents less for a gallon of gasoline 12 years from now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Global warming is the best reason of all to leave the oil in the ground. We don't need to be going after more of the same thing that's destroying the Earth. Many alternative energy sources are viable right now and the rest are close. Solar, wind, wave, tidal, geothermal, fuel cells, fourth generation nuclear (no waste), conservation and efficiency standards are the way to go, not more oil.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, he is inexperienced. It is true he has less experience than many other candidates, but he has more relevant experience than George Bush did in 2000. Yet, I don't recall ever hearing that complaint back then. Why is that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bush advisers with great experience brought us the war in Iraq, recession and record deficits. Let's get past the &quot;he is not experienced&quot; clich&eacute; and judge Obama by what he has done and what he proposes to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, it is often said &quot;I don't know where he stands.&quot; My reply is &quot;Where were you during the Indiana primary?&quot; I don't agree with all of Obama's positions, but he has clear policies regarding trade, Iraq, climate change, energy, the economy, abortion, health care, immigration and terrorism. Listen or read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you don't like his views, fine. But don't cop out by saying he doesn't have any. This only makes it seem that either you are not paying attention or that there is some other reason you don't wish to vote for Obama.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When cell phone users who have questions about Democratic Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign send queries to Carmel's ChaCha Search Inc., they get factual responses independently researched by one of the company's 33,000 human guides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also see paid Obama advertisements at the bottom of their answers. Those who click the ads are linked directly to his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were approached by the Obama campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They've got a big ad budget,&quot; said ChaCha President Brad Bostic. &quot;That particular campaign is targeted to that 18- to 25-year-old demographic. So the match was particularly good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this year's election cycle, the policy watchword is &quot;change.&quot; But amid the partisan debate, another type of change is revolutionizing the way candidates track voters and spread messages. Communication tools like text messaging, social networking and YouTube are increasingly integral to successful politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And smart Indiana businesses are capitalizing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama isn't ChaCha's only political client, Bostic said. Los Angeles-based Rock The Vote, a nonpartisan organization that aims to increase young voters' turnout at the polls, also hired ChaCha. Text an inquiry about polling locations or how to register and ChaCha will respond in cooperation with the not-for-profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all politicians have caught on, Bostic said. And efforts to innovate sometimes fizzle. But overall, early adopters enjoy enormous results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's almost like a massive virtual rally that never stops,&quot; he said. &quot;Like with anything new and cutting-edge, there's always a fair amount of experimentation that has to happen. You have to try a lot of things and think about what works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Engaging voters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political observers and technology gurus give Obama the highest marks for leveraging new ways of communicating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's Indiana spokesman, Jonathan Swain, said the campaign was able to organize last week's last-minute downtown rally and communicate its details to the faithful within hours thanks to the enormous database Obama built during this year's prolonged Democratic primary election. An official count isn't available, but most reports estimate the campaign's national database includes 3 million to 6 million e-mail addresses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From my perspective, this technology has really allowed our grass-roots organization to have a bigger reach,&quot; Swain said. &quot;Sustaining excitement is key to keeping people engaged and keeping urgency high.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tech-savvy candidates like Obama enjoy an unprecedented ability to send targeted messages. Swain noted that when the Obama campaign sends a text to addresses in its Indiana database, it regularly adds Indiana details to the broad economic plans he discusses on the national stage. His messages specify the 42,000 jobs he promises for Hoosiers and the Indiana infrastructure investments he'd prioritize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans also recognize the political power of new technologies. Scott Dorsey, CEO of locally based e-mail software firm ExactTarget, said Gov. Mitch Daniels has been a client since before his 2004 campaign. This year, ExactTarget's former vice president of corporate strategy, Kristen Brown, left to become eCampaign adviser to Sen. John McCain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorsey is a true believer in the power of information technology. These days, speeches and campaign commercials are instantly available on YouTube. And some candidates, like McCain and Obama, have built popular internal social networking sites in addition to having a presence on public platforms like MySpace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology's downside</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Dorsey said candidates are only beginning to understand that technology comes with risks. This summer, Obama orchestrated the announcement of his vice presidential running mate via mass text message. Joe Biden's name leaked out online first and rapidly reached traditional news outlets, disappointing the cell phone users who'd signed up specially for the revelation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest dangers, Dorsey said, are in overusing new technologies. It's all too easy to flood users with unwanted messages. That could happen if a candidate shared his or her database with another candidate from the same party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If somebody gives permission to receive messages about Obama, that doesn't mean they want all Democratic messages,&quot; Dorsey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, he said, modern IT can give officials unprecedented insight into voters' priorities_if it's used judiciously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Social networks are likely to live on after the campaigns. They're all about conversation and dialogue. This was an entry point,&quot; Dorsey said. &quot;It will be interesting to see it evolve over time. It's not so much about, 'Use these technologies to get elected then shut off the funnel of communication,' but instead, how to continue to further communication once elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two keys to political success online, said Chris Baggott, CEO of local startup Compendium Blogware: Establish your presence early and update it often. Search engines like Google calculate response rankings using algorithms that consider both a Web site's vintage and the frequency of its updates. Baggott has been counseling his political clients to set up blogs and post frequently, so their messages climb to the top of search results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otherwise, Baggott said, it's all too easy to be overwhelmed online. He noted the incident this spring, when Obama's remarks about guns and religion at a small San Francisco fund-raiser came back to haunt him in Appalachia, and nearly cost him the Democratic primary. The comments were captured and posted by a blogger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One guy with a cell phone changed the dynamic of an election,&quot; Baggott said. &quot;That's democracy, baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still knocking on doors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IUPUI political science professor Brian Vargus said politicians in Indiana below the gubernatorial level are using surprisingly little new technology. Basic Web sites are standard, he said, but local candidates still rely primarily on shoe leather. That'll change over the next four years, he predicted, now that the cat's out of the bag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Campaigns are not going to go back. They never do. They always go forward,&quot; Vargus said. &quot;By 2010, they'll all have it down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But professor Richard Edwards, who teaches media arts and sciences at Indiana University's School of Informatics, said there could be a backlash if McCain upsets Obama. If that happens, the conventional wisdom will be that tried-and-true tactics of conventional campaigns still trump modern IT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This election is going to be one the political scientists and new-media specialists will pore over,&quot; Edwards said. &quot;The question is whether or not these techniques are effective, or if this is the latest example of new-media hype.&quot;<BR>*</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Mitch Daniels isn't to blame for the devastating blow to Michiana's economy from three Monaco Coach plants closing in Elkhart County, with loss of 1,400 jobs and the negative ripple effect that will leave even more people jobless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Listening to criticism of Daniels by Democrats, you would think he is to blame. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Well, Mitch didn't raise gas prices across the country and bring about a downturn in the national economy. Those are the reasons why Monaco wasn't selling as many recreational vehicles and decided to close the Elkhart County facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But you can hardly blame Democrats such as Jill Long Thompson, Daniels' opponent, for using the plant closings to criticize the governor. After all, Daniels has ballyhooed every plant opening as though it was something for which he should receive credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Candidates for governor always claim they will do wonders for the Hoosier economy to create more jobs and greater wealth. Daniels claimed just that in running for governor in 2004. Long Thompson claims that now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The truth is that governors really don't have a lot of control over the economy in their states. Whether the nation's economy is robust or bust is the biggest factor. Individual states are affected a little more or a little less because of the sectors of the economy that are most important in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Daniels was able to brag about more jobs in Indiana when the nation's economy was good. His critics now point to job losses as the nation's economy has turned bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is not to say that governors can't do a thing to help their states' economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They can seek with promises of tax and infrastructure help to lure new industries or encourage expansion of existing facilities. The Democratic governors before Daniels did this. Daniels has done this. Long Thompson would do this. Some might do it a little better than others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No matter who was governor, however, it would be impossible now to convince General Motors to increase commercial Hummer production in Mishawaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indiana still depends heavily on the automotive industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's one reason why the Indiana's jobless rate went up so much in the most recent report - a report before any impact from the Monaco closings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The governor promises to do all that he can to help those left unemployed by Monaco. He will. Long Thompson, if she were governor, would do all that she could. What governor wouldn't?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We will hear a battle of statistics during the campaign for governor. Daniels will search out the positive in seeking to convince voters that he was effective in getting Indiana braced for the downturn. Long Thompson will draw attention to the negative in seeking to convince voters that Daniels didn't keep promises to improve the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Daniels now cites statistics showing Indiana's jobless rate is better than that in adjoining states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Long Thompson cites statistics showing that Indiana's jobless rate increase in June was the largest in the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Daniels talks of improvements in state rankings for favorable business climate, Long Thompson says Indiana has slipped in state rankings of gross domestic product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some jobs pay more than others. We will hear rival statistics about the value of jobs retained, gained or lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the candidates talk of plans for future economic growth, they should focus first on a terrible problem over which a governor will have a voice. That's the negative impact on cities and counties and the people from the flawed property tax legislation pushed by the governor and passed by the Indiana General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The gravity is shown by South Bend Mayor Steve Luecke's projection that loss of $18.2 million in annual revenue by 2010 will mean cutting 53 firefighters, 40 police officers and more than 100 other employees, with parks closing, popular programs curtailed and public safety endangered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other cities face similar woes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Indiana cities are forced to make cuts like that, what employer would want to locate in the state?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But that tax legislation didn't cause the recreation vehicle closings, the downturn in just about anything automotive related and the increasing unemployment in Indiana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blame decisions in Washington and Detroit more than any action or lack thereof in Indianapolis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State government didn't let the dollar weaken, the national deficit skyrocket, the dependence on oil grow and the housing crisis develop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mitch Daniels didn't mess up General Motors and Ford planning and marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the national economy booms under a President Obama or a President McCain, the governor of Indiana, whether Long Thompson or Daniels, will preside over a rebounding Indiana economy and take credit for it. Only fair. If you're blamed for the rain, take credit for the sunshine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON --  Barack Obama's mentor on international affairs is an Indiana Republican who supports John McCain for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sen. Richard G. Lugar urged Obama to seek membership on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee back in 2005, when Lugar was chairman of that prestigious committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then, when Obama became a member, Lugar let the freshman senator from Illinois travel with him to Russia to view the continued progress of the Nunn-Lugar program, the program that has rid the world of thousands of nuclear warheads in the former Soviet Union, weapons once aimed at the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mutual concern and respect led to passage of the Lugar-Obama nonproliferation initiative. Patterned after Nunn-Lugar, the initiative seeks to get rid of stockpiles of conventional weapons, such as shoulder-fired missiles that terrorists could use to down airplanes. It also enhances efforts to detect and interdict weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, it was not surprising that Obama, during his quest for the Democratic presidential nomination, cited his work with Lugar and ran TV commercials showing a photo of the two of them. Obama said Lugar is the type of Republican he would welcome in his Cabinet. And there even was some rather far-fetched speculation last week that Lugar could be on Obama's list of vice presidential running mates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What does Lugar say?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Well, he repeats what he said consistently before when mentioned as a possible secretary of state in Republican administrations: &quot;No.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It would not be a good idea for a president or for me,&quot; Lugar said as he discussed this latest speculation over lunch in the Senate Dining Room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We can do the best for the president and the country right where we are,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lugar, though no longer Foreign Relations Committee chairman, with Democrats controlling the Senate, still is the most respected Republican voice on foreign relations in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He welcomes that role, even when he has felt compelled to break with a president of his own party over policy in Iraq. He warned early that the Bush administration had inadequate planning for what to do after initial military victory in Iraq. Unfortunately, his warnings were ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lugar would be unable to issue any such public warnings if serving in a president's Cabinet as secretary of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If you are part of the administration, you are working for somebody else,&quot; he said. He would rather work for and at the pleasure of the voters of Indiana, who seem to admire his willingness to speak out on international affairs and to seek a bipartisan approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the Foreign Relations Committee, he seeks consensus, contending that the nation is in the strongest position when united on foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That was one of the reasons he telephoned Obama right after the Democrat was elected to the Senate and encouraged him to seek membership on the committee. He knew of Obama's interest in the Nunn-Lugar program and wanted to enlist the rising Democratic star in a bipartisan approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lugar praised Obama for willingness to learn of issues before the committee and participate in the work, including work on the initiative they co-sponsored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lest anyone draw the wrong conclusion, Lugar is a Republican and will support McCain, not Obama, for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I cast a vote for John McCain recently in the Indiana primary,&quot; Lugar said, &quot;And I will do the same in the fall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He praised McCain recently after the presumptive Republican presidential nominee distanced himself from the Bush administration by vowing to work more closely with Russia on nuclear disarmament and by calling for a reduction in tactical nuclear weapons in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, Lugar conferred with McCain before McCain made those comments. He then was prepared immediately to respond with agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was deliberate on his part,&quot; Lugar said of McCain's desire to strike out on a course differing from that of President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chances are that either a President McCain or a President Obama would show more interest in Lugar's views on foreign relations than ever was shown by President Bush, who preferred to believe Donald Rumsfeld instead on whether there was an adequate plan for what to do after troops reached Baghdad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Does Lugar think Obama has the experience needed to handle challenges of the presidency?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No. But he quickly added that McCain doesn't either, because &quot;nobody does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The challenges are so enormous, he said, that nobody can step into the office and readily find answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Iraq, he said, the next president, whether McCain or Obama, will face &quot;the same problem,&quot; how and when to withdraw troops, no matter whether they should or shouldn't have been sent there in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lugar didn't school Obama on international relations to help Obama to become president. But that schooling could help the country if Obama does reach the White House.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON --  Barack Obama's mentor on international affairs is an Indiana Republican who supports John McCain for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sen. Richard G. Lugar urged Obama to seek membership on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee back in 2005, when Lugar was chairman of that prestigious committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then, when Obama became a member, Lugar let the freshman senator from Illinois travel with him to Russia to view the continued progress of the Nunn-Lugar program, the program that has rid the world of thousands of nuclear warheads in the former Soviet Union, weapons once aimed at the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mutual concern and respect led to passage of the Lugar-Obama nonproliferation initiative. Patterned after Nunn-Lugar, the initiative seeks to get rid of stockpiles of conventional weapons, such as shoulder-fired missiles that terrorists could use to down airplanes. It also enhances efforts to detect and interdict weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, it was not surprising that Obama, during his quest for the Democratic presidential nomination, cited his work with Lugar and ran TV commercials showing a photo of the two of them. Obama said Lugar is the type of Republican he would welcome in his Cabinet. And there even was some rather far-fetched speculation last week that Lugar could be on Obama's list of vice presidential running mates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What does Lugar say?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Well, he repeats what he said consistently before when mentioned as a possible secretary of state in Republican administrations: &quot;No.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It would not be a good idea for a president or for me,&quot; Lugar said as he discussed this latest speculation over lunch in the Senate Dining Room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We can do the best for the president and the country right where we are,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lugar, though no longer Foreign Relations Committee chairman, with Democrats controlling the Senate, still is the most respected Republican voice on foreign relations in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He welcomes that role, even when he has felt compelled to break with a president of his own party over policy in Iraq.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain's selection of a running mate should be done out of the public eye, former Sen. Bob Dole told The Tribune on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a brief phone interview, the three-time Republican presidential candidate who represented Kansas in the Senate from 1969 to 1996 said McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., are both in good shape heading toward November's election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;McCain is in a pretty good spot, and Obama, right now he's a hot ticket and should be,&quot; Dole said. &quot;It's a historic event. But will it last?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;McCain right now has to find a strong vice presidential candidate in what, at this point anyway, is &quot;not a particularly good year for Republicans,&quot; Dole said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whomever McCain picks has to be younger, Dole said, but he doesn't have any suggestions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are a hundred names, and I know McCain's put together a little group,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the selection should happen out of the public eye, Dole said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It ought to be quiet, dignified,&quot; he said. &quot;It's kind of disappointing to put somebody out in public, and they don't get it. It's a little embarrassing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dole, who survived prostate cancer diagnosed in 1991, will talk about that experience Sunday at Sauder Hall Performing Arts Center at Goshen College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's part of the Goshen Center for Cancer Care's True Celebration program, which honors those facing a battle with cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 2 p.m. event is free and open to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dole is replacing former White House press secretary and Fox News anchor Tony Snow, who had to cancel because of an illness. Snow has been fighting cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was President Nixon who said he wanted to conquer cancer in how many years?&quot; Dole said. &quot;And that was a long time ago. You just have to be optimistic. In the meantime, we have these great centers, like they have in Goshen, that save a lot of lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since leaving the campaign trail, Dole has become well known for television commercials, including as a spokesman for the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He's also written a memoir, titled &quot;One Soldier's Story,&quot; and a couple of books on presidential wit, one of which is subtitled &quot;I Wish I Was in the Book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dole, who spoofed himself on Saturday Night Live just a couple weeks after losing the 1996 presidential election, said he should have used more humor on the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You can't take everything too seriously,&quot; he said. &quot;People want reassurance. They want someone up there talking to them who's real, who cries and laughs and smiles and talks just like they do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As for Obama's and McCain's comedic skill:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I haven't heard anything that's remarkable as far as humor,&quot; he said. &quot;But they'll get some writers now, and they'll start putting in a few lines. You've got to be pretty careful with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
